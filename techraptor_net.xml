            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ninja Theory has announced that its narrative-led action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II&nbsp;</em>will be making its way to the PlayStation 5 sometime this summer.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/NinjaTheory/status/1925174749317185829" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on X, Ninja Theory celebrates the one-year anniversary of the game's release by freeing it of its Xbox exclusivity (on console, at least). We don't have a release date for the game yet; the studio simply says it's coming in "summer".</p>

<p>Alongside the PS5 version, Ninja Theory also says that&nbsp;<em>Hellblade II&nbsp;</em>will be getting some extra features, and that these features will also be coming to the Xbox and PC versions of the game, presumably when the PS5 version launches.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II</em>, it's the sequel to 2017's&nbsp;<em>Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice</em>, and it picks up the story of the titular character as she travels to Iceland in order to save her people from slavery.</p>

<p>Like the first game, <i>Hellblade II&nbsp;</i>is a linear journey that marries action-adventure gameplay and combat, exploration, and psychological horror elements. The titular character, Senua, suffers from psychosis, a condition that manifests itself in the form of voices that both guide and hinder her.</p>




<p>Ninja Theory's game is just one of several Xbox titles to come to PS5 in the last year or two. Others include the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em></a>, Obsidian adventures&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-thieves-grounded-and-pentiment-officially-announced-for-playstation-platforms" rel="nofollow"><em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Pentiment</em></a>, and open-world racer&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5</em>.</p>

<p>Additionally, the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Gears of War&nbsp;</em>remaster&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gears-of-war-reloaded-announced" rel="nofollow">Gears of War: Reloaded</a>&nbsp;</em>will bring the influential third-person shooter franchise to PlayStation for the first time when it launches later this year.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/senuas-saga-hellblade-II" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2461850/Senuas_Saga_Hellblade_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Finally Back on iOS App Store After Protracted Epic-Apple Spat]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-app-store-returns</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-finally-back-on-ios-app-store-after-protracted-epic-apple-spat.1194966/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-app-store-returns<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has announced that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is finally available on the iOS App Store once again, following a protracted legal battle between itself and Apple over third-party payment systems and storefronts.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1924949632628523199" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Epic confirms that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>has been re-added to the App Store on both iPhones and iPads in the US, while in Europe, it's available as part of the mobile version of the Epic Games Store.</p>

<p>Just last week, Epic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-offline-worldwide-ios-apple-block" rel="nofollow">complained that Apple was blocking the release</a> of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on the App Store, leading to a worldwide outage of the game on the platform until the issue was resolved (which, thankfully, now looks to be the case).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-ios-restored-shooting.jpg?itok=6sJ6H9Ei 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-ios-restored-shooting.jpg?itok=XPMkebt9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Apple has restored&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on the iOS App Store in the US and the mobile Epic Games Store in Europe.</figcaption></figure><p>Epic's battle against Apple began back in 2020, when the former hosted a sale on in-game currency that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-slashes-up-to-20-off-purchases-on-all-platforms" rel="nofollow">slashed up to 20% off prices</a> if customers used Epic's own proprietary payment system rather than Apple's.</p>

<p>Apple swiftly retaliated by removing&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>from the App Store, prompting Epic to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-apple-store-version-removed-for-violating-app-store-guidelines" rel="nofollow">file a lawsuit in response</a>. It wasn't just Apple whose wrath Epic incurred, either; the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-sues-google-over-fortnites-removal-from-play-store" rel="nofollow">also sued Google</a> after the game was removed from the Play Store for the same reason.</p>

<p>What followed was a protracted battle between the two companies, one that saw Apple <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apple-rejects-epic-request-to-relist-fortnite-in-korea" rel="nofollow">blocking numerous attempts</a> on Epic's part to get&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apple-rejects-move-to-restore-fortnite-ios-on-app-store" rel="nofollow">relisted on the iOS App Store</a> in various territories.</p>

<p>In April this year, Apple was forced to pay a €500m fine by the European Commission due to its refusal to allow developers to direct customers towards alternative third-party payment systems, which Epic will no doubt have seen as a huge win.</p>




<p>As for what's going on within&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>itself, the game is currently in the middle of its&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-star-wars-crossover-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars</em>-themed Galactic Battle season</a>, which has introduced character skins like Darth Jar Jar and Emperor Palpatine to the game.</p>

<p>Rather embarrassingly, however, Epic had to issue an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-swearing-darth-vader-ai-fixed" rel="nofollow">emergency hotfix last week</a> thanks to an AI-powered Darth Vader that was openly swearing at players. Needless to say, he won't do that anymore. I, for one, am disappointed.</p>
