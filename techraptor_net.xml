After several years of a strategic investment in the studio, the publisher recently made a move to purchase the remaining stock of the company, gaining complete control over the party game brand.</p><h2>Asmodee's Complete Control of Exploding Kittens</h2><p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/board-games/asmodee-exploding-kittens-buyout" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Wargamer</a>, Asmodee exercised a call option to purchase the 45% minority stake in <em>Exploding Kittens</em>. Since the publisher already owned a 55% stake in the company back in 2021, this would bring 100% ownership of the company under Asmodee. This was a previously communicated intention by Asmodee.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Asmodee states that the purchase price of the remaining stake will be determined based on the operational performance of Exploding Kittens Inc. for the full year January-December 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>Asmodee's control of <em>Exploding Kittens</em> is a decision that won't adversely affect the studio's output. Both companies have been working closely since 2016, when Asmodee began distributing the studio's games in Europe. In addition, Asmodee's strategic purchases of tabletop developers has been a consistent business practice by the tabletop giant.</p><p><em>Exploding Kittens</em> has undeniable clout when it comes to party games. The titular party game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/interview-shane-small-exploding-kittens" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">insanely popular</a> on release, spawning an animated Netflix show and countless <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/exploding-kittens-good-vs-evil-card-game-announced" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">spin-offs</a>. It even led to the developer creating other popular party games like <em>Throw Throw Burrito </em>and <em>Hand-to-Hand Wombat</em>.</p><p>Admittedly, the studio has also been known for weird marketing stunts and unusual controversy. They had to do a safety recall on several goggles included in copies of <em>Throw Throw Burrito</em> for being <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/exploding-kittens-goggles-might-explode-on-you-product-recall-issued" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">explosive hazards</a>. Then, back during the hype cycle around NFTs, the studio decided to partner with a 3D printing company for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/exploding-kittens-to-produce-limited-run-printable-nfts" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">"physical NFTs."&nbsp;</a></p><p>As for how Asmodee will guide <em>Exploding Kittens</em>, both as a creative studio and as a brand, that is something only time will tell.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has released a brand new update for <em>Patapon 1+2 Replay</em>, and if you like to challenge yourself, then this one's for you.</p><p>As announced on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2383200/view/492711745752663122" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Steam</a>, the Boss Rush Challenge mode will see you taking on bosses from across both <em>Patapon </em>games included in the collection, and you'll have to clear the main scenario for each title if you want to try out its Boss Rush feature.</p><p>The number of bosses, as well as the strength of the bosses that appear, will vary from stage to stage, and your army's health and status will be retained throughout each stage, although a set amount of HP will be recovered from battle to battle.</p><figure role="group">

<p>When you clear Boss Rush stages, you'll return to how things were before you began, so you don't need to worry about any permanent changes; it's very much an additional mode that runs alongside your main adventures.</p><p>As announced on Bandai Namco's <a href="https://x.com/BandaiNamcoUS/status/2003133429727088664" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">official X account</a>, original <em>Patapon </em>designer Rolito is back on board, having provided new artwork specifically for the Boss Rush mode, so if you're a fan of the <em>Patapon </em>art style (and who isn't?), then you'll get a special kick out of this one too.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>Patapon 1+2 Replay</em>, it is, as the name suggests, a collection that includes remastered versions of the first two <em>Patapon </em>games, which were originally released on Sony's excellent PSP handheld.</p><p>The games are a sort of combination of rhythm-action and RPG in which you need to hit buttons in time with the (brilliant) music in order to advance your army and defeat a series of enemies. You can check out the Boss Rush update trailer, which shows off <em>Patapon</em>'s gorgeous art style, right here.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, the <em>Patapon </em>revival doesn't stop with this collection, either; a spiritual successor, <em>Ratatan</em>, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ratatan-early-access-release-date-september" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3f2e2199-a7b4-4859-8f58-46cef0a83ab5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">released this year</a>, and it's getting a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ratatan-update-christmas-day" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6860479b-517c-4243-b770-0b22c034f105" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">massive update on Christmas Day</a> as well, so you might want to check that out if you want more rhythm-action goodness.</p><p>You can check out <em>Patapon 1+2 Replay </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2383200/PATAPON_12_REPLAY/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/patapon-1-2-replay/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/patapon-1-plus-2-replay-switch/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a>.
