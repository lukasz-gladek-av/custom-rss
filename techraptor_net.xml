            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/knightling-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive and developer Twirlbound have announced the release date for 3D action-adventure platformer&nbsp;<em>The Knightling</em>, and it's gracing PC and current-gen consoles (as well as the Switch) this summer.</p>

<p><em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>was originally unveiled <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/knightling-saber-interactive-2025" rel="nofollow">back in August last year</a>, which feels pretty appropriate given that the game's official release date is August 28th.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>The Knightling</em>, you'll play as the titular hero as he attempts to follow in the footsteps of his missing mentor Sir Lionstone, the legendary guardian of the land of Clesseia. The Knightling must discover what's happened to Sir Lionstone and save him from whoever has taken him prisoner.</p>

To that end, you'll also be unlocking "the extraordinary powers of Sir Lionstone's mighty shield".</p>

<p>You will, of course, be playing as Sir Lionstone's apprentice, but I'm betting that by the time this one is over, you'll have discovered that even young knightlings can exhibit great courage. That's just a guess, mind.</p>

<p><em>The Knightling</em>'s combat will give you the chance not only to press the attack against your enemies, but also to block and parry attacks in order to create your own openings, finishing the fight with "huge attacks and combos".</p>

<p>The shield isn't just a combat weapon, though; you'll also be using it to solve various puzzles, platform your way across the world, and unlock secrets in order to earn new upgrades.</p>




<p>If you'd like to check out&nbsp;<em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>before you commit to picking it up in August, then there's a free demo for you to try out right now on Steam. Hey, what have you got to lose, eh?</p>

<p><em>The Knightling&nbsp;</em>comes to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1471650/The_Knightling/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10004254/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-knightling/9nd5r4j0g5lv" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch on August 28th.</p>
