            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/secret-agent-wizard-boy-and-international-crime-syndicate-preview-harry-potter-on<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Don't you love it when a game title is straight and to the point? Take, for example, <em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy and the International Crime Syndicate</em>, a game about you playing as a secret agent wizard boy trying to take down a crime syndicate. Who would have guessed?</p>

<p><em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy</em> is a goofy, outrageous, and hilariously jank simulation/adventure Early Access game that takes place within totally not-Hogwarts. Co-developed by the Szymanski brothers (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/my-friendly-neighborhood-review-c-is-for-creepy" rel="nofollow">John and Evan</a>) and published by the third, <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/david-szymanski" rel="nofollow">David</a> of <em>Dusk</em> fame, you can expect a zany and unconventional game from these fellas.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-chaos.jpg?itok=UlbKvPCF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-chaos.jpg?itok=t2S0Nc6Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Go on, create chaos!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy and the&nbsp;International Crime Syndicate </em>Brings Out the Child in Us</h2>

<p><em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy</em> is quite literally a sandbox. It's like a parent, dropping their kid in the box and telling them to "do stuff." In similar fashion, this game drops players smack dab in the middle of the school courtyard, and it's your job to figure things out from there.</p>

<p>Sure, there is an objective, and that is to investigate a mysterious door, but that's about it. The most important thing to note here is that <em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy </em>is very much an Early Access game. It takes roughly three or so hours to see everything it has to offer, and your one objective can be completed quite quickly.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-and-the-international-crime-syndicate-spell-puzzle.jpg?itok=6pOH-qOi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-and-the-international-crime-syndicate-spell-puzzle.jpg?itok=XrZU96ZL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hopefully we see more puzzles or secrets involving the use of your spells.</figcaption></figure><p>I was able to get access to this door and open it pretty fast, thereby "completing" all Early Access has to offer, and that's honestly fine- the main source of fun in <em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy</em> stems from its ridiculousness. It's a game that can be broken by the player with the flick of a hand, and it's intentionally and cleverly designed to be this way.</p>

<p>Physics are absolutely overturned, and you'll probably come across several ways to die without feeling like you did anything wrong. You just have to accept that <em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy</em> doesn't take itself seriously, and that's the key to letting loose and having fun.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-castle.jpg?itok=NIiPfmeS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-castle.jpg?itok=R1D9HyNf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The game goes for a lower poly style, and it looks wonderful and captures the atmosphere of a wizard school well!</figcaption></figure><h2>Exploring Not-Hogwarts in <em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy and the&nbsp;International Crime Syndicate </em></h2>

<p>The castle itself is inhabited by students, some of whom have their own quirky lines of dialogue. There are various objects to interact with, a plethora of rooms and areas to explore in the castle, and even new spells to discover.</p>

<p>Here's what I love about <em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy</em>: You can just be exploring the castle, and oh look, there's a small missile sitting in the teacher's office. It looked like a toy, so why <em>wouldn't</em> you throw it? And next thing you know, you explode, and your corpse just ragdolls all over the place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-dead.jpg?itok=5ZsRPWxo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-dead.jpg?itok=NSsX6CP0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I probably shouldn't have stood on the obvious black button.</figcaption></figure><p>That's really the tip of the iceberg, though. There are various deathtraps waiting for you throughout this castle if you're the curious sort, as well as various secrets that make exploration enjoyable. Even though the game isn't all that serious, it captures the vibe of exploring a Hogwarts-like castle pretty damn well, actually.</p>

<p>After all, in the books and movies, Harry Potter and his friends would explore Hogwarts and get into all sorts of trouble. Hidden rooms, deathtraps, and making mischief? That's the <em>Harry Potter</em> books to a tee, and that's what you'll get here, too.</p>

<p>The castle itself isn't that big, yet. It'll get fleshed out during Early Access, as I understand it, so I'm very much looking forward to seeing new areas. There are courtyards, dungeons, a big ol' tower filled with explosives for some reason, and even student common rooms in its current state.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-and-the-international-crime-syndicate-secret-2.jpg?itok=_opVd-H7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/secret-agent-wizard-boy-and-the-international-crime-syndicate-secret-2.jpg?itok=j1lOTq6L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Oho, a secret passage!</figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of student common rooms, this reminds me of one funny moment. One area in the basement of the castle, clearly meant to be the "Slytherin" common area, has a student that blocks players off if they aren't wearing a green hat. I didn't have a green hat, nor did I know where to find one. What I did know is this: I can kill.</p>

<p>My sociopathic little wizard boy went to the potions classroom across the basement and concocted an exploding potion. From there, I grabbed it and threw it at the gate operator. Well, he died, of course. I went into his little booth through a vent and stole his hat, and the other green hats accepted me as their own. Genius, I tell you!</p>

<p>As I had previously mentioned, <em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy</em> has unlockable spells. You'll find spellbooks hidden throughout the castle, and those are how you learn new spells to use. Most of them feel useless at first, but we have to remember that this game is all about having fun and messing around.</p>

<p>So, I learned spells that could set things on fire, make things larger, or even allow me to swap bodies with another person. I learned that you can just swap bodies with a&nbsp;whole suit of armor and play as that. It didn't really give the player any benefit, but it's hilarious nonetheless.</p>

<p>The spell to enlarge things, called Biggify, is probably my favorite. You can make tons of objects gargantuan if you keep casting on it. I cast it on a student and made him become a behemoth and switched bodies with him, just because I could. I was so big, I couldn't leave the room I was in. Fantastic stuff.</p>

<p>If everything I've said so far sounds appealing to you, I've done my job. For a game that is as purposefully jank as it is, <em>Secret Agent Wizard Boy and the International Crime Syndicate</em> contains a good few hours of fun. It definitely needs to be fleshed out more, and that'll come in due time. For now, I'm just happy to find out how I can break this game in different ways.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/wanderstop-review-more-than-managing-tea<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Wanderstop</em> is the first title from Ivy Road, a studio formed by industry vets in 2021. Trailers showcased the title as a tea shop manager, but it’s so much more, and less, than that. Presenting a complex story and taking care of customers’ tea orders is only the tip of the iceberg.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Serving Up Tea in <em>Wanderstop</em></h2>

<p>You play as Alta, a fighter known for being the best. After having her win streak of three years broken, she enters the woods to find the one person who can train her back to perfection. Weakened from consistent running, you pass out and awaken in a clearing.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wanderstop-boro-dialogue.jpg?itok=snXRUB4e 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wanderstop-boro-dialogue.jpg?itok=45d_NI06 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This is where the 10-15 hours of gameplay begins. You start by exploring the clearing and the tea shop known as Wanderstop. Managed by Boro, you’re stuck helping him make tea until you’re able to lift your sword and leave the woods. I found that having your own cup to savor at this moment can really heighten the experience. I chose a nice herbal blend to sip while serving my first customers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The tea making process involves multiple steps, but once you have it down, it’s fairly easy. You grow specific fruits to gather, collect and dry tea leaves, then brew the drink inside the shop. All ingredients needed are found in the clearing, and there are no time limits on how long someone will wait for their beverage. If you make it incorrectly, they’ll even let you try again with no penalty to their dialogue.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wanderstop-ren-tea-order.jpg?itok=uCUfjaJt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wanderstop-ren-tea-order.jpg?itok=WkvQtENr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>My biggest issue with <em>Wanderstop</em> is the missing challenge. Aside from a handful of specific client asks, most of the tea making you do is extremely straightforward. From growing the plants, finding the correct ingredients, and making the tea, it’s quite lacking in variety.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most challenging part is playing the title with a mouse and keyboard, then trying to quickly select one of the items from your inventory. It’s not super difficult, but getting what item you want and where you want it can take some finesse. A controller is far superior when it comes to inventory scrolling and using the shears.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wanderstop-large-hybrid.jpg?itok=K6Ks9HPi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wanderstop-large-hybrid.jpg?itok=ibKsNxy_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While tea creation may have been the premise that drew people in, it’s not the main focus of the title. What <em>Wanderstop</em> lacks in management complexity, it gains in narrative focus. The story is the highlight of the title, evoking emotions I wasn't prepared to experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Without delving too much into the story and ruining all the surprises, you go through Alta’s history and attempt to discover how to fix her current situation. It does pull at the heartstrings and could make you ponder your own views as you work through the different stages of the game. The characters are endearing, many of them with distinct personalities and conversational mannerisms.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wanderstop-extradimensional-character.jpg?itok=BhK_0iWr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wanderstop-extradimensional-character.jpg?itok=jBpKkxmX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As you progress, you’re confronted with moments that alter what the clearing looks like. These changes bring new color schemes, new plants, and new customers. It also ends prior interactions with customers, cutting some side stories preemptively. This is irksome, but you do get chances to learn more about those characters as the game progresses.</p>

<h2><em>Wanderstop </em>Review <em>|&nbsp;</em>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Wanderstop</em> is less a tea shop management game and more a visual novel guiding players through a difficult, emotional narrative. It can be a tear-jerking experience, especially towards the end of the game. However, once played, I doubt I’ll personally dive back into the world now that I know the full story. It’s perfect for those wanting less of a commitment, with short windows of game time, or who need breaks between storytelling moments.&nbsp;<br>
