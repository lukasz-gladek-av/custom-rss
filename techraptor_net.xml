            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which confirms that Ubisoft has laid off yet more employees, and this time, the layoffs are concentrated at the studio's Toronto division.</p><p>The publisher confirmed the layoffs in a statement to news platform <a href="https://mobilesyrup.com/2026/02/19/ubisoft-toronto-layoffs-splinter-cell-remake-development/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">MobileSyrup</a>, telling the site that 40 employees at the Toronto location are being laid off. Ubisoft says it hasn't made this decision lightly and that it will support staff with "comprehensive severance packages and robust career placement assistance".</p><p>Ubisoft Toronto is currently working on a <em>Splinter Cell </em>remake, which was <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4adJLuhgYrPboHAPRfK7Oz/splinter-cell-remake-begins-development-at-ubisoft-toronto" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">announced</a> all the way back in 2021. Since then, we haven't heard much from the project, but Ubisoft tells MobileSyrup that Toronto is still working on that game, so it hasn't been canceled at time of writing, at least.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Of course, there's good reason to doubt what Ubisoft is saying will remain true given recent developments. In January, the publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="91d63675-e1f4-4624-a716-79db888eb3c6" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">canceled its long-in-development <em>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time </em>remake</a> as part of an ongoing restructuring effort.</p><p>That effort has also seen sweeping layoffs across various Ubisoft outfits, including the company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-layoffs-massive-stockholm" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4b995302-57da-4b38-b244-d5e338eabf5f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Stockholm location and <em>The Division </em>developer Massive Entertainment</a>, as well as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-paris-voluntary-redundancies" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="46d73c0f-a3ab-4fb0-8104-90ea24dd2897" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Paris head office</a>.</p><p>Some Ubisoft wings have even been shut down outright; the Halifax branch of Ubisoft was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-halifax-shutdown" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5c381dd9-8d80-4d19-ac2f-5c64bbb6ef55" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">closed down in early January</a>, just weeks after workers from said branch formed the first ever North American Ubisoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-halifax-union" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="22333ad9-7422-4ae5-b9c7-e8c3a1c689d3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">union</a>.</p><p>All of this, of course, follows a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="acd9f3a1-9a63-4e42-9b91-122a243964e9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">major shakeup in operations</a> for Ubisoft, with the company reorganizing itself into Creative Houses designed to shepherd different franchises, including big hitters like <em>Assassin's Creed </em>and <em>Far Cry</em>.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Given the cancellation of the <em>Sands of Time </em>remake, it remains to be seen whether Ubisoft Toronto's work on <em>Splinter Cell </em>will result in anything concrete, but for now, at least, the project remains in development. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
