            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Forza Horizon 6</em>'s release date appears to have been leaked, but it wasn't a well-known insider source that revealed the information; instead, it appears to have been Xbox's very own <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://xboxera.com/2026/01/14/forza-horizon-6-release-date-leaks-in-fh5/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">XboxEra</a>, a social media message by <a href="https://x.com/XBOXF10/status/2011429719800180925" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Infinite</a> shows a screenshot of a window in <em>Forza Horizon 5 </em>inviting players to pre-order the upcoming <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>'s Premium Edition. Doing so nets you a number of goodies, including extra cars and access to two "premium expansions".</p><p>Perhaps more interestingly for our purposes, however, a pre-order also advertises the possibility of playing <em>Forza Horizon 6 </em>"four days early starting May 15th", which would seem to point to an official release date of May 19th.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Whoopsy-daisy, eh, <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As a reminder, <em>Forza Horizon 6 </em>was officially unveiled by Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-horizon-6-revealed-ps5" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7ede297d-3bdf-4de5-b00a-3479b4a33aab" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">during the Tokyo Game Show last year</a>. It'll be coming to PS5, just like its predecessor, although that release will be happening later than the game's PC and Xbox Series X|S arrival.</p><p>We don't know a great deal about <em>Forza Horizon 6 </em>yet, although we do know the game will be taking place in Japan, and that it'll feature a number of real-world locations, including Tokyo, Hokkaido, and the imposing Mt. Fuji.</p><p>We also know that <em>Forza Horizon 6 </em>is one of the reasons that Turn 10 Studios decided to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-motorsport-updates-ending" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="28526b82-2c26-415e-b595-273f31c08d2e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">can further content updates</a> for the more hardcore <em>Forza Motorsport</em>, since the studio is assisting Playground Games with development on the simcade racer.</p><p>It's likely the release date for <em>Forza Horizon 6 </em>will be revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-january-22nd-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2c8e5f78-4ad9-43f4-bd6b-54b81360f376" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">next week's Xbox Developer Direct</a>, where we'll also get more information about the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fable-reboot-delayed-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="48a951d3-c822-4051-88a7-e27a8ee10808" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">long-delayed <em>Fable </em>reboot</a> and Game Freak's <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em>.</p>
<p>Assuming this info is correct, then <em>Forza Horizon 6 </em>will be launching on May 19th on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2483190/Forza_Horizon_6/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/forza-horizon-6" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, with a PS5 launch to follow later in 2026.

<figcaption>Bobby Kotick seems to be pointing the finger at Embracer Group and Emma Ihre over a lawsuit.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Kotick's reasoning regarding Embracer's desire to hurt Activision involves the two companies releasing what he considers to be similar games at similar times, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-island-2-release-date-moved-to-april" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d3ec9c2d-facf-442a-974a-8f5fa5d1240e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Dead Island 2</em></a>, <em>Insurgency</em>, and <em>Remnant 2 </em>(which Kotick says have similarities to <em>Call of Duty </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-blizzard-deep-dive-breaks-down-diablo-iv-release-date-trailer" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8a9c064f-770c-42b5-a1a7-d8ea93c11706" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Diablo IV</em></a>, respectively).</p><p>The lawsuit in question was brought against Kotick and his former companies in 2022 by AP7. It alleges that Kotick rushed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-buys-activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-staying-as-ceo" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ca03cb11-0e22-42e4-bb57-2d2f082d977b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">sale of Activision Blizzard to Microsoft</a> in 2021 in order to dodge the consequences of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-employee-speaks-out-about-sexual-harassment" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="377898d2-bd83-41f5-9293-7f03ef9de06f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">numerous</a> sexual harassment <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-blizzard-employees-walk-out-after-new-explosive-allegations" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="37853141-4a88-4074-b619-4cc60e7ad075" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">allegations</a>.</p><p>Indeed, Kotick goes one step further and suggests that the "narrative" of those allegations was "false", and that AP7 was aided in its lawsuit by "activists" who "brought false and wholly unsubstantiated claims against Activision and Mr. Kotick".</p><p>Embracer, for its own part, was quick to respond to The Game File and Totilo. The company told Totilo that it was "humbled" by Kotick's claims, but that it "did not and [does] not need any help from a Swedish pension fund in competing with Activision". Claws out, eh?</p><figure role="group">

<p>It's not just <em>It Takes Two </em>that's doing well, though. In the aforementioned interview, Fares also confirms that <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/way-out" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e2cb188e-f0aa-4666-85ea-d14e29df56e5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>A Way Out</em></a>, which was Hazelight's first foray into co-op-exclusive adventuring, has sold "over 12 million" copies as well.</p><p>Of course, <em>Split Fiction</em>, the studio's latest title, is "doing very well as well", according to Fares. At last count, <em>Split Fiction </em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-4m-battlefield-skate" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="780fa581-f417-4e89-86d1-414cbf5909f8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">sold four million copies</a>, and since that figure is from May last year, it's likely to be much further ahead than that by now.</p><p><em>Split Fiction</em>'s success is such that a movie version is in the works, with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="249fa328-8f25-4975-b468-c4dc37526434" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">bidding war reportedly taking place</a> over the rights to said movie.
