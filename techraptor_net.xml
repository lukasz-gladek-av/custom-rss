            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Black Tabby Games has revealed that its surreal horror visual novel <em>Slay the Princess </em>has reached a new sales milestone, and the studio has divulged sales figures for <em>Scarlet Hollow </em>as well.</p><p>Per a new press release, <em>Slay the Princess </em>has managed to reach a million sales across all platforms. As a reminder, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slay-princess-is-new-time-loop-rpg-with-gorgeous-art" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="24809200-53e9-4bd9-816c-f6276e727e7a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">launched on PC first back in October 2023</a> before getting itself a console release in 2024.</p><p>Black Tabby's Tony Howard-Arias says the studio, which consists of Tony and their partner Abby, is "immeasurably grateful" for the reception <em>Slay the Princess </em>has garnered, and they express hope that the game's success means people will realize "visual novels are a serious medium".</p><figure role="group">

<p>It's not just <em>Slay the Princess </em>that is celebrating a new sales milestone. Black Tabby's first game, <em>Scarlet Hollow</em>, has managed to hit 100,000 sales since the release of its first episode back in June 2021.</p><p>The two games are very different prospects, of course; <em>Slay the Princess </em>is a self-contained experience with an absurd amount of branching and reaction to player choice, while <em>Scarlet Hollow </em>is...well, it's also that, but it's episodic, so the whole game hasn't yet seen the light of day.</p><p>Black Tabby is working to rectify that, however. <em>Scarlet Hollow</em>'s fifth episode is due to arrive on February 13th (that's next Friday at time of writing), and per a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1609230/view/499470950023038028" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">progress update</a> on Steam, the episode currently "contains roughly 300,000 words", although much of that will be confined to branching paths.</p>
<p>If you haven't checked <em>Slay the Princess </em>out yet, it's a visual novel that combines distinctive pencil sketch-like art with a recursive narrative about, well, slaying a princess.</p><p>I don't want to spoil the game's many surprises, but suffice it to say there's more going on under the surface than that, so if you haven't yet, you can check it out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1989270/Slay_the_Princess__The_Pristine_Cut/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/slay-the-princess---the-pristine-cut/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/slay-the-princess-the-pristine-cut/9PG84GGVTSQV" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/slay-the-princess-the-pristine-cut-switch/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Switch</a>. Right now, <em>Scarlet Hollow </em>is only available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1609230/Scarlet_Hollow/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
