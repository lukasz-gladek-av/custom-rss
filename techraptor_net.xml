            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-2d-no-fate-sidescroller-september<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Reef Entertainment and developer Bitmap Bureau have announced&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em>, a gritty sidescroller in which you must put a stop to the T-1000 and foil Skynet's plans before the human race is destroyed.</p>

<p>The game will allow you to play as either Sarah Connor or Arnold Schwarzenegger's T-800 as you fight to stop the shapeshifting android, memorably played by Robert Patrick in&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</em> (and in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-t-1000-dlc-release-date" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>DLC</a>).</p>

<p><em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em>'s story will blend "iconic scenes" from the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2&nbsp;</em>with "original scenarios and multiple endings", which sounds like a rather unique mixture.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/terminator-2d-no-fate-truck-chase.jpg?itok=QITciBWm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/terminator-2d-no-fate-truck-chase.jpg?itok=nA9hX4xL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Several iconic&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2&nbsp;</em>scenes are recreated in&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2D: No Fate</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In the trailer, we can see&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2&nbsp;</em>scenes like Sarah Connor working out in her hospital room, Arnie's T-800 duking it out with thugs in a dingy bar, and, of course, that iconic truck chase sequence.</p>

<p>We also see how the gameplay will work, and it looks like&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2D: No Fate&nbsp;</em>will take on a sort of&nbsp;<em>Contra</em>-style run-and-gun feel; we can see Connor snap-aiming in various directions,&nbsp;<em>Contra</em>-style, as well as lots of fast-paced action rendered in crisp pixel art.</p>

<p>Overall,&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2D: No Fate&nbsp;</em>has a pretty pleasing SNES and Genesis-era feel to it, right down to the continue screen, which feels like exactly the kind of thing a licensed&nbsp;<em>Terminator&nbsp;</em>game would have sported back in the 90s.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2D: No Fate&nbsp;</em>here. It's even got a fun reworked version of the classic&nbsp;<em>Terminator&nbsp;</em>theme for you to enjoy. Good luck getting that one out of your head once it's in there.</p>




<p><em>Terminator 2D: No Fate&nbsp;</em>isn't the only video game based on the&nbsp;<em>Terminator&nbsp;</em>series that's set to launch in the (hopefully near!) future.</p>

<p>There's also Nacon's&nbsp;<em>Terminator: Survivors</em>, which, as its name suggests, is a survival game in which you must make sense of humanity's near-extinction at the hands of Skynet, scavenging for resources and navigating an irrevocably changed world.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don't know when that one's coming out; it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/terminator-survivors-early-access-release" rel="nofollow">delayed to an unspecified point in 2025</a> back in August, although it's more than possible we'll hear something about it during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-connect-2025-announced" rel="nofollow">next week's Nacon Connect presentation</a>.</p>

<p>In the meantime,&nbsp;<em>Terminator 2D: No Fate&nbsp;</em>launches across PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch on September 5th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Frostpunk 2 Console Versions Coming in Summer, Updated Roadmap Reveals]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-console-summer-roadmap</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/frostpunk-2-console-versions-coming-in-summer-updated-roadmap-reveals.1120716/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-console-summer-roadmap<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>11 bit studios has announced that the&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>console ports will be arriving in summer, and that you can look forward to a major free update for the game in just a couple of months.</p>

<p>Back in November, 11 bit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-roadmap" rel="nofollow">shared the first</a>&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>roadmap, which promised a free update, console ports, and the game's first major DLC sometime this year. Now, the studio has released a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1601580/view/498314610455086104" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">revised roadmap</a> that gets much more specific.</p>

<p>First up, a major update is coming on May 8th. 11 bit simply says this update will "adjust the City's management, paying homage to the order established by the first New Londoners". How mysterious!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-2-console-summer-roadmap-updated.jpg?itok=jlHnQTFn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-2-console-summer-roadmap-updated.jpg?itok=P0dX5UaI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s console ports are officially coming in summer.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the major new update and the console port release timing, 11 bit studios also announced a broad release window for&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s first DLC&nbsp;<em>Spectrum</em>. It's launching in fall, apparently.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, both the&nbsp;<em>Aurora&nbsp;</em>DLC and&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s as-yet-unnamed third major expansion still don't have release windows more specific than this year and next, respectively, but at least we know roughly when the first one's coming.</p>

<p>When&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>does arrive on consoles, it'll be coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. You won't be getting any last-gen ports of the game, unfortunately, so PS4, Xbox One, and Switch owners are out in the cold (or not, as the case may be).</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>, it's the followup to 11 bit studios' 2018 city-building survival sim&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>. Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>tasks you with building a city and tending to its citizens' needs amidst a harsh, everlasting winter.</p>




<p>Released in September, the game took <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k" rel="nofollow">just a few days to become profitable</a> for 11 bit studios, so it's no wonder console ports and DLC are proceeding apace.</p>

<p>However, things aren't quite as rosy elsewhere in 11 bit land; back in December, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/11-bit-studios-layoffs-project-8" rel="nofollow">canceled its console-focused game&nbsp;<em>Project 8</em></a>, while ambitious-looking upcoming sci-fi adventure&nbsp;<em>The Alters&nbsp;</em>has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-alters-delayed-again-2025" rel="nofollow">delayed to a nebulous point in 2025</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601580/Frostpunk_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game are due to arrive in summer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-pocketpair-monster-hunter-wilds-day-off<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair has announced that it's giving most of its staff the day off on Friday, and while a concrete reason isn't stated, it's almost certainly because that's the day on which&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>comes out.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-gives-employees-special-holiday-that-just-so-happens-to-coincide-with-monster-hunter-wilds-release/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, a notice on the Japanese Pocketpair X account states that the studio's bosses have been receiving "mysterious" messages from staff, who claim they'll be "unwell tomorrow".</p>

<p>Pocketpair then says that because it's expecting a large volume of employees to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">call in mysteriously sick on Friday</a>, it's decided to give the majority of its staff the day off. However, the studio also says that updates for&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>and <i>Craftopia</i>&nbsp;will be unaffected by this holiday.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-pocketpair-palworld.jpg?itok=m-gZo3Mr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-pocketpair-palworld.jpg?itok=wVW-pyUi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is probably what a lot of Pocketpair employees will be seeing on Friday.</figcaption></figure><p>As Automaton points out, Pocketpair actually did the same thing back in 2022 for the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>release date, so it's clear the studio understands just how badly its staff is going to want to play these massive, time-consuming epics.</p>

<p>It looks like Pocketpair isn't the only one that wants to play&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, either. The game's first open beta, which took place in November, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">broke Steam records</a> for the franchise, and that's including fully-released games.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, it's the latest game in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series of, er, monster-hunting action RPGs.</p>

<p>Taking place in the dusty Forbidden Lands, the game features a greater emphasis on storytelling, as well as the classic epic struggles with giant monsters you've come to know and love from the series.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>for yourself when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on February 28th (i.e. tomorrow).</p>

<p>If you want to prepare yourself for the game, you can take a look at its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-global-release-timings" rel="nofollow">global release timings here</a>, and make sure to read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier" rel="nofollow">our own Tyler's review</a> to find out what he thought of&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>.</p>
