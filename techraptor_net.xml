            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Rock Band 4&nbsp;</em>development team has announced that the rhythm game will be delisted in just a few days, so if you haven't played it yet and you want to, make sure you pick it up sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>In a message on the game's Discord server (as spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/rock-band-4-delists-october-5th-pre-2015-dlcs-as-well.1313488/#post-145880428" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Big Yoshi</a>), the folks behind&nbsp;<em>Rock Band 4&nbsp;</em>say that because the "core licenses" for the game's music are expiring,&nbsp;<em>Rock Band 4&nbsp;</em>will be removed from both the PlayStation and Xbox storefronts.</p>

<p>As is often the case with digital delisting, if you've already bought the game, then you can continue to download and play it at your leisure, and naturally, that goes for if you've got a boxed copy of&nbsp;<em>Rock Band 4&nbsp;</em>as well.</p>

<p><em>Rock Band 4&nbsp;</em>was originally released back in 2015, and at time of writing, it's still the most recent mainline entry in the series. Like previous&nbsp;<em>Rock Band&nbsp;</em>titles, the game sees players teaming up on instrument peripherals to take on a variety of songs across different genres (despite the name).</p>

<p>It's also the last game in the series (assuming it continues in any form, that is) to be developed by original creator Harmonix, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rock-band-developer-harmonix-acquired-by-epic-games-will-make-fortnite-content" rel="nofollow">purchased by Epic Games back in 2021</a>&nbsp;and which is now responsible for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-festival-launches-with-over-600000-concurrent-players-as-lego-fortnite-passes" rel="nofollow">very&nbsp;<em>Rock Band</em>-esque&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival</em></a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-pass-tiers-rejigged-yet-again-ultimate-now-costs-30-a-month.1313695/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has announced another shakeup to the way Xbox Game Pass tiers work, and you're now going to be forking over a lot more cash if you want an Ultimate subscription.</p>

<p>As detailed in an Xbox Wire <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, there will now be three core tiers of Game Pass: Essential, Premium, and Ultimate (and yes, that wording will probably seem rather familiar if you're a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-spartacus-revealed-as-playstation-plus-overhaul" rel="nofollow">PlayStation Plus devotee</a>).</p>

<p>The PC Game Pass tier is disappearing; all three tiers will now go across PC and console. The Essential tier is, as you'd imagine, the cheapest on offer, and it grants access to "50+ games", unlimited cloud gaming, and console multiplayer for $10 per month.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-changes-2025-new-tiers.jpg?itok=3vTgJtch 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-changes-2025-new-tiers.jpg?itok=HcvZe2Uh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox is overhauling its Game Pass subscription service.</figcaption></figure><p>The second tier is Premium, which will cost you $14.99 per month and grant you access to Xbox-published games "within a year of launch", although that appears to exclude games in the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>You'll also get the same benefits as the Essential tier, although you'll enjoy "shorter wait times" for cloud gaming. Naturally, the benefits for the Premium and Essential tiers are also rolled into Ultimate, which is the only tier whose name hasn't changed.</p>

<p>What has changed is the pricing; you'll now be coughing up an eye-watering $30 per month for Game Pass Ultimate, and in return, you'll get "75+ day one games a year, including all Xbox-published games day one". As a reminder, Ultimate subscribers already get this benefit for $20 a month.</p>

<p>Other Ultimate benefits include access to the Ubisoft+ Classics range and a&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>Crew subscription, as well as "best quality" cloud gaming with "shortest wait times".</p>




<p>These changes, which come into effect immediately, are the second major Game Pass overhaul in under two years, although this one's arguably more drastic than the one <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier" rel="nofollow">put into effect back in July last year</a>.</p>

<p>The changes also come shortly after Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-largest-investment-2025" rel="nofollow">declared</a> that this year marks its "largest investment" in the Game Pass service, although that hasn't stopped former Xbox staffers and other industry luminaries from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-shannon-loftis-comments" rel="nofollow">questioning the service's worth</a> to creators.</p>
