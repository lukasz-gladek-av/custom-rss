Local game stores have reported unusually high demand, leading to a shortage of <em>Pokemon TCG Prismatic Evolutions</em> by distributors. It has gotten so dire that The Pokemon Company has directly addressed the shortage.</p>



<p>Pokebeach <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="nofollow">first reported</a> on the <em>Pokemon TCG Prismatic Evolutions</em> shortage. On January 4th, local stores were forced to limit or even cancel customer preorders of the upcoming set. According to a poll, each US store received on average 10-15% less of what they requested to buy from distributors.</p>

He stated the following:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I think a large part of the issue is that stores who do not normally order Pokemon are requesting to buy this set from distributors. Think small book stores, tabletop game stores, and other TCG-adjacent stores.” DeGuire frequently speaks to Pokemon’s distributors.</p>

<p>“This means there is nowhere near enough product to go around. Distributors are still giving loyal Pokemon stores a higher percentage of the supply, such as my store. But the actual amount of product a store receives is diluted because so many other stores want the product. Strategically, distributors want to give the product to as many stores as possible to retain as many accounts as possible.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, because of so many stores placing orders, The Pokemon Company didn't have enough supply to go around, leading to fewer boxes across the board.</p>

<p>This is curious since the <em>Pokemon TCG Prismatic Evolutions</em> shortage is an anomaly. Usually, The Pokemon Company provides plenty of supply to retailers, especially during the holidays. So what exactly is making this set so in demand?</p>

It is beloved, consistently within the top 10 lists of most popular Pokemon, thanks to its varied evolved forms and adorable design. The Pokemon Company itself even dubbed 2025 <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/2025-is-the-year-of-eevee-at-the-pokemon-center" rel="nofollow">The Year of Eevee</a>.</p>

<p>The Pokemon Company released an official statement addressing the <em>Pokemon TCG Prismatic Evolutions</em> shortage. In a <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCG/status/1879574273544622582" rel="nofollow">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter), the company stated that they are actively printing more products for the impacted stores across the US. They also confirmed that they will be printing more future Prismatic Evolutions product in the coming months.</p>
