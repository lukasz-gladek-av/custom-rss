            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-jason-blundell-new-playstation-studio<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>veteran Jason Blundell, who's worked on some of the series' biggest games, is now heading up a new studio for PlayStation by the name of Dark Outlaw Games.</p>

<p>This news was revealed in an interview with gaming journalist Jeff Gerstmann (via <a href="https://www.pcgamesinsider.biz/news/75045/call-of-duty-vet-blundell-helming-new-playstation-studio-dark-outlaw-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PCGamesInsider</a>), during which Blundell revealed that he's been "working away in the shadows" on a game that has yet to be announced.</p>

<p>Blundell goes on to say that it's a "privilege" to be able to work as part of a first-party Sony studio, although I'm pretty sure that some of Sony's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">more recent casualties</a> might have something to say about that assessment.</p>

<p>If Blundell's past experience is anything to go by, however, we can probably assume that it'll be a first-person shooter of some kind, and since he's a&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>veteran with experience working on the series' Zombies modes, Dark Outlaw's game could well have live service elements.</p>

<p>Whether or not that's a logical move for Sony remains to be seen; the company's most recent live service shooter experiment, last year's&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>, ended in disaster. The game was&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">shut down in just two weeks</a> and its developer was subsequently shuttered for good.</p>

<p>This also won't be Blundell's first foray into development for PlayStation; after leaving Treyarch in 2018, he founded Deviation Games, which was working on a new IP for PlayStation. However, Blundell left in 2022, and the developer then&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deviation-games-is-shut-down-before-it-can-ship-a-game-in-its-partnership-with-playstation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">closed its doors last year</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, it remains to be seen whether Vonderhaar's studio will join the procession of NetEase studios <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">losing their funding</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">laying off staff members</a>.
