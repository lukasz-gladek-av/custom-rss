            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/huge-halo-leak-digsite<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A huge amount of&nbsp;data relating to the&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>franchise has been leaked online, including developer builds for various games, unreleased content, and more, spanning the 25-plus years&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>has been around for.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/massive-halo-leak/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Insider Gaming</a>, the leak was first spotted by dataminer and leaker <a href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1872351879843439101" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Visceral</a>, who also revealed that around 90GB of data had been leaked. The leak, according to Visceral, "contains some builds, tools, docs etc from various&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>titles".</p>

<p>Visceral also says that the leak happened because&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>steward 343 Industries (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-unreal-engine-5-new-games" rel="nofollow">now known as</a> Halo Studios) enlisted the help of community modders to work on restoring cut&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>content from past games in the franchise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-leak-master-chief-collection.jpg?itok=_rPGdmG_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-leak-master-chief-collection.jpg?itok=THNnMhNt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A huge amount of&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>data has leaked online.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>leak was further confirmed by <a href="https://x.com/DogbrainLudus/status/1872256501982839002" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">X user DogbrainLudus</a>, a modder who was part of the aforementioned project, <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/digsite-deep-dive" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">known as "Digsite"</a>. He says that neither he nor any other Digsite members who recently departed the project are responsible for the leak.</p>

<p>DogbrainLudus also says he doesn't care how modders use what's in the leak, although "Microsoft might not agree". I think that's probably putting it mildly.</p>

<p>The reason for the leak hasn't been disclosed, although an exchange between Visceral and <a href="https://x.com/Rythayze/status/1872429533611393103" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">another user</a> on X <a href="https://x.com/Rythayze/status/1872457396813213968" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">suggests</a> that the team wasn't being paid for its work. A <a href="https://x.com/zel_is_here_now/status/1872578699037753350" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">third user then claims</a> the Digsite team told Halo Studios it wanted to be paid for the work it was doing and Halo Studios refused.</p>

<p>Of course, Halo Studios itself hasn't confirmed any of that information, so you should take it with a pinch of salt. Naturally, we're also not going to be listing any of the data that's leaked as part of this&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>leak; it's easy enough to find online if you look.</p>

<p>We also know that the next game in the&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>series is not "imminent", according to Halo Studios, so it's likely to be quite a while before you get to revisit Master Chief's story again. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hitpoint-press-humblewood-setting-is-now-pay-what-you-want<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hitpoint Press has offered TTRPG fans an enticing sale this holiday season. The publisher behind many beloved books and products, like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/deck-of-many-animated-things-and-spells-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Deck of Many,</em></a><em> </em>has announced that two of their campaign settings, <em>Humblewood</em> and <em>Heckna</em>, are now available as pay-what-you-want.</p>



<p>Humblewood and Heckna's announcement as pay-what-you-want happened somewhat unceremoniously on Hitpoint Press' official web store. As the phrase implies, you can now buy a PDF of either the Humblewood campaign setting or the Heckna campaign setting books for whatever amount you decide. Pay a dollar. Pay ten dollars. Pay whatever, the choice is yours.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/humblewood-heckna-store-screenshot.jpg?itok=F_40lBE3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/humblewood-heckna-store-screenshot.jpg?itok=UH6oqGTJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Both of these settings utilize the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 5e SRD and bring their own unique fantasy to the table.</p>

<p><em>Humblewood</em> is a world entirely occupied by intelligent animals, similar to Brian Jacques' influential Redwall novel series. It contains 10 playable player species, new subclasses, and a prewritten adventure for characters levels 1-5. It's a setting so popular it is even available as a third-party supplement on <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/humblewood-debuts-on-dd-beyond" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">D&amp;D Beyond</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, <em>Heckna</em> is a dark carnival setting. A world where various attractions and performers are actually gruesome monsters in disguise. The PDF is both a campaign setting and a prewritten adventure for characters level 1-10. It contains new magic items, a bestiary, a set of safety tools for mindful play, and a "Shuffled Stories" engine designed to remix elements of the campaign on each playthrough.</p>

Hitpoint Press has produced lines of miniatures, GM Screens, and playing cards for Heckna. As for <em>Humblewood</em>, the setting has spawned several prewritten adventures and supplements like <em>Humblewood Tales</em>, as well as an official comic written by Gail Simone.</p>

<p>Hitpoint Press has a respectable reputation in the TTRPG industry thanks in part to their <em>Deck of Many</em> product line alongside TTRPG books nad supplements helmed by prominent creators in the space. These works include <em>Fool's Gold</em> and <em>Hexbound</em> by YouTube personalities DIngo Doodles and Pointy Hat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/breaking-vault-of-viditya-voleti-brings-nonlinear-heists-for-good-cause<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Independent TTRPG designer Graham Gentz has released a new project. The game, <em>Breaking The Vault of Viditya Voleti</em>, is an experience about groups of criminals, doomed heists, and character development through adversity. Furthermore, the game's sales will go towards assisting trans youth.</p>



<p>As described on its <a href="https://grahamgentz.itch.io/breaking-the-vault-of-viditya-voleti" rel="nofollow">Itch page</a>, <em>Breaking The Vault of Viditya Voleti</em> is a nonlinear collaborative game where your group becomes a team of criminals on a heist that goes wrong.</p>

<p>The group decides on the setting of the heist and their final goal. That goal can be assassination, rescuing a prisoner, or sabotaging a doomsday weapon. The setting can be in Ancient China, World War 2, or even in a dieselpunk fantasy setting. Either way, the group is given an ultimatum and most fulfill their mission.</p>

<p>As the game progresses, character and context is revealed, culminating in a death scene where the group succeeds thanks to one character's sacrifice. The players themselves must decide if this act of selflessness was out of genuine character growth or not. To quote the game's description, "You are not a good person, but will you die that way?"</p>

The titular Viditya Voleti has a distinct body of work, producing system-agnostic fantasy work as well as the competitive card game <em>The Anatomy of Fear</em>.</p>

<p>The author, Graham Gentz, has similarly eclectic work, including <em>Immortal Lich Henry Kissinger</em>, <em>Aggressively Strange: Sailing The Spooky Wildsea</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interview/under-autumn-strangely-pastoral-horror-and-shared-stories" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Under The Autumn Strangely</em></a>.</p>

<p>Lastly, 100% of all sales of <em>Breaking The Vault of Viditya Voleti</em> will go to the <a href="https://southernequality.org/tyep/" rel="nofollow">Trans Youth Emergency Project</a>. This nonprofit organization provides logistical and financial support for transgender youth throughout the American South. This includes travel expenses, medication, as well as mental health and wellness needs.</p>

<p>The game is available now in PDF format for as little as $6.</p>
