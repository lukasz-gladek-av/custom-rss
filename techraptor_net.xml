            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-financials-2024-25<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced that its profits have fallen overall when compared to last year's figure, despite "strong" performances for releases like Atlus'&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Persona 5 Royal</em>.</p>

<p>In the legendary Japanese company's latest financial report, Sega reveals that its profit fell by around 17% compared to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-financials-2024-pachislots" rel="nofollow">last year's number</a>, although it's worth noting that its "entertainment" division (which comprises video games, but also movies and TV) actually saw profits rise.</p>

<p>Sega puts the increase in entertainment profit down to "strong performance" in various areas, including back catalog sales and revenue for the latest&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie, which helped the movie adaptations of the Blue Blur's adventures cumulatively cross $1 billion at the box office <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office" rel="nofollow">back in January</a>.</p>

High sales for flagship&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>game&nbsp;<em>Sonic x Shadow Generations&nbsp;</em>were also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-x-shadow-generations-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">part of the studio's strength</a> in this area.</p>

<p>The company also says that "strong repeat sales" for back catalog titles&nbsp;<em>Persona 5 Royal (Remaster)&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Unicorn Overlord&nbsp;</em>helped to shore up its numbers in the entertainment department.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Sega doesn't report any figures on this front, so we don't know exactly where these titles stand in terms of numbers. We do, however, know that Atlus contributed 33 billion yen to its parent's figures for this year, with&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>putting 32.5 billion in the pot.</p>

<p><em>Like a Dragon</em>, another key studio franchise, put 11.5 billion yen in Sega's coffers, with sales of the most recent entry&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</em>being "steady", according to the company. This year also marked the release of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/like-dragon-yakuza-review-yakuza-tv-show-with-ip-paintjob" rel="nofollow">live-action show based on the IP</a>, although Sega doesn't say how well it did.</p>

<p>The entertainment sector's figures also helped somewhat to offset sharp losses in the pachinko and pachislot departments, although not quite to the degree of ensuring a rise in profits for the company, unfortunately.</p>

<p>It's also worth remembering that Sega's references to "gaming" throughout its financial report don't signify video games; rather, they're referring to casino gaming under the Sammy brand, and profits were actually up slightly under that umbrella as well.</p>
