            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/mixtape-preview-bygone-era-captured-beautifully<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Mixtape </em>is the perfect encapsulation of the wonderfully weird feelings of growing up, standing on the edge and looking at the fall to adulthood. Every frame is gorgeous, every emotion powerfully evocative.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As is no surprise, <em>Mixtape </em>is designed around music. You play one of three teenage friends who are determined to make their last night together one they’ll never forget. Each track of the tape is announced with a key frame showing the song and the artist before it starts playing.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Growing Up is Weird and Wonderful</h2>

<p>Preparing for that last night together, each one of those tracks from the eponymous mixtape sends you off into a memory of some formative event in growing up. Each memory is lovely and powerfully relatable, ranging from a first kiss to running from the cops crashing a house party.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In essence, <em>Mixtape </em>is a John Hughes film made in the modern age through the medium of video games. It’s about the awkwardness of growing up, the sadness of leaving things behind, and the rebellious attitude of youth.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one, you remember your first kiss. In silhouette, your character leans in to get a kiss from a boy who she doesn’t much care for but wanted to get her first kiss out of the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cut to an insanely detailed set of teeth and tongues. Each thumbstick controls its own tongue as the writhe, slap, and slither together. It is awkward, hilarious, and a perfect way to show just how weird it all can be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every memory is a little story told about their lives that is a great window into the era the game is portraying. Quick cuts to static images doodled on in the background, like MTV, and flourishes of art are everywhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Simply put, <em>Mixtape </em>has a stellar aesthetic that is impeccably drawn together. It is extremely effective.</p>

<h2>Mixtape's Visual, Sound, and Gameplay Design Come Together Perfectly</h2>

<p>Even just the visual design of the neighborhoods and the roads the characters skate on works. There is an authentic realism to them that fits the somewhat cartoonish characters that inhabit it very well.</p>

<p>The opening scene sees you and your friends skating down a huge hill, each of you yelling out "Car!" when one is coming to avoid it, while leaves litter the ground and the greenery passes you by. It is a beautiful introduction into the world, and the lighting ties it all together into one of the better looking stretches of games in memory.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, seeing as all of the memories and the game is named after a mixtape, the tracks fit the moods of whatever is going on perfectly. <em>Mixtape </em>features a huge list of amazing artist, like&nbsp;The Smashing Pumpkins, the Cure, DEVO, Iggy Pop, and a whole lot more.</p>

<p>Obviously, the music is great in and of itself, but a lot of thought and care has been put into making sure each track enhances what we see and play on screen. Gaming's best moments are when gameplay, visuals, and sound all come together as one, and <em>Mixtape </em>is designed to hit you over the head with that again and again as we move from track to track down memory lane.</p>

<h2>Mixtape Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>My brief preview of <em>Mixtape </em>makes me confident in saying that it will be the best coming of age story put to video games that I can think of. It’s a classic story of teenagers moving through the world as they try to figure it out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I can’t wait to soak it all in and vibe with a soundtrack that will transport me to a past I may never have experienced, but it’s one that everyone will relate to. If I had to guess, I imagine there will be a fair few people that find many aspects of it eerily biographical.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/postal-2-remake-postal-2-redux<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Team Beef, as well as publishers Flat2VR Studios and Running With Scissors, have announced&nbsp;<em>Postal 2 Redux</em>, a ground-up remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Postal 2&nbsp;</em>that's hitting Kickstarter sometime later this summer.</p>

<p>According to a press release,&nbsp;<em>Postal 2 Redux&nbsp;</em>will serve as "part modernization, part love-letter". It'll utilize the Unity engine, rather than the original's "creaking Unreal 1.5 engine", and it'll boast a host of other improvements and tweaks besides.</p>

<p>Team Beef and Flat2VR say the goal with&nbsp;<em>Postal 2 Redux&nbsp;</em>is to "deliver the ultimate, no-excuse&nbsp;<em>Postal 2&nbsp;</em>sandbox". The game's world will apparently be "rebuilt with no limits, ready for every screen you own, and still happy to let you finish your errands with a shovel".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/postal-2-redux-welcome-to-paradise.jpg?itok=loAxe-3o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/postal-2-redux-welcome-to-paradise.jpg?itok=7fz_DlFK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Postal 2 Redux&nbsp;</em>modernizes the 2003 original, and it's coming to Kickstarter this summer.</figcaption></figure><p>Improvements offered by&nbsp;<em>Postal 2 Redux&nbsp;</em>include modernized visuals, with the game's textures and lighting both getting a Unity-powered glow-up (quite literally, in the latter case).</p>

<p>Additionally, you can expect a world with "zero" loading times, as well as smarter crowd AI with "improved pathfinding", new weapon and explosion physics, and "fully propped, breakable interiors". Not only that, but lovable dog Champ is also getting a "Champ 2.0" overhaul.</p>

<p>The three studios say that&nbsp;<em>Postal 2 Redux&nbsp;</em>is aiming to land on "every modern box that'll boot", including the Switch 2, by the sounds of things. Notably, the list of platforms doesn't include the Xbox One, so hopefully, you've upgraded to a Series X|S if you want to play&nbsp;<em>Postal 2 Redux</em>.</p>

<p>Whether or not the game does come to all of those platforms, however, will be dependent on how the upcoming <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/postal2redux/postal-2-redux" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Kickstarter campaign</a> performs. Despite that, however, Team Beef's Grant Bagwell says the campaign is just an opportunity to "shove even more nonsense in", so it seems the game will happen either way.</p>




<p>This remake follows in the footsteps of 2016's&nbsp;<em>Postal Redux</em>, albeit handled by a different development team to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/postal-redux-review-no-return-address" rel="nofollow">that game</a>. It'll also technically serve as the seventh full game in the&nbsp;<em>Postal&nbsp;</em>franchise (not counting mobile games and joke titles, of course).</p>

<p><em>Postal 2 Redux</em>'s Kickstarter campaign begins later this year, although we don't have a concrete date for it yet. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/towa-and-guardians-of-sacred-tree-preview-mystical-japanese-hadeslike</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-sacred-tree-preview-%E2%80%93-a-mystical-japanese-hadeslike.1216659/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/towa-and-guardians-of-sacred-tree-preview-mystical-japanese-hadeslike<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree </em>was revealed at Summer Game Fest, and I had a chance to get my hands on the game. It has beautiful art, and the gameplay is a close sibling to <em>Hades </em>with its own twists.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Towa </em>is set in a mystical realm inspired by Japanese mythology and folklore. That is where we get one of the heroes being a human/koi fish hybrid. Someone more versed in the mythology will likely see references in many of the heroes and enemies.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Towa Shares a lot of DNA with Hades</h2>

<p>It’s impossible not to bring up <em>Hades</em>, as so much of the framework of <em>Towa </em>is so heavily inspired by it. It’s a roguelite where you make runs to clear out rooms of enemies, make a selection based on a series of rewards you can get, then rinse and repeat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like selecting a powerup from a certain god you may want in <em>Hades</em>, Towa similarly has themed upgrade paths based around certain abilities or effects. You can try to build around that one set or go for a more varied approach.</p>



<p>You dash around the battlefield quickly, avoiding the many hazards enemies will throw your way by dodging and unleashing powerful abilities of your own. They are shown with the circles, arrows, and other indicators on where exactly to avoid.</p>

<p>Towa has a couple of big combat differences from something like <em>Hades</em>, however.&nbsp;</p>

<p>First, no matter which guardian you choose to fight with (there are eight total), you’ll have a set of two swords to use in a run. You’ll be forced to constantly swap between the two as the more you use one, the more worn it gets and must be resharpened. Wear one down with some combos, swap, and repeat.</p>



<p>A lot of the upgrades are specific to one sword or another, so you can change the effects and abilities of any sword quite a bit. Moreover, it's something to make sure you keep an eye on, as it would be pretty easy to have one sword be the only effective one and the other needing some help as no upgrades have done anything to it.</p>

<p>You can also bring another guardian with you on a run. They are a little more passive and just follow you around, but have their own abilities that you can use on a cooldown to help out as well.</p>

<h2>Towa Follows the Guardians Over a Long Time</h2>

<p><em>Towa </em>takes place over a vast period of time, centered around Shinju Village. Over that course of time, as the guardians come back again and again to defend it, the village will evlove and the stories of those that live there will change.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The village serves as your central hub where you’ll upgrade swords, abilities, and unlock new things over the course of time. It's where you'll learn more about the guardians, too.</p>

<p><em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</em> is a competent roguelite that will certainly charm people into giving it a try with its great style. I’m also not going to complain about another excellent roguelite taking its cues from <em>Hades</em>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Silent Hill Remake Confirmed by Konami and Bloober Team]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-remake-confirmed-by-konami-and-bloober-team.1216656/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-bloober-team-new-silent-hill<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>publisher Konami has announced that it's officially working with&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake developer Bloober Team on a remake of the very first game in the franchise.</p>

<p>The two studios were revealed to be working together on the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>remake during today's Konami Press Start livestream, where we also got some more info on upcoming games&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>, both of which are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">launching</a> in the next few months.</p>

<p>While it wasn't officially revealed that the project would be a remake during the livestream, that news was subsequently confirmed by the official Japanese&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em><a href="https://x.com/silenthill_jp/status/1933156514614988898" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">X account</a>. The video was also accompanied by music from the original&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>.</p>

<p>Creating a remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>makes perfect sense; it's no longer possible to play the first game on modern hardware. It is technically still available via the PlayStation 3 or PS Vita stores, but you can't play it on PC or modern consoles (without resorting to illegal methods, of course).</p>

<p>The announcement of the original&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>remake means that the horror franchise is officially back in full swing, having been on an extended hiatus prior to the release of&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>back in October last year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cronos-the-new-dawn-bloober-team-silent-hill.jpg?itok=TI1l-VE5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cronos-the-new-dawn-bloober-team-silent-hill.jpg?itok=x7wHqu24 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bloober Team is currently gearing up to release&nbsp;<em>Cronos: The New Dawn&nbsp;</em>sometime this year.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>, Bloober Team is currently working on its own original horror game by the name of&nbsp;<em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em>, a sci-fi spookfest that's due to launch sometime later this year.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why Konami would pick Bloober Team to work on the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill </em>remake, sales of the studio's&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">topped two million back in January</a>, so that might give you some indication as to why Konami considers Bloober a safe pair of hands.</p>
