            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-movie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware's runaway smash hit&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is getting a movie adaptation, and a celebrated sci-fi director and writer is attached to the project already.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/elden-ring-alex-garland-directing-a24-movie-1236408999/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Deadline</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>movie will be produced by indie studio A24, which is also responsible for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-movie-a24" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>movie adaptation</a>, although adapting&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is arguably going to be significantly more of a challenge than Kojima's already-fairly-cinematic game.</p>

<p>Helming the project is Alex Garland, the creative force behind movies like&nbsp;<em>Annihilation</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ex Machina</em>, and his most recent movie&nbsp;<em>Warfare</em>, an on-the-ground depiction of the Iraq war. He's also on writing duties.</p>

Martin will serve as a producer on the movie, but Deadline makes no mention of either FromSoftware or Hidetaka Miyazaki, which could suggest they're not involved in the project.</p>

<p>Naturally, movies are a very different business to games, but it's still a little troubling that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s chief creative force doesn't appear to be a part of the movie. I suppose he's busy with next year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2" rel="nofollow">Switch 2 exclusive&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em></a>.</p>

<p>I can only speak for myself here, but an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>movie seems like a pretty bad idea right from the outset. FromSoftware's open-world masterpiece is, after all, a game that tells its story in a fragmented, non-linear fashion, and it's hard to see how that's going to work in a two-hour ultra-linear movie.</p>

<p>Garland isn't necessarily the worst choice to helm&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>; he's got form when it comes to intelligent fantasy and sci-fi, after all. Still, I can't shake the feeling that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>is unfilmable, and that A24 and Garland have made rods for their own backs here.</p>




<p>We're likely a couple of years away from the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>movie at the very least, but for now, if you want more&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>shenanigans, you can content yourself with upcoming multiplayer spinoff&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nighreign-release-date" rel="nofollow">due to arrive next week</a>.</p>
