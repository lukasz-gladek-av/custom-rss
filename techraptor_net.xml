            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-beacon-update-switch-2-edition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello Games has released a brand new update for&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>by the name of Beacon, and what's more, the studio has also announced that the game is getting a Switch 2 Edition upgrade on Nintendo's new console.</p>

<p>Beacon follows on from major&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>updates like March's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-relics-update" rel="nofollow">Relics</a> and January's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-2-update" rel="nofollow">Worlds Part 2</a>, and it's on a pretty similar scale to those updates, adding some pretty major features to the game.</p>

<p>First up, the settlement system has been overhauled; you can now become the overseer of "multiple planetary settlements", according to Hello Games, and the systems for things like base management, upgrades, and decision-making have also been improved.</p>

<p>Not only that, but disputes between those citizens have also been overhauled, with more resolutions now available to you when citizens have a disagreement in your settlements. If you want to see why those disagreements got started, you can check the new settler personality info page.</p>

<p>There are tons of other changes to&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky</em>'s settlement system as part of the Beacon update, and plenty of other features have been added as well. Make sure to check out the <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/beacon-update/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">full patch notes via the game's official website</a> for more info.</p>

<p>As well as the Beacon update, Hello Games has also revealed that a Switch 2 Edition upgrade is coming for&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky</em>, and it adds some features that are missing in the original Switch version.</p>




<p>First and foremost, multiplayer will be available in the Switch 2 version, as will settlements. Both features are missing from the Switch version of the game.</p>

<p>Of course, the Switch 2 Edition version of&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>will also boast better visuals and performance, as well as touch controls, gyro aiming, and cross-save support. What's more, the Switch 2 upgrade will be entirely free.</p>

<p><em>No Man's Sky</em>'s Beacon update is available for the game right now. You can check out&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/275850/No_Mans_Sky/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/no-mans-sky/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/no-mans-sky/BQVQTL3PCH05" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/no-mans-sky-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, with the Switch 2 version on the way tomorrow.</p>
