            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/acclaim-returning-90s-2000s-publisher<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Famed 90s and 2000s publisher Acclaim is to make a return to the games industry, and it seems the studio is looking to "resurrect and revitalize" some of its classic IPs.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/game-publisher-acclaim-returns-with-focus-on-indie-studios-and-classics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>, Acclaim's revival will be headed up by industry veteran Alex Josef, who wasn't among the original founders or executives of Acclaim but who has experience publishing thanks to his time with studios like&nbsp;<em>Turnip Boy&nbsp;</em>publisher Graffiti Games, among others.</p>

<p>Josef says bringing back Acclaim is an "honor", and that the new version of the studio has "already signed some incredible indie titles". In addition, Josef says he wants to "resurrect and revitalize [Acclaim's] beloved portfolio" of intellectual properties, although he doesn't say which ones those might be.</p>

Jarrett's Global Force Entertainment is helping out with the new version of the studio, and Jarrett says resurrecting Acclaim is a chance to impart "passion and love to a new generation" via "great games".</p>

<p>Some of Acclaim's games, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/turok-3-shadow-of-oblivion-remaster-delayed" rel="nofollow"><em>Turok&nbsp;</em>series</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;dark action game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-studios-remastering-shadow-man-restoring-cut-content" rel="nofollow"><em>Shadow Man</em></a>, have already returned to modern systems in one form or another, so it'll be interesting to see which of Acclaim's properties it's able to "resurrect".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Acclaim, it got its start back in the late 80s, going on to become a prolific and fairly successful publisher throughout the 90s and early 2000s.</p>

<p>For many, however, Acclaim is more well-known for its many controversial marketing ideas, including awarding money to parents who named their baby "Turok", trying to buy ad space on tombstones for&nbsp;<em>Shadow Man: 2econd Coming</em>, and offering to pay UK speeding fines when&nbsp;<em>Burnout 2&nbsp;</em>was released.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadow-man-remastered-acclaim.jpg?itok=PhW6X0e- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadow-man-remastered-acclaim.jpg?itok=5w28Xb9x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Would you want a&nbsp;<em>Shadow Man</em>&nbsp;ad on your tombstone?</figcaption></figure><p>Acclaim closed down in 2004 following poor sales, filing for bankruptcy in August that year. The company subsequently sold publishing rights to many of its franchises to other studios.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what the revived version of Acclaim will do, but it's not the only old-school publishing label to be revived recently.</p>

<p>Back in April last year, Atari announced it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-infogrames-publishing-revival" rel="nofollow">revive the classic Infogrames label</a>, with the studio going on to acquire the rights to the&nbsp;<em>Totally Reliable Delivery Service&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/surgeon-simulator-acquired-by-infogrames" rel="nofollow">Surgeon Simulator</a>&nbsp;</em>brands.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/konami-finally-announces-a-new-suikoden-game-sort-of.1124703/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-star-leap-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has finally announced a new entry in the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>series after thirteen years, but&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap&nbsp;</em>might not be what you want it to be.</p>

<p>During a&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-program-march-3rd-announced" rel="nofollow">news broadcast</a> held earlier today, Konami revealed that&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap&nbsp;</em>will be a free-to-play mobile RPG, although it will be set in the main&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>timeline, so it won't be an alternate-history spinoff or anything like that.</p>

<p>The game will take place a few years after&nbsp;the events of&nbsp;<em>Suikoden V</em>, which itself served as a prequel to the original game. That, of course, also means that we might well see some of both games' characters appearing in&nbsp;<em>Star Leap</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suikoden-star-leap-mobile-rpg-viki.jpg?itok=bjiUk453 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suikoden-star-leap-mobile-rpg-viki.jpg?itok=02oowrx5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Familiar faces may well be making an appearance in&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In fact, one of the screenshots shown on the <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/suikoden/star_leap/us/en-us/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a> for&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap&nbsp;</em>appears to show Viki, a recurring character who serves as your method of fast travel in every mainline&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>game to date.</p>

<p>Of course, Viki is heavily implied to be able to travel through time as well as through space, so her presence here probably shouldn't come as a shock. It does, however, reinforce that this isn't just a spinoff, but a game that wants to take its place alongside the main series.</p>

<p>The trailer for the game also appears to show Gregminster, the capital city of the Toran Republic and one of the key locations in the original&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>(as well as the site of a brief but memorable stopover in the sequel).</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap&nbsp;</em>right here. Honestly, I know it's a mobile RPG, but the art style and overall presentation has me cautiously excited for it.</p>




<p>According to Konami,&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap&nbsp;</em>will be a free-to-play game with "in-game purchases", although the studio doesn't say what form those purchases will take. I hate to say it, but&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>is ripe for some kind of character gacha mechanic, so that's probably what it'll be.</p>

<p>In addition to&nbsp;<em>Star Leap</em>, Konami is also gearing up to release remasters of the first two&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>games, which are due to land later this week, having been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-i-ii-hd-remaster-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> beyond their <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-and-suikoden-2-remaster-confirmed-for-2023" rel="nofollow">original release window</a> of 2023.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out those remasters when they launch on March 6th across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1932640/Suikoden_III_HD_Remaster_Gate_Rune_and_Dunan_Unification_Wars/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/JP0101-PPSA18305_00-SUIKODENREMASTER" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/suikoden-iii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars-pre-order-bonus/9P9FM62WZXR2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/suikoden-i-and-ii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.&nbsp;<em>Suikoden Star Leap&nbsp;</em>is due to arrive at some point in the future on iOS and Android, although we don't know when yet.</p>
