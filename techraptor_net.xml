            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed that the Switch 2 Edition version of <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder </em>will be arriving in March, bringing with it a number of fun new activities for you and your friends to try out.</p><p>The Switch 2 version of <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder </em>was originally revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-september-2025-recap" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d39a3c0a-29cd-4699-ac4c-b79622d8ab1b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">during a Nintendo Direct back in September</a>, and now, Nintendo has announced that the game will join its new console's lineup on March 26th as both a physical and digital release.</p><p>In a new trailer, Nintendo also goes over what you can expect if you decide to check out <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder </em>on Switch 2. While some of the new features revolve around multiplayer, if you're a solo <em>Wonder</em>-er, you'll still have some extra challenges to enjoy.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Bellabel Park, which gives the Switch 2 Edition of <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder </em>the second half of its name (<em>Meetup in Bellabel Park</em>), will play host to a range of new multiplayer attractions and activities, both co-op and competitive.</p><p>If that's not your speed, then you can enjoy the new Toad Brigade Training Camp, where you'll find a range of new challenges to try out across <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>'s many courses.</p><p>You'll also find new Koopaling bosses scattered throughout some of the game's stages, and to help you take them on, Rosalina has become a playable character in the Switch 2 version of the game (and I'm sure it's no coincidence <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-first-trailer" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fdabb138-30ed-426d-ae89-f5cf557b56fc" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">she's appearing</a> in the upcoming <em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie </em>as well).</p><p>Other new features include the mouse-controlled Co-Star Luma and the new Assist Mode, which lessens some of <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>'s challenge and makes your journey just a little less stressful.</p>
<p><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder </em>is available right now for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Super-Mario-Bros-Wonder-2404150.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a>, and it comes to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Super-Mario-Bros-Wonder-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Meetup-in-Bellabel-Park-2915162.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Switch 2</a> on March 26th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has revealed <em>Fantastical Parade</em>, the new expansion for smash hit mobile game <em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, and it's bringing some beautiful-looking new cards next week.</p><p><em>Fantastical Parade </em>is a full-scale expansion along the lines of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-crimson-blaze-expansion" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="36d1e739-eceb-481f-8fe3-e1b1e416796b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">December's <em>Crimson Blaze</em></a> rather than a booster pack like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-secluded-springs-booster-pack" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="acf203ba-9aa5-49ad-a09c-824028b91eb5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Secluded Springs</em></a>, so you can look forward to lots of new cards to transform your <em>Pokemon TCG Pocket </em>experience, plus a whole new mechanic to wrestle with.</p><p>Let's start with the new cards.

<p>You can also look forward to regular cards for adorable 'mons like Vanillite and Pumpkaboo, as well as new Trainer cards like the Retreat Cost-lowering Peculiar Plaza and the Energy-sapping Piers.</p><p>As for that new mechanic, Stadiums are "a new type of Trainer card that can turn the tide of battle", according to The Pokemon Company. The aforementioned Peculiar Plaza card is a Stadium addition, and it's "especially tricky to handle for players using Psychic-type Pokemon", apparently.</p><p><em>Fantastical Parade </em>is also packing a suite of new covers themed around expansion mascot Gardevoir. Those covers won't become available the moment the expansion drops, though; they'll be released starting from January 31st.</p><p>You can check out a trailer that shows off some of <em>Fantastical Parade</em>'s lovely new cards, as well as its overall art style and aesthetic direction, right here.</p>

<p>In practice, some Steam reviewers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997660/GreedFall_The_Dying_World/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">beg to differ</a>. <em>GreedFall 2 </em>has amassed a Mixed rating across over 500 reviews since its Early Access launch, and even more recent opinions point to what players perceive as game-breaking bugs, unfinished systems, and iffy optimization.</p><p>Of course, there's a good chance that Spiders and Nacon can turn around <em>GreedFall 2 </em>and fix its issues in time for launch in March; there are, after all, two months between now and then, which should be enough time to at least iron out some of the more troubling-sounding problems.</p><p>However, given that Spiders was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spiders-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1d57ded4-a6cf-40e0-93cb-59588606ff42" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs in July last year</a>, the studio is operating at a reduced capacity compared to when <em>GreedFall 2 </em>launched, so you might want to temper your expectations accordingly if you're going to pick the game up on PS5 or Xbox.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>GreedFall 2: The Dying World</em>, it is, as the name implies, the sequel to the 2019 RPG <em>GreedFall</em>, although it's actually a prequel.</p>
<p><em>GreedFall 2 </em>once again revolves around notions of colonialism and exploitation; this time, you're playing as a Teer Fradee native, who must navigate political intrigue and deadly fauna across the open world of Gacane.</p><p><em>GreedFall 2: The Dying World </em>is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997660/GreedFall_The_Dying_World/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and it's coming to <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010517" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/greedfall-ii-the-dying-world/9P2SLNTMLJ2Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 12th.
