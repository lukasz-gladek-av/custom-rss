            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/smite-2-beta-preview-new-gods-new-modes-same-moba<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been a minute since we last caught up with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/smite-2-preview-next-generation-of-moba" rel="nofollow"><em>Smite 2</em></a>. Announced a year ago, the MOBA sequel has seen its alpha test take flight during 2024 and is now nearing a beta period along with a wealth of new information. We had the chance to sit in on a presentation with all the details on what’s to come during Smite 2’s beta, including the scoop on a massive update.</p>

<p><em>Smite 2</em> is being primed to add five new gods as one of the biggest pieces of this update – including Aladdin, Geb, Ullr, Agni, and Mulan, along with three new modes including Joust, Duel, and Assault (which were popular modes in the original <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/smite-celebrates-hitting-20-million-players-milestone" rel="nofollow"><em>Smite</em></a>). The team at Titan Forge will also be overhauling the core of Conquest mode, and adding 20 new aspects, which are game-changing play style twists for 20 gods.</p>

<p>There will also be several new items, performance optimizations, text chat, and more.</p>

<p>As mentioned before, <em>Smite 2</em>’s alpha test began eight months ago with only 14 gods available, with one mode, rough performance, and many systems lacking in depth. Since then, the development team has worked together with the community to improve the game by adding 45 gods, six modes, which lead to increased reviews and additional player feedback.</p>


<h2>How <em>Smite 2</em> Evolves The Original's Formula</h2>

<p>For those who aren’t familiar with <em>Smite 2</em>, the core starting goals shared by the team include capturing the magic of the original <em>Smite</em> and its third-person MOBA formula. They also include making targeted improvements to refine a decade-old game for a new generation of gamers, and to respect and honor the community in the process.</p>

<p>In honoring the community, that meant having to over-deliver following the alpha testing weekends. What that means is that fixes were being shipped frequently to keep progress flowing, and focusing on favorite gods to add into <em>Smite 2</em>.</p>

<p>This also included three weekly live streams dedicated to covering player questions and providing a look behind the scenes.</p>

<p>This has culminated in several milestones for <em>Smite 2</em>. The game has 45 gods, increased from the original 14, six modes instead of one, a complete art overhaul, core combat improvements and FX readability improvements, a new HUD, a new conquest map layout, big changes to monetization, collaborations such as Lord of the Rings, and much more.</p>

<p>As <em>Smite 2</em> moves into its beta phase, there’s a lot to cover in terms of what is next. One of the biggest additions will be with the new god, Aladdin, who will arrive on January 14 as part of the new pantheon Tales of Arabia.</p>

<p>Aladdin, The Sultan, is a Magical Assassin who can use the ability Three Wishes – each with powerful effects but can only be used once for came. These include coming back to life instantly, earn bonus Gold, or resetting all cooldowns. Aladdin can also run on walls, which is a new piece of tech for Smite 2. His Ultimate can trap enemies in his magic lamp to fight them, and anyone can join, which allows Aladdin to split up a fight in his own unique way.</p>

For example, Ullr’s stance swapping is further enhanced, while Mulan can plant a Consumable banner that increases XP and grants allies Movement Speed.</p>

<p>New modes will be available including Joust, which is a 3v3 match including one lane and jungle camps. Teleporters have been added for easier traversal, and stealth grass for surprise engagements. The same map is available for the new 1v1 Duel mode.</p>

<p>The Conquest mode is also being updated, which is the premiere mode for <em>Smite</em>’s esports scene. There’s some layout changes (different pathing), new jungle camps, new vision-focused camps, new jungle boss pickups like the Obsidian Dagger (which deals 500 true damage to the user but grants 20% more damage and attack speed for six seconds) from the Fire Giant, and breakables like Healing Wisps in the jungle.</p>

<p>The Aspects mode will offer a new playable twist for gods in <em>Smite 2</em>. In the lobby, players will be able to play the god normally or Aspect enabled. With 20 of the 45 available gods enabled, more will be added over time. An example of this mode is with Athena, who can no longer teleport to allies, but instead to enemies and weaken them. So those types of trade-offs are in play.</p>

There’s also updates to auto builds, role guides for all roles, role filters in the item shop, UI features like PC text chat, balance passes to improve STR and Active items, ranked reset and matchmaking improvements, as well as performance optimizations and more.</p>

<p>As for when players will be able to get their hands on <em>Smite 2</em>’s beta – starting January 7 most of the content described in this article (aside from Aladdin on January 14) will be available, alongside a developer live stream, which will also discuss everything further detail and how 2025 will certainly be a major year for the game and its evolving community.</p>
