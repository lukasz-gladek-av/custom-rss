            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.1, and the latest update for the hack-and-slash action RPG is coming very soon indeed.</p>

<p>As revealed during one of the studio's customary livestreams,&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.1 arrives on July 16th. That's next Wednesday at time of writing, so you won't have very long to wait for this one.</p>

<p>Just like you'd expect, Version 2.1 represents a continuation from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-20-release-date" rel="nofollow">June's massive 2.0 update</a>. Two new areas, the narrative-focused Sailume Bay and the summery Fantasy Resort, will be available for you to explore, with the former serving as the "central stage for Chapter 2's story".</p>

The first, Ukinami Yuzuha, is a Support Agent who can empower other attackers and use her tanuki friend to throw candy bombs. Well, why not, eh?</p>

<p>Your second new Agent in&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.1 is Alice Thymefield, an Anomaly Agent whose Blade Etiquette resource can be used to unleash devastating attacks on her opponents. A new Bangboo, Miss Esme, joins the two Agents, providing HP and energy replenishments if she's in your squad.</p>

<p>Reruns for Miyabi and Yanagi will also be available as part of Version 2.1's banners, so if you missed your chance to pick up those two Agents the first time around, you'll have another chance in this update cycle.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new minigames like surfing, sea shooting, and new fishing spots, as well as new outfits to unlock with a summery theme. There's plenty to look forward to as part of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.1, and you can check out the trailer below!</p>




<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 2.1 arrives across <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices</a> on July 16th.</p>
