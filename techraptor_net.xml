            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-patch-14<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GSC Game World has released&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>Patch 1.4, and it's bringing tons of improvements to the game's combat mechanics, plus more changes to the much-vaunted A-Life AI system and lots of other tweaks.</p>

<p>Much like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-12" rel="nofollow">last few</a> major&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-update-1-1-a-life" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, there's no single star of the show here; it's all about the minor adjustments that all come together to create what will hopefully be a slightly less janky game.</p>

<p>Combat changes include mutants now being able to eat corpses using an animation if they're nearby, as well as entering an "alert" state if something happens near them. You'll have to be on your toes if you don't want to fall foul of mutants now.</p>

They'll also use trees as cover now, which is a nice addition.</p>

<p>Plenty of other big improvements have been made to the way humans do battle in&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>as well; they'll throw grenades only when flushing out targets (rather than on cooldown), flank more often, and use tougher close combat measures in Veteran and Stalker difficulty modes.</p>

<p><em>Stalker 2</em>'s A-Life system, which has been the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world" rel="nofollow">subject of some controversy</a> in the past, has also received a few tweaks, although they're much less extensive than they have been in previous patches.</p>

<p>A-Life NPCs will now behave less erratically when attacking enemy lairs, and an issue involving A-Life NPCs not moving when "transitioning to offline" has also been fixed. It's not much, but it's useful nonetheless.</p>

Be aware that while it's not quite as long as previous updates, it's still a pretty long list.</p>

<p>This patch comes just a day after GSC Game World <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-legends-of-zone-enhanced-edition-release-date" rel="nofollow">announced the release date</a> for the upcoming Enhanced Edition upgrade for the&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Legends of the Zone</em>&nbsp;trilogy, which is bringing visual and gameplay improvements to the classic shooters next week.</p>
