            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/insomniac-ceo-founder-ted-price-steps-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After more than 30 years with the company, Insomniac Games CEO and founder Ted Price is stepping down. His role will be filled by three of the studio's executives, who are stepping up as co-studio heads.</p>

<p>In a Sony <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/ted-price-announces-retirement/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a>, Price says he's retiring from the industry as a whole rather than moving on to new opportunities. He says he's leaving the studio in "one of the strongest positions we've experienced in years", and that he's put a succession plan in place that will provide "continuity, stability, and strong leadership".</p>

<p>To that end, three execs will be stepping up to fill Price's shoes: marketing and brand head Ryan Schneider, finance head and CFO Jen Huang, and head of creative Chad Dezern. It's not clear whether they'll also continue those roles in addition to heading up Insomniac.</p>

<p>It doesn't sound like a great deal is going to change in an operational sense with Price's stepping down. It's likely that you'll notice the difference far more if you're an Insomniac employee than if you're a fan of their games.</p>

<p>The three do eulogize Price's career in a rather touching way, though, calling him "not just our leader" but also "our longtime friend" and praising his "ability to inspire everyone around him to grow".</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for that one yet, so stay tuned for more on this and all other things Insomniac Games.</p>
