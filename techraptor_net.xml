            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Sega and developer Sports Interactive have announced&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 26</em>, the next iteration in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>series of management sims.</p>

<p>The game was revealed earlier today via a new trailer titled "Guess Who's Back", in which we get to see some footage of the Premier League trophy, as well as several players who will presumably be included in the game.</p>

<p>The trailer is pretty short, so we don't get to learn much about&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 26</em>&nbsp;by its conclusion, but the game's very existence will likely be enough to get&nbsp;<em>Football Manager&nbsp;</em>fans excited, albeit tentatively given the franchise's recent history.</p>

<p>Back in June last year,&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-dev-update" rel="nofollow">was unveiled</a>, but it was met with immediate consternation from fans regarding some of the features Sega would remove, which included the Create-a-Club system, as well as Touchline Shouts and other more minor systems.</p>

<p>Initially, <i>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</i>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-release-date" rel="nofollow">set to launch in November</a> last year, but it was subsequently delayed following what Sports Interactive referred to as a "difficult development cycle". This drew further fan ire, since the delay would potentially mean that the game would miss the league window, which would make newer rosters and transfers irrelevant.</p>

<p>Following that, and the news that&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 24&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-24-data-update-2024-25" rel="nofollow">wouldn't be getting a data update</a> ahead of the&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 25&nbsp;</em>release, Sega eventually made the call to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/football-manager-25-canceled" rel="nofollow">cancel&nbsp;<em>FM25&nbsp;</em>altogether</a>, instead choosing to focus on its successor.</p>




<p>We'll likely learn more about&nbsp;<em>Football Manager 26&nbsp;</em>in the coming weeks, including a first look at its gameplay and (hopefully!) a timely release date as well. For now, you can keep your eyes glued to the game's <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a> for further updates.</p>
