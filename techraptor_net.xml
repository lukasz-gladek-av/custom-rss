            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-again<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sassy Chap Games and publisher Team17 have announced that upcoming dating sim&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>has been delayed, meaning it'll no longer hit what would have been its perfect release date.</p>

<p>Announced in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-dating-sim" rel="nofollow">July last year</a>, the game was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/date-everything-delayed-valentines-day" rel="nofollow">delayed to Valentine's Day</a>, but it's been pushed back once again. It'll now launch in June, although the two studios haven't announced a new fixed date for&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>yet, ironically.</p>

<p>In a press release, lead designer Ray Chase says that while&nbsp;<em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>has reached the point at which the game is complete without the studio compromising its "bonkers artistic vision", he and Sassy Chap got "too confident" that they could test all of the game's pathways and outcomes.</p>

<p>In case you're wondering, by the way, it is indeed apparently possible to date the glitches in question. Chase says "their name is Daemon" and that he's "currently in a love/hate relationship with them". I, for one, hope he's being serious.</p>

<p><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>is an upcoming dating sim in which the stated aim is to allow you to, well, date everything.</p>

<p>That claim may not be entirely true, but you certainly can date a wide range of suddenly-animate objects, including your piano, your vacuum cleaner, and your overwhelming sense of existential dread.</p>




<p>The game promises 100 dateable objects, full voice acting, and branching narratives. With that many characters, I'm not surprised extra development time was needed to make sure they all made sense.</p>

<p><em>Date Everything!&nbsp;</em>launches sometime in June for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010892" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/date-everything/9n0ccpmbljq8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and Nintendo Switch. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>
