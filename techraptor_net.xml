            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-circana-march-2025-sales<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>US analysis firm Circana has released its gaming sales data for March, and it probably won't come as a surprise that Ubisoft's latest major release&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>is leading the pack for the month.</p>

<p>According to Circana's Mat Piscatella over on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lniaufpggs26" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>,&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>topped the all-format sales chart for March, with new sports release&nbsp;<em>MLB: The Show 25&nbsp;</em>coming in second. Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is in third, which isn't surprising given its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">incredibly strong sales performance</a>.</p>

<p><em>Shadows&nbsp;</em>is also Xbox's top-selling game for the month, although it's pipped to the post on PlayStation by the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>MLB: The Show 25</em>. Since neither game launched on Switch, the honor for Nintendo's console goes instead to&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-announced" rel="nofollow">recent remaster</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xenoblade-chronicles-x-circana-sales-data-march-2025.jpg?itok=CajVuSfV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xenoblade-chronicles-x-circana-sales-data-march-2025.jpg?itok=qOFJBYOP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X&nbsp;</em>was the best-selling Switch game in March.</figcaption></figure><p>In terms of play time,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>topped the charts for both PlayStation and Xbox, although the honor on Steam goes to wacky co-op horror game&nbsp;<em>R.E.P.O.</em>, probably because&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>isn't available on Steam.</p>

<p>Just in case you're wondering,&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>' March performance wasn't enough to give it the top spot in the year-to-date sales chart; that still belongs to&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, although&nbsp;<em>Shadows&nbsp;</em>is in a very respectable second place.</p>

<p>Hardware spending fell by 25% over last March, representing the lowest March total since 2019. Sony's PS5 was once again the market leader for both dollar and unit sales, with Xbox Series X|S coming in second on both measures.</p>

<p>Switch sales dropped by 37% when compared to last March, although that's almost certainly due in large part to consumers waiting for the Switch 2, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">launching in June this year</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-is-up-to-its-old-web3-tricks-again-with-might-magic-fates.1171311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/might-and-magic-fates-blockchain-mobile<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced&nbsp;<em>Might &amp; Magic Fates</em>, a new free-to-play trading card game created in conjunction with blockchain studio Immutable, and yes, that does mean the game will have Web3 elements.</p>

<p>In an announcement <a href="https://x.com/MightMagicFates/status/1915033605266456909" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Ubisoft says&nbsp;<em>Might &amp; Magic Fates&nbsp;</em>will give you the opportunity to "collect and trade iconic cards", and that the game will offer the chance to "play for free [and] dominate with skill".</p>

<p>According to an <a href="https://www.mightandmagicfates.com/faqs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> on&nbsp;<em>Fates</em>' official website, the game is a "strategic card game where every decision matters", and it'll involve building "powerful decks by combining creatures, spells, artifacts, buildings, and heroes" from across the&nbsp;<em>Might &amp; Magic&nbsp;</em>world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/might-magic-fates-free-to-play-blockchain-art.jpg?itok=rpyoZYSk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/might-magic-fates-free-to-play-blockchain-art.jpg?itok=B-fKlTqA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Might &amp; Magic Fates&nbsp;</em>is another Web3-infused offering from Ubisoft.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, you'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Might &amp; Magic Fates&nbsp;</em>online against other players, and Ubisoft promises the chance to build your collection either through earning rewards by playing the game or through "opening booster packs filled with cards of varying rarities".</p>

<p>If you're wondering where the Web3 elements come in, Ubisoft says the blockchain stuff in&nbsp;<em>Might &amp; Magic Fates&nbsp;</em>will be "optional" and will "unlock digital ownership for players who want it".</p>

<p>According to Ubisoft, that means you can "enjoy the full experience, grow your collection, and compete at the highest level" without ever having to touch&nbsp;<em>Fates</em>' Web3 elements, but if you want to, you can "freely trade your cards using the Immutable blockchain".</p>

<p>This is, of course, far from Ubisoft's first dalliance with Web3 gaming. In October last year, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-nft-game" rel="nofollow">released the rather generically-named</a>&nbsp;<em>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles</em>, an NFT game that features figurines you can buy with your real-life hard-earned cash.</p>




<p>I'm not entirely sure that&nbsp;<em>Might &amp; Magic Fates&nbsp;</em>is going to be the thing to turn Ubisoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-cost-cutting-q3" rel="nofollow">flagging fortunes</a> around, but then again, given that it's a blockchain game, I don't think Ubisoft is banking on it doing so either.</p>

<p><em>Might &amp; Magic Fates&nbsp;</em>has no release date yet, but when it launches, it'll arrive for mobile devices "with potential expansion to PC". Watch this space for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-apple-500-million-euro-fine</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-slapped-with-%E2%82%AC500m-fine-in-ongoing-battle-with-epic-games.1171257/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-apple-500-million-euro-fine<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple has been ordered to pay a fine of&nbsp;€500 million and make changes to the way its iOS store works as part of its ongoing legal battle with&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>studio Epic Games.</p>

<p>In a news <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/apple-is-breaking-the-law-by-charging-fees-for-steering-imposing-restrictions-on-third-party-stores" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website, Epic reveals that the European Commission has <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_25_1085" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">found</a>&nbsp;Apple to be in breach of the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which requires the iPhone maker to "inform customers, free of charge, of alternative offers outside the App Store".</p>

<p>As part of the DMA, Apple must also "steer [customers] to those offers and allow them to make purchases", an obligation with which the European Commission believes Apple "fails to comply". The Commission says Apple "prevents app developers" from informing customers about alternative offers and distribution channels.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apple-epic-european-commission-fortnite.jpg?itok=nL_9tJEl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apple-epic-european-commission-fortnite.jpg?itok=qPrGULfx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Apple's battle with Epic has resulted in another blow to the Cupertino tech giant.</figcaption></figure><p>Today's ruling means that Apple must "remove the technical and commercial restrictions on steering" (i.e. allowing developers to recommend other offers and non-iOS alternatives to customers) and "refrain from perpetuating the non-compliant conduct in the future".</p>

<p>According to Epic, changes Apple must make include the removal of fees imposed on purchases made outside of an iOS app, as well as the elimination of "restrictions on the language, style and flow that developers can use to link to their website or to access an alternative payment system".</p>

<p>If you need a reminder of where all this started, it's been running since 2020, when Epic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-slashes-up-to-20-off-purchases-on-all-platforms" rel="nofollow">decided to offer a discount</a> on in-game&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>purchases across all platforms, but only if using a new direct payment system introduced by the company at the time.</p>

<p>Apple took umbrage at this decision and removed&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>from the iOS App Store, prompting Epic to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-apple-store-version-removed-for-violating-app-store-guidelines" rel="nofollow">file a lawsuit in response</a>. Google, the owner of the Android operating system, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-sues-google-over-fortnites-removal-from-play-store" rel="nofollow">took similar measures</a> and was also sued by Epic.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-mobile-epic-apple-european-commission.jpg?itok=pYA66nQy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-mobile-epic-apple-european-commission.jpg?itok=nia3XVmp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>All of this started as part of a row over alternative payment systems within&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on mobile.</figcaption></figure><p>The saga has essentially been running since then, but Epic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-google-victory-play-store" rel="nofollow">won another pretty significant victory</a> back in October, this time against Google. As part of the ongoing case, a judge ruled that Google must open up its Play Store to third-party apps and give "rival third-party app stores access to the full catalog of Google Play apps".</p>

<p>That ruling referred specifically to the Epic Games Store's availability on Android rather than alternative payment systems, but since Epic would rather funnel players through its own store and payment systems than Google or Apple's, it's all connected.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what today's ruling means for Epic and Apple in the future. In the meantime, you can still play <i>Fortnite&nbsp;</i>on mobile devices, although you'll need to download the Epic Games Store app to do so.</p>
