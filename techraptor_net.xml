            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Erenshor</em>, described by developer and publisher Burgee Media as a "single-player simulated MMORPG", is getting a brand new update, and it's got a new class, a guild system, and more for you to try out.</p><p>As revealed in a press release, the game's new Rising Shadows update is coming on February 2nd. One of its main new features is the Reaver, a melee class that can fulfil tank, DPS, and utility roles thanks to its stance system. It's not dissimilar to <em>World of Warcraft</em>'s Death Knight.</p><p>You can also look forward to a guild system that lets you create and join guilds, which Burgee Media says will add "a new layer of identity and progression" to <em>Erenshor</em>'s simulated MMO world.</p><figure role="group">

<p>If you're more of a solitary type, then you can take solace in the new Reliquary, a player space that you can decorate and customize using "found, crafted, and quest-earned statues", as well as "shrines, buffs, and other objects".</p><p>You can also use the Reliquary as a basis for fast travel, storing portal runes within it so you can move between locations and your home base with ease. Not only that, but you can summon your in-game friends to your Reliquary, as well as hosting auction houses, shops, and banks.</p><p>The new update also introduces a host of SimPlayer improvements, making <em>Erenshor</em>'s inhabitants feel even more lifelike, as well as new GM entities that will request you follow in-game rules if you find yourself feeling a little roguish.</p><p>All of this is in addition to lots of quality-of-life improvements that should make your experience in <em>Erenshor </em>feel that much smoother. If you're feeling like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/fellowship-preview-familiar-yet-fresh-take-on-mmo-dungeons" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2c9e90e9-ffd4-4c64-91cc-0b15cda9f07b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Fellowship</em></a><em> </em>is just a little too crowded, this one might be for you.</p>
<p><em>Erenshor </em>is a "single-player MMORPG" that aims to recreate the feeling of a classic MMO, only without the online multiplayer component.</p><p>It does so through technology Burgee calls SimPlayers, which, despite what you might think, aren't based on LLMs; instead, they use "a mixture of state machines and decision trees" to simulate real MMO players convincingly.</p><p>In essence, Burgee's goal is to build a living, breathing environment full of the same sort of things you'd find in a regular MMO, namely cities full of NPCs (and "players"), dungeons, lore to discover, and more.</p><p>If you'd like to see how successful Burgee has been at replicating that experience, you can check out <em>Erenshor </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2382520/Erenshor/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you're hankering for a new tactical RTS that will give you a meaty intellectual challenge to chew on, then look no further than developer and publisher Tactical Boar's <em>Veterans: Napoleonic Wars</em>, which is coming to PC sometime soon.</p><p>In a press release, Tactical Boar says you'll be "mastering formations, maintaining morale, and making tactical decisions across recreated battlefields" in its game, all while taking command of "historical armies".</p><p>You'll need to pay attention to unit experience and morale as you play, as well as common 1790s battlefield formations like the line, the column, and the square. As you progress through campaigns, your units will gain veterancy, giving you greater control over shaping and customizing your armies.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Veterans: Napoleonic Wars </em>is all about formation and unit tactics.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As "increasingly complex tactical scenarios" play out, <em>Veterans: Napoleonic Wars </em>will throw new challenges at you, including the use of artillery, which Tactical Board says "emphasizes the importance of troop maneuvering" as well as "reinforcing the importance of positioning and timing" in battle.</p><p>Despite this strategic depth, the studio says <em>Veterans: Napoleonic Wars </em>will offer "accessible, fast-paced gameplay", so if you're not a real-time strategy genius, then you should still find something to enjoy here.</p><p>Unlike many other RTS games, this one won't offer any multiplayer features, either; Tactical Boar says the game will be "a focused single-player experience", so don't expect to be taking on your friends here anytime soon.</p><p>You can check out the debut trailer for <em>Veterans: Napoleonic Wars</em>, which should be red meat for you if you're a <em>Total War </em>fan (and you're <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/total-war-pharaoh-review-this-is-not-it" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7067fdbf-b9ab-4e47-903f-e0733b54d97a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">disappointed with more recent releases</a>), right here.</p>
<p>There is, admittedly, not a ton of information in said trailer, but <em>Veterans: Napoleonic Wars </em>doesn't have a release date yet, so that's probably fair enough. If you want to keep up with this one's progress, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4202430/Veterans_Napoleonic_Wars/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow">wishlist it on Steam here</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
