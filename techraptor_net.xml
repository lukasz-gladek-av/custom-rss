            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-tv-series-rights-james-wan<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>James Wan's production company Atomic Monster has acquired the rights to turn indie driving survival game&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>into a TV show.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/pacific-drive-tv-series-game-james-wan-1236251563/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>, Wan, best known as the creator of the&nbsp;<em>Saw&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Insidious&nbsp;</em>franchises (as well as the director on movies like&nbsp;<em>Furious 7&nbsp;</em>and both&nbsp;<em>Aquaman&nbsp;</em>films), will serve as an executive producer alongside Michael Clear and Rob Hackett, also Atomic Monster execs.</p>

<p>They'll be joined by Jeff Ludwig, who will, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4906983/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">according to IMDb</a>, also serve as an executive producer on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies" rel="nofollow">Annapurna and Remedy's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake&nbsp;</em>TV series</a>. He's also worked alongside movie and TV production studio Story Kitchen on a&nbsp;<em>Sifu&nbsp;</em>live-action adaptation, which has yet to see the light of day.</p>

<p>However, since the project doesn't yet have any creative personnel attached to it (not to mention a streaming platform), it's likely that we're still very early on in production, so it could be a very long time indeed before we hear anything about this one.</p>

<p>If you aren't familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>, it's a "driving survival adventure" developed by Ironwood Studios and published by Kepler Interactive. The game is set in the fictional Olympic Exclusion Zone, which may be in the Pacific Northwest but which owes more than a small debt to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-a-life-20-gsc-game-world" rel="nofollow">the likes of&nbsp;<em>Stalker</em></a>.</p>




<p>Your goal in&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>is to explore the Zone, scavenge resources to build yourself better equipment and upgrade your car, and uncover the area's "mystery".</p>

<p><em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>is just the latest game to come into non-interactive media's crosshairs. Major successes in recent years include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kaitlyn-dever-last-of-us-season-2" rel="nofollow">HBO's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kaitlyn-dever-last-of-us-season-2" rel="nofollow">The Last of Us</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-prime-video-100-million-viewers" rel="nofollow">Amazon's&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>show</a>, although as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paramount-cancels-halo-series" rel="nofollow">Paramount and its&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>show</a> can no doubt tell you, these experiments don't always pan out.</p>
