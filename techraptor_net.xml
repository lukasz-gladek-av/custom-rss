Indie games have a much wider variety, and because by necessity they have to have a great hook or idea to form a game around, those that usually see the most success are also the most interesting games of the year.</p>

<p>Here are the nominees for TechRaptor's 2024 Indie Game of the Year Award for outstanding creative and technical design from outside a large studio.</p>

<hr><h2>Fifth Place -&nbsp;The Rise of the Golden Idol</h2>



<p>Developer: Color Gray Games | Release Date: November 12th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Andrew Otton</p>

<p><em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em> was easily one of my favorite games in recent years, and thankfully the sequel <em>The Rise of the Golden Idol </em>doesn't disappoint. An exercise in beautiful simplicity,<em> Rise of the Golden Idol </em>is amazing at making you feel like a genius (or idiot for an extended period) when something finally clicks.</p>

<p><em>Rise </em>brought with it some quality of life updates in this detective/investigation game in how information is organized and how you can quickly access it as you try to suss out exactly what happened in any one scene. There are bigger storylines connected in interesting ways, with plenty of callbacks to the original game as well.</p>

<p>If you like logic-based puzzles or really just want to figure out some mysteries, including some murder mysteries here and there, this game is a no brainer.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Fourth Place - UFO 50</h2>



<p>Developer: Mossmouth, LLC | Release Date: September 18th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Austin Suther</p>

<p>If you love the artform of video games, <em>UFO 50 </em>is the game for you. It’s a digital time capsule with 50 individual games, giving us a glimpse at how technology and gameplay evolved during the early years of the medium, warts and all.</p>

<p>There’s a fun little narrative behind the scenes, with this fake company called UFOsoft, running on fake hardware and a bunch of made-up employees in the credits. It’s fun to explore the history of UFOsoft, but the games themselves are, of course, the highlight.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We’d be here forever if I explained the ins-and-outs of every game within this collection, but just know these can range from quick, arcade-like experiences to full fledged RPGs. <em>UFO 50</em> is a remarkable achievement in game design.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Third Place -&nbsp;1000xRESIST</h2>



<p>Developer: Sunset Visitor | Release Date: May 9th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p>

<p><em>1000xRESIST</em> is the kind of interactive experience that is few and far between -- a narrative experience that is equal parts strange and personal, profound and intimate.</p>

<p>Across 15 hours, it encompasses the complexities of high school drama, the anxiety of uncertainty in the face of a pandemic, the existential dread of an alien invasion, the hollow comforts of a religious cult, and the complex cracks in the system by revolution.</p>

<p>It is the kind of narrative that is dense with metaphor and layered meaning. The generational gaps of Watcher, All Mother, and Iris. The recursive nature of humanity throughout the centuries: oppression leading to revolution leading to oppression.</p>

<p>While its gameplay features are light, little more than dialogue options, the experience of <em>1000xRESIST</em> cannot be missed by those that love interactive narrative or thoughtful sci-fi.</p>

<h2>Second Place - Animal Well</h2>



<p>Developer: Shared Memory | Release Date: May 9th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p>

<p>This game caught my eye as soon as it was revealed -- a tease of puzzles within puzzles, upon release it absolutely delivered. With a core game experience presenting a tight, non-linear Metroidvania, you can enjoy the unsettling atmosphere as you hop through the world. For those who enjoy finding collectibles you'll be treated to unique puzzles and gameplay challenges.</p>

<p>If you scratch just a bit further below the surface, the experience is one that only a few games have managed to pull off so far. No matter what level of interest in this game, it's an entertaining and unique experience for every type of player.</p>

<h2>Winner - Balatro</h2>



<p>Developer: LocalThunk | Release Date: February 20th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Blair Bishop</p>

<p>It was somewhat humorous to see the reaction to <em>Balatro </em>in the run-up to awards season. People simply couldn’t believe a game that looked like that could generate enough hype to last throughout the entire year. So they delved in and saw for themselves how this was possible, and they returned changed. Ashamed that they ever doubted that this was possible.</p>

<p>It’s a testament to how well-designed <em>Balatro </em>is. It’s easy to pick up and play, and it’s easier to find yourself lost in it. Striking the perfect balance between casual muckabouts and all-in numbers games, LocalThunk has created something which will be in the space for years to come.</p>

<p>And maybe even after that.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Switch 2 Officially Announced, Direct Coming in April]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced-direct-coming-in-april.1083870/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has finally officially announced the Switch 2, putting an end to months and months of speculation. What's more, a Direct presentation is coming with more information in April.</p>

<p>In a new trailer uploaded to the official Nintendo account, Nintendo shows off the console, which does indeed appear to feature many of the rumored improvements, including magnetic Joy-Cons, a bigger screen, and a redesigned dock.</p>

<p>Nintendo also says you'll be able to play both Switch 2 games and original Switch titles on the new machine, although "certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-announced-frontal-view.jpg?itok=uDHqZxsT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-announced-frontal-view.jpg?itok=4cvp3yOZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here's the Switch 2 in all its glory.</figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2's Joy-Cons will, it seems, lose the bold color scheme of the originals; instead, the default Joy-Con controllers will be all-black, although their analog stick housings will sport the Switch's traditional blue and red.</p>

<p>Additionally, the inside of the Joy-Cons, where the SL and SR buttons are located, will be blue and red, as will the magnetic housing on the console itself.</p>

<p>A new kickstand will also be present on the Switch 2, and it looks a lot sturdier than the original Switch's equivalent. Our very own Stretch has done the math, and he reckons the kickstand tilts by about 150 degrees.</p>

<p>It looks like the Switch 2 won't be making too many changes in terms of ports, either; the USB-C socket will once again be located on the bottom for charging and attaching to the dock, and you'll also have access to a headphone jack.</p>




<p>We knew a Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">announcement was coming sometime before April</a>, and rumors had suggested that the announcement would come today, so it's nice to have the console out in the open at last.</p>

<p>Of course, right now, Nintendo is keeping its cards close to its chest regarding hardware specs, so we don't know how much more powerful the Switch 2 is than the original Switch.</p>

<p>It does, however, look like some kind of new&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>game will accompany the launch of the console; the trailer shows what seems to be a new entry in the phenomenally popular racing series, although I suppose it could also be&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</em>with yet more new courses.</p>

<p>In any case, Nintendo will be revealing more about the Switch 2 during a new Direct presentation on April 2nd. Stay tuned for more on that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-mod-liberty-city-preservation-project-taken-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ambitious&nbsp;<em>GTA&nbsp;</em>mod Liberty City Preservation Project has been shut down, but contrary to what you might think, the mod's developer insists that the takedown wasn't due to a DMCA request on Rockstar's part.</p>

<p>In a message shared to the mod's Discord server (via <a href="https://x.com/GameRollGTA/status/1879611635343741349" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GameRoll on X</a>), modder nkjellman says that the choice to take the mod down was made "due to the unexpected attention" the project received, and that a decision was reached "after speaking with Rockstar Games".</p>

<p>However, in a <a href="https://x.com/GameRollGTA/status/1879683899015700852" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup message</a>, nkjellman clarifies that the takedown "isn't a DMCA" but rather "a friendly takedown, mutually agreed upon by all parties involved". The modder says there's "no negativity between [their team] and Rockstar Games / Take-Two Interactive".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gta-liberty-city-preservation-project-mod-shutdown-trevor.jpg?itok=LYAOCXcD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gta-liberty-city-preservation-project-mod-shutdown-trevor.jpg?itok=OeJ0uke4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Liberty City Preservation Project is no more, but it wasn't taken down because of a DMCA, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>The modder goes on to say that you shouldn't download LCPP from unofficial sources because they "may contain malware", and that users also shouldn't share download links in the Discord server.</p>

<p>Of course, although nkjellman says the takedown was "friendly" and that Rockstar didn't issue a DMCA, that doesn't mean it wasn't Rockstar who unofficially requested the mod's removal.</p>

<p>It's very possible that if nkjellman and their team had refused to take down LCPP, a DMCA would have been the next step, so even though a DMCA wasn't issued, it could well have been the threat of a DMCA that caused the modders to take down the project.</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, one thing's for certain: you won't be able to get Liberty City Preservation Project from official sources anymore, so I hope you've already got the mod downloaded if you want to keep playing it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gta-4-liberty-city-preservation-project.jpg?itok=XhxeCzuQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gta-4-liberty-city-preservation-project.jpg?itok=XTo3oq5s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rockstar's parent company Take-Two is well-known for its hawkish stance on modders.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering exactly what the Liberty City Preservation Project mod was, it was an ambitious attempt to essentially mod the entirety of&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 4&nbsp;</em>into the&nbsp;<em>GTA 5&nbsp;</em>engine, complete with the whole Liberty City map to explore.</p>

<p>In a way, it's not surprising that it's been taken down. Rockstar's parent company Take-Two is notoriously hostile towards modders, having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-adds-gta-underground-list-killed-mods" rel="nofollow">taken down</a> several&nbsp;<em>GTA</em>-related <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-issues-another-wave-of-dmcas-for-gta-mods" rel="nofollow">modding projects</a> in the past.</p>
