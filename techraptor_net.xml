            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A small consolation has been provided to backers of the Darkest Dungeon board game. After <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mythic-games-files-liquidation-end-controversial-company" rel="nofollow">the collapse</a> of board game developer Mythic Games and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/darkest-dungeon-board-game-wont-ship-unless-backers-pony-up-more-money" rel="nofollow">failure to produce</a> the board game, the game files for its various elements will be released to its Kickstarter backers.</p><p>This development in the <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> board game came from a thread of social media posts by the official Darkest Dungeon accounts. The thread, later reposted on <a href="https://www.darkestdungeon.com/news/regarding-mythic-games-and-the-darkest-dungeon-board-game/" rel="nofollow">their website</a>, states that former Mythic employees reached out to the studio for permission to release the project files to everyone who backed the original campaign.</p><picture>

This is important since those files contained copyrighted material from the <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> videogame, which made releasing any of this material impossible without Red Hook Studio's consent.</p><p>If you were a backer for the <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> board game Kickstarter, you will receive an email explaining the situation. That email will contain a link to all files for the project, including artwork, game rules, 3D models, and more.</p><p>The thread ends with addressing a major question by fans. Why doesn't Red Hook just step in and finish the game's production themselves? The thread explains that Red Hook doesn't have expertise in board game manufacturing. In addition, the studio doesn't have enough funds to divert to such an endeavor without seriously endangering its own operations.</p><p>Overall, this development for the <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> board game is better than most failed projects. It is a shame that the Kickstarter, which was one of the most successful on the platform, with $5.6 million raised, didn't happen due to Mythic's myriad production problems. But having a way to make your own is a small comfort. Just don't think about selling it.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
