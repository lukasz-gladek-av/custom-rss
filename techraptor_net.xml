            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asmodee and streaming giant Netflix have inked another streaming deal. The tabletop giant has signed global rights for official Ticket to Ride movie and TV shows to the streaming platform, bringing even more potential cinematic board game adaptations.</p><p>According to an official press release, this Ticket to Ride movie and TV deal secures exclusive global rights to adapt the board game series into scripted and unscripted projects across film, TV, and additional formats.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>This deal is similar to another one struck by Asmodee and Netflix in October of 2025. That deal secured similar rights to another beloved Asmodee board game franchise, the resource-gathering social game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/netflix-catan-movie-and-tv-rights-secured-bringing-scavenging-and-diplomacy-to" rel="nofollow"><em>Catan</em></a>.</p><p>The press release confirms the first project under this deal will be an official <em>Ticket to Ride</em> movie. The film will be written by Ben Mekler (<em>Kipo and the Age of Wonderbeasts)</em> and Chris Amick (<em>Final Space</em>), and producers will include Asmodee's own Darren Kyman, Eric and Kim Tannenbaum, and Jonathan Levine and Gillian Bohrer.&nbsp;</p><p>This deal is another step in Netflix's more recent push for creating content out of recognizable board game IP. It aligns with deals to make streaming material out of the board game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/clue-tv-show-has-been-greenlit-by-netflix" rel="nofollow"><em>Clue</em></a> and <em>Catan</em>. It's also consistent with already produced tabletop game movies and shows such as <em>Exploding Kittens</em> and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/family_pack_2024" rel="nofollow"><em>Family Pack</em></a>, an adaptation of T<em>he Werewolves of Miller's Hollow</em>.</p><p>The Ticket to Ride movie deal with Netflix does raise the question: how would you adapt it. <em>Ticket to Ride</em> is a game where players compete to collect and connect various train routes through major cities, scoring points for completing routes. It's essentially a top-down competitive management experience, which is difficult to express in film which tends to err on human scale struggles.</p><p>There's also the fact that the importance of train routes and railways is very cultural and historical. Do you make it a period piece about the rise of the rail? If so, which country do you center on? Is the tone wondrous, in keeping with the board game's kid friendliness, or a more cynical take? Those are the challenges the screenwriters will need to address one way or another.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <guid>1438810</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/riftbound-origins-review-tcg-with-movement-strategy-im-in" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="70845ca1-ba9b-48fd-ae51-be30d1b4ed06" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>League of Legends</em> TCG</a> has now released its second set, expanding the number of Legends from <em>LoL</em> that you can let lead your deck alongside additional new mechanics. In our review of <em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em>, we'll take a look at some of the new mechanics and how they'll power a deck along with the new <em>Spiritforged </em>keywords and how they shift the battlefield.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Spiritforged </em>Equipment</h2><p dir="ltr">Equipment is a new type of gear card that has been added to <em>Spiritforged</em>. This Gear has a cost to be played, but then an additional cost to be equipped to your units.</p><p dir="ltr">Equipment opens up a whole new level of augmentation in <em>Riftbound </em>letting you take fighters that might have not quite been viable, but give them a chance to have their Might boosted or alter other elements of the card.</p><p dir="ltr">Equipment can give a Unit a few more Might to help them on the battlefield, additionally you can have equipment that will turn a Unit into a different type such as a mech. This kind of augmentation is extremely important for decks like the Rumble Champion Deck.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-spiritforged-set-review-equipment.jpg?itok=faNVTWyX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/riftbound-spiritforged-set-review-equipment.jpg?itok=AQSwl3us 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">I've gotten lost early on in a number of TCG because of how quickly new elements are added, and how quickly it invalidates any of the older cards. With equipment, not only are all cards getting an upgrade, but the changes that equipment can have on a card also open up a variety of possibilities where cards that wouldn't be viable before are now able to be played.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Spiritforged </em>New Keywords</h2><p dir="ltr">Five different Keywords have been added with <em>Spiritforged</em>. These expand the kinds of effects that cards will have as you play them, by keywording them they're faster to understand and respond to.</p><p dir="ltr">The first new Keyword is Echo, you'll see these appear on spell cards. The effect of Echo is that you can repeat the effect of a spell by paying an additional cost that's listed on the card. This is an easy way to let a spell have a standard level of effect in the early game, but as you build up more Runes, you're able to unleash more havoc with them as the game goes on.</p><p dir="ltr">In my few games playing with the effect, I loved the versatility of these cards and that by using them at different scales, you could do more or less with your turn. It wasn't a spell that was useful at the beginning of the game, but not impactful by the end of the game, and it also wasn't a card that felt useless in my hand if drawn too early.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-spiritforged-set-review-unique.jpg?itok=YVkI-bjN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">The second new Keyword is an interesting one, Unique. This card effect means that you can only have a single copy of the card in your deck. This effectively moved what other TCG might call a Restricted list into the Keywording on the card itself. It has the dual effect of meaning a player won't need to know the ins and outs of a ban-list to know if they've built their deck legally, alternatively a card with Unique as a Keyword is certain to immediately catch a player's eye, as they might come up with a strategy to unleash this powerful card.</p><p dir="ltr">The final three new Keywords that were introduced in <em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em> have to do with the new Equipment type; Quick-Draw, Equip, and Weaponmaster.</p><p dir="ltr">Equip has you simply paying the listed cost to attach a piece of equipment to a Unit, Quick-Draw lets that equipment as a reaction, attaching it to a unit you control immediately. These are keywords that define how to activate and equip your equipment.</p><p dir="ltr">The Weaponmaster Keyword is one that you'll find on Units. This lets you summon a unit and then attach equipment to it immediately, whether it's in your base or attached to a different unit for one recycle less than the cost listed on the card.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/riftbound-spiritforged-set-review-battlegrounds.jpg?itok=9krrPVpV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">I am a big fan of the equipment mechanic, but also the different speeds you can implement for getting Equipment on the field, and in the hands of your Units. It was also incredibly helpful that, outside of playing and equipping these cards normally, you could either have it react faster with an ability of the equipment or an ability of a Unit. This gives a healthy level of flexibility when building your deck around equipment and how to best get it onto your field.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How Has <em>Riftbound </em>Evolved?</h2><p dir="ltr">The aspect of Spiritforged that I think I'm most excited about is that elements have been added to the game, adding powerful but Unique cards and involving equipment to augment your current cards, but overall it hasn't invalidated the <em>Riftbound </em>cards from the initial set.</p><p dir="ltr">So often I watch new TCG sets release where a new set means everything prior is out sped or overpowered by new cards coming out.<em> Riftbound Spiritforged</em> feels like it has instead elevated the whole game, meaning you can take your old deck and make slight changes and bring it into competition with the latest cards instead of having to completely remix your approach to the game.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p dir="ltr"><em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em> is an evolution of the formula. There are more Legends, and more permutations on how you can approach building a deck with new mechanics, but nothing you previously had is left in the dust.</p><p dir="ltr">If you want to continue to play your favorite deck and Legend, you can use this set to introduce Equipment to have them hit harder, or substitute cards in with new abilities without invalidating all of the cards you already own.</p><p dir="ltr">The flip side of this is that there really are so many different Legends with different abilities that if there wasn't a strategy that was previously speaking to you, there probably is now.</p><p dir="ltr">The biggest issue I still have with pulling booster packs of Riftbound is how few Runes you receive, and how many Battlegrounds you get instead. Especially when trying to start your initial Rune collection it can be rough to see so few come out of packs.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Riftbound Spritforged was reviewed with cards provided by the publisher</strong></em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/mtg-lorwyn-eclipsed-designers-talk-bringing-back-classic</link>
            <guid>1438762</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Since last month's release of the latest <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>set, Lorwyn Eclipsed, we've been busy blighting our goblins, turning our merfolk sideways, and spending <em>way</em> too much mana on Elementals. But I wanted to know what went into the design of the set, so I got the chance to chat with a few folks from the design team - read on for our interview about the creation of Lorwyn Eclipsed.</p><h2>Flavor First?</h2><p>I've heard the design team talk a lot in the past about designing cards that are either "flavor first" or "mechanics first," and I wanted to know which of these approaches was easier to build around, and how they approached this set.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorwyn-eclipsed-artwork-elf.jpg?itok=cOLhe5pX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lorwyn-eclipsed-artwork-elf.jpg?itok=0IdyH3GU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>"It depends on the set," explains Mark Gottlieb, Principal Game Designer. "For example, returning to Kamigawa was more of a flavor-driven design - there was a pretty deep trope space to work with, plus the concept of tradition vs futurism led to a lot of designs."</p><blockquote><p>The mechanical core of Lorwyn and Shadowmoor ... is very solid and pretty universal...</p></blockquote><p>But as for Lorwyn, Gottlieb explains that the original set was inspired by Celtic folklore, which - while exuding a distinct vibe, didn't offer up a deep well of concrete tropes to play with. "The mechanical core of Lorwyn and Shadowmoor, though—typal, hybrid, color-matters—is very solid and pretty universal," Gottlieb explains, "So I’d say Lorwyn Eclipsed was much more of a mechanic-driven design."</p><h2>What Stays, What Goes</h2><p>When bringing a set as beloved as Lorwyn back for the first time, it must have been difficult to decide what elements were important to implement vs. what could get left behind. "The question we asked ourselves," Gottlieb continues, "is 'What is definitional about Lorwyn?' And the same for Shadowmoor. What do people immediately think of as the identity of those sets?"</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorwyn-eclipsed-artwork-goblins.jpg?itok=Hqo5sLY_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lorwyn-eclipsed-artwork-goblins.jpg?itok=pgkDXuK6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>Gottlieb says they ran an exercise of dissecting the original sets into their component parts, slicing them up into "Must have," "Nice to have," and "Don't need" categories. "The 'Must have' group," Gottlieb explains, "was mostly filled with broad mechanical space, like typal, hybrid, and -1/-1 counters. Most of the original keywords, though, like clash, reinforce, and conspire, didn’t carry the same weight."</p><h2>Aging Like A Fine Kithkin Wine</h2><p>Next I wanted to know in which ways, when designing the new set, did the team "feel the age" of the original Lorwyn block. Were there any mechanics, original designs, etc. that felt like they needed a serious update? &nbsp;</p><p>"A lot of the original keywords weren’t particularly inspiring and played a bit clunky," admits Gottlieb. "But we didn’t really think about the set in terms of 'Ugh, what do we have to fix?' The thought process was much more along the lines of 'What new and exciting things can we create out of the original sets’ elements that meet the moment for modern Magic?'"</p><blockquote><p>A lot of the original keywords weren’t particularly inspiring and played a bit clunky...</p></blockquote><p>"Blight uses -1/-1 counters in a new, proactive way. Vivid takes advantage of hybrid in a way we haven’t before. We’d never had the opportunity to mash up Lorwyn and Shadowmoor elements before, since the story had previously kept them separate from one another." Gottlieb says that mindset gave the team the opportunity to come up with a whole new cycle of Elemental Incarnations, "as well as a new take on “champion” that takes advantage of newfangled 'behold' technology."</p><h2>Saying Goodbye To The Block</h2><p>To that end, I wondered if there were any challenges that came from designing this set as a single release, when we had a whole block with the setting the last time we visited Lorwyn.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lorwyn-eclipsed-artwork.jpg?itok=c7zM2l9v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p>"Yes, absolutely," Gottlieb replies. "It’s like two friends that each live in a two-story house and move into a condo together. A lot of the furniture has to go. But the competition for space was a crucible, in a way. Only the best stuff could stay. Everything in the set had to earn its spot."</p><blockquote><p>It’s like two friends that each live in a two-story house and move into a condo together. A lot of the furniture has to go.</p></blockquote><p>Gottlieb went on to describe a particular challenge in their design, which was the fact the the mechanical spaces Lorwyn Eclipsed focuses on (creature types matter, color matters), involve, as he puts it, "universal elements among <em>Magic</em> cards. Just about every creature card has both color and creature types, but they don’t really speak to one another, and keeping track of eight creature types and five colors across your board state can be burdensome. So it was certainly difficult to balance the focus between those two pillars of the design."</p><h2>Getting The Band Back Together</h2><p>With a set with this kind of legacy, I was curious if any of the original designers came back for this set. "Yes, multiple designers overlapped the original sets and the new one," explains Gottlieb. "I was the Vision Design lead for Lorwyn Eclipsed, and I was the Rules Manager during Lorwyn, and was a member of the Shadowmoor design team."&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p>"Mark Rosewater worked on all five Lorwyn-based sets. Aaron Forsythe, Doug Beyer, Erik Lauer, and Mike Turian were involved in both the old and the new. But all the newer designers who contributed to Lorwyn Eclipsed have a respect for the original material and were excited to delve into a part of Magic’s history. And the Worldbuilding team did a spectacular job immersing us into the setting, which really helped everyone zero in on the tone we wanted to capture."</p><blockquote><p>All the newer designers who contributed to Lorwyn Eclipsed have a respect for the original material and were excited to delve into a part of Magic’s history.</p></blockquote><p>Finally, I closed out my questions with my classic ender: Do you have a favorite card from the new set? Is there a card you don't think is getting enough attention yet that you think will be a powerful addition to limited, constructed, or Commander?</p><p>To this, Jadine Klomparens, Principal Game Designer chimed in. "I really like Mutable Explorer and think there’s a lot of potential for it to show up in strategies that are interested in ramp or low opportunity cost changelings, or both!" I agree - Mutable Explorer's one of my favorite cards in the set!</p><picture>
