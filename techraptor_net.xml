It isn't a retro-throwback like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-pixel-perfect-secret-lair-brings-retro-vibes-to-table" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pixel Perfect</a> or a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-secret-lair-chaos-vault-previews-psychedelic-land-cards" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Chaos Vault</a> drop. No, this is a <em>Spongebob</em> Secret Lair, bringing one of the most iconic cartoon characters in the world to the popular card game.</p>

<h2>The <em>Spongebob</em> Secret Lair Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://collider.com/spongebob-magic-the-gathering-special-secret-lair-images/" rel="nofollow">Collider</a>, the Spongebob Secret Lair will be broken up into three different drops. Each of these drops will be available for purchase on March 24 in both non-foil (MSRP $29.99) and foil (MSRP $ 39.99) bundles respectively.</p>

These cards are reimaginings of classic Magic: The Gathering cards. Those cards are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Jodah, the Unifier</em> as "Spongebob Squarepants"</li>
	<li>Charix, the Raging Isle as "Mr. Krabs, Penny Pincher"</li>
	<li><em>Skrelv, Defector Mite</em> as "Plankton, Tiny Tyrant"</li>
	<li><em>Granzilaxx, Illithid Scholar</em> as "Squidward, Sarcastic Snob"</li>
	<li><em>Toxril, The Corrosive</em> as "Gary, The Snail"</li>
	<li><em>Barktooth Warbeard</em> as "Patrick Star"</li>
	<li><em>Toski, Bearer of Secrets</em> as "Sandy Cheeks, Martial Astronaut"</li>
</ul><p>The reskin choices here are humorous. Gary The Snail as a 7/7 creature that can spawn snail tokens and drop poison tokens is such a jarring departure from the lovable mollusk. Patrick Star is just a 6/5 creature with just the flavor text, "I don't get it..." which is spot on.</p>

This drop features classic Magic cards with Spongebob artwork inspired by internet memes. Counterspell showing Spongebob in a mocking chicken pose. Night's Whisper sporting a close-up of Squidward's face with bloodshot eyes. If you've been online long enough, you've seen these images.</p>

As the name implies, this drop contains a number of land cards sporting locations from Spongebob's underwater home of Bikini Bottom courtesy of artist Jon Vermilyea.</p>

<p><em>Spongebob Squarepants</em> is the longest running children's cartoon on Nickelodeon. Debuting in 1999, the show has run for 15 seasons alongside five animated feature films.</p>
