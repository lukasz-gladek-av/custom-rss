            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atlus has released the first ever official music video for a song from the&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>series, and the video sets one of&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>'s most iconic battle themes to a very thematically relevant visual element.</p>

<p>The video is for the battle theme "It's Going Down Now", which plays whenever the party gets the drop on an enemy in the Tartarus dungeon in&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>. If you're anything like me, that means you'll be hearing the song hundreds of times over the course of your time with the game.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release, "It's Going Down Now" is the most-streamed song from the&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>soundtrack on Spotify, having built up over 100 million plays. It makes sense, then, that this was the song chosen for the series' first music video.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-3-reload-music-video-battle.jpg?itok=HVo2nqiA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-3-reload-music-video-battle.jpg?itok=2wf_ubTj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Persona</em>'s first ever music video is for a battle theme from&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The track was created specifically for&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>; it doesn't have an equivalent in the original&nbsp;<em>Persona 3</em>, which simply uses the equally iconic "Mass Destruction" as its general battle theme. That song still plays in&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, but only for battles in which you don't have the advantage.</p>

<p>The music video for "It's Going Down Now" sees rapper Lotus Juice and singer Azumi Takahashi performing in front of&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>'s famous Tartarus steps, which lead up to the dungeon proper. The video is also interspersed with other visuals you'll recognize if you're a&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>fan.</p>

<p>You can check out the music video for "It's Going Down Now" in its entirety right here. If you've played the game, it's a great opportunity to hear the song for that extra-special thousand-and-first time.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-3-reload-persona-5-tactica-leaked-by-atlus-itself" rel="nofollow">a remake</a> of Atlus' cult hit JRPG&nbsp;<em>Persona 3</em>&nbsp;that boasts all-new visuals, gameplay improvements, and a rearranged soundtrack.</p>

<p>The game proved a success for publisher Sega and developer Atlus, having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-3-reload-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">racked up two million sales</a> around the world at last count. A remake of its successor,&nbsp;<em>Persona 4</em>, was announced during this year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">Xbox summer showcase</a>.</p>
