            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-year-of-eevee-merchandise<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has designated 2025 as the "Year of Eevee", promising tons of Eevee-themed merchandise throughout the year including plushies, TCG sets, figurines, and much more.</p>

<p>Over on the UK version of the Pokemon Center <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/year-of-eevee" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>&nbsp;(with the promo likely also on its way to the US website soon), the company promises "a year of Eevee products" as a gift for those who "love Eevee". Who doesn't?</p>

<p>The site goes on to say that "from plush to apparel,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>to figures, you won't be short on Eevee merch this year". True to its word, the site then spotlights a number of existing plushies, toys, and pins themed around Eevee and its evolutions (or Eeveelutions).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-center-year-of-eevee-listings.jpg?itok=qY6xd3Bn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-center-year-of-eevee-listings.jpg?itok=WoNLmx1t 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Year of Eevee is already well and truly underway on the Pokemon Center website.</figcaption></figure><p>Further down, the Pokemon Center site looks forward to Eevee merchandise that's coming later this year, including "a new series of beautifully-crafted Evolving Personalities figures" based on Eeveelutions.</p>

<p>They include the Splashes Vaporeon figure, the Skillful Strategy Jolteon figure, and the Satisfied Snooze Flareon figure, with several more based on the remaining Eeveelutions coming later on.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a new kind of plushie that features "the most cozy, fleecy material", and as you've probably guessed, Eevee will be one of the options for that plushie, although you can also pick up Pikachu if you like.</p>

<p>All of this is, of course, in addition to the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-brings-eevee-and-its-many-forms-to-scarlet-violet" rel="nofollow"><em>Prismatic Evolutions&nbsp;</em>set</a> for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG</em>, which launches next week and revolves mainly around Eevee and its evolutions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-center-year-of-eevee-prismatic-evolutions.jpg?itok=j7zmhfec 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-center-year-of-eevee-prismatic-evolutions.jpg?itok=1mYb5EEQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Prismatic Evolutions&nbsp;</em>set will be heavily themed around Eevee.</figcaption></figure><p>All of this Eevee-related excitement comes as speculation regarding the upcoming Nintendo Switch successor mounts. Nintendo has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">promised an announcement</a> before April this year, so it's very possible the new console could be revealed this month.</p>

<p>In February, a new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends&nbsp;</em>game in the form of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced" rel="nofollow">was revealed</a>, and we still don't have a concrete release date for that. Additionally, mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games have been released every three years since 2013, so we could be due an announcement on that front soon as well.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that given that 2025 is now apparently the Year of Eevee, and given all of the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em> news we might reasonably expect this year, we could finally be in for a new Eeveelution being revealed soon. Let's hope so!</p>
