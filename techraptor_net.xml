            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="25b964ba-1595-45a4-84b1-e7d705f5dc6c" href="https://techraptor.net/games/astrobotanica" rel="nofollow"><em>Astrobotanica</em></a>&nbsp;is an indie survival title being developed by&nbsp;Space Goblin Studio. Funded through a Kickstarter campaign, the title offers a relaxing survival experience during the prehistoric era of Earth. Playing as an alien named Xel, you have the technology to scan plants, animals, and cavemen, create various tonics that can cure illnesses, decrease air needs, and more. I've been interested in the game since I first heard about the Kickstarter campaign and jumped at the chance to dive into the demo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The bulk of the demo consists of scanning different plants to learn what they do, interacting with one caveman named Ube, and solving puzzles. It gives a relatively well-rounded feel of what&nbsp;<em>Astrobotanica</em>&nbsp;offers to the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="taxonomy_term" data-entity-uuid="a90d9136-1388-4f79-8f46-10943fc6369d" href="https://techraptor.net/genre/survival" rel="nofollow">survival genre</a> mechanics wise. You scan plants and animals to see what they are. Scanning Neanderthals allows you to see what their current health status is. Interacting with them gives you to the chance to heal them and learn their language. Plants have different properties raw and when made into a tonic, with tonic making being a frequent action for surviving.&nbsp;</p>

From collecting trophies to put in specific places, using plant juices, or pushing orbs found in ruins to their correct position, the puzzles stand out as one of the interesting parts of the game. Not only were there multiple things to solve, all of the puzzles were different. If this variety is kept up in the complete version it will give&nbsp;<em>Astrobotanica</em>&nbsp;the ability to stand out amongst competitors that have 2-3 puzzle layouts that repeat with various difficulty through those titles.</p>

<h2>Lacking a Hook</h2>

<p>While most of the game mechanics are well explained, there is zero story tying game aspects together. Why are you on this planet? Why do you want to heal Neanderthals? What is your name? The only way you find out what you're called or your appearance is from the P.R.I.M.A.L. tab. Besides that, there's little else to really give you a reason to do, well, anything. If you don't watch any trailers, read the in-depth Steam page description, or skim through news about&nbsp;<em>Astrobotanica</em>, you have no idea what the game is about. What is the over-arcing goal that you're meant to work towards?</p>

<p>Hopefully the lack of narrative is due to the demo being a small sample of the early access version.&nbsp;<em>Astrobotanica</em>&nbsp;is supposed to be rich with lore, and hints of that are present. You can find different idols and stone tablets while exploring the demo area. However, what they represent or say, and even where they are stored in your inventory, are mysteries.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/juice-puzzle-astrobotanica.jpg?itok=jNAgGHYc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/juice-puzzle-astrobotanica.jpg?itok=-9Pc0FlH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Regardless of missing narrative, there is a quest tracker that updates as you complete various tasks. These include scanning a plant, making a tonic, and healing Ube. There's no real draw to it, though. No fanfare is made when an objective is complete. It's not the biggest issue, but being reminded that a task changed and you're focusing on something else certainly helps streamline the quest cycle.</p>

<p>Other missing items include map markers on the map or being able to put a marker on the map. Even when you buy the P.R.I.M.A.L. HUD upgrade, the map remains unchanged and pretty much useless since you'll be using the HUD compass for all your navigation needs. Since you only have access to the first level of upgrades, map markers could be listed later on.&nbsp;</p>

Many open-world survival games have building as one of the big draws to playing. You can design your own camp, create an epic castle, grow massive gardens, etc. The same can be said for this game based on the Kickstarter information. When it comes to the demo, you can't do any building aside from placing garden plots in the demo. You can see some structures you'll be able to construct in the future, but can't actually place them in the world, even if you do unlock the plan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game struggled as I continued to play. By the time I wrapped up my three hour session, it was consistently lagging, sluggish to load areas as I moved around, and put excess strain on my PC. This is a concern for players on older computers and those that like long gaming sessions.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Astrobotanica</em>&nbsp;may have a unique premise and story that is ready to set it apart from the competition, but with no narrative present in the demo and lacking many staple mechanics of the survival genre, it's hard to see it. Open world survival crafting games are extremely popular, with titles like&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="72a14f4d-4d77-4ace-a3aa-09008b8c98bf" href="https://techraptor.net/games/palworld" rel="nofollow">Palworld</a>,</em>&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="294eedd9-16ba-4c31-9a65-967aeca4d3fc" href="https://techraptor.net/games/enshrouded" rel="nofollow"><em>Enshrouded</em></a>, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5840301c-ab91-4d31-a561-7a7d64d82464" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/dune-awakening-interview-art-directors-gavin-whelan-and-david-levy" rel="nofollow"><em>Dune: Awakening</em></a>, and <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fbd23abe-125c-4cba-8afc-994aaf0735ef" href="https://techraptor.net/games/rust" rel="nofollow">Rust</a>.</em>&nbsp;It's a competitive niche to launch a game in.</p>

<p>Many of these smaller issues could be in development and were simply unready for the demo. Nonetheless, playing the demo didn't hook me. There was no story to grab my attention, and the mechanics present weren't unique enough to keep me wanting more.</p>
