            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has revealed that this year marks its "largest investment" in the Xbox Game Pass subscription service to date, so it's clear the company isn't too fazed by discussions around whether the service is good for developers or not.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-xboxs-increasingly-vital-indie-publishing-operation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, Xbox indie boss Chris Charla confirms that 2025 has seen the biggest investment in Game Pass in the service's history, and he also reveals that Xbox has "signed deals with more than 150 partners to expand the catalog".</p>

<p>Charla says that "the majority" of studios whose games have been included as part of Game Pass "want to bring their future titles to the service", too, so the somewhat ambivalent buzz doesn't seem to be deterring developers who've got experience with the platform either.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, former Bethesda exec Pete Hines said subscription services were "worth jack shit" without companies making the effort to "figure out how to balance the needs of the service" with those who are "providing the content".</p>

<p>PlayStation boss Shawn Layden appeared to agree, linking Hines' comments on social media platform LinkedIn and asking whether subscription services were "healthy and helpful" for those who make games.</p>

<p>Layden's comments drew agreement <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-shannon-loftis-comments" rel="nofollow">from former Xbox VP Shannon Loftis</a>, who added that game adoption on Game Pass "comes at the expense of retail revenue" and that the service creates "weird inner tensions" among developers.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Borderlands 4 Sales Reach 2.5m as Revenue Climbs]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-sales-revenue</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-sales-reach-2-5m-as-revenue-climbs.1304256/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to new sales data,&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>has racked up quite a few sales for itself since launching earlier in September, and it's making a pretty tidy packet for its developer and publisher as well.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/borderlands-4-amasses-over-25m-players-since-launch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, data firm Alinea Analytics says that&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>has sold over 2.5 million copies since it was released on September 12th, resulting in revenues exceeding $150 million. That's a pretty impressive set of figures.</p>

<p>Alinea's data claims that around 1.3 million of the game's sales were on PC via Steam, and that over a million players have picked up&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>on both console platforms on which it's available. Honestly, that's a much more even split than I was expecting.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/borderlands-4-sales-shooting.jpg?itok=uV9qzfHf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/borderlands-4-sales-shooting.jpg?itok=cH0_nZ62 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>has sold pretty well.</figcaption></figure><p>If you want some demographic breakdowns, Alinea has those as well. Over half of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s player base on PC is based in the US, and the next most popular regions are China, Germany, the UK, and Canada.</p>

<p>However, on PS5, the story is a little different. Again, more than half of the game's players on PS5 are in the US, followed by the UK, Germany, France, and Canada. Alinea doesn't provide data for Xbox Series X|S players.</p>

<p>According to Alinea's data, 59% of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>players on PC played&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/borderlands-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Borderlands 2</em></a>, while 55% played&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/borderlands-3" rel="nofollow">Borderlands 3</a>&nbsp;</em>and just 22% played the spinoff title&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tiny-tinas-wonderlands" rel="nofollow"><em>Tiny Tina's Wonderlands</em></a>.</p>

<p>Those figures are higher on PlayStation; as Alinea points out, previous&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>games have been made available as part of PlayStation Plus, so 81% of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s player base on the console has checked out&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 3</em>.</p>




<p><em>Borderlands 4</em>'s strong sales performance comes despite widespread criticism of the game's performance on PC, which prompted Gearbox head Randy Pitchford to launch into an impassioned (and lengthy) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/randy-pitchford-borderlands-4-performance-comments" rel="nofollow">defense of his game on social media</a>.</p>

<p>Despite Pitchford's comments, 2K and Gearbox have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-pc-performance-top-priority" rel="nofollow">pledged to improve the game's PC version</a>, calling it their "top priority". Presumably, doing so will lead to even more sales for them.</p>
