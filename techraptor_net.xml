            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wuchang-fallen-feathers-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Leenzee and publisher 505 Games have announced the release date for upcoming China-set Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, and it's adding to what will already be a pretty stacked summer.</p>

<p>Per a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/498319683381887449" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the game will be launching on July 24th across PC and current-gen consoles. It joins the likes of shooter&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-release-date" rel="nofollow">RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business</a>&nbsp;</em>and cozy hobbit life sim&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-shire-delayed-july" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of the Shire</em></a>.</p>

<p>As is customary for modern games, pre-ordering&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>will also get you some extra goodies. You'll receive two outfits, a new weapon, and a Glistening Mercury upgrade item if you place your order before the game's launch.</p>

This guy, on the other hand, looks like he's landing a lot sooner than that.</figcaption></figure><p>A Deluxe Edition of&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>will also be available, and it'll net you four more outfits and four weapons, as well as a Blood of Changhong skill upgrade item. Of course, you'll be able to obtain plenty of those items throughout your journey, but it's nice to have a headstart.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, it's a Soulslike action RPG set in the Shu kingdom during the late Ming dynasty. You'll play as the titular Wuchang, a pirate "struck by amnesia" who must contend both with her uncertain past and a horrific disease known as the Feathering.</p>

<p>Along the way, you'll face "grotesque abominations", explore "forgotten temples" and "overgrown ruins", and "piece together Wuchang's lost memories". It all sounds pretty much par for the course when it comes to Soulslikes.</p>

<p>You can check out a new trailer for&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, which shows off a rather unsettling boss by the name of the Perfect Bride, right here.</p>




<p><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10005853" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/wuchang-fallen-feathers/9nprhd8gqkqs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on July 24th. It'll also be available as part of a Game Pass subscription if you're signed up to the PC or Ultimate tiers.</p>
