            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hobbits from J.R.R. Tolkien's <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> universe, Middle-earth, have what could be the coziest lifestyle ever created, and <em>Tales of the Shire</em> attempts to bring that relaxation to the masses with one of the most relaxing, play-at-your-own-pace games to release in a while.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the calm and surprisingly deep atmosphere, fun yet simple gameplay loops, and in-depth customization are held back from shining like the star it should be in a few unfortunate areas.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Hobbits are creatures who spend their days with life’s simplest comforts, and they’re incredibly fond of food. Players start the game as a new Hobbit in an area called Bywater, an already-established part of the Shire.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-by-the-river.jpg?itok=i95Tr6NB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-by-the-river.jpg?itok=76neaal- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nature is beautiful and bountiful in&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire</em>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>After they arrive in Bywater, preparations begin to try to establish the area as its own Village. To do this, an appraiser will need to verify its status. This results in a variety of different quests and, ultimately, waiting around.&nbsp;</p>

<p>During this, players are able to grow closer to the other Hobbits through cooking and hosting meals. To prepare for these meals, players have to forage, fish, and farm for ingredients.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Tales of the Shire</em> Cooking Is a Cut Above</h2>

<p>Cooking is easily the focal point of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="40e0d549-a81e-46b9-9977-4f4a7267b6d2" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/tales-of-shire-preview-delicious-delight" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of the Shire</em></a>, and its depth attests to that. Everything from picking combinations of flavors and seasonings in ingredients to using a variety of kitchen tools to achieve the perfect texture is satisfying, especially when you finally achieve exactly what you’re trying to make seasoned to perfection.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cooking-in-tales-of-the-shire_0.jpg?itok=rX8TQ0Fu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cooking-in-tales-of-the-shire_0.jpg?itok=bujPXldJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cooking in&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>includes balancing different flavors and textures to create the best meal you can.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, the meal sharing isn’t as straightforward as it should be. What should happen is that players write letters to Hobbits to invite them to a meal. The next day, the Hobbit will write back what they’re craving that day for a meal, and players make the meal and start the event whenever they want during the day.</p>

<p>As a reward for a meal well done, Hobbits will share recipes with the player.</p>

<p>However, there was a problem that caused the game to crash after most of the meals I tried to host that weren’t part of the main story. To get around it, I had to ignore the meals that I planned, which ended up with some Hobbits who are surprisingly good at holding grudges.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The developers are working on ironing out problems before <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d2f5f5b9-19dc-4f88-ba82-0aecd6ac2014" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/tales-of-shire-preview" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of the Shire</em></a> launches, so this could be solved by the time the game is released. However, it was something that had a pretty big impact on reviewing the game since I couldn’t get too close to the other Hobbits or unlock as many recipes.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-mealtime.jpg?itok=AlYjN6od 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-mealtime.jpg?itok=EHbQgHFs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sharing meals with other Hobbits in&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire</em>&nbsp;should be a fun experience, though bugs made it a feature I could barely use.</figcaption></figure><p>Besides that, the cooking system sets the tone of the game well. Yes, Hobbits have cravings and want specific flavors, but <em>Tales of the Shire</em> isn’t about perfection. The Hobbits of Bywater are happy to have a meal together, so long as they don’t hate the food, so things don’t have to be perfect.</p>

<p>It’s a small nod to the fact that nothing in <em>Tales of the Shire</em> asks for perfection and rigid solutions. Everything in the game is fluid and requires little to no hustling, and players get to see this from the very start. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Foraging, Fishing, and Farming Are Also Well Done</h2>

<p>While it’s hard to get too excited about foraging every single day, <em>Tales of the Shire</em> makes it surprisingly easy and entertaining enough. Traveling around the map for missions (whether you’re skipping around or walking at a relaxing pace) means passing by quite a few&nbsp;ingredients. It’s very easy to pick these up as you go.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fishing-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=tn_lF1Dk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fishing-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=TosMcuS9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>fishing is easier than in many similar games, but complex enough to keep players interested.</figcaption></figure><p>Fishing is also pretty relaxing. The actual fishing minigame isn’t too difficult, but it’s just hard enough to make sure the player needs to pay attention. Compared to other games in the genre, it’s a balance that works well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Farming in <em>Tales of the Shire</em> is a bit more in-depth than the other systems. Growing plants vary by season, like most farming-sim players would expect. However, a unique twist comes with how plants are grouped.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Planting can be done freely in various farming spots. By planting an assortment of plants that get along with each other, players can speed up the process and harvest higher-quality plants.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Hobbit Holes Are Truly the Coziest Homes</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/home-customization-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=O6zLwY4P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/home-customization-in-tales-of-the-shire.jpg?itok=usktinAu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There are quite a few gorgeous home customization option in&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire</em>, like these planters and ceiling wallpaper.</figcaption></figure><p>Part of living the Hobbit life is living in a Hobbit hole. In <em>Tales of the Shire</em>, the player’s Hobbit hole can be customized in a near-endless way. Players can tailor every part of the home to their desires, including minute details like the rafters, the transitional flooring, and the chandeliers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As you play more, the home expands until the Hobbit hole is a sprawling burrow.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of it all, there’s a ton of furniture to gather from other Hobbits and from the furniture store in town. Not only is it all pretty stylish, but it can be placed and rotated freely in the home. This includes furniture for outside and the gardening areas, too.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, the furniture comes from around Middle-earth. Finding various Mirkwood pieces for my Hobbit home was a pleasant surprise, and it felt like small easter eggs for Middle-earth lovers.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Max Relaxation Doesn’t Fit Everyone’s Playstyle, Though</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-thinking-bubbles.jpg?itok=cTt58TOu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-the-shire-thinking-bubbles.jpg?itok=9S8_TRyC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The writing in&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>was as quirky as one would expect from Hobbits.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Tales of the Shire</em> capitalizes on the fact that some people want to sit back with a game and relax. There are very few time constraints – even the events of each day aren’t dictated by times – and players can take everything slowly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In fact, it’s easy to feel like you’re playing a waiting game. However, the bigger idea is to slow down and enjoy the small parts of the game, which is truly the way of the Hobbits with foraging, farming, and fishing (and, of course, cooking).&nbsp;</p>

<p>In that regard, <em>Tales of the Shire</em> really shines. It truly feels like you’re living the life of a Hobbit. Things like quirky dialogue and random events players can run into while running around the map are really well done.</p>

<p>However, this is held back by a few things. Beyond quests, it’s almost pointless to interact with NPCs at random. Players can talk to some NPCs at random, but there are no interactions and no meaningful dialogue that happens by doing so. It made the actual Hobbits feel a bit hollow.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bywater-villagers-in-tales-of-the-shire_0.jpg?itok=4rHBwr9_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bywater-villagers-in-tales-of-the-shire_0.jpg?itok=jGWmnZV0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The villagers in&nbsp;<em>Tales of the Shire&nbsp;</em>have potential, but they're hollow shells unless they're talking in the main story.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s also held back by several crashing problems. Talking to different Hobbits just to turn in quests would crash the game more often than not. This problem is supposed to be resolved before launch, but it’s worth noting that it caused a significant problem for me.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Tales of the Shire Needs Work, But Has a Solid Foundation</h2>

<p>Overall, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d95816c7-fd28-4045-9e01-20d255217d3c" href="https://techraptor.net/games/tales-of-shire" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of the Shire</em></a> offers a niche, yet lovely, experience if you can get past the bugs and you enjoy a more fluid, cozy gaming experience. For those who love Hobbits or Middle-earth, it’s a wonderful, cozy game that expands on the calm lifestyle of Hobbits.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There is a lot to enjoy, from the core gameplay to the small details like dialogue. However, it’s easy to feel dragged down by the larger stability problems.&nbsp;</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation's Wireless Fight Stick Officially Named FlexStrike, Launching 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-wireless-fight-stick-flexstrike</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstations-wireless-fight-stick-officially-named-flexstrike-launching-2026.1255146/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PlayStation has revealed the name and release window of its upcoming wireless arcade fight stick: it's called the FlexStrike, and it's launching sometime next year.</p>

<p>The FlexStrike was first revealed under the codename Project Defiant back at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-state-of-play-june-2025-recap" rel="nofollow">this year's summer State of Play</a>, but it's now shedding its development moniker. What's more, Sony has revealed more about what you can actually expect from the peripheral.</p>

<p>It'll be compatible with both PS5 and PC, and you'll be able to use it with both via a wired connection or wirelessly (using the included PlayStation Link adapter, of course).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/playstation-flexstrike-fight-stick-blue-background.jpg?itok=HXRoyRYy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/playstation-flexstrike-fight-stick-blue-background.jpg?itok=NccehqMO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The FlexStrike is coming sometime next year.</figcaption></figure><p>On the technical side, you can expect "mechanical switch buttons and toolless swappable restrictor gates", which include "square, circle, and octagon restrictor gates" you can slot into the storage compartments alongside the aforementioned PlayStation Link adapter.</p>

<p>You'll be able to hook both the FlexStrike and a Pulse 3D headset, or the Pulse Explore earbuds, up to your PS5 using a single PS Link adapter, and you can even connect two FlexStrikes up with the same adapter if you want to battle alongside (or against) a friend.</p>

<p>If you're not looking to use the FlexStrike to wander through game menus, you can keep your PS5 controller connected while you're using it, and since the FlexStrike features the same button inputs as a DualSense, you can probably use it as a standard controller as well, if you're so inclined.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer showing off what the FlexStrike can do and what kind of aesthetic it's sporting (hint: it's pretty similar to the PS5's design) right here.</p>




<p>If you're lucky enough to be attending Evo in Vegas next month, you'll be able to get a first look at the FlexStrike. The rest of us will have to wait until 2026, and we'll presumably learn more about pricing and release dates in the coming months.</p>
