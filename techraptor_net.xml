            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/overwatch-2-street-fighter-6-collab<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard and Capcom have announced an<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em><em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>collaboration, bringing some of the latter's most iconic characters into the hero shooter.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you won't actually be able to play as the&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>fighters themselves; rather, they'll be arriving in the form of skins for&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em>characters, with the skins roughly corresponding to the hero that best matches the&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>character.</p>

<p>The trailer shows off a Dhalsim skin for Zenyatta, a Guile look for Soldier: 76, a Blanka skin for Winston, and a Juno look for Chun-Li, plus Widowmaker cosplaying as Cammy and a few others besides. It's all kicking off on May 20th.</p>

<ul><li>Winston - Blanka</li>
	<li>Kiriko - Juri</li>
	<li>Zenyatta - Dhalsim</li>
	<li>Hanzo - Ryu</li>
	<li>Juno - Chun-Li</li>
	<li>Widowmaker - Cammy</li>
	<li>Soldier: 76 - Guile</li>
	<li>Sigma - M. Bison</li>
</ul><p>As far as we know, these are all of the skins that are debuting as part of the&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2 Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>collaboration, although there might be a few fun extras to grab, like emotes or other goodies.</p>

<p>We also don't know what the skins will actually look like in-game, although we do get to see Hanzo as Ryu at the end of the trailer. Granted, he's not actually taking part in a match, but hey - it's better than nothing.</p>




<p>This is far from&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2</em>'s first crossover. The game has stepped outside of its own lore in the past to team up with the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/overwatch-2-season-7-reveals-diablo-4-crossover-tons-of-skins-new-map-hero-reworks" rel="nofollow">fellow Blizzard stablemate&nbsp;<em>Diablo IV</em></a>, anime&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/overwatch-2-celebrates-one-punch-man-collaboration-release-with-new-trailer" rel="nofollow"><em>One Punch Man</em></a>, and, er, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/overwatch-2-reveals-collaboration-with-k-pop-group-le-sserafim" rel="nofollow">K-pop band Le Sserafim</a>. Well, why not, eh?</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out the&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>skins in&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em>when they launch on May 20th across all platforms on which Blizzard's hero shooter is available.</p>
