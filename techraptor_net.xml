            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Enter the depths of <em>Abyssus </em>with friends in this co-op shooter that has you exploring the ruins of an ancient, sunken civilization. Through attempt after attempt, learn more about the civilization, improve your character and loadout, and try to survive to the end.</p>

<p><em>Abyssus </em>is a dieselpunk co-op shooter that you can play with up to four friends, or that you can just as easily run yourself. The gameplay loop is simple but addictive. You'll descend into the ruins in a massive diving bell and emerge on a floor. Each floor is linear and filled with rooms where you'll be forced into combat with the strange, ancient, yet mechanical enemies that call this place home. After the forces of a room are wiped out, the door forward will open, and you'll continue.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abyssus-review-death.jpg?itok=fYa8yE6E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abyssus-review-death.jpg?itok=8ZI33Kem 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Every two floors, you'll find alternating mini-bosses and bosses, but it's quite simply your main goal to get as far as you can, gather resources, and then do it all over again.</p>

<p>There's an interesting level of variety in the rooms and their contents that you'll come across. At its base form, there are a few set rooms that are pre-generated and then filled with a random assortment of enemies in waves.</p>

<p>Additional objectives also randomly occur that focus on room-based objectives, like holding areas ala King of the Hill, or destroying crystals. As you play further, entire floors may get their own objectives, like getting to the end in under two minutes or completing a whole floor without taking damage (good luck on that one…).</p>

<h2>Upgrades In <em>Abyssus</em></h2>

<p>It's not just the world that is randomized, but also the upgrades for the player. At certain points, players will obtain relics that can add different effects to the game and add new elemental abilities to their primary, secondary, and ability attacks.</p>

<p>Even if every new player starts with an assault rifle and grenades, by the time you reach the third floor, your health, abilities, and experience could be wildly different.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abyssus-review-abilities.jpg?itok=sVVrmc1F 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abyssus-review-abilities.jpg?itok=7oJKNOp5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>When playing, I thoroughly enjoyed the level of randomness. It was never just about killing enemies, but looking to take on some additional objective. The enemy pool is a bit shallow; it does change when you reach areas past the main bosses, but even then, if you die, you're back to the original pool of enemies.</p>

<p>There are also a large number of permanent upgrades. Completing certain objectives while playing will grant you access to additional loadout options, and by defeating bosses and getting lucky with opening chests, you'll obtain Soul Fragments that give powerful advantages.</p>

<p>I wasn't too sure about the gameplay loop of <em>Abyssus</em>; it's a good loop, but it might not have been enough to grab me. Seeing how quickly my abilities scaled and how much further I was able to get with Soul Fragments is what really dragged me into the game. Each upgrade isn't far off from another, so there's always some big improvement to be made.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abyssus-review-character-upgrades.jpg?itok=g9c71Ee3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abyssus-review-character-upgrades.jpg?itok=gEYyy5o1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>On the first tier of upgrades, I could see features to slightly improve damage, but also ones that allow you to start with a second syringe (a powerful healing item). On the second tier alone, these upgrades started getting a bit crazy. Getting to increase your health by 20%, getting additional ability uses, and even getting to start each run with valuable keys and coins.</p>

<p>A single good run can net you one to two upgrades to begin with, letting you quickly scale and see yourself barely making it through the first mini-boss, to confidently taking out a boss.</p>

<p><em>Abyssus </em>is a game that could be replayed over and over until the end of time, but it's also very respectful of your time in that you can make progress in a single 20-30 minute run.</p>

<h2>Keep Going Deeper</h2>

<p>Interestingly, playing the game and defeating bosses will earn you Soul Fragments that improve your character's abilities, but completing Expeditions (reaching the end of the game) will net you Brine Canisters.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abyssus-review-dungeon-upgrades.jpg?itok=EeZeh4uo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abyssus-review-dungeon-upgrades.jpg?itok=rI9Lop_H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Brine Canisters can be used to make your game harder. A clear example of this would be the ability to make Healing Shrines no longer restore Syringe uses. This takes away the ability to refresh what is one of the most powerful ways to heal yourself as you're making your way into the depths.</p>

<p>This culminates in the ability to alter enemy and boss damage and health modifiers.</p>

<p><em>Abyssus </em>presents multiple levels of play to the player. You can adventure on your own and with friends, and your aim can be to just get to the end of an Expedition and be happy that you got to enjoy the game. Completionists have hundreds of objectives to complete to unlock additional weapons, modifications, and cosmetic items. This will continue to keep the game fun and have you playing in ways you may not be most inclined to.</p>

<p>Then, for the masochist, there's the ability to take all of that progress and stack on additional difficulties to prove that you aren't just able to reach the end, but you can do so with added weights dragging you down.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abyssus-review-objectives.jpg?itok=qp_dREh9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abyssus-review-objectives.jpg?itok=xY64yJbp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>At no point would any player who reached their level of satisfactory play feel like they were missing out, or that they had been locked out of experiencing more of the game due to difficulty, but it's clear how much time and consideration was put into an experience that would challenge the best of them.</p>

<h2><em>Abyssus </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Whether you want a game to run once or twice in an afternoon to blow off some steam or dive into it for a longer session with friends,&nbsp;<em>Abyssus </em>is a fantastic choice. The randomness of the runs serves to lift up the player, allowing them to gather what's necessary to break through to the next barrier in just a run or two, and not a few hours.</p>

<p>The game maintains its difficulty while also providing players with a wide host of options to power up their characters and gear, and reshape the dungeon they're making their way through to maximise their abilities.</p>

<p>The satisfaction of continuously reaching a new personal best or getting incredibly close will keep bringing you back for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has previewed changes coming to an army in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a>. The new <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Nighthaunt Battletome brings the ghostly army into the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-fourth-edition-signals-new-age" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newest edition</a>, bringing some rules and mechanics updates along the way.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/hsrvwzdi/scare-the-wits-out-of-your-foes-and-open-up-a-phantasmal-pharmacy-with-battletome-nighthaunt/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community</a> post, Games Workshop previews some of the changes coming in the new <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Nighthaunt battletome.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-nighthaunt-battletome-ethereal-statblock.jpg?itok=tCkvmBSa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-nighthaunt-battletome-ethereal-statblock.jpg?itok=q424004a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Some of these changes are buffs and quality-of-life improvements. The units will retain their Ethereal rule, but now ignore just negative modifiers... except for Nagash. To balance for this, saves are now reduced to 5+ for Hero units and 6+ for spectres. But, to help reinforce the idea of the Nighthaunt as incorporeal warriors, they are all getting a 5+ Ward save and an additional unit of health per model.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Warhammer Age of Sigmar Nighthaunt Battletome introduces new passives and resources. Mounting Dread debuffs the enemy's control scores based on how long the battle has gone. Etherreal Translocation lets you teleport a unit once per turn away from the enemy. Vanish and Reappear grants units bonus movement and lets them ignore terrain or enemy units.</p>

<p>The new battletome also includes new heroic traits and artefacts. Undead wizards can now use Wrench Souls, which can move friendly Nighthaunt units outside of movement phase, Alternatively, they can burden the enemy with Chains of Death, burdening them with strike-last for the rest of the turn. Then there's the unlimited spell ability, Fell Blades, which subtracts 1 from enemy save rolls against subsequent attacks.</p>

This ghastly potion-maker's Spectral Alchemy ability lets you provide a buff to your army. Spectral Solvent dissolves anything with a negative move characteristic. Choking Vapours debuffs enemy Wizards. And Unholy Prescription prevents the enemy from making Ward saves for a single turn.</p>

<p>All of these changes and more can be found in the new <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Nighthaunt Battletome, which will be available for pre-order this upcoming Saturday.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Helldivers 2 Halo Crossover Seemingly Teased in Latest Trailer]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-halo-crossover-seemingly-teased</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-halo-crossover-seemingly-teased-in-latest-trailer.1268088/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>trailer may hint at the existence of a crossover between Arrowhead's shooter and Microsoft's iconic&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>franchise.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-xbox-series-xs-august" rel="nofollow">launching on Xbox Series X|S</a> later this month, and to commemorate that launch, Arrowhead and Sony have released a new "Bring the Boom" trailer, showing gameplay highlights for the game. It's a fairly standard trailer, but it's the final few seconds that are particularly interesting.</p>

<p>As spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-bring-the-boom-trailer-teases-odst-at-the-very-end.1267872/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Klyka</a>, the final few seconds of the Bring the Boom trailer depict scenery that looks very close to&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST</em>'s New Mombasa, complete with music that's strongly reminiscent of that spinoff. It looks like a crossover with that game is on the cards.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-halo-odst-crossover-visual.jpg?itok=uqNXoTcA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-halo-odst-crossover-visual.jpg?itok=S2c2fC9R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>&nbsp;is getting a&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>crossover.</figcaption></figure><p>If this crossover is going ahead, then&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>feels like the right game for&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>to cross over with. While the core&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>series follows the exploits of unstoppable badass Master Chief,&nbsp;<em>ODST&nbsp;</em>is much more about the little guys on the ground, which matches&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s "you are a cog in a miserable machine" feel.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that we don't know what form the crossover will take, if it's coming at all. We could be getting a full New Mombasa map, or the crossover could be limited to&nbsp;<em>ODST&nbsp;</em>skins or cosmetics. It's also not clear whether that crossover is coming just to Xbox or to the PS5 as well.</p>

<p>This trailer comes just a couple of months after Chinese gaming giant Tencent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arrowhead-tencent-stake-report" rel="nofollow">purchased a 15% stake</a> in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>developer Arrowhead, which, despite the fact that both <i>Helldivers&nbsp;</i>games were published by Sony, remains an independent company (for now, at least).</p>

<p>At any rate, you can check out the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Bring the Boom trailer right here. The&nbsp;<em>Halo 3: ODST&nbsp;</em>tease (if, indeed, that's what it is) can be found right at the end.</p>




<p><i>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</i>is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and it's coming to <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/helldivers-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on August 26th. You can read our review of the game from back when it launched <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/helldivers-2-review-fighting-for-managed-democracy" rel="nofollow">right here</a>.</p>
