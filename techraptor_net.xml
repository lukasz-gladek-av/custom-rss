            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/digimon-story-time-stranger-shows-off-vibrant-digital-world-and-quality-of-life<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the titles at SGF I was most excited to check out was <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger.</em> Having loved the previous two <em>Digimon Story</em> games I was excited to see a new location, new story, but more of the same JRPG goodness.</p>

<p>I got to sit down and play 30 minutes of <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger,</em> starting with the protagonist, Aegiomon, and Inori first reaching Central Town in the Digital World. After a brief cutscene of the characters making their way through a sewer to a ladder, the party emerges in Central Town.</p>

<h2>Central Town Is Alive With Digimon</h2>

<p>I was blown away by just how much was going on in this city. From where you emerge, you can see at least three dozen digimon, of levels from Baby up to Mega, some hanging around having conversations, some watching over the city, and others working as store owners or guides.</p>

Astamon is serving drinks at the bar for Xros Wars fans</figcaption></figure><p>It was a feast to the eyes, and as a fan of Digimon, I was even more excited to hear that every Digimon that I could see in and around Central Town was one I could obtain for myself through scanning or digivolution.</p>

<p>With a variety of colorful characters, different themed Digimon exploring relevant environments, and active movement, it really made the city feel alive.</p>

<p>Exploring the city, there was a shop to purchase stat-changing equipment from, attacks to purchase for your Digimon, and food for the Digifarm. Plenty for you to spend your hard-earned cash on. I didn't get to dig much more into that, but a lot of it was the standard RPG array of items and elemental attacks of varying power.</p>

<h2><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> Overworld Combat And QOL</h2>

<p>Leaving Central Town on a Pegasusmon's back, it was my new goal to reach the top of a large tower. Entering a space with aggressive Digimon, there were a few things that I was shown.</p>

<p>The first was that there were a variety of supplies and crates that I could destroy with my Digimon to obtain the item.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-digiattack.jpg?itok=9m6HNF5S 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-digiattack.jpg?itok=a7j_dO8I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Defeat weak Digimon instantly while reaping the benefits</figcaption></figure><p>Digimon now spawn in the overworld, as opposed to being random encounters. On top of that, I was surprised when I initiated my first battle… and it was over just as soon as it had started. A new Quality of Life feature in <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> is that if you're up against Digimon that are less powerful than your own party by a certain amount, you'll win automatically.</p>

<p>What's even better about this is that not only is EXP still earned, but you get scan data for the Digimon you face too.</p>

<p>When you encounter a Digimon that you don't kill immediately, you'll get launched into turn-based combat. Here you can perform basic attacks or lean into your Digimon's special abilities. This is where I experienced the least difference from prior <em>Digimon Story</em> games, but also it's Shin Megami Tensei style combat, where there's a focus on using special attacks and swapping between a variety of unique creatures. It doesn't need to totally reinvent the genre to be a good combat system.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-combat-conclusion.jpg?itok=vaRjZlXx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-combat-conclusion.jpg?itok=6oaGvcod 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Another major Quality of Life improvement is that combat speed can change. You can have 1x, 2x, 3x, and 5x battle speed. When you know your Digimon, what combos of abilities are strongest, and are maybe doing some experience farming this speed up will be a saving grace.</p>

<h2>Boss Battles Have Evolving Moments</h2>

<p>There were two places where combat showed off some unique aspects that I experienced as I was fighting against Parrotmon, a boss/titan at this point in the story.</p>

<p>The first of these changes involved Parrotmon directly. Partway through the battle, Parrotmon brought its wings in towards its body, protecting itself as it started to charge up electrical energy with its head. A new white bar appeared below its health; this was a gauge that I needed to take down by specifically attacking its head instead of its body, otherwise it would unleash a powerful attack.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-parrotmon-combat.jpg?itok=OzSdi9MQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-parrotmon-combat.jpg?itok=G7-f9kuH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This added dynamic element created a reason to prioritize powerful attacks, turning the battle momentarily into a sprint as opposed to being a marathon.</p>

<p>The other change is how the tamer is involved in a battle. The first of which is in item usage. Instead of an Item being used, and taking up a Digimon's turn, the Tamer has their own 'action' that they can take. If an item is used, the Digimon whose turn it is is still able to perform an ability, but it will take a rotation of all of the Digimon before your Tamer can use an action again.</p>

<p>This came in clutch while I was using Tankmon in the battle against Parrotmon. Tankmon has a powerful attack that will leave him paralyzed for a turn. Just before it was Tankmon's turn, I was about to use a restorative item with the Tamer, readying Tankmon for another powerful attack, while still getting to deal heavy damage with a Kyuubimon.</p>

<p>A second way that the Tamer is involved is with a powerful X-Art (Pronounced Cross Art). While battling, you'll earn points by hitting your enemy with type advantage attacks, and avoiding being hit with moves that are strong against your Digimon. Activating this ability stacked three turns' worth of every buff on my entire party.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-x-art.jpg?itok=N50H5BSA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-x-art.jpg?itok=DnaQ9qzQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>X-Arts will subtly let you know when it's ready to be activated</figcaption></figure><p>This was another time, this time created by the player, to set up your most powerful Digimon to attack in quick succession to capitalize on the boosts that you receive.</p>

<p>One thing that wasn't clear about X-Art is whether this kind of ability is one that can be swapped out, or you can expand from having one option to multiple.</p>

<h2>Creating And Digivolving Your Partners</h2>

<p>Digimon are at the core of this experience. At any time in your party, you can have three active members and three reserve members. There are also spaces for guest party members who are part of combat, but can't be controlled by the player. You can also have 999 additional Digimon in your storage. You can freely transfer Digimon in and out of your party whether you're in a city or out in areas where you can fight wild Digimon. I got to see Aegiomon and Minervamon as guests in this session.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-converting-digimon-data.jpg?itok=a64pZFBe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-converting-digimon-data.jpg?itok=Pwy5sSkM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In combat as you attack a Digimon their weaknesses and resistances will slowly be revealed</figcaption></figure><p>Digimon in your party, whether they're active or in reserve, will all gain full experience in battle, which is a lovely touch.</p>

<p>Encountering Digimon in the wild, you'll scan them. Once you've scanned them to 100%, you can convert that data into a Digimon of that type for yourself. Additionall,y you can scan to 200% and the Digimon that you create will have boosted stats as well as a higher maximum level potential.</p>

<p>An aspect of Digimon raising that I didn't get to see as part of the gameplay demo was the Digimon farm so we'll have to look for more than that in the future.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Digimon Has Never Looked So Good</h2>

<p>Walking around the world, seeing Digimon interact with one another, and most frequently during the battle scene, was just how good the Digimon in <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> looked.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-kyubimon.jpg?itok=O0IR81zm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-kyubimon.jpg?itok=GfTBjksC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I was most impressed with seeing Zudomon up close, his bulkier model looking really well-defined in Central Town, and Kyuubimon in the middle of battle. The boss battle took place under dark cloud cover, but Kyuubimon's flaming elements glowed bright. This not only looked more realistic, but also made me think of other interesting fire or water elements of different Digimon and how they'll be represented.</p>

<h2>References Everywhere</h2>

<p>You can tell that the developers are fans of the source material by how even that small slice of the world was overflowing with references. The Digimon 02 Rookies could be found near the Trailmon station, Tamers Rookies were hanging out in an alleyway, and even Arukenimon and Mummymon were seen together.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-adventure-02-reference.jpg?itok=icktb10K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digimon-story-time-stranger-adventure-02-reference.jpg?itok=QxT2s_Le 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In the middle of a conversation you might notice the cast of Digimon Adventure 02 in the distance</figcaption></figure><p>Outside of the specific references to groups of Digimon, if there's a Digimon that you're a fan of from specific Digimon media ,then chances are that Digimon is here. We've seen Digimon as early as <em>Digimon Adventure</em>, all the way up to <em>Digimon Xros Wars: The Young Hunters Who Leapt Through Time</em>.</p>

<p>It isn't entirely clear if we'll see any Digimon from <em>Ghost Game</em> or characters like Pulsemon or Herrismon from mobile games, and I think it would be safe to assume we won't see any <em>Appmon</em>.</p>

<h2><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I went into <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> as a lifelong Digimon fan, and someone who has been poring over released footage and assets, and I was still blown away by what I got to see. The world is full and thriving with Digimon life. Packed full of new Digimon (like Tankdramon) and references that Digimon fans will always smile to see.</p>

<p>I hope they are hiding some <em>Ghost Game</em> Digimon, and that we'll get to see more of the Armor Digivolutions (including some non-canonical ones).</p>

<p>The release of this game can't come any sooner.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warner-bros-creates-gaming-divisions-for-top-ip-including-mortal-kombat-and-harry-potter.1221906/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-restructure-divisions-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros. Games has announced that it will restructure itself into divisions based around its four main IPs, with three studio heads already appointed to oversee the new divisions.</p>

<p>According to a Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-restructures-game-of-thrones-harry-potter-1236434385/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the four divisions will be based around the key WB properties, namely&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter</em>,&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones</em>, the&nbsp;DC universe, and&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat</em>. The three new studio heads will all report directly to WB gaming head J.B. Perrette.</p>

<p>If you feel like you've identified a number discrepancy in this announcement, you're not wrong, but there's a simple explanation. Both&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Game of Thrones&nbsp;</i>will be overseen by a single studio head, namely WB Montreal head Yves Lachance. NetherRealm's Shaun Himmerick will be&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>and DC's steward, while WB New York's Steven Flenory will work on the publishing and tech side of things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/batman-arkham-knight-warner-bros.jpg?itok=OhBHeGSf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/batman-arkham-knight-warner-bros.jpg?itok=axEdBZ40 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Warner Bros. has reorganized its gaming department into four key divisions.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Variety, no employees have been laid off as part of this change, which comes as a pleasant surprise after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jagex-layoffs" rel="nofollow">spate</a> of "structural realignment" <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow">operations</a> we've seen in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-layoffs-veilguard-failure" rel="nofollow">recent months</a> (and over the last couple of years, as a matter of fact).</p>

<p>The change also comes after former Warner Bros. gaming head David Haddad <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-david-haddad-stepping-down" rel="nofollow">stepped down from the company</a> a few months ago. His departure follows a couple of rather embarrassingly high-profile failures for the company's gaming segment, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow">flop fighting game&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow">MultiVersus</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-seasons-ending-in-january-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">large-scale letdown&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em></a>.</p>

<p>As Variety notes, it's not clear whether this change is intended to be a permanent replacement for Haddad's leadership or whether it's a stopgap while the company tries to find a successor for him.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-warner-bros.jpg?itok=FSCfp-pd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-warner-bros.jpg?itok=DA6P0PYb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>was one of two major letdowns for Warner Bros. last year.</figcaption></figure><p>As you might have guessed, these failures <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-financials-2024-revenue-falls" rel="nofollow">led to a "disappointing" financial year</a> for Warner Bros., which is likely why the company has chosen to reorganize around its key franchises (although it should be pointed out that both of its major flops last year were based, at least in part, on some of those franchises).</p>

<p>The studio's poor performance could well also have been a factor in the closure of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games" rel="nofollow"><em>Condemned&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R.&nbsp;</em>developer Monolith</a> earlier this year, along with&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>developer Player First Games and regional division WB San Diego.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what this means for Warner Bros.' gaming operations in the long run. Stay tuned for more.</p>
