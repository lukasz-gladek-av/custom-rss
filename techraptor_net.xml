            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report, a TV show based on id Software and Bethesda's legendary&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>franchise is currently in development, and it's set to air on Prime Video.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/wolfenstein-tv-series-amazon-kilter-patrick-somerville-1236469609/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>, the show will be produced by&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>studio Kilter Films, with executive producer duties being handled by Keyframe Films' James Altman and MachineGames' Jerk Gustafsson, the latter of whom served as director on&nbsp;2014's&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein: The New Order&nbsp;</em>and 2019's&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein: Youngblood</em>.</p>

<p>We don't yet know what the story of the series will be, but as Variety points out, the logline for the series is simply this: "the story of killing Nazis is evergreen". It's hard to argue with that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wolfenstein-tv-show-new-colossus.jpg?itok=JWPaEvZx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wolfenstein-tv-show-new-colossus.jpg?itok=p6g4rqpr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>TV series is in development for Amazon.</figcaption></figure><p>Although story details are being kept under wraps, if it were me, I'd probably adapt the narrative of&nbsp;<em>The New Order</em>; it's almost certainly the strongest the series has to offer.</p>

<p>Casting also hasn't been revealed yet, but if you ask me,&nbsp;<em>Reacher</em>'s Alan Ritchson was essentially born to play swole hero B.J. Blazkowicz, so if he doesn't end up in the lead role, something's gone seriously wrong.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Station Eleven&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Maniac&nbsp;</em>creator Patrick Somerville will serve as the showrunner for&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein</em>, so it'll essentially be up to him and Amazon what direction the show decides to take.</p>

<p>No third mainline game in MachineGames' rebooted&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>series has been revealed yet (I'm very much trying to ignore&nbsp;<em>Youngblood</em>); while&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/indiana-jones-and-great-circle" rel="nofollow">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>&nbsp;</em>had more than its fair share of Nazi-punching, this might be the closest you're going to get to more&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein&nbsp;</em>for some time.</p>

Other successes on that front include <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/fallout-tv-show-proves-last-of-us-wasnt-fluke" rel="nofollow">Fallout</a>&nbsp;</i>(also made for Amazon), HBO's&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>, and&nbsp;<em>League of Legends</em>' <i>Arcane</i>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/more-league-of-legends-shows-on-way" rel="nofollow">won't be the only&nbsp;<em>League&nbsp;</em>show soon enough</a>.</p>

<p>As well as these shows, plenty of as-yet-unadapted games are getting their own TV adaptations as well, including&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clash-of-clans-tv-show" rel="nofollow"><em>Clash of Clans</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beyond-two-souls-tv-series" rel="nofollow"><em>Beyond: Two Souls</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-live-action-series-netflix-soon" rel="nofollow"><em>Assassin's Creed</em></a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-update-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-update-set-to-land-next-week.1253382/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware have announced when you can expect the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>duos update to land, and it's not too far away at all, so get ready to revisit Limveld with your buddy.</p>

<p><i>Elden Ring Nightreign</i>'s duos mode was first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-confirmed-sales" rel="nofollow">revealed in early June</a>, but now, the two studios have <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1948745061984014727" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unveiled</a> the date on which you'll be able to tackle Limveld's dangers with just one other person: July 30th.</p>

<p>The ability to play in a duo will be added as part of patch 1.02, which will also bring new ways to sort relics, hopefully making organizing your favorite loadouts a little easier.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-update-tower.jpg?itok=LdljaS4A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-update-tower.jpg?itok=NrplKzA7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s duos mode is coming very soon.</figcaption></figure><p>As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>was released back in late May, quickly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">amassing over two million sales</a> on its first day of release. At launch, the game only supported solo play or squads of three, and players quickly began requesting a duo mode, which FromSoftware was evidently happy to implement.</p>

<p>After release,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>received a number of updates, adding features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-adel-upgraded-update" rel="nofollow">new superpowered versions</a> of the Nightlord bosses to take on, plus new quality-of-life improvements and more.</p>

<p>News of the duos update's release date comes shortly after&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-nightreign-sales" rel="nofollow">reached five million sales</a>&nbsp;earlier this week, with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC currently sitting at ten million. Those are some pretty encouraging numbers for Bandai Namco, I'm sure.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's a multiplayer-focused spinoff of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>that sees players descending on a randomly-generated map in order to kill minibosses, loot gear, and get strong enough to take on a boss at the end of each run.</p>




<p>The game is one of two major multiplayer-oriented titles in FromSoftware's slate for the next couple of years; the other is&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2" rel="nofollow">Switch 2-exclusive PvPvE game</a> set to launch sometime next year.</p>
