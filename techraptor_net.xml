            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Renegade Game Studios has announced they are bringing back <em>Ikusa: Samurai Swords</em>. The tabletop publisher is working alongside Avalon Hill to bring an <em>Ikusa: Samurai Swords 40th Anniversary</em> board game via a crowdfunding campaign this Fall.</p>



<p>In an official post, Renegade Game Studios stated that both they and Avalon Hill will bring the <em>Ikusa: Samurai Swords 40th Anniversary</em> board game to players around the world by a crowdfunding campaign on <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gamefound-acquires-indiegogo-greatly-expanding-tabletop-crowdfunding-platform" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gamefound</a>. This new version of the classic board game, known as <em>Shogun</em> to its most ardent fans, will feature new artwork, updated components, and more modern production values.</p>

If one wishes to gain the title of shogun, they will need to strategically deploy, manage, and command all armies and mercenaries at their command.</p>

<p>The post does confirm that the <em>Ikusa: Samurai Swords 40th Anniversary</em> board game Gamefound campaign will be packed with features and materials for dedicated fans and board game enthusiasts. This will include behind-the-scenes content, sneak peeks at the game's updated components, as well as giveaways.</p>

<p>This edition of the game will only be available via the Gamefound campaign. While a retail reprint isn't out of the question, if you want the most pristine version of this title, you will want to make time.</p>

<p>Avalon Hill is a tabletop studio behind many enduring and beloved tabletop experiences. These include the fantasy game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/talisman-fifth-edition-announced-by-games-workshop" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Talisman</em></a>, the horror game <em>Betrayal at House on the Hill</em>, which recently released a crossover with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/avalon-hill-talisman-betrayal-expansions" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Stephen King's <em>It</em></a>, and the TTRPG-lite experience, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/heroquest-crypt-of-perpetual-darkness-designed-by-joe-mangianello-is-available-for" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>HeroQuest</em></a><em>.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slime-rancher-2-release-date-september</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/slime-rancher-2-1-0-release-date-set-for-september.1256454/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Monomi Park has announced that its cozy critter-rearing sim&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2&nbsp;</em>is leaving Early Access this September, gaining new story content, new gameplay features, and more in the process.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2</em>&nbsp;will be exiting Early Access and hitting its 1.0 release on September 23rd. By the time it launches in full, it will have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slime-rancher-2-release-date-announced" rel="nofollow">been in Early Access for three years</a>.</p>

<p>When the 1.0 version arrives, Monomi Park says you can expect plenty of extras for the cute farming sim, first among them being new Labyrinth sections that you can explore in order to "solve the [game's] ongoing mysteries and save the Far, Far Range".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/slime-rancher-2-1.0-release-date-slimes_0.jpg?itok=D81n1cqc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/slime-rancher-2-1.0-release-date-slimes_0.jpg?itok=Cmk__xk7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Slime Rancher 2&nbsp;</em>is finally exiting Early Access in September.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll also be able to enjoy the new Quantum Drones, which can both "help automate your ranch" and "roam the island to find resources", as well as more blueprints featuring "decor variants, gadgets, and upgrades".</p>

<p>All in all, Monomi Park is calling 1.0 "the best and most complete version of the&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2&nbsp;</em>experience to date", so if you've been holding off until the game is done, September is the date you're going to want to aim for.</p>

<p>As well as announcing the 1.0 release, Monomi Park has also revealed physical versions of&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2</em>&nbsp;for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, which will launch in January. They'll sport artwork from&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>artist Yusuke Naora, as well as a fold-out poster.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer for the&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2&nbsp;</em>release date, as well as a sneak preview of the artwork created by Naora for the physical releases of the game, right here.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2</em>, it is, as you've probably guessed, the sequel to the original&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher</em>, which left its Early Access period <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slime-rancher-leaving-early-access-this-august" rel="nofollow">all the way back in August 2017</a>.</p>

<p>Less than a week after its Early Access launch,&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/slime-rancher-2-sales-cross-300k-in-first-week-with-zero-crunch" rel="nofollow">managed to pick up over 300,000 sales</a>, and Monomi Park proudly says it did so with "zero crunch", so hey, there's another reason to grab the game if you haven't already.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Slime Rancher 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1657630/Slime_Rancher_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009803" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/slime-rancher-2/9phfj0n31nv1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
