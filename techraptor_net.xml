            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mandalorian-adventures-clan-of-two-brings-new-jobs-to-star-wars-board-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new expansion is coming for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mandalorian-adventures-board-game-announced-by-asmodee-group" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Mandalorian: Adventures</em></a>. Unexpected Games' latest premium expansion, <em>The Mandalorian: Adventures Clan of Two</em> will add new game elements to the base game based on Season 2 of the popular streaming series.</p>



<p>According to an official press release, <em>The Mandalorian: Adventures Clan of Two</em> was designed by Unexpected Games' studio head Corey Konieczka, the same mind behind the original release. The expansion introduces four new characters, four locations, and a brand new mission book. The expansion is not a standalone experience and requires the base game.</p>

This season involves the titular Mandalorian Din Djarin attempting to reunite his companion Grogu with the nomadic Jedi Order, all while avoiding attacks and plots by the Imperial Moff Gideon.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Season 2 of <em>The Mandalorian</em> included some of my favorite Star Wars™&nbsp;scenes in the last decade. It was a blast recreating these moments for the board game, and this expansion includes so much more. From Boba Fett and Ahsoka Tano to duels and dangerous cards, I can't wait for you to see all the new content.” said Konieczka.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In addition to new characters and missions, <em>The Mandalorian: Adventures Clan of Two</em> introduces new enemy types, ongoing events, and a duel deck. These elements can be integrated into the base game, adding more replayability to the experience.</p>

In addition to this board game about helmeted bounty hunters there is the collectible card game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-wars-unlimited-shadows-of-galaxy-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars: Unlimited</em></a> and the skirmish miniatures game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/star-wars-shatterpoint-guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars: Shatterpoint</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>The Mandalorian: Adventures Clan of Two</em> will be available in Summer 2025. It will be sold at an MSRP of $39.99.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-foamstars-season-last</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/next-foamstars-season-will-be-its-last-square-enix-says.1052598/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-foamstars-season-last<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has announced that the next&nbsp;<em>Foamstars&nbsp;</em>season, which is due to begin next week, will be the game's last, although you'll still be able to play online if you want to.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/documents/notice-regarding-foamstars-season-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post on its website</a>, Square Enix says the "Party Goes On!" season for&nbsp;<em>Foamstars</em>, which starts on December 13th and runs until January 17th, will be the last season, and that "season updates for&nbsp;<em>Foamstars&nbsp;</em>will be coming to an end" after this period.</p>

<p>Following the end of&nbsp;<em>Foamstars&nbsp;</em>seasons, "expansions will be introduced to enhance gameplay", Square Enix says, including customizing shots for characters and "new enhancement elements".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/foamstars-season-last-pink-foam.jpg?itok=tHAZsSaR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/foamstars-season-last-pink-foam.jpg?itok=dFfxNseu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Foamstars&nbsp;</em>won't be getting any more new seasons after next week's.</figcaption></figure><p>Square Enix goes on to say that the&nbsp;<em>Foamstars&nbsp;</em>servers will remain active, as will "all online services" for the game, so it's not being taken offline; it just won't be receiving any more characters or maps, it seems.</p>

<p>Additionally, the&nbsp;<em>Foamstars&nbsp;</em>Cup, a "series of in-game events named after each character", will be held following the next season's conclusion, and all of the game's previous Season Passes will be made available again to give you a chance to get anything you might have missed the first time around.</p>

<p>The decision to end seasons for&nbsp;<em>Foamstars&nbsp;</em>probably shouldn't come as a surprise. When the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/foamstars-release-date" rel="nofollow">was released</a>, a PlayStation Plus subscription was required to play it, and it was a premium product to boot.</p>

<p>However, in October, the PS Plus requirement was dropped and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/foamstars-free-to-play-october" rel="nofollow">the game went free-to-play</a>, perhaps indicating that Square Enix wasn't attracting the kind of player numbers it would have liked for&nbsp;<em>Foamstars</em>.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Foamstars</em>, it's a multiplayer party arena shooter that's essentially Square Enix's attempt to wrest the family-friendly multiplayer crown from Nintendo's&nbsp;<em>Splatoon</em>.</p>

<p>The game sees teams of players competing against one another across a series of gameplay modes. Rather than ink, characters can shoot foam from their guns, and the foam can help your team or hinder your opponents depending on where you fire it.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Foamstars&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/foamstars/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now on PlayStation</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/foamstars-review-partys-over" rel="nofollow">read my review here</a> to find out what I thought of this&nbsp;<em>Splatoon&nbsp;</em>competitor.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ananta-project-mugen-gameplay-trailer</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ananta-formerly-project-mugen-shows-off-anime-rpg-gameplay-in-brand-new-trailer.1052550/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ananta-project-mugen-gameplay-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Naked Rain and publisher NetEase have revealed a brand new gameplay trailer for&nbsp;<em>Ananta</em>, the open-world anime action RPG formerly known as&nbsp;<em>Project Mugen</em>.</p>

<p>The name change was <a href="https://x.com/Ananta_EN/status/1862316133988409359" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">put into effect in late November</a>, and at that point, NetEase and Naked Rain teased a new gameplay trailer for the game, which has now arrived. It looks exactly as you'd expect; essentially like a cross between the likes of&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>and a strange anime-inflected&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto</em>.</p>

<p>The trailer shows off&nbsp;<em>Ananta</em>'s central hub of Nova City, which is where you'll be spending most of your time, whether you're taking on one of the game's missions or engaging in its many minigames and distractions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ananta-project-mugen-gameplay-trailer-beach.jpg?itok=USXTSxJh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ananta-project-mugen-gameplay-trailer-beach.jpg?itok=zznkKgiB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ananta</em>, formerly known as&nbsp;<em>Project Mugen</em>, has a brand new gameplay trailer for you to check out.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer is positioning&nbsp;<em>Ananta&nbsp;</em>as a sort of everything-RPG; not only can you take on exciting, high-octane combat missions in the game, but you can also kick back and relax by driving through the city, playing volleyball, or just grabbing a bite to eat.</p>

<p>In a press release, NetEase and Naked Rain describe <i>Ananta</i>'s world as a place "where the unexpected is the norm and having fun is the ultimate goal".</p>

<p>While you'll be spending most of your time in Nova City, the two studios say you'll also be able to visit other "interconnected cities" to take on challenges, and they're also promising "kung fu movie"-style combat in which you can utilize your surroundings to defeat your enemies.</p>

<p>You can check out the latest trailer for&nbsp;<em>Ananta&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p><em>Ananta&nbsp;</em>will be a free-to-play RPG, but NetEase and Naked Rain haven't revealed what kind of monetization the game will employ. It does rather resemble a HoYoverse-style gacha game, but we'll likely learn whether that's the case in the coming months.</p>

<p>We still don't know when&nbsp;<em>Ananta&nbsp;</em>will be released, but when it is, it'll land on PC, PS5, and mobile devices. You can check out our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/project-mugen-interview" rel="nofollow">interview with the game's producer here</a>.</p>
