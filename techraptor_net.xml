            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You are an Avatar, floating in the void. By your power alone you can mold the earth beneath you, from scorching deserts to shifting seas. But there is another Avatar, a foe contesting the realm. Will you have the magic, wits, and minions to survive? That’s the question posed to you when you shuffle up your decks and play <a href="https://sorcerytcg.com/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em></a>, a Trading Card Game created by Erik's Curiosa.</p><p><em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> is a collectible TCG created in 2024 by Erik’s Curiosa, which aims to capture the old-school feel of classic trading card games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="28960c39-7173-4bd8-bcaf-074e72deed91" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Magic: The Gathering</a>.</p><p>From incredible, oil-painted artwork (of which all the artists retain the rights to their work!), to a “Kitchen Table TCG” design philosophy, the game aims to capture what it felt like to first crack packs of early-days TCG’s and jump into a strange and enchanting world.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The rules are designed to be simple, but there’s plenty of tactical strategy involved to encourage players to experiment with deck-building and different approaches to battle.</p><h2>How Do You Play Sorcery: Contested Realm?</h2><p>To play the game, each player will need an Avatar of their choosing, a deck of 30 Atlas Cards, and a deck of 50 Spellbook cards, as well as a play mat or gaming surface divided into a 4x5 grid.</p><p>There are four different elements (you guessed it: earth, wind, air, and fire) which each give different flavor to cards, and require different types of Site cards played on the field to power up.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p>You’ll use your Avatar to play these Site cards onto the battlefield, cast spells, attack enemy Site cards with minions, and attempt to bring your opponent’s health down to 0 - which triggers a tense end-game as you move your forces in for the kill.</p><p>Wait… did I just say move?</p><h2>How Does It Feel To Play Sorcery: Contested Realm?</h2><p>One of the most exciting aspects of <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> is the way you battle on the board. You’ll actually move your minions and Avatar around the playing field (once you’ve placed cards down that serve as realms across the vast void), attacking, defending, and trying to close the gap on your opponent. This adds a thrilling mix of troop movement into your usual TCG game.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>In a way, it almost feels like you’re playing a smaller, approachable version of a tabletop war-game in the middle of your classic TCG. This reliance on physical placement of cards on the board adds a truly unique feel to the game - with some Spells shooting out in a straight line. There are also ways to destroy your opponent's Site cards, or in other ways hinder your enemy's movement.</p><p>Attacking feels familiar to games like <em>Magic</em>, where your Minions deal damage equal to their strength to your opponent's Minions - but there's a unique mechanic here, too, where nearby allied Minions can swoop in to help defend. It all leads to much more movement around the board than you'd expect at first glance (most Minions and Avatars can only move one space per activation). It all feels familiar <em>and</em> refreshingly new at the same time. Just like the artwork on the cards.</p><h2>The Art of <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em></h2><p>As you've likely noticed from the imagery so far in this review, the artwork on display for <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> is unique, iconic, and captures a feeling I miss from modern TCG games: that hand-made feeling.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm not saying games like <em>Magic</em> and <em>Pokemon</em> can't have gorgeous card art - they more often than not <em>do</em> - but overall there's a slickness to the images that leaves them feeling less personal.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sorcery-contested-realm-artwork-1.jpg?itok=Bj6a2JbD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1600" height="1080">

  </picture><p>With <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> all of the artwork is, to quote their own site (where they proudly <a href="https://sorcerytcg.com/art" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">devote an entire page to speaking in depth about the art and artists</a>), "hand-painted using traditional mediums such as oil, acrylic, water color paintings, pen and pencil, or a mix of all the various media. This creates a very authentic and varied feel within the art, evoking the golden age of fantasy."</p><p>That's my favorite part of the Sorcery artwork, every card looks different. <em>That</em> feels like old-school TCG games to me, where there's no unified set of design imperatives all the artists have to adhere to. It feels free, wild, and evokes the varied magic being flung around the void in <em>Sorcery</em>.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Learning The Game</h2><p>The game's core rules and concepts are very easy to pick up on <em>if</em> you're a veteran of trading card games already. You'll understand core mechanics like needing resources to play cards, tapping things to attack/gain effects, etc. If you're brand new to trading card games, you will need to do a bit of catch up - as <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> takes the foundations built over the last 30 years of gaming and adds on it with "troop movement" (for lack of a better term).</p><p>My <em>only</em> complaint with the game is also something I love about it - go figure! That's this "kitchen table" approach to gaming, meaning there are some elements that flavorful, but not clearly defined (especially in the starter set's quickstart rulebook). And while that leads to a little extra flipping back and forth through the core rules, I'd imagine it also opens the game up to more creative ideation in the future.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Where To Start With <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em></h2><p>As I just mentioned above, <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> currently has three sets out: the core set, Arthurian Legends, and the <em>just</em> released set: Gothic. If you want to get a good feel of the game, I highly recommend picking up one of their two Starter Sets - The Four Elements Starter Set comes from the core set, and features four mini-decks each attuned to one of the four elements.&nbsp;</p><p>It's a great way to get a taste of the game. The new The Prophets of Doom Starter Set was just released with the release of Gothic, and features four decks attuned to angels, demons, and other gleefully grim cards from the new set.</p><h2><em>Sorcery: Contested Realm - </em>Final Thoughts</h2><p>I've wanted to try <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> for a while now based just on hearing rumbling about it in the TCG community, and I'm so glad I did! <em>Sorcery</em> is one of the biggest surprises of the year for me, completely blowing away my expectations. The artwork on display is unlike anything else in the TCG world today, and the gameplay feels fluid, satisfying, and tactical.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're a fan of classic fantasy artwork and you're looking for a new game to try as your other faves get filled with outside IP's, chase ultra-shiny mega rares, and more bloat -- you should absolutely give <em>Sorcery: Contested Realm</em> a spin! You won't be disappointed.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A change-up has happened at Archetype Entertainment. The lead of the studio, James Ohlen, will be stepping down from the company, shifting his role within the parent company, Wizards of the Coast.</p><p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/james-ohlen-shifts-from-archetype-entertainment-head-to-creative-consultant-for-tabletop-rpgs-at-wizards.716766/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">EN World</a>, James Ohlen has chosen to leave his position as the lead of Archetype Entertainment. This is a new internal games studio established by tabletop giant Wizards of the Coast to develop AAA videogames based on original IPs.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>This is important since the studio's first project, <em>Exodus</em>, has been long in development. After its 2023 announcement, a lot of pre-rendered trailers, a dedicated episode in the anthology series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/secret-level-brings-videogame-anthology-to-prime-video" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Secret Level</em></a>, and an official <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coasts-exodus-ttrpg-is-out-putting-sci-fi-twist-on-dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">TTRPG tie-in</a>, the sci-fi title had a gameplay trailer at this year's The Game Awards. The game appears to be a narrative-focused third-person action title. It also dropped a release date of early 2027.</p><p>Ohlen's official reasons for his departure from Archetype Entertainment were that he felt that his work on <em>Exodus</em> was complete and that the final bits of development were in good hands. Given the nature of videogame development cycles, this tracks. It means the game is essentially content complete; all that is left is QA, playtesting, and improving technical performance.</p><p>But Ohlen is not completely departing from Wizards of the Coast as a company. Ohlen will remain as a creative consultant for the tabletop publisher, shifting his focus to TTRPGs. This is a familiar field for Ohlen since he launched Arcanum Worlds, a TTRPG studio dedicated to publishing third-party material for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p><p>Better still, Arcanum Worlds' output has a consistent record of quality. Their world includes DMs Guild supplements like <em>Minsc and Boo's Journal of Villainy</em> and <em>Heroes of Baldur's Gate,</em> as well as the comprehensive book on the Nine Hells, <em>Chains of Asmodeus</em>. The studio has also created original fantasy settings built on D&amp;D's system, such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dragon-age-writer-reveals-raiders-of-serpent-sea" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Raiders of the Serpent Sea</em></a> and <em>Odyssey of the Dragonlords</em>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
