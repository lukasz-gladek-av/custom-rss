            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tomonobu Itagaki, best known for creating the&nbsp;<em>Dead or Alive&nbsp;</em>franchise and for the revival of&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden</em> as a 3D hack-and-slash action game&nbsp;back in 2004, has died aged 58.</p>

<p>As spotted <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1978723327435763751" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">by Wario64</a> on social media, Itagaki's Facebook account was updated earlier today with a post which (according to Wario64's machine translation) he asked "someone special" to release when the "light of [his] life is about to run out".</p>

<p>Itagaki says that the fact the post has appeared on his Facebook page "means it's finally time" and that he's "no longer in this world". He says he "stand[s] by [his] beliefs" and has "no regrets", except for "not being able to deliver [his] new work", for which he apologizes to his fans.</p>

No cause of death was announced in any of the places where Itagaki's death was confirmed.</p>

<p>Tomonobu Itagaki joined the games industry in 1992, where his inaugural project was the Super Famicom port of sports game&nbsp;<em>Tecmo Super Bowl</em>. What would arguably serve as his big break came in 1996, when he headed up&nbsp;<em>Dead or Alive&nbsp;</em>for what was then known as Tecmo Creative #3.</p>

<p>That studio would go on to change its name to Team Ninja, working on the rebooted version of&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden&nbsp;</em>for the Xbox back in 2004, as well as subsequent 3D hack-and-slash entries in the revived version of the franchise.</p>

<p>Itagaki departed Team Ninja in 2008 and would go on to work on just two games following his departure, namely 2015's much-maligned&nbsp;<em>Devil's Third&nbsp;</em>and 2020's&nbsp;<em>Samurai Jack: Battle through Time</em>, albeit as an advisor on the second title.</p>
