The crowdfunding platform that has given creators of all stripes a chance to bring their projects to new audiences is helping those same creators navigate the volatile trade environment caused by the US government.</p>

<h2>The Kickstarter Tariff Manager Announcement</h2>

<p>The Kickstarter tariff manager was announced in an official <a href="https://updates.kickstarter.com/first-look-the-kickstarter-tariff-manager/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>. The post states that the manager is part of the platform assisting creators with navigating rapidly changing trade policies. Up to this point, this assistance has included tips on shipping logistics and conveying information to campaign backers. This manager is the first major form of aid that isn't just useful information.</p>

This is important because an import fee during this time can lead to disruptions of budget, delayed timelines, and even difficult tradeoffs on what can be delivered.</p>

<p>To this end, the tariff manager can allow creators to introduce a surcharge to backers to cover import costs. This will lead to a separate line item on the backer's payment page. This ensures full transparency to why backers are charged extra after their respective pledge level and shipping fees.</p>

<p>Alternatively, if backers cannot pay these extra costs, the manager will allow them to contact the creator directly and discuss solutions. This can include requesting a refund, adjusting their pledge level, or other compromise agreed upon by both parties. If the campaign in question was just for a TTRPG book however, there's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ttrpg-books-might-be-exempt-from-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a chance</a> it won't be affected by these tariffs.</p>

<p>The Kickstarter tariff manager is another tale in the ongoing story of the board game industry reacting to the trade tariffs imposed by the Trump Administration. The severe costs have already caused the closure of developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/greater-than-games-shuts-down-in-response-to-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Greater Than Games</a>, publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CMON</a>, and online retailer <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/boardlandia-shuts-down-due-to-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Boardlandia</a>. The sudden and aggressive implementation of the tariffs have even caused Stonemaier Games to file <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/stonemaier-games-suing-us-president-over-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a lawsuit</a>.</p>

<p>THe Kickstarter tariff manager will be introduced as part of a new Pledge Manager several weeks from now.</p>
