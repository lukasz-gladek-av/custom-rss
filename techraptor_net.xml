            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arc System Works, the studio responsible for classic fighting games like <em>Guilty Gear </em>and <em>BlazBlue</em>, has announced <em>Donutal</em>, an "alien screening adventure" in which you'll be deciding whether to grant aliens entry to Earth.</p><p>The game, which bears more than a few similarities to indie hits like <em>Papers, Please </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-im-not-a-human-500k-sales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d5684c77-487f-4888-bbf9-847c5d9828ec" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>No, I'm Not a Human</em></a><em> </em>(and the aliens very definitely are not in this case), will be coming to PC via Steam sometime this year, although no release date has been given yet.</p><p>Arc System Works describes <em>Donutal </em>as a game in which you "uncover true identities through conversation", which is also the main mechanic of the game; you'll be talking to aliens, trying to figure out their motives, and then accepting or rejecting their applications to enter the planet.</p><figure role="group">

<p>You'll play as someone who's just been awakened from 150 years of cryosleep, and you'll have to commit yourself to your new role of Alien Entry Examiner despite the fact that you're suffering from amnesia.</p><p>While examining aliens' applications, you can summon them to an interrogation room, and by summoning different combinations of aliens, you may learn more about their motivations for coming to Earth.</p><p>Additionally, you'll have to figure out whether prosperous aliens who can contribute to the planet via tourism or academia could also be dangerous individuals; getting this wrong could lead to "irreversible consequences", according to Arc.</p><p>Each day, you'll be greeted with a morning news bulletin that will reflect how well you did in screening aliens and allowing the right ones to join the Earth population. You can check out a trailer for <em>Donutal </em>here.</p>
<p><em>Donutal </em>is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3971730/Donutal/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam</a> sometime this year. A demo for the game is available now if you'd like to see whether it's your cup of tea or not. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 </em>developer The Chinese Room has revealed that it's partnered up with <em>Valor Mortis </em>publisher Lyrical Games for its next project, so it looks like <em>Bloodlines 2</em>'s failure hasn't dissuaded the studio.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.thechineseroom.co.uk/games/unannounced-new-project" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news post</a> on its official website, The Chinese Room says the "upcoming, unannounced" project will be published by Lyrical Games, but that the British developer will retain "creative autonomy and IP ownership".</p><p>Lyrical Games' duties will include "full financing, strategic production support, and collaborative go-to-market planning", which sounds about right for a publisher. The Chinese Room says the partnership with the publisher builds on Lyrical's "commitment to backing distinctive, high-craft projects".</p><figure role="group">

<p>The Chinese Room CEO Ed Daly says the partnership will give the studio the "confidence and support to push creatively" in order to "stand out in today's market", while Lyrical head Blake Rochkind says the developer's next game has a "strong vision" and that his company is aiming to "remove friction" from development.</p><p>Assuming this project is next in The Chinese Room's pipeline, it'll be the studio's first game since last year's poorly-received <em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-indefinitely" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="14f47468-9696-4619-adfe-4a904a94f05a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">spent a long time</a> in development hell before being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="424a86e4-db05-4ea2-9339-418c1fb748b3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">"rescued" by the British developer</a>.</p><p>Reflecting on <em>Bloodlines 2</em>'s poor reception, former Chinese Room head Dan Pinchbeck <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodlines-2-name-chinese-room" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ec744b99-1543-4387-b78c-dd265b6df66b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">suggested that the game shouldn't have been released</a> under the <em>Bloodlines </em>name, which created expectations the studio was unable to meet.</p><p>Whether Pinchbeck is right or not, <em>Bloodlines 2 </em>was released as <em>Bloodlines 2</em>, and it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-financials-bloodlines-2-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cdaf779b-8a75-48a8-9d81-99d3be95566b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">resulted in a pretty dismal year</a> for publisher Paradox thanks to its failure. It's probably safe to say that whatever The Chinese Room's next game is, it's not <em>Bloodlines 3</em>.</p>
<p>The Chinese Room might have been the outfit behind <em>Bloodlines 2</em>, but the studio is usually better-known for its contemplative narrative games (which some might refer to as "walking simulators") like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chinese-room-still-wakes-the-deep-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c24b924e-d035-4ba1-a306-060800f9d7e1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Still Wakes the Deep</em></a><em> </em>and <em>Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs</em>.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see whether this project is more like those games than <em>Bloodlines 2</em>, but for now, it looks like The Chinese Room has secured a publisher, at least. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
