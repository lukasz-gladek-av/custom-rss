It’s a cozy slice of life game where you deliver artificial pets. There’s also a mystery to be solved.</p>

<h2 lang="EN-US" paraeid="{280475d0-d510-4868-87d2-14c667b4b7b0}{184}" paraid="278375488" xml:lang="EN-US">Petal Runner's Game Boy Visuals</h2>

<p paraeid="{c3d7e0ce-d02a-4e0b-bcc1-34ba4197aaac}{18}" paraid="447900538" xml:lang="EN-US">My first impressions of <em>Petal Runner</em> were that it looked just like the <em>Pokemon </em>games of my childhood. That is absolutely true and by design, as I was told by Creative Director Brandon Greer, who said he always loved the look of <em>Pokemon Red </em>and wanted to do something inspired by it.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{8730c49a-d8b5-4c50-96b8-acddb7a531f4}{236}" paraid="538743245" xml:lang="EN-US">Greer told me that he was always interested in pixel art and got into learning how to make it as a hobby. That turned into something more, which led to creating the art in <em>Petal Runner</em>. He even <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BJGpixel" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">runs a YouTube channel</a> with tutorials if you want to learn as well.&nbsp;</p>



<p paraeid="{4f21161a-8587-48e8-8bdb-14384b1328d0}{137}" paraid="191828718" xml:lang="EN-US">There’s no battling, but there’s also no shortage of Hanapets to befriend along the way. Delivering and calibrating, sometimes coming to repair them by recalibrating, is the name of the game as you play <em>Petal Runner</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{06b0ace7-5ed8-4943-9078-cc6c547b84be}{14}" paraid="1637422151" xml:lang="EN-US">HanaPets come in all shapes and sizes, with their own unique personalities as well. There’s your HanaPet Kira, who is quite cat-like and has a lot to say, and I saw one that was a shark swimming through the air. &nbsp;</p>



<p paraeid="{fe7086e1-21c3-4f2d-bdee-e599a2edc5dd}{106}" paraid="1797208579" xml:lang="EN-US">Instead of battles, you’ll calibrate HanaPets for people as you deliver them. Those come in the form of a series of minigames that are very reminiscent of <em>WarioWare</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{c4991f8b-ccd0-46c2-9c70-beea2366bfe4}{105}" paraid="239729365" xml:lang="EN-US">Each one only lasts a few seconds at most. For example, in one you have to land your parachute guy in the correct area. In another, you use a brush to clean up a dog quickly.&nbsp;</p>

<h2 paraeid="{c4991f8b-ccd0-46c2-9c70-beea2366bfe4}{105}" paraid="239729365" xml:lang="EN-US">A Big Map To Explore</h2>

<p paraeid="{10032f3f-205f-48fd-9b21-b2e7c3a2efa8}{134}" paraid="718244314" xml:lang="EN-US">Most of your time, though, will be spent traveling around the fairly large world of Sapphire Valley. <em>Petal Runner </em>will feature four distinct neighborhoods that you drive through and to on your motorcycle. &nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{e7148687-3ba1-4081-a847-abe8dd14ea3e}{71}" paraid="764631281" xml:lang="EN-US">Each neighborhood will have its own sort of color palette and distinct design, too. It's not just one big sprawling city that is sort of samey, but each neighborhood will have its own personality and look to it.</p>

<p paraeid="{e7148687-3ba1-4081-a847-abe8dd14ea3e}{71}" paraid="764631281" xml:lang="EN-US">You'll have plenty of reason to travel in making deliveries, too, as there are a lot of secrets, sidequests, and side characters to befriend. Exploration is encouraged and rewarded, as just soaking in the world is the biggest appeal of these sort of games.</p>



<p paraeid="{e7148687-3ba1-4081-a847-abe8dd14ea3e}{188}" paraid="73521114" xml:lang="EN-US">I was only given access to a small portion of one neighborhood in my demo, but it had so much for me to see and do. People were boundless, shops and buildings all over, and little paths that are slightly hidden were everywhere Greer said it was a blast to design the world and fill its spaces with a lot of fun interactable characters and items.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{846fb01a-19d7-42b3-8579-091e419aa9e3}{25}" paraid="1917473999" xml:lang="EN-US">One of the areas I had access to was a mall, full of stores I could walk into and interact with customers and shopkeepers. There were shops for music, HanaPets, accessories, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p paraeid="{3d2877fa-b57c-4e2f-b241-0260da76da1b}{132}" paraid="1218408175" xml:lang="EN-US">It was a great nostalgic trip to the Game Boy years of something like <em>Pokemon</em>, with an elevated pixel art that they can get away with on today's technology. A lot of charm was packed into not a lot of pixels.</p>

<h2 paraeid="{3d2877fa-b57c-4e2f-b241-0260da76da1b}{132}" paraid="1218408175" xml:lang="EN-US">Petal Runner Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/spine-preview-gun-fu-more-like-fun-fu</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/spine-preview-gun-fu-more-like-fun-fu.1216521/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/spine-preview-gun-fu-more-like-fun-fu<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Spine&nbsp;</em>is a gun fu-style action game developed by Nekki, known for the <em>Shadow Fight</em>&nbsp;series. Nekki, a team composed of animation fans, wanted to push its games to the next level by going hard on animations. Deeply inspired by creators like John Woo and films such as&nbsp;<em>John Wick, Spine</em>&nbsp;is an exhilarating one-stop shop for all things action.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We were able to get some hands-on time with&nbsp;<em>Spine&nbsp;</em>during Summer Game Fest 2025. With a developer sitting by my side during the duration, I learned&nbsp;enough about&nbsp;<em>Spine&nbsp;</em>to have me eagerly anticipating its eventual release.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>A Strong Backbone&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Described as a "rollercoaster of gun-fu,"&nbsp;<em>Spine</em>&nbsp;is an adrenaline junky's dream. While much of its inspiration comes from the aforementioned film and filmmakers, the gameplay takes notes from the highly coveted&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham</em>&nbsp;series.</p>

<p>Nekki is succeeding creating fluid combat that made&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham</em>&nbsp;such a hit. Non-stop, weighty but smooth fighting against seemingly insurmountable odds.&nbsp;<em>Spine</em>'s badass heroine takes on dozens of armed thugs without flinching, fulfilling the power fantasy that lingers in all of us.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The demo essentially guides us through a series of enemy encounters. In a tense cutscene taking place within a bar, shit goes down and heroine Redline jumps into the fray. Armed thugs try to surround her, but her reflexes are superhuman with her "Spine" implant. Like&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham</em>, there's a notification when you're about to get hit, giving you time to act.</p>



<p>Though,&nbsp;<em>Spine</em>&nbsp;is very proactive in combat rather than reactive. Instead of waiting for the enemy, you need to jump in and take them out. Beat them up enough and you can do a cinematic finisher involving your gun and/or fists. In many of these brutal executions, she takes these goons out with a close-ranged shot to the head.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In combat, you're also able to use your pistol on enemies no matter the range.&nbsp;<em>Spine</em>&nbsp;does ask you to suspend your disbelief a bit -- pistols don't seem to do as much damage as your punches -- but it's fun to string a few shots together while beating down on enemies.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Locked and Loaded</h2>

<p>During one sequence in the demo, the camera perspective changes from typical third-person POV to overhead. Fans of&nbsp;<em>John Wick 4</em>&nbsp;will immediately see the similarities, and it's just an exhilarating sequence as the music ramps up and you utilize a powerful shotgun against your foes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is but one instance where developer Nekki hopes to surprise players by introducing new spectacles. A scene where you control Redline from the perspective of CCTV footage was teased, which sounds like another exciting scene.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previously I mentioned shotgun, so know that there isn't just a pistol --&nbsp; there are other weapons too.&nbsp;<em>Spine</em>&nbsp;will feature four main styles of gun fu, so depending on your weapon, your moveset changes a bit. Though, in the case of the shotgun, its ammo is limited. The pistol, however, seems to remain with you when you run out of shotgun (or other weapon types') ammo.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though it doesn't seem like a requirement to do well in combat,&nbsp;<em>Spine&nbsp;</em>also features a parry system. You can parry regular, non-projectile attacks, but for some enemies with guns, you can also counter those. In some instances, you're able to chain together these parries and take out multiple foes in quick succession, which is immensely satisfying.</p>



<h2><em>Spine&nbsp;</em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Our demo ends with a boss battle against a spindly agent with night vision goggles akin to spider eyes. The spider theme is fitting here, as while we dodge the boss's sword attacks, spider mines start coming out, which is another element to dodge around and avoid.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's a tough fight, but one Redline is more than equipped to deal with. It's a satisfying conclusion to the relatively quick demo. There isn't a single dull moment in&nbsp;<em>Spine</em>, and I hope the rest of the game is just the same way. The developer is aiming for around 10 hours of play, which sounds like the perfect length for a bombastic game such as this.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizkids-announces-official-dungeons-dragons-potato-head-beholder-miniature-coming-to<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizkids has announced an official <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> Potato Head Beholder miniature. After creating a Potato Head toy based on the iconic monster, the studio is producing a miniature version for gaming tables and selling it exclusively at the Origins Game Fair.</p>



<p>According to an official press release, there will be two versions of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Potato Head Beholder miniature. The first of these miniatures is an event-exclusive version for those attending Origins Game Fair this year. Origins Game Fair is one of the oldest tabletop conventions in the industry, and it is hosted by one of the biggest tabletop associations, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gama-expo-will-be-moving-to-baltimore-in-future" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GAMA</a>.</p>

It's a miniature of a Beholder, one of the scariest monsters in the world's most popular TTRPG, reimagined in a fun, more starchy form. Much like the Potato Head toyline, the miniature even includes attachable accessories to make the monster your own.</p>

<p>There's even an air of hilarity with this version of the miniature sporting a wizard's hat. Beholders in the world of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> are terrifying creatures. They are highly intelligent, incredibly vain, and can cast a deadly arsenal of rays from their eye stalks. But the one thing they cannot do, no matter what, is cast magic. Just don't say that to one unless you want to end up a pile of ash.</p>

This version is a more conventional take on the Potato Head monster concept. It includes the more iconic Potato Head accessories like the top hat, moustache, and giant glasses. It also has a set of scary teeth if your DM wants to make it especially mean.</p>

<p>The retail version of the Dungeons &amp; Dragons Potato Head Beholder miniature is available for pre-order now.</p>
