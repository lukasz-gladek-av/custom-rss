            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gold-point-scheme-ending-march<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that its Gold Points reward scheme will be coming to an end in March, but you'll still be able to spend the points you've accrued after the closing date.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/news/7db7f9327a48ec83" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official announcement</a> on its website, the Japanese gaming giant says you'll no longer earn Gold Points for Switch purchases after March 25th. However, since Gold Points expire twelve months after purchase, any you have left over will still be valid until a year after you acquired them.</p>

<p>Naturally, this means that not only will you not be able to earn Gold Points through buying games on Switch, but you also won't get them through Nintendo's website or through redeemed download codes anymore.</p>

<p>However, if you cancel that pre-order, then you won't get Gold Points anymore, even if you re-up your pre-order at some point later down the line. Bear that in mind if you're umming and ahhing about one of your pre-orders right now.</p>

<p>Nintendo confirms later in the announcement post that you'll still be able to spend your Gold Points for up to a year after you get them, even if you're spending them after the cutoff date. You just won't earn any more from that point onwards.</p>

<p>No reason is given in the post for Nintendo's decision to end the Gold Point scheme, but I'm assuming that it has something to do with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">impending arrival of the Switch 2</a>, which may bring a scheme that replaces Gold Points with it.</p>

You can then use those points to get discounts on future store purchases.</p>

<p>If you're thinking of buying anything on Switch, it's probably best to do it before March 25th so you can get your hands on those sweet, sweet Gold Points. Stay tuned for more.</p>
