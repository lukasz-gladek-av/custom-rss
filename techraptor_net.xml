You're not a settler, and you haven't crash-landed — you're expendable prison labor sent to tame a new world for the benefit of distant, heartless corporations. Welcome to the comically bleak world of <em>StarRupture</em>!</p><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/starrupture" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b3eb7ef1-31bd-43e4-bd15-aa4e8990ab75" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>StarRupture</em></a> is the second game from Creepy Jar, a game developer best known for their survival crafting game <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/green-hell" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d60f8f93-57ae-418f-9999-eebdf6c54d21" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Green Hell</em></a>.

<figcaption>Your food and water needs can be satisfied by collecting alien plants or finding food as loot in abandoned structures. Unfortunately, there's no real farming system yet.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Living on a Prison Planet</h2><p>While the player character in <em>StarRupture</em> is thematically a prisoner, you functionally get the same sort of standard survival crafting experience that you might expect. You'll need to gather materials, craft items, consume food and water, and survive both environmental dangers and hostile fauna.</p><p><em>StarRupture</em> stands out a bit from other games in the genre by featuring a manufacturing system rather than a simple crafting system. This makes it a bit closer to games such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/satisfactory" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ad287941-87b4-47ba-9bfa-1184bd27b53c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Satisfactory</em></a>. A handful of items can be made on demand at indoor crafting stations, but you'll be making most of your stuff using gigantic machines outdoors.</p><p>That's not to say you'll be stuck at your base all day; there's a fairly large open-world area to explore, bordered by a combination of impassable mountains and a cloud of radiation. You can find resource deposits, dead bodies, lost shipping drones, and even entire abandoned facilities that will have useful loot for you to collect.</p><p>Unfortunately, you're not alone on this world — hostile bug-like creatures populate most of the region outside of the starting area. The star of this solar system periodically erupts into a devastating wave of fire every now and again, burning the entire surface of the planet and instantly killing you if you're not safely inside a structure.</p><p>Suffice it to say, there's plenty to do and a lot of area to explore in <em>StarRupture</em> at first glance. I've explored nearly the entire playable space over approximately 60 hours of gameplay, and I now have somewhat more mixed feelings about the overall experience in the Early Access launch version of the game.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Sadly, StarRupture lacks the robust survival system of Green Hell; instead, we get something a little more standard for the genre.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Stepping Back from <em>Green Hell's </em>Survival</h2><p>Naturally, the second game from a developer invites comparison to the first game. <em>Green Hell</em> and <em>StarRupture</em> both have survival elements, and I was somewhat disappointed to see Creepy Jar tone down the complexity of survival mechanics in <em>StarRupture</em>.</p><p>If you haven't played <em>Green Hell</em>, it arguably has one of the better survival systems out there, despite being seven years old. There is no "food" meter, for example — you need to supply your character with a mix of protein, fats, and carbs to stay healthy. (Of course, you also need to stay hydrated as well.)</p><p>This same depth of detail applies to injuries and diseases. There are a bunch of different ways that you can get sick or injured in <em>Green Hell</em>, and several different types of medicine or first aid need to be correctly applied to cure your ills. Sanity is a factor, too; if your health is poor, you'll start to go a bit loopy and begin hallucinating.</p><blockquote><p>Creepy Jar created some truly fun and engaging survival mechanics in Green Hell, and replacing them with simpler survival systems in StarRupture is a massive step backward.</p></blockquote><p>With that knowledge in mind, I was excited for the possibilities of <em>StarRupture's</em> survival system. Surely, strange diseases and psychological hazards would be a concern on an alien planet — especially when you're literally on the ground by yourself with no other humans to help you.</p><p>Sadly, the survival mechanics in <em>StarRupture</em> aren't all that different from most other survival games. You need to manage health, hunger, and thirst, along with a "toxicity" metric that can build up from eating certain foods. Diseases requiring specialized treatment are replaced with simpler debuffs that can often be healed by waiting them out.</p><p>I was disappointed with this discovery, to say the least. Creepy Jar created some truly fun and engaging survival mechanics in <em>Green Hell</em>, and replacing them with simpler survival systems in <em>StarRupture</em> is a massive step backward.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The rail system for transporting items between factory machines is prone to jamming and difficult to set up for complex manufacturing.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Manufacturing's a Mess</h2><p>Manufacturing and crafting are a big part of <em>StarRupture</em>. In fact, you wouldn't really be able to unlock new technology without setting up a factory to automate your crafting. Building factories to make items at scale is an important part of gameplay. Unfortunately, it has some seriously rough edges.</p><p>Your factory starts at ore deposits where machines will mine up raw ore. This raw ore is processed into bars with smelters, and these bars of material are subsequently moved to other machines (such as furnaces and fabricators) to make them into more complex materials.</p><p>Some of the mid-game items require multiple stages of manufacturing. Let's use the "Rotor" item as an example. You'll need to mine Titanium and Wolfram ore and process both of those into bars. You must then make Titanium Rods and Wolfram Wire at fabricators, and then combine Titanium Rods and Wolfram Wire in another fabricator.</p><p>The problem is the way items are transported between machines. Instead of conveyor belts, <em>StarRupture</em> uses small drones traveling along rails akin to small trains. It is difficult to design a rail system like this in such a way that items can criss-cross over each other to reach different machines without a lot of overengineering.</p><blockquote><p>The rail system in StarRupture is such a pain to use that it's easiest to simply destroy and rebuild your setup each time you need to make a new item.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Another issue with the rail system is that there is no easy way to purge leftover items; you have to jump up next to any leftover items and manually remove them. Sometimes, items won't disappear at all, and you'll have to destroy your rails and place them elsewhere to get around this bugged item.</p><p>Finally, and perhaps most critically, there is no remote control for these machines. You need to go to each machine, start the manufacturing process, and then move down the line for each subsequent machine. These systems should be remotely controllable from a console so you don't have to run around everywhere, but they're not.</p><p>In other games, you can design a factory system in such a way that you can make different items without having to rebuild your item transportation system. The rail system in <em>StarRupture</em> is such a pain to use that it's easiest to simply destroy and rebuild your setup each time you need to make a new item. This feels like suboptimal game design.</p><figure role="group">

<h2><em>StarRupture</em> Early Access Preview | Final Thoughts</h2><p>From what I've seen, the foundations of a good game are there with <em>StarRupture</em>, despite its flaws. The manufacturing system is fun enough despite the quirks of the rail transport system. Running around fighting bugs is plenty entertaining.</p><p>That said, there's one major thing lacking at launch: a story. There's not much guidance once you get past the tutorial. You can explore the world and find some lore at points of interest, but there really isn't much to do beyond progressing your corporation reputation by manufacturing the next tier of items.</p><p>You can see machines and structures in the deadly radioactive cloud surrounding the playable area; this suggests that we'll see the playable area expand in the future. However, not much has been done with the fairly large game world as it stands now.</p><p><em>Green Hell</em> had an engaging, interesting story, and I'm sure Creepy Jar will eventually deliver the same for <em>StarRupture</em>. Still, the game as it stands now is a slightly wonky factory base-building game with a game world mostly devoid of significant stuff to do.</p><p><em>StarRupture</em> is worth checking out if you're one of those factory game nerds who have a few hundred hours in <em>Factorio</em> or if you're looking for a bit of a diversion by exploring a new setting for a few hours. If that's not you, it may be best to wait for the gameplay and story to be fleshed out a bit more in a future update.</p><hr><p><em>StarRupture</em> was previewed over approximately 60 hours of gameplay on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1631270/StarRupture/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> with a key provided by the publisher.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Grandfather Nurgle, the Chaos god of plagues, disease, rot, and rebirth, gets a new Battletome for <em>Age of Sigmar</em> 4th Edition, along with a whole host of new units to share Nurgle's gifts with the realms. In this article, we take a look at some of the brand new units and a new Regiment of Renown.</p><p>We've been covering <em>Age of Sigmar</em> for a while, and you can read our review of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-review-perfect-starter-set" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Skaventide</a>, the launch box for <em>AoS</em> 4th edition, along with our guide to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/how-to-get-started-with-age-of-sigmar-4th-edition-with-spearhead" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Spearhead</a> <em>AoS</em> gameplay format. We also recently reviewed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-quest-darkwater-review-cant-stop-rot" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Quest Darkwater</a>, which features several of the new units in the new battletome.</p>
<p>The Maggotkin of Nurgle all serve the Chaos god Nurgle, the god of disease, decay, despair, destruction, death, and rebirth. Their units usually appear covered in rot and decay, but also show signs of rebirth, and have new things growing out of them. This decay and rebirth, as part of the circle of life, make the Maggotkin extremely durable with high health and extra saves, but at the cost of mobility, as they plod slowly forward, relying on their resilience to get them into the fight, rather than speed.</p><p>The Maggotkin's new Battletome includes background for the Plaguefather's forces, warscrolls for returning and new units, a brand new Spearhead force, Path to Glory rules for creating your own hero, 2 armies of renown, and 2 regiments of renown (and we discuss one of them, The Pustules below).</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Festus The Leechlord</h2><p>Festus the Leechlord is a new daemon prince for the Maggotkin. This former healer fell into Nurlge's clutches because he was obsessed with research, which led the Chaos god himself to train Festus. He rides a massive slug, Gathoblyt, into battle, which also keeps his workshop within reach so that he can create new poisons to use against his foes.</p><p>Festus can cast The Leechlord's Curse on an enemy, which has a chance to deal mortal wounds and heal Festus for each wound dealt, every time that unit uses a core ability or command. He can also poison units he is in combat with, dealing wounds to heroes and monsters, or simply slaying a model in a unit outright on a command roll off, and if any units in combat with Festus are slain, he gains D3 Leech points, which boost his command stat by the number he has.</p><p>Festus' model isn't particularly imposing, not when compared to the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-review-infernal-reinforcements" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Urak Taar</a>, but it is a solid miniature, full of thematic detail that captures the mobile tainted apothecary.</p><picture>

This gives them a sweat-soaked and reeking ability, which stops units that have charged and are in combat with them from using commands on a 3+. The Rotswords come armed with Ruined Master Crafted weapons that have 2 attacks and deal 2 hits on a crit.</p><figure role="group">

Still mounted on their now corrupted steeds, they have 2 attacks dealing 3 damage on the charge, and their Pall of Exhaustion ability can give a unit they're in combat with Strike Last on a 3+.</p><p>The Sloven Knights come in a box of 3 fixed builds with different head options.

They're extremely effective against wizards and priests, with their Discomforting Stench ability, which can make it more difficult for a targeting wizard or priest to use their spells and blessings by rolling over their power level. They're also armed with Pox-blighed weapons with 4 attacks, and rend 2 against priests and wizards.</p><p>The Putrid Blightkings come in a box of 5, with mainly fixed builds except for the 2 head options for the Champion, and the option to build a Standard Bearer, or normal Blightking.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>The Pustules</h2><p>The Pustules are a Maggotkin Regiment of Renown, and the box comes with 10 Plaguebearers, a Spoilpox Scrivener, and a Feculent Gnarlmaw. The Spoilpox Scrivener is also available separately in this wave of releases, having only been available in the Spearhead box before. This Regiment of Renown can be included in forces from the other 3 Chaos gods (Blades of Khorne, Disciples of Tzeentch, Headonites of Slaneesh), or in Slaves to Darkness, Skaven, or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-review-let-fire-duardin-of-war" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Helsmiths of Hashut</a> armies.</p><p>Normally, Nurgle's Plaguebearers are more difficult for enemies to hit while they're contesting an objective, and the Spoilpox Scrivener can boost their Control Score to help win that objective. The Gnarlmaw is a terrain feature that deploys at the start of the battle, and can heal the Plaguebearers if they are within 12 inches of it, and can return slain models if they are contesting an objective for some overlapping synergies to make sure your Plaguebearers dominate the objective their sitting on.</p><picture>

The only ones that don't make an appearance are Mulgoth the Cleaver and the Blight Templars, with the following releases in boxes we detail below.</p><ul><li>Court of Gelgus Pust - Gelgus comes in a box along with Belga the Cystwitch and Shaman Foulhoof. Gelgus comes armed with Malady and Contagion, which have 7 attacks with 3 damage each, and once per game, he can pollute a terrain feature that boosts the healing of nearby friendly units and reduces the healing of nearby enemy units. Belga can deal mortal wounds to diseased enemy units within 18 inches, and enemies removed by that ability can return slain Plaguebearers to the battlefield. Foulhoof can boost the attacks of nearby Pestigor units, which also get a release in this wave.</li><li>Pestigors - Pestigors are the beastmen of Nurgle, and come in boxes of 10. They are just as durable as their Nurgle brethren, with an additional save. They each have 2 attacks and gain Rend 1 within their own territory. Foulhood can boost those attacks to 3 to make them very capable.</li><li>Cankerborn - The Cankerborn come in a box of 2, and you get 2 objective miniatures, which are used to mark objectives or terrain at the end of any turn with Pesilent Pollutants. The Cankerborn can use the Pollutants to teleport around the battlefield in their movement phase. They each have 4 attacks dealing 3 damage and dealing mortal wounds on crits.</li><li>Pox-Wretches - Pox-Wretches come in a box of 14, with 6 Mire Kelpie tokens, which the Pox-Wretches can remove to try and give a unit they're in combat with the Diseased keyword. The Diseased keyword plays into the Maggotkin of Nurgles' faction abilities, like the Blessed by the Plaguefather ability, which deals 1 mortal wound to all enemy units if all enemies have the Diseased keyword.</li></ul><h2>Age of Sigmar Maggotkin of Nurgle Units Final Thoughts?</h2><p>I've always been a fan of the Plaguefather's forces. I love the detail that the 2 ranges miniatures have (<em>AoS</em> and <em>40K</em>), and these new sculpts are no different. I've always been respectful of their resilience, having come across them many times playing <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>. It also pleases me that the releases come hot off the back of the release of <em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> and that the units are available so soon after, rather than being locked behind a separate game.&nbsp;</p><p>The new Maggotkin of Nurgle units have a lot of synergies on the battlefield, through the common goal of spreading disease to empower other abilities, and through local abilities like Foulhoof boosting the Pestigors. The Pustules regiment of renown is a lot of fun, and making the Plaguebearers even more resilient than normal is very satisfying. The whole wave of new release miniatures is full of fantastic detail, but the Sloven Knights and the Rotswords musician are my favourites.</p><hr><p><em>The copies of</em> <strong>The Age of Sigmar Maggotkin of Nurgle releases&nbsp;</strong><em>used to produce this review were provided by Games Workshop.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>
