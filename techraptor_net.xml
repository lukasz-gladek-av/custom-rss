            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-game-launch-sales-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report claims that launch numbers for third-party games available on the newly-released Nintendo Switch 2 aren't great, and that customers seem to be favoring Nintendo's own games rather than those by publishers like Capcom, CD Projekt, and Sega.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/it-was-the-biggest-console-launch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Game Business</a>, around 62% of physical Switch 2 game sales in the US during the console's launch week were for first-party games, and that doesn't include the&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>console bundle, which comes complete with a digital copy of the racer.</p>

<p>The Game Business notes that "one third-party publisher" (who the publication doesn't name) referred to Switch 2 launch sales as "below our lowest estimates", so it sounds like non-Nintendo publishers releasing games on the Switch 2 aren't happy with sales so far.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-launch-numbers-cyberpunk-2077.jpg?itok=us_KQx7O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-launch-numbers-cyberpunk-2077.jpg?itok=MWkIhCl- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>is one of the Nintendo Switch 2's third-party launch titles.</figcaption></figure><p>As The Game Business points out, while Switch 2 third-party numbers might look better than the original Switch's figures (81% physical first-party during the launch month), those figures should come with some caveats.</p>

<p>More third-party games launched alongside the Switch 2 - thirteen versus the original console's five - and the Switch 2 has also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-fastest-selling-nintendo-console" rel="nofollow">sold more consoles than the original machine did</a> during the same time period, so the higher percentage doesn't tell the whole story.</p>

<p>It's difficult to know what, if anything, these figures portend. Many of the Switch 2's third-party titles are several years old, meaning a lot of people will probably already have had their fill of them.</p>

<p>Additionally, the Switch 2's strange Game Key Card system, which means that many publishers don't actually include full game files on their Switch 2 carts, may have put off buyers from picking up games on Nintendo's platform. It's difficult to say without more in-depth qualitative data, of course.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2-third-party-launch-sales.jpg?itok=TXSQb1zp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-kart-world-nintendo-switch-2-third-party-launch-sales.jpg?itok=c5GTUjW7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>has done predictably well for Nintendo, even if third-party sales are floundering.</figcaption></figure><p>As newer Switch 2 games and third-party exclusives (assuming such releases are planned by publishers) begin to arrive, we'll probably get a more complete picture of how people feel about Switch 2 third-party titles.</p>

<p>Still, Nintendo probably isn't too worried; it's always the company's first-party releases that do the best on Nintendo hardware, and as long as games like<i>&nbsp;Mario Kart World</i>, the two&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>Switch 2 Editions, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow">the upcoming&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>&nbsp;</em>enjoy strong sales, Nintendo probably won't sweat too much.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-powerwash-simulator-2-gameplay-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>FuturLab has released a brand new&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>gameplay trailer, and it shows off some of the game's new features, as well as the little cat you can presumably pet to your heart's content.</p>

<p>Naturally, if you're expecting&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>to serve as a significant reinvention of the wheel, you might be disappointed. If, however, you're after more refined and more satisfying cleaning gameplay, it looks like FuturLab has you covered.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rLMus-sx1I" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new trailer</a> kicks off with the player spraying some filthy structures with the titular power washer, including a teapot-shaped building, a still-operational fairground (surely a safety hazard?), and a car that looks like it desperately needs the TLC.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-new-gameplay-trailer-spraying.jpg?itok=brerRuib 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-new-gameplay-trailer-spraying.jpg?itok=kwVJKTgC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will bring more of the satisfying cleaning gameplay you know and love.</figcaption></figure><p>While much of the gameplay looks similar to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/powerwash-simulator" rel="nofollow">the first game</a>,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will boast some innovations as well.</p>

<p>We get to see the player sitting in a chair on wires to reach harder spots (sorry, cleaning aficionados, but I'm not sure what this contraption is called), and we also get to see a window-cleaning platform extending to help with trickier places.</p>

<p>Towards the end of the trailer, we get to see the player customizing their base by hosing down a piano (which I wouldn't necessarily recommend doing in real life) before rotating it and placing it in their ideal spot. The trailer also shows off&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>'s new co-op mode, which will let you take on tough cleaning jobs with a friend.</p>

<p>Finally, and perhaps most excitingly,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will let you pet Ulysses the cat. Ulysses made an appearance in the original game, but you couldn't pet them, which I think is an actual breach of the law. Thankfully, that egregious oversight has been rectified in the sequel.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-new-gameplay-trailer-co-op.jpg?itok=CRoi9XSm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-new-gameplay-trailer-co-op.jpg?itok=ZYOfuM6D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will feature co-op play, as well as a cat you can pet (not pictured).</figcaption></figure><p><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-2-2025" rel="nofollow">announced back in March</a>. It'll serve as a sequel to the original game, which has attracted a cult following thanks to its soothing gameplay and breadth of jobs to complete.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>yet, but when it launches, it's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968420/PowerWash_Simulator_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011314" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/powerwash-simulator-2/9p45ggdtfnsm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> (no word of a Switch 2 port yet).</p>
