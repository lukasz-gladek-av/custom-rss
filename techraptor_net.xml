            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-anna-williams-dlc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has revealed that the next&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>DLC fighter, as well as the first one to join the game's roster as part of its second season, is none other than Nina Williams' deadly sister Anna.</p>

<p>As part of&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s first season of DLC characters, iconic fighters like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-heihachi-mishima-dlc-release-date" rel="nofollow">Heihachi Mishima</a>, capoeira dancer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-reveals-eddy-gordo-as-first-dlc-character-alongside-season-pass-1-roadmap" rel="nofollow">Eddy Gordo</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>'s Clive Rosfield, and Bandai Namco is continuing to add classic&nbsp;<em>Tekken&nbsp;</em>characters to&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s roster with its second season.</p>

<p>Introduced as "Scarlet Lightning" in her debut trailer, Anna proceeds to beat seven bells out of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-victor-chevalier-reveal" rel="nofollow">French agent Victor Chevalier</a>, who's voiced by none other than acting legend Vincent Cassel.</p>

<p>After battling Victor, Anna moves on to taking on Polish Prime Minister (in the game, of course, not in real life) and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-lidia-release-date" rel="nofollow">fellow DLC fighter</a> Lidia Sobieska. As you'd expect given that this is Anna's trailer, the assassin makes short work of Lidia.</p>

<p>Finally, in a showdown for the ages, Anna gets to take on her sister Nina, who once again takes a beating from Anna. We also get to see Anna's Rage Art, which sees her summoning a helicopter to provide fire support as she blasts her opponent with Lovely Tom.</p>

<p>Anna will be released for&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>on April 3rd, with three-day early access available on March 31st for those who purchase the game's second season pass. You can see Anna in action via her debut trailer right here.</p>




<p>The second round of&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>DLC will include not only Anna, but also three more characters, as well as two extra stages. The first stage will arrive in summer, as will the next character after Anna. One more character will arrive in fall, and in winter, the season's final character and stage will launch.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-konami-new-game-ip</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-2-remake-studio-bloober-team-working-with-konami-on-new-game.1118211/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-konami-new-game-ip<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake developer Bloober Team has announced that it's working on another project alongside Konami, and that the game will be based on Konami's intellectual property.</p>

<p>In a press <a href="https://blooberteam.prowly.com/383560-bloober-team-and-konami-continue-their-collaboration" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">release</a>, Bloober says it's "focusing on a new game based on Konami's IP" and that details of the project "remain a mystery" right now. The studio goes on to say it "can't reveal too many details at this time" but that fans will be "just as excited" about the collaboration as Bloober is.</p>

<p>It's interesting that Bloober is remaining cagey about exactly what IP it's working on. The obvious choice would, of course, be&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>; perhaps the team has been selected to develop another remake. Still, it's a little odd Bloober would play those cards so close to its chest given its work on&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloober-team-konami-new-game-silent-hill-2.jpg?itok=vItbk2rq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloober-team-konami-new-game-silent-hill-2.jpg?itok=Uhp93h6U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bloober Team is working on another game based on Konami IP, and it may or may not be&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Given Bloober Team's penchant for horror, it doesn't feel like any other IP makes sense; I can't quite picture a Bloober Team&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid&nbsp;</em>game, for instance, although<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>might be a slightly easier pitch.</p>

<p>If you ask me, I think it'll likely be a remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>. Remaking the third game before the first makes no sense to me since they share plot elements, and while I'd love&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 4: The Room&nbsp;</em>to get a remake, it hasn't been that long since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-4-room-comes-to-gog-for-gogs-12th-anniversary" rel="nofollow">the game was re-released on PC</a>.</p>

<p>Either way, picking Bloober Team to work on a new Konami game makes sense given their first collaboration's success; Konami recently revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">topped two million sales worldwide</a>,&nbsp;</p>




<p>It's been a pretty active time for Konami recently in terms of its major franchises. After many years of dormancy, the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake launched in October, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-and-more-all-but-confirmed" rel="nofollow">more&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>projects are on the way</a>&nbsp;as well.</p>

<p>Not only that, but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">in August</a>, Konami will release&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, a full remake of the 2004 stealth-action classic built in Unreal Engine 5 and sporting revamped gameplay.</p>

<p>Now, all Konami needs to do to complete the trifecta of my childhood dreams is to revive&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>. It's been so long that I'd even take a remake at this point, although I'd prefer an entirely new game, of course. Stay tuned for more!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dauntless Shutting Down in May, Phoenix Labs Reveals]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-shutting-down-in-may</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dauntless-shutting-down-in-may-phoenix-labs-reveals.1118187/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-shutting-down-in-may<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Phoenix Labs has announced that multiplayer monster-hunting action RPG&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>will shut down in May, and while the studio hasn't given a concrete reason for the game shutting down, it's easy to guess why it's happening.</p>

<p>In a rather terse&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/331370/view/503943474819631342" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on Steam, Phoenix Labs simply says that&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>will shut down on May 29th and that it will receive "no additional content or updates". From May 29th, you'll no longer be able to play&nbsp;<em>Dauntless</em>.</p>

<p>It sounds like not only will there be no new content after the shutdown (naturally), but that the game won't be getting any major updates before then, either. In short,&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>is basically a dead game walking at this point.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dauntless-shutting-down-monster.jpg?itok=iWDvQy2c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dauntless-shutting-down-monster.jpg?itok=Czum_WmI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>will shut down in May.</figcaption></figure><p>So, why is&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>shutting down? Well, while Phoenix Labs doesn't give a reason (in either the official announcement or in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dauntless/comments/1ix9232/its_finally_over/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a Discord message</a> sent to players, apparently), we can make a very strong educated guess.</p>

<p>A quick look at&nbsp;<em>Dauntless</em>' Steam numbers (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/331370/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, as usual) shows an active player count of just 61, with 107 players checking into the game over the last 24 hours. It's clear players aren't exactly flocking to&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>right now.</p>

<p>A major reason for that is likely the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-awakening-update-apology" rel="nofollow">controversial Awakening update</a>, which was released in December and which quickly drew the ire of players.&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>fans criticized the update's approach to monetization and progression, among other things.</p>

<p>Following the Awakening update's poor reception, Phoenix Labs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-developer-phoenix-labs-more-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off "the majority" of its staff</a>, leaving the future of games like&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>uncertain. Now, the future of at least one of those games is a lot clearer.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>, it's unclear whether support will continue for the cozy farming sim. Phoenix Labs isn't shutting down just yet, after all, although things aren't looking good for the studio.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you need a monster hunting fix, you might want to check in with Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which launches later this week. Our own Tyler <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier" rel="nofollow">was impressed with the game</a>, so it might well fill that&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>hole for you.</p>
