            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the last few years alone, players have been treated to gaming excellence that can be explored and completed in a single gaming session (or night, if preferred), and there's a new title to be added, but simply not ignored: <em>UMAMI</em>. While the word itself is commonly used to describe the savoriness of a dish, it's also the name given to developer Mimmox's debut release, and yes, food is most certainly involved!</p>

<p>The game's developer did not shy away from delivering us with extravagant yet mouth-watering... puzzles (and yes, you've read correctly). Puzzles that look like some popular real-world dishes. So, after a few hours of puzzle-solving and building quite the appetite, did the developer cook something delicious with <em>UMAMI</em> worthy of a five-star rating?</p>

<h2>First Puzzling Encounter For A Hungry Mind</h2>

<p><em>UMAMI</em> is the delectable debut game from developer&nbsp;Mimmox, in which it equally challenges and makes one quite hungry over its scrumptious food-centric dioramas. It doesn't overstay its welcome when it comes to solving the puzzles, which is a great thing, but it's also very streamlined in its gameplay design and mechanics, and it packs on the cozy vibes for a stress-free experience (no hair-pulling needed).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/umami-screenshot-1075.jpg?itok=rPGqyqzT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/umami-screenshot-1075.jpg?itok=HxcfLQ79 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>We wonder just how puzzingly difficult it can be to assemble a hamburger?&nbsp;(Picture: Mimmox / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Each&nbsp;diorama featured in <em>UMAMI</em>&nbsp;has a unique theme and an associated master chef credited beside their tasty masterpieces, ranging from a purrfect hamburrrger to honey-drenched waffles, to towering stacks of sushi, and a spooky apple pie. Players must position every eye-watering piece to the diorama using a reference image of the completed&nbsp;puzzle by playing around with each puzzle piece, rotating and placing them.</p>

<p>There may not be an overarching story involved, other than the bite-sized descriptions of the themed dioramas to solve and the outstanding (and creative) chefs behind their creations. Nevertheless, players can bask in a delightful yet soothing gameplay environment while puzzle-solving, with no time limits and no added pressure, but all the time to spare in a single evening or over a weekend, relaxing over some appetizing puzzles.</p>

<h2>Let Us Cook!</h2>

<p>As alluded to, <em>UMAMI</em> is a 3D puzzle experience with warm and inviting, cozy vibes that remove the gloves and restrictions for a relaxing, puzzling solving experience. The best and adequate description of this 3D cozy puzzle game is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/overcooked-review-culinary-triumph" rel="nofollow"><em>Overcooked</em></a>, with mechanics akin to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/fez-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Fez</em></a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/little-to-left-review" rel="nofollow"><em>A Little to the Left</em></a> (and borrowing the latter's cozy vibes).</p>

<p>Like many 3D puzzle games, <em>UMAMI</em> features key elements and gameplay mechanics designed for a stress-free gaming experience as players move from one deliciously enticing puzzle to the next, cooked up by the talented animal chefs for us to behold. Movement-based mechanics is one such key element, as players are free to move or change their position to assist in solving each diorama, which extends to moving each puzzle piece by playing around with them and rotating them to discover the correct orientation.</p>

<p>Granted, it will take players some time to determine its correct orientation&nbsp;after playing around and rotating each puzzle piece, before they can place the piece onto a 3D diorama structure. Luckily, we didn't go into every puzzle blind, as the developer has kindly provided us with a reference image featuring the solved diorama, including the front and back positions, to further aid players in locating those key pieces and placing them in their correct position on the diorama structure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/umami-screenshot-1074.jpg?itok=rqzLjhPf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/umami-screenshot-1074.jpg?itok=yX7R_Je6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>If you need further help in solving this tasty diorama, click the puzzle piece in the top right corner for some clues or hints. (Picture: Mimmox / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>This added detail has certainly come in handy even after spending minutes staring point-blank at the puzzle pieces and the structure, especially on the levels where many pieces look all too familiar. After completing a diorama, the next one will immediately unlock, and it's pretty much "rinse and repeat" until all 15 beautifully hand-designed levels are completed.</p>

<p>A little delicious mention is that there are a few secrets to be discovered on every level, adding yet another unique touch to this cozy puzzle experience. As for what secrets exactly can be found, all we can say is that there are animal friends that appear in some levels and cards, so our lips are sealed.</p>

<h2>Is Fresh Or Rotten?</h2>

<p>There aren't many drawbacks regarding this 3D cozy puzzle game, aside from the lack of narrative and strong art, level, and gameplay design, so players and puzzle enthusiasts won't have much to complain about. However, if one were to be nitpicking, <em>UMAMI</em> is a short game overall, as players can expect to complete all the puzzles in rapid timing before dedicating extra time to find all the secrets, so one would be looking around the ballpark of four to eight hours for 100% completion.</p>

<p>Sure, there are conversations regarding gameplay length in general, but the developers prioritized delivering a complete and polished game, well-designed puzzles, and adorable yet cozy aesthetics for an experience that's well-paced without sacrificing or cutting out content or mechanics. But if the game's appetizing puzzles are too mind-boggling for one to solve, then players would be better off playing something easier or going elsewhere for a less challenging gameplay experience, but that would be too silly to do.</p>

<p>Additionally, the game's cozy aesthetics may not appeal to every player seeking their next puzzle experience, which in turn could lead to unwarranted and incorrect assumptions about the game. As such, we would counter that argument and recommend playing the demo to find out for yourselves, but this game is worth it for the engaging puzzle and level designs, cozy aesthetics, and time well spent that leaving a tip is required (because the developer certainly "cooked" with <em>UMAMI</em>)!</p>

<h2>UMAMI Review |&nbsp;Final Thoughts</h2>

(Picture: Mimmox / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Our time with <em>UMAMI</em> may have been fleeting, but it was certainly tantalizing and utterly irresistible, largely thanks to gorgeous puzzles, ingenious gameplay design and mechanics, and inviting audio mixing and design. The developers made a stellar effort in exquisitely designing, hand-painting, and well-balancing all 15 puzzles featured, which is worth spending every minute solving them and replaying just for the cozy aesthetics alone.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, the game's cozy aesthetics and environment definitely made every minute spent less stressful and, instead, made us want more puzzles, but we were understandably satisfied with what we received. Without any guardrails or time restrictions, players are left to their devices, albeit with some assistance, to move from puzzle to puzzle at their desired pace.</p>

<p><em>UMAMI</em> may demand some brainpower, plenty of logic, and perspective to solve the five-star gourmet puzzles, but it doesn't demand too much of one's time to complete them. There is no such thing as the wrong or incorrect way to solve a puzzle, but that's the beauty and joy of them, and that's quite simply... <em>UMAMI!</em></p>
