      <div><p>Beadle &amp; Grimm have launched a new crowdfunding success. Their new project is <em>Skullduggery</em>, an urban fantasy supplement for the latest edition of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, and it reached its initial funding goal in just 17 minutes.</p>

<h2>The <em>Skullduggery</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>According to the campaign page, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/beadleandgrimms/skullduggery-urban-adventures-5e/description" rel="nofollow"><em>Skullduggery</em></a> is the newest project by Beadle &amp; Grimm's Pandemonium Warehouse. As mentioned above, the supplement contains new city-themed character options. These include new subclasses, backgrounds, species, feats, spells and equipment, all designed for the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 ruleset.</p>

The Path of Metamorphosis Barbarian amplifies their body with experimental alchemy. The Grim Reaper Patron Warlock lets casters make a literal deal with Death. The Circle of Vermin Druid provides one command of creatures that scurry in a city's cracks. The list goes on.</p>

<p>As for the new species, <em>Skullduggery</em> leans into the macabre and strange. The new Forsaken species is a mortal tainted by necrotic energies, existing in a state between life and death. Alternatively, there is the Mycelium, fungal plant creatures drawn to the city, searching for their wayward god.</p>

<p><em>Skullduggery</em> also contains tools for DMs. It includes city establishment, organization rules, and a swath of prewritten locations, characters, and groups. These are vital for DMs wanting to run a campaign set in city streets and dubious alleyways. intrigue, deadly poison, and duplicitous guilds. In addition, the book contains a prewritten adventure, <em>The Oppression of Blood</em>, which will take players from levels 1-9.</p>

<p>This volume of content is not unexpected for Beadle &amp; Grimm. The company has a reputation for creating bespoke, premium boxed versions of different fantasy campaigns like <em>Curse of Strahd</em> or <em>Pathfinder's</em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/absalom-city-of-omens-gold-edition-brings-premium-pathfinder-thrills" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Absalom, City of Omens</em></a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We're swinging from the rooftops with excitement for the upcoming&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>&nbsp;Universes Beyond <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mtg-spider-man-villains-bonus-sheet-and-infinity-stone-revealed" rel="nofollow">Spider-man</a> </em>set, and we're thrilled to have the official spoilers for two brand Bonus Sheet cards - straight from our friends at Wizards of the Coast! Let's jump right in.</p>

<h2>MTG Spider-Man - Rest In Peace</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/techraptor-mtg-spider-man-rest-in-peace-exclusive.jpg?itok=RPahGfVQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/techraptor-mtg-spider-man-rest-in-peace-exclusive.jpg?itok=lFGX-rEV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Graveyard hate has never looked this good! Featuring original artwork from this pivotal moment in the comics by Mark Buckingham and D'Isreali (from Spectacular Spider-Man #27 (2003)), I can't think of a single better moment to illustrate this card.</p>

<p>And with this full-art treatment, the art truly gets to shine as we see Peter Parker at his beloved Uncle Ben's grave. Your opponents running a mono-black sacrifice deck will&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;hold their head in their hands when you drop this on the battlefield.</p>

<p>Now, onto our next card - which brings a bit of delightful chaos to the scene.</p>

<h2>MTG Spider-Man - Rite of Replication</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/techraptor-mtg-spider-man-rite-of-replication-exclusive.jpg?itok=IBuEnfdg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/techraptor-mtg-spider-man-rite-of-replication-exclusive.jpg?itok=1baBP9HJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This iconic artwork, showing a horde of Spider-Man clones bursting onto the frame, is the perfect piece to choose to represent Rite of Replication, a sorcery allowing you to clone (or, if kicked, clone and clone and clone) a creature on the battlefield. Once again, the full-art of these bonus sheet treatments really adds a lot of energy and chaos to this card.</p>

<p>I'm a big fan of copying creatures, and I've always loved the way Rite of Replication doesn't restrict&nbsp;you to copying a creature you control. Does your opponent have an annoying Commander? Give them a taste of their own medicine!&nbsp;</p>

<p>What do you think of these two Bonus Sheet cards? Do you think they chose the right artwork to represent them? Let us know in the comments below!</p>
