During the LVO 2025 Preview show, the tabletop publisher announced new army boxes for several big franchises: <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Warhammer 40,000</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Age of Sigmar</a></em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-old-world-core-boxes-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Old World</em></a>. Here is everything they announced.</p>

<h2>The LVO 2025 Preview Show Reveals</h2>

<p>Games Workshop made several major announcements as part of the LVO 2025 Preview Show. Several of those announcements involved new army boxes coming to their games.</p>

The vampiric nobles of this army have made a pact with the armies of the Barrow Kingdoms, adding new legions of undead to their ranks.</p>

<p>The aptly named Deathrattle army box will include these new skeletal miniatures, the latest Soulblight Gravelords Battletome, and 55 warscroll cards.</p>

The strong yet prideful army stands alongside named units like Ishaya Vess against the forces of Chaos. In addition, these miniatures will have both returning plastic and metal kits.</p>

<p>The High Elf Realms Battalion Box will include an updated Arcane Journal, dice, reference cards, and 66 miniatures. Those miniatures include 32 Elven Spearmen, 32 Elven Archers, and two Tiranoc Chariots.</p>

<p>Another army coming to <em>Warhammer The Old World</em> are the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/jbz6zd6h/lvo-preview-2025-a-blind-bray-shaman-grants-a-glimpse-of-the-future-of-the-old-world/" rel="nofollow">Beastmen Brayherds</a>. This preview is more of a teaser, showing some artwork and a Bray-Shaman miniature. Hopefully, new details will come later.</p>

The Ash Wastes Nomads are getting a new book, <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/zlyt0pyr/lvo-preview-2025-new-nomads-rule-the-dunes-of-the-ash-wastes/" rel="nofollow"><em>Tribes of the Wastelands</em></a>, which will give them new gang rules, hired guns, and new Dramatis Personae.</p>

<p>Those new hired guns include Sha'dar Hunters, sneaky close-quarters scouts, and Arthromite Spinewyrms, ferocious worm monsters tamed for their shear power.</p>

The <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/evne31tw/lvo-preview-2025-establish-exactly-how-much-is-too-much-with-the-emperors-children/" rel="nofollow">Champions of Slaanesh</a> army box brings back the Emperor's Children. That means loud Noise Marines, strategic Lords Exultant, and devastating Tormentors. The army box will contain the latest codex, two units of six Noise Marines, two units of 10 Infractors which can be built as Tormentors, and a Lord Exultant.</p>

<p>The second preview was for a new Nurgle. The <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/elxrte0d/lvo-preview-2025-nurgle-coughs-up-a-new-lord-of-poxes/" rel="nofollow">Lord of Pox</a> miniature is a unit that continues the Death Guard's whole motif of pestilence and disease. Aside from some preview images however, not much else was revealed.</p>
