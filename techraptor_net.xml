            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced a partnership with Nvidia to introduce new companions called "Co-Playable Characters" to Krafton's games, and yes, they're powered by generative AI, because of course they are.</p>

<p>In a press release, the two companies say that Co-Playable Characters, or CPCs, are "powered by on-device Small Language Models" and that they have the potential to "interact with players in deeper ways than traditional NPCs".</p>

<p>This is because CPCs are apparently "equipped with the ability to understand and cooperate with users"; according to Krafton and Nvidia, CPCs will "understand and respond to game situations in a human-like manner", although given what I've seen of the&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>player base, I'm not sure I want that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-krafton-ai-characters-door.jpg?itok=kLSKyQC2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-krafton-ai-characters-door.jpg?itok=_B5Ll4Eq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Krafton will soon introduce AI-powered companions to&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>itself that's getting these AI-powered characters, either. According to the press release, Krafton intends to introduce CPCs "across its gaming portfolio", so you can expect to see these characters in&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>spinoffs too, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inzoi-release-date-delayed" rel="nofollow">upcoming life sim&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em></a>.</p>

<p>Only&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>are mentioned, so we don't know if Krafton is also planning to introduce CPCs to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-2-krafton-ceo" rel="nofollow">the likes of&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush 2</em></a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-early-access-2025-co-op" rel="nofollow"><em>Subnautica 2</em></a>, but I can't possibly imagine how having an AI inanely yammering away to me while I'm rhythmically smashing goons to pieces could help.</p>

<p>Krafton CEO Changhan Kim says that Nvidia's AI technology, which will power CPCs, is "poised to redefine the future of gaming", while Nvidia developer relations VP Keita Iida says Krafton's CPCs will bring "new, unique experiences" to games. Hmm.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/krafton-ai-characters-inzoi.jpg?itok=CB6fpefb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/krafton-ai-characters-inzoi.jpg?itok=pCzDb0ww 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Krafton's life sim&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>will also include AI-powered "Co-Playable Characters".</figcaption></figure><p>Krafton might be wholeheartedly embracing AI - and it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-working-hard-on-using-ai-to-make-npc-and-worlds-more-alive-reactive-and" rel="nofollow">far from the only company</a> in gaming <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" rel="nofollow">to be doing so</a> - but the technology isn't impressing everyone.</p>

<p>Last month, for instance,&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>creator Ken Levine <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-generative-ai" rel="nofollow">said he wasn't "overly impressed"</a> by generative AI, suggesting that while it could certainly perform mundane tasks related to coding and other technical aspects of game development, it wasn't suitable to be used for creative purposes.</p>

<p>Similarly, gaming giant Nintendo declared last year that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-no-plans" rel="nofollow">currently has no plans</a> to use generative AI to develop its games, citing issues with intellectual property rights infringement as well as a desire to deliver "value that is unique to [Nintendo]".</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geforce-now-steam-deck-app-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/native-geforce-now-app-coming-to-steam-deck-later-this-year.1076106/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geforce-now-steam-deck-app-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia has announced that it's bringing a native GeForce Now app to Steam Deck devices later this year, allowing you to access the cloud gaming subscription service on your handheld device more easily.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-ces-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog post</a> announcing the new app, Nvidia says Steam Deck users can look forward to "up to 4K resolution and 60 frames per second with high dynamic range" when connected to an external display.</p>

<p>It's technically already possible to access GeForce Now via your Steam Deck, but you have to use what essentially amounts to a workaround; in <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-may-games-list/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">May last year</a>, Nvidia released a custom script that installs Google Chrome onto your Deck, then "adds all the settings needed" for GeForce Now streaming via that browser.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nvidia-geforce-now-steam-deck-app-cyberpunk.jpg?itok=Ufr9mfet 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nvidia-geforce-now-steam-deck-app-cyberpunk.jpg?itok=Lm9gnORb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The GeForce Now app for Steam Deck will let you stream games at up to 4k and 60fps.</figcaption></figure><p>As Nvidia points out, your Steam Deck will theoretically draw less power if it's streaming a game from the cloud than if it's using its own internals, although I'd imagine Steam Deck users will want to wait for the app to land so they can see that for themselves.</p>

<p>Of course, you will also need a GeForce Now subscription if you want to stream games via this new app, and given that Nvidia is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geforce-now-monthly-playtime-limit-2025" rel="nofollow">imposing a 100-hour monthly playtime limit</a> across all of its tiers this month, that may not be a particularly enticing prospect for you.</p>

<p>Still, this seems like a pretty neat way to circumvent the Steam Deck's relatively low power, and it might even help you get past things like the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apex-legends-bans-linux" rel="nofollow"><em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>Steam Deck ban</a>&nbsp;(which is technically a Linux-wide ban), although given that the GeForce Now app will be Steam Deck-native, that seems a touch unlikely.</p>




<p>In any case, you'll be able to check out the native GeForce Now app for Steam Deck when it launches later this year. We don't have a full release date for it yet, so watch this space for more info.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Tencent Added to US List of Companies Allegedly Aiding Chinese Military]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-us-dod-list-chinese-military</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencent-added-to-us-list-of-companies-allegedly-aiding-chinese-military.1076034/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-us-dod-list-chinese-military<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The US Department of Defense has added Chinese gaming giant to a list of companies allegedly aiding the Chinese military, a decision that Tencent itself calls a "mistake".</p>

<p>According to a Reuters <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-adds-tencent-catl-list-chinese-firms-allegedly-aiding-beijings-military-2025-01-06/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Tencent was added to the DOD's list alongside battery manufacturer CATL, causing the shares of both companies to drop. Tencent's stocks fell by 7.3%, while CATL's dropped by just 2.8%.</p>

<p>The Reuters report goes on to say that Tencent responded to the DOD's decision by calling it a "mistake" and suggesting that its business would be unaffected by the move. The Chinese gaming giant also suggested it would begin legal proceedings if necessary.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tencent-us-list-chinese-military-epic.jpg?itok=k9rKb54p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tencent-us-list-chinese-military-epic.jpg?itok=00MChtj- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tencent has its fingers in plenty of pies, including&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>studio Epic Games.</figcaption></figure><p>As Reuters points out, the list, which is officially known as the Section 1260H list, doesn't prohibit Tencent from doing business in the US, so it's unlikely to have any material impact on the company's dealings in the short term.</p>

<p>However, having a presence on the list can sometimes serve as a blow to a company's reputation in the US, which could prevent other companies from wanting to do business with Tencent.</p>

<p>Given just <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-bosses-tencent-private-buyout-report" rel="nofollow">how many pies</a> Tencent has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-techland-majority-stakeholder" rel="nofollow">its fingers in</a> across <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tencent-and-sony-buy-over-30-shares-in-from-software" rel="nofollow">the gaming industry</a>, it's unlikely that there will be a mass exodus of studios breaking their agreements with the Chinese gaming giant, but this still likely won't come as pleasing news to the company.</p>

<p>As for what Tencent is up to outside of its addition to this list, the studio is busy working with developers both Western and non-Western on a number of different projects.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tencent-monster-hunter-outlanders.jpg?itok=RZb13lX1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tencent-monster-hunter-outlanders.jpg?itok=6ZHFnuW8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tencent has plenty of projects on the go.</figcaption></figure><p>The gaming giant is currently working with Capcom on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-rpg" rel="nofollow">mobile RPG&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders</em></a>, and it's also behind the extremely&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/light-of-motiram-announced-tencent-horizon" rel="nofollow"><em>Horizon</em>-coded&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em></a>, which was unveiled in full back in November.</p>

<p>Tencent is also attracting talent like&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>director Hideaki Itsuno, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideaki-itsuno-lightspeed-studios" rel="nofollow">joined subsidiary LightSpeed Studios</a> recently (but not the branch that's currently working on&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-revealed" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy XIV Mobile</em>, another Tencent project</a>).</p>
