<p>According to Ubisoft, the project's cancellation is part of what the studio refers to as a "major organizational, operational, and portfolio reset" which is "designed to reclaim [Ubisoft's] creative leadership" and renew the publisher's "trajectory towards sustainable growth".</p><p>Said initiative will consist of three pillars, namely a new operating model, a "refocused portfolio", and the "rightsizing" of the company as a whole. Naturally, this reorganization will also include increased investment in generative AI.</p><p>Ubisoft also reiterates its commitment to restructuring <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="acd9f3a1-9a63-4e42-9b91-122a243964e9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">into Creative Houses</a>, each of which will steward a set of the studio's IPs, including Vantage Studios, which will oversee <em>Assassin's Creed </em>and <em>Far Cry</em>.</p><p><em>Prince of Persia</em>, meanwhile, will fall under the watchful eye of Creative House 4, which, according to Ubisoft, is "dedicated to immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes". That's also the Creative House that will look after <em>Rayman</em>, which Ubisoft says it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rayman-remake-2026-rayman-4-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="781293f6-dc00-4c8e-aa6f-0f302cc5b8b6" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">currently working on</a>.</p>
<p>Notably, Creative House 4 is also responsible for <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>, and Ubisoft doesn't say anything about the status of the long-awaited <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</em>, although if <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beyond-good-and-evil-2-new-job-postings" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3c16fa0c-81d9-45f0-9b15-3df2fe6adb4a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">recent job listings</a> are to be believed, the project is still in development.</p><p>We'll have to wait and see what this new restructuring effort means for Ubisoft and for those who play its games. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Pearl Abyss has announced that its highly-anticipated open-world action RPG <em>Crimson Desert </em>has gone gold at last, so it's finally safe to start getting excited for that March release date.</p><p>In <a href="https://x.com/CrimsonDesert_/status/2013974920120987867" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a post on X</a>, the studio thanks <em>Crimson Desert </em>fans (and, presumably, <em>Black Desert </em>fans as well) for their support during the former's development and invites players to stay tuned for further updates on the game.</p><p>Pearl Abyss accompanied the announcement of <em>Crimson Desert</em>'s completion with a photograph of the game's staff members in a celebratory pose, which is rather endearing (and which rather brings home the fact that the game really is coming out soon).</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Crimson Desert </em>has gone gold at last.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Just as a reminder, when <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-gold-kojima-daruma-doll" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c0ed27a4-2f32-4cd5-b797-033e2ec3af80" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a game "goes gold"</a>, it essentially means that the master copy of the game, i.e. the one from which all other copies will be created, is complete. In essence, it means that the game is ready to ship.</p><p><em>Crimson Desert </em>was first announced all the way back <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/26/black-desert-online-devs-announce-three-visually-impressive-new-games-including-plan-8" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">in 2019</a>, with a trailer showing off gameplay for the title appearing at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-game-awards-2020-announcements-and-news" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a982241a-bdbb-4ed6-918b-2b5ee8272e07" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">The Game Awards in 2020</a>.</p><p>Following that, however, in July 2021, Pearl Abyss delayed <em>Crimson Desert </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crimson-desert-delayed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="36cb0564-abf5-4116-8b3d-f6fc86269ba6" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">indefinitely</a>, citing the usual need to "create the best possible experience" upon the game's release.</p><p>Pearl Abyss continued working on the game in the years that followed, and after one last delay, a release date of March 19th was finally revealed. It now looks as though the studio will be able to keep to this latest release date.</p>
<p>Though <em>Crimson Desert </em>began life as a prequel to Pearl Abyss' <em>Black Desert Online</em>, it eventually morphed into a standalone adventure.</p><p>Taking place in the world of Pywel, <em>Crimson Desert </em>features an in-depth combat system with plenty of moves and tactical options to master, as well as a range of other activities including fishing, hunting, and cooking.</p><p>You'll be able to play <em>Crimson Desert </em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3321460/Crimson_Desert/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/crimson-desert/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/crimson-desert/9NG592G0W474" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 19th.
