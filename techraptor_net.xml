            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Video games layoffs continue as it appears to be hitting Warner Bros owned studios. A new <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3lizk5skwps2d?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Jason Schrier on BlueSky">report from Jason Schreier</a>, shared that the latest studios to be cut are: Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and WB San Diego.</p>

<p>As part of the closure of Monolith Productions, the Wonder Woman game that they were working on is also being cancelled. The game was expected to make use of their signature Nemesis System that premiered back in <em>Middle-Earth: Shadows of Mordor</em>. As of last known count, over 170 people worked at Monolith Productions.</p>

<p>This follows the stepping down of WB Games head <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-david-haddad-stepping-down" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Warner Bros. Games Head David Haddad to Step Down After 12 Years">David Haddad last month</a> after 12 years on the job. It marks a decrease in WB Games' lineup following the failure of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League"><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em></a>, <em>Harry Potter Quidd itch Champions</em>, and struggles with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/multiversus" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Multiversus"><em>Multiversus</em> </a>(which was worked on by Player First Games and WB San Diego). Additionally, last year <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-suicide-squad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Suicide Squad Developer Rocksteady Hit by Layoffs">Rocksteady was hit by a pair </a><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Suicide Squad Studio Rocksteady Reportedly Hit by More Layoffs">of layoffs</a>.</p>

<p>The remaining studios that are part of WB Games are:</p>

<ul><li>Rocksteady (who worked on<em> Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>, and previously made the <em>Arkham</em> games).</li>
	<li>WB Montreal (<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>),</li>
	<li>TT Games (Lego games),</li>
	<li>NetherRealm (<em>Mortal Kombat</em> and <em>Injustice</em>),</li>
	<li>WB Games offices in New York, San Francisco, and Boston.</li>
</ul><p>Earlier today we shared the announcement that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/striking-distance-layoffs-callisto-protocol" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" The Callisto Protocol Developer Striking Distance Lays Off &quot;Most&quot; Developers">Striking Distance laid off</a> most of its employees as 2025 continues to be full of layoffs for the video game industry. This is also part of WB Discovery's pattern of massive cuts under CEO <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/warner-bros-discovery-lays-off-1000-employees-finance-max-1236074169/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Warner Bros.

The TV executive has said that these cuts took "courage" to make.</p>

<p>For now we're left pondering the works that came in the past, such as the masterful <em>Shadows of Mordor</em> from Monolith Productions, or the missed potential of <em>Multiversus</em>.</p>
