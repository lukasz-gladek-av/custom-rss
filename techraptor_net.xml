            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-announces-res-arcana-duo-two-player-board-game-spin-off<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Asmodee Group</a> is releasing <em>Res Arcana Duo</em> at the end of the week. The global tabletop publisher known for producing many beloved titles like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fantasy-flight-games-announces-marvel-champions-next-evolution" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Marvel Champions</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/river-of-gold-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>River of Gold</em></a> has announced a unique spin-off of Sand Castle Games' competitive board game series, one designed for two players.</p>

<h2>The <em>Res Arcana Duo</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the store page listing, <em>Res Arcana Duo</em> is a standalone installment in the <em>Res Arcana</em> series. Like the main series, players take on the roles of powerful magicians caught in an elaborate game of mystic supremacy. A visual trademark of the series is the detailed artwork provided by Julien Delval.</p>

Each player chooses a Mage (Druid, Alchemist, Necromancer, etc.) and gets a deck of unique artifact cards. Using these artifacts helps you claim Monuments and Places of Power, providing resources that fuel the art of magic. Make your moves wisely and you can conquer your enemies.</p>

<p><em>Res Arcana Duo</em> contains a new set of game pieces, cards, and mechanics. These include a new set of Mages, Artifacts, Monuments, and Places of Power designed for the spin-off's one-on-one format.</p>

<p>If you own the base game of <em>Res Arcana</em>, <em>Res Arcana Duo</em> can function as an expansion. In addition, the <em>Lux et Tenebrae</em> and <em>Perlae Imperil </em>expansions can be used with the game to provide a more robust tabletop experience.</p>

<p>A copy of the game contains the following:</p>

<ul><li>4 New Mage Cards</li>
	<li>16 Artifact Cards</li>
	<li>7 Monument Cards</li>
	<li>2 Double-Sided Place of Power Tiles</li>
	<li>5 Magic Item Tiles</li>
	<li>1 Starting Player Tile</li>
	<li>5 x5 Essence Chips</li>
	<li>60 Essence Tokens</li>
	<li>1 Storing/Sorting Tray</li>
	<li>1 Rule Booklet</li>
</ul><p><em>Res Arcana Duo</em> is available right now for pre-order at an MSRP of $24.99. The game will ship to players on November 22, 2024.</p>
