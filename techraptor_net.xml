The latest installment in this iconic board game of political machinations will put players in the role of a 19th-century world leader, adding a monarchal twist to the game's established rules.</p>

<h2>The <em>Diplomacy: Era of Empire</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official <a href="https://renegadegamestudios.com/blog/employ-skillful-diplomacy-and-cunning-tactics-in-diplomacy-era-of-empire/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, <em>Diplomacy: Era of Empire</em> is a complete stand-alone experience for new or experienced players. During a game, players take the role of one of seven world leaders during the 19th century. This includes Britain, France, Russia, Turkey, China, Japan and the Netherlands.</p>

Like classic <em>Diplomacy,</em> players must rely upon their own cunning and cleverness to conspire and conquer. No dice rolls are going to save you here. The game is designed for 2-7 players and a single game takes roughly four hours to complete.</p>

<p>For <em>Diplomacy</em> veterans, this version of the game will contain original twists to the established formula, keeping things interesting. Just be sure to inform new players that the betrayals aren't personal.</p>

<p><em>Diplomacy: Era of Empire</em> is the first unique spin on a classic board game by Renegade Game Studios. It is a continuation of the company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/renegade-takes-over-axis-allies-and-other-classics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ongoing partnership</a> with Hasbro to reprint classic board games. It is a partnership that has included <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/robo-rally-transformers-crossover-game-available-for-pre-order" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Roborally Transformers</em></a>, and a <em>GI Joe</em> <em>Axis &amp; Allies</em> game.</p>

<p><em>Diplomacy: Era of Empire</em> is available for pre-order right now on Renegade's store page. It is being sold at an MSRP of $50 and copies are expected to ship in September 2025. A copy of the game will include the following:</p>
