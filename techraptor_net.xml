            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortuary-assistant-movie-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Horror work sim&nbsp;<em>The Mortuary Assistant&nbsp;</em>is getting a movie adaptation, and it'll star&nbsp;<em>Arrow</em>'s Willa Holland and&nbsp;<em>House of Cards</em>' Paul Sparks, according to a new report.</p>

<p>Per a Deadline <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/04/the-mortuary-assistant-movie-willa-holland-paul-sparks-1236376119/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">article</a>, the movie will be produced by Epic Pictures' horror label Dread, which is also the publisher of&nbsp;<em>The Mortuary Assistant&nbsp;</em>via its gaming wing DreadXP. The company will co-produce the movie alongside Traverse Media.</p>

<p>Story-wise,&nbsp;<em>The Mortuary Assistant&nbsp;</em>will proceed pretty much exactly as you'd expect it to if you've played the game. Holland will play Rebecca, a young woman who works as a mortuary assistant. Sparks will play her boss Raymond Delver, who Deadline describes as "a mentor, but also a potential threat".</p>

<p>Helming the adaptation is Jeremiah Kipp, a director who's worked on horror properties before. Perhaps his most well-known project is&nbsp;<em>Slapface</em>, an indie horror movie from 2021 that won the Cinequest Film Festival's Audience Award.</p>

<p>Speaking to Deadline, Kipp said that he and&nbsp;<em>The Mortuary Assistant&nbsp;</em>game creator Brian Clarke "respond to character-driven storytelling within a disturbing horror space" and that the movie's creation process has "organically felt like an expansion of [Clarke's] unique gameplay".</p>

<p>For his part, Clarke says he's "extremely fortunate" to see a&nbsp;<em>Mortuary Assistant&nbsp;</em>movie to get made, and that he "can't wait for fans to see [the game] expand into new territory".</p>




<p><em>The Mortuary Assistant&nbsp;</em>is just one of a number of games to be getting film adaptations in the coming years. Others include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/outrun-movie-report" rel="nofollow">an<i>&nbsp;</i><em>OutRun&nbsp;</em>movie</a> from producers Michael Bay and Sydney Sweeney, as well as Nintendo's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-zelda-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">live-action&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie</a>&nbsp;and a film <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-zelda-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow">based on Hazelight's hit&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em></a>.</p>
