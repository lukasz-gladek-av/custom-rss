            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/dune-awakening-interview-art-directors-gavin-whelan-and-david-levy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At PAX East 2025, there was one booth that dominated the convention floor and had dozens of stations open for people to play: <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dune-awakening-preview-pax-east-2024" rel="nofollow"><em>Dune Awakening</em></a>. Not only did I have the opportunity to download and play some of the <em>Dune Awakening</em> beta over the weekend, but I got to sit down with Senior Art Director Gavin Whelan and Associate Art Director David Levy to talk about their work on bringing Arrakis to life.</p>

<p>In our<em> Dune Awakening</em> interview with the art directors, let's dive into what it took to design and build this new MMO.</p>



<h2><em>Dune Awakening</em>'s Inspirations: Pulling From Many Sources</h2>

<p>"We all have experiences of what our perception of <em>Dune</em> is," Whelan said. "Some of the older devs like myself, we have the 1984 movie, which scarred me mentally when I was way too young. A lot of people have read the books, and there's the newer movies and TV series. The sandworm is kind of just this thing that's part of our general consciousness."</p>

<p>The original Frank Herbert novel provided a lot of lore for the dev team to go on, but so much of the style of the world has been adapted to film and TV already. I was curious how much of those designs were incorporated into the game versus what was being developed from scratch.</p>

<p>"We have the legendary movies, which we were working with those guys very closely," Whelan said. "They shipped a bunch of us down to the set. We got to sit inside an ornithopter, and the relationship between us and Legendary Pictures was very close. They were sending us concepts, reference images, prop photos, so we could start modeling things based on that."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Whelan also met with Cinematics Director Greig Fraser to discuss details for the game. Plus, <em>Dune Awakening</em> Creative Director Joel Bylos was a passionate fan from the start who brought his perspective to every detail.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's great to have that sort of safety net," Whelan said, speaking of Bylos. "He is such a lore nerd on this. He will just go, 'No, that's not the way it goes. Here's the line in the book.'"&nbsp;</p>

<p>The close relationship between the developers and the filmmakers helps make <em>Dune Awakening</em> be an extension of that universe that shares similar themes while still carving out its own space in the <em>Dune </em>timeline.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Setting the Tone for <em>Dune Awakening&nbsp;</em></h2>

<p>Associate Art Director David Levy, meanwhile, was bringing his own experience to the team.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I worked on the TV series for <em>Dune Prophecy</em>, I was a lead for the concept team, so I worked on the TV series for three years," Levy said.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Having a team that's passionate about the source material was critical for getting the details of the world accurate and making it feel more lived-in, from the design of the lighting from the harsh Arrakis sun to the vehicles you can see and interact with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You'll see in the game we have big ships flying across the sky," Whelan said. "I nagged for so long to get those in because it wasn't essential gameplay, it was just something in the sky, but it set the tone."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, you can't talk about <em>Dune</em> without talking about sandworms. These are designs that are well-known from screen adaptations, but I was curious what the design process was like for the sandworms in&nbsp;<em>Dune Awakening.</em></p>

<p>"We needed to have a certain amount of articulation in the mouth for the smaller worms," Whelan said. "The tri-mouth design was much easier to anticipate and give it some articulation. And we have those out in the deep desert, though those are the small worms. The big worm – I have never worked on, and will never work on, a game where we have a creature that big."&nbsp;</p>

<p>I had to ask the two of them directly: can you ride a sandworm?&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We're working on it," Whelan said. "There are a whole bunch of challenges, it's going to be an interesting journey to get that working right. It has to be a visceral, engaging feeling."&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Dune Awakening</em>: Deep Desert &amp; Beyond&nbsp;</h2>

<p>A core element of <em>Dune Awakening</em> is the deep desert, a PVP area with high-risk, high-reward opportunities.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It's a balance between the amount of freedom and amount of danger we give the player," Levy said. "It's going to be a very high-octane area."&nbsp;</p>

<p>The two developers wanted to make sure that exploration pays off, giving players plenty to see and do if they venture out into the deep desert. At the same time, for players not interested in PVP gameplay, there's plenty of other missions to take on.</p>

<p>"There are aspects of this game for all gamers to come into," Whelan said. "I have a friend who is exclusively into PVP, and will really be into that area. Other people can research, resource gather, build, or craft. There's just so many cool elements that can attract a lot of people."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Plus, huge sandstorms will sweep across the map and reset the deep desert, giving Funcom opportunities to create new points of interest out there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every aspect of <em>Dune Awakening</em>, from the deep desert design to the character creator to the narrative, was built from a global team that had to navigate the challenges of developing a game when COVID was at its peak.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Eventually, we all transitioned to working online," Whelan said. "We had to coordinate something so complicated remotely. I love having people face to face in a room, where ideas can flow and you can see body language. Anybody can come up with the perfect idea, the perfect solution. But doing things on Teams meetings, it was a slow and challenging process."&nbsp;</p>

<p>In Levy's role, he was taking charge of how the lighting works in the world and how to make each day in-game feel dynamic and new.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I love photography, and we were able to translate Gavin's vision into something that is immersive and unconscious to the player, like the day-to-day changes. Every day will be slightly different weather. How do we make it beautiful, but also oppressive? There's so many different biomes, I'm excited for the player to feel that sense of immersion in the atmosphere."&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Dune Awakening</em>: One Big Sandbox</h2>

<p>At its core as an MMO, <em>Dune Awakening</em> has been designed to give the player agency to explore what kind of experience they want to have.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I'm blown away by the creativity of the players," Whelan said. "We build a sandbox for players. They take ownership of it, and they start to shape it. Some people want to play straight <em>Dune</em> fantasy, we accommodate that. Others just want to have fun with it. We have heat maps so we can see what the players are doing and how they explore."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The player is the component of the game," Levy said. "They're not just a passenger who's going through a very linear experience. The player is making<em> Dune Awakening</em> after we've built it."&nbsp;</p>

<p>A core goal of <em>Dune Awakening</em> was to constantly let the player branch out and try new things. The immediate needs must first be met – food, water, shelter. But similar to other survival MMOs, once the player has a handle on those things, the world really starts to open up, and before too long they'll be flying ornithopters and gathering resources to make more complex tools.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not only were Levy and Whelan interested in making the game accessible to as many players as they could in the design of the world, they also wanted it to run on as many machines as possible.</p>

<p>"We have been very conscious of the fact that there are economic challenges," Whelan said. "People can't rush out and buy a graphics card. We want to make sure that the lighting and the world looks beautiful and consistent on low-end machines.</p>

<p>"We get to a point where the game looks beautiful, and then we start optimizing. We bounce back and forth making sure <em>Dune Awakening</em> looks good and runs well."&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Dune Awakening </em>was a big hit at PAX East, with the beta weekend allowing me to try it out on my Nvidia GeForce 3060Ti (runs great!) as well as on my Steam Deck (runs not so great). The <em>Dune Awakening </em>release date is June 10 with early access for those who buy <em>Dune Awakening Deluxe Edition</em> on June 5.</p>

<p>Whelan, Levy, and the whole team have worked to make <em>Dune Awakening</em> an authentic<em> Dune </em>experience for fans, and there should be many secrets to uncover when players jump in for themselves in just a few weeks.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-originally-switch-1</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mario-kart-world-is-a-switch-2-game-because-of-mario-kart-8-deluxes-dlc.1195167/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-originally-switch-1<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed that&nbsp;Switch 2 launch title&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>was originally in development for the first Switch, and that the release of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>'s Booster Course Pass DLC is the reason the game ended up on Switch 2.</p>

<p>The Japanese gaming giant's latest Ask the Developer article is all about the new&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>game, which launches <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">alongside the Switch 2 on June 5th</a>. It turns out, though, that Nintendo began prototyping&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>all the way back in 2017.</p>

<p>According to producer Kosuke Yabuki, work on&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>began in March 2017, a month or so before the release of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>. Programming director Kenta Sato says the original plan was to develop for the Switch, but that this threw up a lot of technical issues.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-kart-world-switch-1-game-switch-2-shot.jpg?itok=9F4aF8SX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-kart-world-switch-1-game-switch-2-shot.jpg?itok=qtH1RAF- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>was originally intended as a Switch game.</figcaption></figure><p>Specifically, Sato says there were doubts about whether the original Switch was capable of accommodating&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>'s 24-player limit. The team discussed various solutions, including "toning down the visuals, lowering the resolution, and...dropping the frame rate to 30fps".</p>

<p>Yabuki says that the team "kick[ed] the can down the road" while trying to work out what to compromise on for&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, but that when&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>'s Booster Course Pass DLC was released, it gave the team "a bit more time to continue development".</p>

<p>During that time, the development team discussed moving&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>to the Switch 2, which became, as Yabuki puts it, "a ray of hope", opening up "a bunch of possibilities" and removing the need to compromise on performance or visual fidelity.</p>




<p><em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>will launch for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mario-kart-world-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> on June 5th. It's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">just one of the games</a> that will be available for the system on release, alongside the likes of&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>,&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, and the bafflingly paid-for&nbsp;<em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-train-2-review-to-hell-and-back.1195119/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-train-2-review-to-hell-and-back<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Standing out as a roguelike deckbuilder is hard. New games in the genre seem to constantly be releasing on Steam. For every <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/high-stakes-how-balatro-confronts-addiction-and-roguelikes" rel="nofollow">breakout hit like&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em></a>, some games just get left behind. If you're going to release a deckbuilder in the current landscape, you better be sure you have a way to stand out.&nbsp;<em>Monster Train 2&nbsp;</em>uses the autobattler foundation of its predecessor to iterate by doubling down on player freedom.</p>

<p>From the selection screen to the last track on the map, there are so many ways for you to build your perfect army to storm the gates of Heaven with. Though the forces you face and friends you find can become a little repetitive, the toolbox Shiny Shoe gives to you feels near infinite in the ways you can customize each run.</p>

<h2><em>Monster Train 2</em> - Charming Challenges</h2>



<p>The structure of <em>Monster Train 2 </em>stands on the shoulders, like most roguelike deckbuilders, stands on the shoulders of <em>Slay the Spire</em>. However, beyond the deckbuilding and energy aspects, this deckbuilder is very much its own thing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Fights take place on your train, which has three floors. You place units on each floor, trying to prevent monsters from climbing the floors of your train. If you can’t defeat them, they reach your train’s most valuable resource: the Pyre Heart. Your units can die without consequence, but when your Pyre Heart reaches zero health, you lose.</p>

<p>This gameplay is divided into different runs, each of which can take up to around an hour. These are eight battles, each with a track to choose from between battles. Tracks have different stops, including places to spend your gold, fireplaces to heal your Pyre Heart, and banners to recruit new units to your forces.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The main increasing challenge that each run presents is the difficulty system of Covenants. As the Covenant level increases from 1-10, you gain new challenges, like reduced control over your deck and increased strength for your enemies.</p>

<p>If you want some more interesting challenges, though, you can head over to the Dimensional Challenge portal. These challenges will provide interesting and compelling modifiers and restrictions to change how you see the game. For instance, in one early challenge, everything you receive is doubled.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It sounds great at first: double gold will make upgrades so much easier! Then, you realize it means that you also need to take two copies of every card. It really makes you rethink which cards to take in a creative way. If you find mutators you enjoy more than others, you can choose to add them to your standard runs before starting them from the menu.</p>

<h2><em>Monster Train 2</em> - Expression Excellence</h2>



<p>Deckbuilders are at their best when they give you the tools to break them in creative ways. <em>Monster Train 2</em> delivers in spades, and a major reason why is the clan system. In addition to choosing a primary clan that grants a primary champion to follow, you choose a secondary clan, which can impact your starting deck cards and cards you find along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For instance, combining the Lazarus League’s Reanimate abilities with the Banished’s Valor spells can help your units revive near death with 1 health point, but high armor to withstand continued attacks.</p>

<p>As you collect cards, your runs can become even more personalized with upgrades you collect. Instead of a linear upgrade system, <em>Monster Train 2</em> takes a more open approach to upgrades, letting you choose which aspects of a card you want to upgrade in each shop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Do you want to make a card that’s usually only single-use, able to be used multiple times in one combat? Reduce a card’s energy cost? Make a spell’s power more potent? The choice is yours, and you can go anywhere.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The best part is that there isn’t a single “correct” answer. There may be ones you become more comfortable with, but the best answer will change depending on how your run is developing, and what you’re focusing on to do heavy damage or build up your defenses in your run.</p>

<h2><em>Monster Train 2</em> - The Repetition Rut</h2>



<p>While you have loads of variety to express yourself, I wish the enemy forces you were fighting did the same. There are a couple of different possible permutations for each of the 8 encounters, but after a few runs, you'll see most of what there is to see as far as encounters.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The bosses are the same during each train ride through Heaven, with 3 in each run. There are a few different modifiers they have to freshen them up, but it definitely leaves runs feeling a little samey if you are playing as the same clans.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Celestial Alcove events, which are small events that let you make choices to affect your deck, also seem to pull from a pretty small variety. I started mostly ignoring these because while some were neat, it felt like I'd seen them all pretty early. When I did see them, more often than not, I ignored them due to the harsh penalties that some imposed.</p>

<p>This will also become the case with given clans. With so many different card types like Spells, Equipment, and Units, and specialized shops for each, you'll almost certainly start seeing the same cards in your runs. However, this was a small snag that was easy to circumvent. When I started seeing a lot of the same cards, changing up the clan made it feel fresh again. Even when I started seeing the same cards, I could make different upgrade choices to make things feel fresh.</p>

<p>More unlocks for content started to unlock throughout the process of the main story. As you progress the story, which will happen naturally as you unlock the various clans and Pyre Hearts, other mechanics, both for your foes and you, will reveal themselves. It's a neat way to gate content and drip-feed new stuff as you progress.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, the story itself is a little one-note and feels like it relies quite a bit on knowledge of the first&nbsp;<em>Monster Train</em>. It's easy to enjoy the game itself without the knowledge of the predecessor, but you might be scratching your head a bit during the dialogue exchanges without it.</p>

<h2><em>Monster Train 2</em> - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Monster Train 2&nbsp;</em>is a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blue-prince-review-i-finished-game-50-hours-ago-and-theres-still-puzzles-to-solve" rel="nofollow">great deckbuilder</a> that fans of the genre should add to their collection. The resistance you face can start to feel a little repetitive as you start getting deeper into the game, and the story is more of a vehicle for unlocks than something that stands on its own. But the toolbox of deckbuilding creativity on the player side, from the synergies you can build in your deck to mutators you can add into your run, makes it feel like a game that anyone who takes the time can break in the best way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remastered-sales-circana-april-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Circana has released its gaming industry sales data for April in the US, and Bethesda's&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>has topped sales charts for the month, an impressive feat considering its availability on Game Pass.</p>

<p>According to Circana's Mat Piscatella,&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>topped the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lpoo44vmwk2e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all-format sales charts</a>&nbsp;for the month, and it also hit number one on both the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lpoo4byukv2e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lpoo4dcbr52e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> charts individually. The game isn't available on the Switch, so that console's honor went to&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-released" rel="nofollow">shadowdropped last month</a> (although it had become a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-oblivion-remake-images-seemingly-leaked" rel="nofollow">pretty poorly-kept secret</a> by the time it was released). Developed by Virtuos, the game retains the original title's gameplay and underlying engine, but gives it a fresh Unreal Engine 5 coat of paint.</p>

<p>On a year-to-date basis (i.e. starting from January and running until May), the best-selling game of the year is still Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which shouldn't come as a surprise given its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">phenomenal early sales performance</a>.</p>

<p>Second place goes to&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, which will likely come as a reassurance to Ubisoft given its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-financials-layoffs-possible" rel="nofollow">grim financial state</a>, and the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>is the year's third best-selling game so far.</p>

<p>In the hardware stakes, the PS5 has once again emerged victorious in April on both unit and dollar sales. Switch hardware sales plummeted by 37% compared to last year, but that's arguably to be expected given that its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">successor is just around the corner</a>.</p>
