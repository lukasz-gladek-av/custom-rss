            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has released new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 2024 Unearthed Arcana. This new playtest material reintroduces some character options originally available in Fifth Edition as well as the return of much older character options from the fantasy TTRPG's storied past.</p>



<p>In an official post on <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/dnd/ua/arcane-subclasses" rel="nofollow">D&amp;D Beyond</a>, several members of the design team, Makenzie De Armas, Amanda Hamon, and Ben Petrisor, discuss the contents of the latest <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 Unearthed Arcana. Notably, the video in the post is the first not to feature Todd Kenrick, who has served as the host of the design videos. This is because he was let go from the company about a week ago.</p>

These include the Arcane Archer Fighter, the Hexblade Warlock, the Arcana Domain Cleric, and four different Wizard schools: Conjurer, Necromancer, Transmuter, and Enchanter. All of which were absent in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">2024 Player Handbook</a>.</p>

<p>Thankfully, if you are familiar with the 2014 version of these subclasses, the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 Unearthed Arcana includes cliff notes on how they have been changed for the new 2024 edition. For example, Arcane Archer's Arcane Shot ability has been reworked with any weapon that uses ammo, including firearms, and the Hexblade's Armor of Hexes is now unlimited and scales with your Warlock Level.</p>

The Tattooed Warrior Monk, originally a Prestige Class, has returned for 2024. In this subclass, your Monk slowly gains a collection of magical tattoos, ones imbued with arcane power. Using these tattoos, and some Focus Points, this will allow you to cast certain spells like Misty Step, Longstrider, or Lesser Restoration.</p>

<p>The second new subclass is the Ancestral Sorceror. These Sorcerors trace their bloodline back to a powerful ancestor who wielded great magic. Maybe your Sorceror is a descendant (or reincarnation) of wizards of legend like Mordenkainen or Bigby? This is reflected in the class features, which include adding Charisma to your spellcasting, having Counterspell always prepared, and having perfect concentration.</p>

<p>Obviously, the material in the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 Unearthed Arcana is playtest material and will be subject to change. If you want to let Wizards know what you like and dislike, the Unearthed Arcana is available to download for free. The feedback survey will open on July 3.&nbsp;</p>
