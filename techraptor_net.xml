  </picture><p>These moments of survival are broken up into Big Days. Big Days represent substantive events like mammoth hunts, cave bear attacks, and clashes with rival tribes. Between these events, you must gather food, craft tools and weapons, and consult shamans for guidance. Once these events happen, break out the miniatures and the dice. These skirmishes and hunts are resolved using a d10-based alternating activation system.</p><p>The core experience of <em>Hide, Stone, and Bone</em> is its detailed campaign system. The ultimate goal is survival. This means, even if the dice are against you while fighting other tribes, your group can still thrive in the long run.</p><p>The game is the tabletop debut of Austin Hunt. According to his bio, Hunt has been a war gamer for over two decades, playing in multiple games across different genres. The book features illustrations by Netherlands artist Mars Oosterveld, whose work has also featured in <em>Paleomythic</em>.</p><p>Osprey Games is known for a diverse catalog of skirmish games.
