            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-release-date-july-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Tripwire Interactive has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>release date, with the multiplayer-focused zed-slaying shooter now set to release in the summer.</p>

<p>Back in March (which is also when the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-release-date" rel="nofollow">originally intended to launch</a>), Tripwire <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/killing-floor-3-delayed-2025" rel="nofollow">delayed</a>&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>, citing a need to implement changes suggested by user feedback from the game's closed beta test.</p>

<p>In a new press release, Tripwire says that its development team has been using the extra time from the delay to address that feedback, and so a new release date of July 24th has been set. In the interim, Tripwire says it will release more dev diaries showing off the ways in which it's implementing player suggestions.</p>

<p>The new release date also means that pre-orders for the three different versions of&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3</em>&nbsp;- Standard, Deluxe, and Elite - are once again live.</p>

<p>In case you're wondering, pre-ordering the Standard version nets you the game, plus a weapon skin set, a weapon trinket, and a player card. The Deluxe edition gets you all of that plus two extra Shadow Agent skin sets, a Nightfall Supply Pass, and 1000 Nightfall Creds.</p>

<p>Finally, the Elite edition includes everything outlined above, but ups the Nightfall Supply Pass total to four and the Creds total to 3000. Pre-orders for all three editions are available across PC and consoles right now.</p>




<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>is, it's the third mainline installment in the&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor&nbsp;</em>series of multiplayer-focused first-person shooters. Taking place 70 years after&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 2</em>, it sees you and your buddies teaming up to take down an army of slavering monsters known as Zeds.</p>

<p><em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1430190/Killing_Floor_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/killing-floor-3/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/killing-floor-3/9pfzlckhc1vm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on July 24th.</p>
