            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Larian Studios has revealed more information about its upcoming <em>Divinity </em>game, and if you were worried that the studio would deviate from its recent spate of turn-based RPG successes, then worry no more.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, Larian head Swen Vincke confirms that the new <em>Divinity </em>game, which was revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-game-awards-2025-recap" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7f71e644-2289-45c0-a1c9-dc56c3797e8a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">during the Game Awards last week</a> (and which still doesn't have an official title), will be a turn-based RPG.</p><p>Vincke also says that the game will represent his studio "unleashed", and that it'll feature many of the hallmarks you've come to expect from a Larian game "brought to the next level". I expect that means plenty of reactivity, lots of options in combat, and a dizzying amount of content in general.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Don't worry: Larian's new <em>Divinity </em>game won't betray the studio's turn-based strengths.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Boldly, Vincke says he believes that the studio's new <em>Divinity </em>game will be "way better" than the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-has-way-over-10-million-players-mod-support-has-been-in-works-since" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a6faddb2-01d3-46aa-a769-c7be021e6a4f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">phenomenally successful <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Schreier, Vincke and Larian were originally intending to work on a new <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>RPG with Wizards of the Coast before realizing there was no enthusiasm for such a project, hence the pivot to <em>Divinity</em>.</p><p>Vincke says that Larian wants to finish the new <em>Divinity </em>in less time than it took the studio to release <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>; he says that "three to four years is much healthier than six years", so it sounds like that's about as long as you can expect to wait for the game to launch.</p><p>Perhaps controversially, Larian is also using generative AI to make the new <em>Divinity </em>game. Vincke is quick to assert that <em>Divinity</em>'s actual content won't be AI-generated, but that the studio is using the technology for concept art, placeholder text, and exploring ideas during development.</p>
<p>Reassuringly, though, Vincke concludes by saying he intends to use the money generated by <em>Baldur's Gate 3 </em>for more experimentation and expansion in <em>Divinity</em>. He says the game will do "a couple of things that you haven’t seen in RPGs before".</p><p>We'll have to wait and see what Larian is intending to do with <em>Divinity</em>; we're probably a ways away from even a full reveal, let alone a release date. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bungie has announced a new release window for upcoming extraction shooter reboot <em>Marathon</em>, and we now know how much you can expect to pay for the game if you decide to pick it up as well.</p><p>In a new <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonvidoc" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> entitled "Vision of <em>Marathon</em>", Bungie says that the game will launch in March 2026, although the studio stops short of committing to a specific date. When it arrives, you'll be paying $40 for it upfront.</p><p>Buying <em>Marathon </em>will give you "full access to the game", Bungie says, which means you'll get a slew of free updates that bring new maps, new Runner shells, and new gameplay elements, plus more.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Additionally, Bungie says it wants to make sure players log into <em>Marathon </em>because they "love the game", rather than because they're afraid of missing out.</p><p>That means previous seasons' battle passes will always be available for purchase, so you won't miss any rewards you're looking forward to. You can also rest assured that <em>Marathon </em>won't have any pay-to-win elements; Bungie says it wants to "preserve competitive integrity" in the game.</p><p>The blog post was accompanied by a more in-depth video development diary in which Bungie delves into some of the improvements it's made since <em>Marathon</em>'s last alpha test, including solo queues, proximity voice chat, and changes to the flow of gameplay to make things smoother.</p><p>You can check out that full video diary, which goes into some detail regarding <em>Marathon</em>'s maps, loot and progression systems, and more, right here.</p>
<p><em>Marathon </em>hasn't exactly had the best time of things since its announcement.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Dambuster Studios has confirmed that it's currently actively working on <em>Dead Island 3</em>, although it's going to be a couple of years before you hear from the franchise again.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:pucmqonvvkskre2rhfmckaob/post/3ma3mavhny225" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Bluesky user Timur222</a>, a recent Dambuster financial report reveals that the studio's "primary focus" is now working on <em>Dead Island 3</em>, and that all of Dambuster's development staff have been allocated to the project. The QA team will also be moved to <em>Dead Island 3 </em>once <em>Dead Island 2</em>'s "Luna and Mac versions are complete".</p><p>According to the financial report, <em>Dead Island 3 </em>is in the early stages of development right now; "feature, character, world, and story design" are "moving at pace", Dambuster says. The project is targeting the first or second quarter of 2028 for its release.</p><figure role="group">

<p><em>Dead Island 2 </em>had a lengthy and protracted development, which is probably partly why Dambuster wants to reassure fans that <em>Dead Island 3 </em>is very much in the works.</p><p>The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/e3-2014-dead-island-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a81e91d7-4004-4de5-ae3c-8bc56962c3e8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">originally</a> being worked on by <em>Spec Ops: The Line </em>studio Yager, before publisher Deep Silver <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deep-silver-drops-developer-dead-island-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a179414a-bc53-4112-843d-eb6c1a63b510" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">parted ways with the developer</a> in 2015. In 2016, <em>Sackboy </em>and <em>Snake Pass </em>outfit Sumo Digital <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-island-2-gets-new-developer" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4d6af9d9-b2a2-4b28-8163-7cabf82d0085" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">picked up the project</a>, but Sumo would subsequently be dropped in favor of Dambuster, who would see the game to completion.</p><p><em>Dead Island 2 </em>eventually <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-dead-island-2-release-date-revealed-as-zombie-game-goes-gold" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3af58b2f-6249-454f-b7f4-d915445acf90" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">went gold in early 2023</a>, at which point the game, in one form or another, had been in development for around nine years. It was eventually released in April of that year, earning itself a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dead-island-2-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="88112c94-4c59-4912-abba-14a20a257ae9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">pretty respectable 7 from our reviewer Will</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully, <em>Dead Island 3 </em>won't suffer from the same issues that plagued its predecessor during development, and we'll be able to get our hands on what will presumably be another open-world zombie-slaying extravaganza sooner rather than later.</p><p>In the meantime, you can check out <em>Dead Island 2 </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/934700/Dead_Island_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP2047-PPSA03098_00-DI2MAINSIEAPS500" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dead-island-2/C3L4J3H7H12R" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a>.
