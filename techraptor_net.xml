  </picture><h2>Fifth Place - Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2><p>Developer: Team Cherry | Release Date: September 4th, 2025</p><p>Written by Andrew Otton</p><p>Everything about <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> just feels right. The movement, the animations, the frenetic pace to combat, the wonderfully weird world to explore... It's no surprise to see this rank on our list.</p><p>Sometimes <em>Silksong </em>can feel unfairly hard, but there is a certain ethos to most of the game. There's always an advantage to be found, a pattern to be learned. It's never cheap deaths, but certainly punishing ones as you learn new enemies or boss encounters (though I could do without some of those delivery quests).</p><p>As one of the most highly anticipated games in the last few years, I think <em>Silksong </em>lived up to expectations. There's a lot to love for action platformer fans, metroidvania fans, those that love the lore of the series, and just generally gaming fans as it's just solid through and through.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Fourth Place - Ghost of Yotei</h2><p>Developer: Sucker Punch Productions | Release Date: October 2nd, 2025</p><p>Written by Austin Suther</p><p>I got around to <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> in December, a couple of months after it was initially released. Maybe it’s because I was trying to avoid spoiling myself, but I didn’t see a great deal of talk about <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>. At least, not when compared to other PlayStation exclusives.</p><p>Nonetheless, <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> deserves your attention. It took TechRaptor’s top spot for Best Visual Design of 2025, and well, go figure. Take one look at the game and you’ll see why: It’s jawdroppingly gorgeous. The world is large but densely-packed, so it’s very easy to find yourself going off course and completing various quests or side objectives, though it also doesn’t feel like a collect-a-thon, a common pitfall many open world games fall into.</p><p>Outside of visuals, though, we get to see the journey of Atsu as she sets out on a journey of revenge many years in the making. She’s out to kill the Yotei Six, a group of evildoers that killed her family and now threaten to control all of Hokkaido.</p><p>In this quest for revenge, gameplay is a standout. Combat is smooth but weighty, as Atsu delivers devastating blows with her varied arsenal, including katanas, spears, and shinobi weapons. Atsu is more in-your-face than <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>’s Jin Sakai, so while you can resort to stealth, there’s a larger focus tackling your foes up front and in their face.</p><p>For a game as long as <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is, one would think combat gets stale after a while, but that never happened. Enough new weapons and enemies are introduced to make encounters feel fresh, and man, the feedback from that DuelSense is really somethin’ else.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Third Place - Hades II</h2><p>Developer: Supergiant Games | Release Date: September 25th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p>Hades II builds on its predecessor in arguably every department, both in terms of quantity and quality. There are twice as many levels, even more bosses, and a nearly doubled soundtrack. All that centers around the already-impeccable gameplay loop that Supergiant built in the previous game.</p><p>It would be so easy to say<em> Hades II</em> is just its predecessor but bigger, and that captures a majority of it. It's a classic case of not breaking what worked so well while iterating to make parts of it fresh.</p><p>Playing as a witch instead of a warrior comes with some nuances, like how Melinoe has to play it safe at the start. But usually by the end of a run, you're melting entire rooms of enemies with a chaotic chain of curses and effects.</p><p><em>Hades II </em>features a satisfying combat gameplay loop peppered with narrative moments from characters in the Crossroads and out in the wild. Even the bosses all have their own stories, making the world feel that much richer.</p><p>So yes, <em>Hades II</em> is just <em>Hades </em>but better—but the first game didn't win our GOTY in 2020 for no reason, after all.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Second Place - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2><p>Developer: Sandfall Interactive | Release Date: April 24th, 2025&nbsp;</p><p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p><p>Sandfall Interactive's <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> was a major success by all accounts for the studio. Their debut title managed to gain a spotlight in the gaming community thanks to its modern blend of stunning visuals, gripping character performances, and impressive symphonic musical score.</p><p>The biggest secret to its success is how <em>Clair Obscu</em>r manages to put a new look and feel on familiar turn-based RPG gameplay. While the individual elements aren't new to veterans of the genre, the distinct mix presented helped lower the barrier for many who were dismissive of the genre's merits.</p><p>For those accomplishments, this title deserves its spot.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Blue Prince</h2><p>Developer: Dogubomb | Release Date: April 10th, 2025</p><p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p><p>There hasn't been a game that I've thought about more this year. Stepping into Blue Prince you're met with an entertaining puzzle roguelite experience of trying to build your way through a house of ever-changing rooms. This simple plan gets bogged down as suddenly you need to learn how to unlock a door, or reach a basement, unlock a side gate or get into an orchard.</p><p>Blue Prince does a fantastic job of starting simple, with a clear goal for the player to complete, while simultaneously seeding in other mysteries and puzzles. By the time you are at the end of one thread, there are four or five other threads that have come up. Simple mechanics get iterated upon until you complete the game, and this serves as a fine point to step off the ride, but for those wanting further puzzles to complete the game doubles in length.</p><p>Blue Prince is a true indie development story of how time and a single great idea were able to capture the minds of thousands and leave us wanting just one more puzzle to complete, even after it's all over. Blue Prince joins the ranks of many other meta puzzle games that I'll be recommending to friends for years to come.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

  </picture><h2>Fifth Place - Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</h2><p>Developer: The Game Kitchen | Release Date: July 31st, 2025</p><p>Written by Austin Suther</p><p>It’s been a hot minute since we’ve seen <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> in 2D (it’s been, well, decades) so it was about time we saw this coveted series go back to its roots with <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>.</p><p>With <em>Blasphemous</em> developer The Game Kitchen at the helm of this project, we’re met with a hard-as-nails, fast-paced 2D platformer that feels like a faithful homage to <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> of yesteryear.</p><p>Ryu Hayabusa takes the bench as two new characters get some time to shine: &nbsp;. These two become fused together and have a wide range of exciting powers at their disposal. The player feels like the ultimate badass, slashing through demon enemies like butter and avoiding obstacles with the finesse only a shinobi can accomplish.</p><p>Furthermore, the two ninja’s personal dynamic holds a lot of promise too, so here’s hoping The Game Kitchen brings us a sequel!</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Fourth Place - Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2><p>Developer: Team Cherry | September 4th, 2025</p><p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p><p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> is an experience that can easily be overshadowed by the fervent attitude of its fans. There was an almost zealous anticipation for Team Cherry's follow-up to the critically acclaimed <em>Hollow Knight</em>. That anticipation continued to grow in excitement as the developers went radio silent over years of development.</p><p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> releasing this year wasn't just a release, it was an event. An event so momentous it crashed all major digital game storefronts; a feat no other release this year pulled off.</p><p>As for the game itself, it is a remarkable achievement of an action-platformer. It builds upon the foundation of its predecessor, pushes the limits of exploration and difficulty, interweaving it with a narrative about the dangers of organized religion.</p><p>For that achievement, Team Cherry's sophomore effort deserves its praise.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Third Place - Ball x Pit</h2><p>Developer: Kenny Sun | Release Date: October 15th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p>Every now and then, an indie game comes around and mashes a couple well-known genres together to create something greater than the sum of its parts. That's exactly what<em> Ball x Pit</em> does. It takes the tried-and-true formula of <em>Arkanoid </em>and twists it into a roguelike, with a dollop of city building and pinball to round it all out.</p><p><em>Ball x Pit</em> has that classic "just one more run" hook to it, especially since each run only lasts a couple minutes. Punctuating each run is a little bit of base building, which slowly snowballs into arguably the more important part of the game.</p><p>The <em>Arkanoid</em>-style gameplay starts out pretty fun, and it only evolves into something more clever as you unlock more characters, items, and abilities. You'll find different strategies based on specific builds, and the endless combinations and low-stakes gameplay makes it so easy to lose hours to what was supposed to be one or two runs.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Second Place - Dispatch</h2><p>Developer: AdHoc Studio | Release Date: October 22nd, 2025</p><p>Written by Austin Suther</p><p>When<em> Dispatch</em>’s main character, Robert Robertson gets defeated by a villain, leaving his mechanical suit in shambles, he’s out of a job and rent is due. He still wants to make a difference with his strong sense of justice, and as fate would have it, he’s given an offer he can’t refuse: dispatch heroes for Torrance, California’s Superhero Dispatch Network, and they’ll help him get back on his feet and repair his suit.</p><p>While at first glance <em>Dispatch </em>plays like any other “choose your own adventure” type of deal, where your choices have impacts on the outcome of the story, this game innovates by fusing a strong narrative with the interactable dispatching mini-game.</p><p>With <em>Dispatch</em>’s lovable cast of villain-turned-heroes, Robert will send them from job-to-job in order to fight crime. Take into consideration if a hero is suited for the job, or else you might experience failure; though, failure isn’t always a bad thing as the writing leads to some pretty funny outcomes. In between your dispatching job, the narrative that gradually amps up over eight strong episodes is sure to capture your heart as much as it did for us at TechRaptor.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Blue Prince</h2><p>Developer: Dogubomb | Release Date: April 10th, 2025</p><p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p><p>In a world of AAA titles and never-ending sequels and remakes, it's always incredible when such a unique indie experience comes along. <em>Blue Prince</em> is an outstanding game with a simple idea that gets iterated upon, and iterated again, and used in ways that will break your brain to try to interpret.</p><p>Tonda Ros' story of creating <em>Blue Prince</em> is one that perfectly embodies the spirit of Indie game development. After enjoying games and seeing documentaries like <em>Indie Game The Movie</em> came the realization 'Yeah, I can probably do that'.&nbsp;</p><p>Eight years later, <em>Blue Prince</em> released as a game that you can "complete" in what you can consider a normal amount of time, rewarding players' interest and lateral thinking. Though, for those who are as interested in puzzle solving as Ros is for putting puzzles together, you'll get rewarded time and time again as you dig deeper and new discoveries teach you about an incredible larger world without leaving the grounds of the mansion.</p><p><em>Blue Prince</em> has truly infected my mind and the mind of many other gamers wanting to scratch just that little bit deeper. It more than deserves it's place as the Indie GOTY.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
