            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pathea Games, the studio behind the <em>My Time </em>series of cozy life sims, has announced <em>The God Slayer</em>, a steampunk action RPG set in a bustling Eastern-inspired metropolis.</p><p>The game was originally revealed as part of PlayStation's China Hero Project initiative back in 2023, but now, Pathea has released two brand new trailers that show off <em>The God Slayer</em>'s unique setting and action-heavy gameplay.</p><p><em>The God Slayer </em>looks like it's taking a pretty different direction to Pathea's usual fare; it'll cast you as Cheng, who is an Elemancer, a warrior "infused with elemental powers and a heart of vengeance". You'll set out on a quest to avenge your loved ones and oppose the tyrannical Celestials.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Per the game's brand new Steam page, <em>The God Slayer </em>features a rather nifty elemental system in which the elements will interact with each other in realistic ways; fire, for instance, will burn wood, while steam will rise from boiling water and earth can block your path.</p><p>As an Elemancer, you'll be able to use the elements to your advantage in combat; the gameplay trailer (thanks, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhiXXsDsWTg" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">IGN</a>) shows the player using ice to freeze human enemies after an alleyway has been flooded with water, as well as using rock magic to hurl stones at encroaching demonic enemies.</p><p>Of course, we're likely a while away from <em>The God Slayer</em>'s release; it doesn't have an official release date yet, so what we're seeing in these trailers could be fairly heavily choreographed to show the game at its best.</p><p>Still, if you want to get a sense for <em>The God Slayer</em>'s setting and vibe, you can check out the debut CG trailer right here.</p>
<p>As well as <em>The God Slayer</em>, Pathea is also hard at work on upcoming cozy life sim <em>My Time at Evershine</em>, which will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-skipping-early-access" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ba8c6a72-2d0f-4000-bc5a-2dc8cdc24ff3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">skipping Early Access</a> after its Kickstarter managed to raise over $2.5 million dollars late last year.</p><p>You can wishlist Pathea Games' <em>The God Slayer </em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2536510/The_God_Slayer/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">right here</a> to keep up with its progress.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
