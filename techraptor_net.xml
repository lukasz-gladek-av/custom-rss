            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Legendary point-and-click developer Revolution Software has announced&nbsp;<em>Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged</em>, a remastered version of the second game in the&nbsp;<em>Broken Sword&nbsp;</em>series, and it's due to arrive early next year.</p>

<p>Per a press release, <i>Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged&nbsp;</i>"celebrates the series' enduring legacy while introducing enhancements for modern players". CEO and founder Charles Cecil says the remastered version will "respect the original while making it shine for modern audiences".</p>

<p>It sounds as though the new remaster will work in a similar way to last year's&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Templars: Reforged</em>, coming complete with new visual enhancements, audio improvements, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/broken-sword-the-smoking-mirror-reforged-beach.jpg?itok=yg8s4qC3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/broken-sword-the-smoking-mirror-reforged-beach.jpg?itok=VJRNpiHn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged&nbsp;</em>remasters a point-and-click classic next year.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Revolution Software, the new version will feature "beautiful high definition" visuals, as well as "crisp audio", but if you love the original, you'll still be able to switch between the new and old styles at any time.</p>

<p>Additionally, if you're the kind of person who gets frustrated at point-and-click adventure puzzles (for which I will throw absolutely no shade your way whatsoever), then you can play with the new "story mode" in order to get "subtle hints".</p>

<p>Once this one's been released, it will be intriguing to see whether Revolution Software decides to revisit its adventures into three dimensions with remasters of 2003's&nbsp;<em>The Sleeping Dragon&nbsp;</em>and 2006's&nbsp;<em>The Angel of Death</em>. Arguably, they're the ones most in need of remastering.</p>

<p>For now, though, you can check out the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged&nbsp;</em>right here. It'll show off the new art style and give you a sense of what you can expect if you pick the game up.</p>




<p>Let's also hope that this remaster is successful enough to prompt a potential new entry in the series, a la 2020's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/beyond-steel-sky" rel="nofollow"><em>Beyond a Steel Sky</em></a>.</p>

<p>For now, though,&nbsp;<em>Broken Sword - The Smoking Mirror: Reforged&nbsp;</em>launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch early next year. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-hellsinger-developer-the-outsiders-shut-down-by-parent-company-funcom.1317700/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Metal: Hellsinger&nbsp;</em>developer The Outsiders has been closed down by its parent company Funcom, according to studio founder David Goldfarb, but he says he's determined to press on regardless.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/locust9.bsky.social/post/3m2jumlqlmc2m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky post</a>, Goldfarb confirms The Outsiders' closure after ten years of operation. The studio's shutdown is part of a wider spate of layoffs at Funcom, which the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-funcom-layoffs" rel="nofollow">announced recently</a> (despite latest release&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>being Funcom's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-sales-1m-infographic" rel="nofollow">most successful game</a> to date).</p>

<p>Goldfarb says he and his studio "survived a near-death studio experience years back when&nbsp;<em>Darkborn&nbsp;</em>was canceled", referring to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embrace-your-inner-monster-in-darkborn" rel="nofollow">a project</a> that was first revealed back in 2015 before being <a href="https://x.com/outsidersgames/status/1255834216815890434" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">canned in April 2020</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-hellsinger-the-outsiders-shutdown-shooting.jpg?itok=_3dTMF_o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-hellsinger-the-outsiders-shutdown-shooting.jpg?itok=zFSmQ3n5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Outsiders' latest (and last) game is 2022's&nbsp;<em>Metal: Hellsinger</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Goldfarb says he and his team were hoping to "do something even better" than&nbsp;<em>Metal: Hellsinger&nbsp;</em>this time, "things don't always go the way you hope", and The Outsiders has instead been closed down.</p>

<p>However, Goldfarb says this might not be the end for him and his team. He says they're "not giving up", and that they "are going to try to continue on in some new form", asking followers to help out with "business leads, placement for employees, guidance, whatever it is".</p>

<p>Funcom originally purchased The Outsiders back in 2021, just a few months before <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/funcom-acquires-conan-ip-holder" rel="nofollow">acquiring the rights</a> to the&nbsp;<em>Conan&nbsp;</em>IP and the holding group that originally held those rights (along with the rights to the likes of&nbsp;<em>Solomon Kane&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mutant-year-zero-road-to-eden" rel="nofollow"><em>Mutant Year Zero</em></a>, the latter of which uses the Swedish <em>Mutant&nbsp;</em>RPG's setting).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, The Outsiders is far from the only studio to be closed down by its parent in recent months. Others include Xbox subsidiary and&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">The Initiative</a>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rich-vogel-t-minus-zero-entertainment-netease-shut-down" rel="nofollow">NetEase-backed outfit T-Minus Zero</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Torchlight 3&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/echtra-games-shut-down-torchlight-3" rel="nofollow">Echtra Games</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/torchlight-3-echtra-games-closure.jpg?itok=1HbqPY62 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/torchlight-3-echtra-games-closure.jpg?itok=jNgJ5trY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Outsiders joins the likes of&nbsp;<em>Torchlight 3&nbsp;</em>studio Echtra Games in being closed down by a bigger parent recently.</figcaption></figure><p>Let's hope that The Outsiders and Goldfarb manage to find a way to continue on beyond the whims of Funcom. In the meantime, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/metal-hellsinger-review" rel="nofollow">re-read our&nbsp;<em>Metal: Hellsinger&nbsp;</em>review</a> to find out just how much we thought the studio's rhythm FPS rocked.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[No, Microsoft Isn't Giving Up Console Development]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-console-hardware-rumors</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-microsoft-isnt-giving-up-console-development.1317625/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft has reiterated its intention to remain in the first-party console business, despite rumors swirling recently that the company may be contemplating an exit from that side of its operations.</p>

<p>In a statement provided to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/no-xboxs-next-gen-console-hardware-plans-arent-cancelled" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Windows Central</a>, Microsoft says it is "actively investing in [its] future first-party consoles and devices designed, engineered, and built by Xbox", which is a pretty definitive rebuttal of rumors to the contrary.</p>

<p>The company also suggested that those who want to see proof of its commitment to the console business can remind themselves of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-gen-xbox-hardware-sneak-peek" rel="nofollow">the agreement</a> Xbox made with AMD back in June, which will see the tech company creating chips for new Xbox devices.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-hardware-rumors-this-is-an-xbox.jpg?itok=nkZV2fzt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-hardware-rumors-this-is-an-xbox.jpg?itok=t0lUZem6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Despite its current multi-device "This Is an Xbox" campaign, Xbox insists it hasn't given up on hardware development.</figcaption></figure><p>Recent rumors appear to have started with leaker <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/microsoft-revamps-xbox-game-pass-plans-and-hikes-ultimate-to-29-99-a-month-ultimate-gets-ubisoft-classics-and-more.1688694/post-270866538" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SneakersSO</a> (who was previously apparently responsible for leaking the news that Xbox would port its games to other hardware, including <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sea-of-thieves-grounded-and-pentiment-officially-announced-for-playstation-platforms" rel="nofollow">erstwhile rival PlayStation</a>).</p>

<p>The leaker said over the weekend that Xbox's future lay in software rather than hardware, and that previously "concrete" plans for new Xbox hardware had become "up in the air". Evidently, that's not the case, or at least that isn't the image Microsoft wants to publicly project.</p>

<p>If Microsoft were to pull out of the console race, it wouldn't necessarily be an entirely ridiculous decision. According to Aldora Intelligence's sales data (via <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/18/new-ps5-versus-xbox-sales-estimates-are-probably-worse-than-youd-expect/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Forbes</a>), Xbox Series X|S sales are sitting at under half of the PlayStation 5's numbers, having failed to break 30 million between the two available machines.</p>

<p>These are not, however, official figures; Microsoft is,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-75m-best-quarter-ever" rel="nofollow">unlike Sony</a>, fairly reticent about regularly announcing how many Xbox Series consoles it's managed to sell. Still, it's fair to say Xbox is almost certainly trailing Sony quite significantly in terms of hardware sales.</p>




<p>Microsoft's statement comes after Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">introduced new tiers for its Game Pass subscription service</a> last week, with Ultimate now costing an eye-watering $30 per month. That move itself came after Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-largest-investment-2025" rel="nofollow">revealed that this year marked its "largest investment"</a> in the service to date.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Denies Generative AI Government Lobbying]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-lobbying-denial</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-denies-generative-ai-government-lobbying.1317550/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Japanese gaming giant Nintendo has denied lobbying its native country's government over generative AI, although the company does say that it intends to continue taking action against anything it perceives as intellectual property infringement.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1974716195246088220" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media, Nintendo says that it "has not had any contact with the Japanese government" regarding generative AI, "contrary to recent discussions on the internet". The studio closes by saying it will "continue to take necessary actions" against IP infringement, "whether generative AI is involved or not".</p>

<p>The message was seemingly posted in response to <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/nintendo-apparently-lobbying-japanese-government-in-fight-against-generative-ai/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a>&nbsp;(thanks, Nintendo Everything) by Japanese House of Representatives politician Satoshi Asano, who said that Nintendo "avoids using generative AI to protect its IP" and that the company was "engaging in lobbying activities with the government".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-generative-ai-lobbying-denial-donkey-kong.jpg?itok=dcJTiuib 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-generative-ai-lobbying-denial-donkey-kong.jpg?itok=qrNQ3PWb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo, the studio behind games like&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, has, in fact, not been lobbying the Japanese government over generative AI.</figcaption></figure><p>Asano himself apologized for the inaccuracy of his original statement and the misleading information contained within, posting a lengthy explanation and apology <a href="https://x.com/Asano__Satoshi/status/1974812318761631821" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on his X account</a>. He's also deleted the original post in order to "prevent further dissemination of inaccurate information" (according to machine translation).</p>

<p>If Nintendo was lobbying the Japanese government over generative AI, though, it likely wouldn't come as much of a surprise, given the company's past statements about the controversial technology.</p>

<p>Back in July last year, Nintendo <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-no-plans" rel="nofollow">said it had no plans</a> to utilize generative AI during any of its development processes, with president Shuntaro Furukawa pointing to "issues with intellectual property rights" and the responsibility of Nintendo to "deliver value" as sticking points.</p>

<p>The legendary gaming company is famously hawkish when it comes to pursuing legal action over its intellectual property. It's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">currently suing</a> Pocketpair, the creator of survival game&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">patent infringement</a>, and it's been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-genki-switch-2-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">aggressive</a> on the legal field in this regard <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-subpoena-request-pokemon-teraleak-identity" rel="nofollow">before</a>, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-generative-ai-lobbying.jpg?itok=nrT_JqIb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-generative-ai-lobbying.jpg?itok=yFsqkjbK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you want to know how protective Nintendo is over its IP rights, ask the folks behind&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's stance on generative AI puts it at odds with many of its peers, including the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow"><em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>studio Krafton</a>, streaming giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" rel="nofollow">Netflix</a>, and fellow gaming titans <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-partners-with-generative-ai-company-to-enable-dynamically-generated-stories-quests" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" rel="nofollow">EA</a>, among others.</p>

<p>However, Nintendo isn't the only gaming luminary to express doubts about generative AI; others, like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-generative-ai" rel="nofollow"><em>BioShock</em>'s Ken Levine</a>, have also evinced skeptical positions on the tech, so Nintendo is far from alone in being cautious.</p>
