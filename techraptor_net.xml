<p>The PS5 Pro arrives on November 7th, and plenty of games, from huge first-party PlayStation efforts through to indie juggernauts and more, will be getting the PS5 Pro treatment, although Sony <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/04/ps5-pro-50-enhanced-games-available-at-launch-november-7/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">doesn't state</a> exactly what these improvements will be for each game.</p>

<p>Instead, the company simply reminds us that the PS5 Pro enables "enhanced ray tracing, PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, and silky smooth framerates of 60hz or 120hz through an upgraded GPU".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/discussing-queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-standalone-expansion-new-princesses<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After the success of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="449834bb-ce3a-4a84-8de1-5fb9557c6eb0" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/queen-by-midnight-review-im-prettiest-princess"><em>Queen By Midnight</em></a>, a deckbuilding card game from designer Kyle Shire and publisher Darrington Press, they’re back again for a standalone that doubles as an expansion; <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="02324209-a2e3-4a29-9940-d2c9418e30b1" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-review-more-princesses-more-problems"><em>Queen By Midnight: Quarter Past</em></a>. Last week we got to sit down with Shire and Alex Uboldi, Game Production Manager at Darrington Press, to talk about the new expansion including the new playable Princesses, how they balanced each character, and whether any more ideas are bouncing around in Shire’s Head.</p>

<p>Before hopping into the interview it’s important to explain that <em>Queen By Midnight</em> is a deckbuilding game where players take on the role of Princesses fighting for a chance to become Queen. Spend Clout to purchase cards from your character deck, or the shared bazaar, to build up your strength and defeat all of the other princesses before the clock strikes midnight.</p>

<h2>The Inception And Collaboration Behind <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em></h2>

<p>To begin our interview Shire introduced himself and the history of development for<em> Queen By Midnight.</em> “The TLDR is wayback in the day I had this weird idea for a card game that I had kicking around for a very long time. I was working full time for a company that rhymes with shmeshminima and didn’t really think anything was going to come from [<em>Queen By Midnight]</em> and when shmeshminima went shmesmwaway I had a bunch of time on my hands and I needed to fill it with something to do. This game became my reason to get out of bed in the morning for the longest time.”</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//y8Vj_uhNKPA"></iframe></p>

<p>After some time, and returning to work, Shire explained that he had continued to work on it behind the scenes until the creation of Darrington Press as the game publishing arm of Critical Role was created. “Darrington Press came along I pitched it to Ivan and thank got someone as talented and wonderful as Alex Uboldi came along and managed to fish all of the good threads out of my tangled mess and managed to make a really great game, and now another one.”</p>

<p>Uboldi hopped in to offer his side of this meeting “When I started at Darrington Press one of the first projects that was handed to me was the original <em>Queen By Midnight</em>. I took it and I played it with a bunch of different groups and every group I played it with loved the game”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Every group I played it with loved the game so I’m like ‘Ok, there’s something special here’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>“It was a lot of my job to basically help develop the art, the graphic design, go through all of the cards and make sure there was consistency,” Alex spoke further on his input to the creation of the finished product that we know today. “Basically it was bringing Kyle’s vision to life in the most beautiful way possible.”</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-preview-image.jpg?itok=ouBHUQCt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-preview-image.jpg?itok=sIy4lBGN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Quarter Past</em> sitting next to the base game of <em>Queen By Midnight</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Reception Worthy Of A Queen</h2>

<p>I asked Shire what it was like having that game, that he was working on in the backburner become such a success, he said “It’s been a dream come true. Any single time I am able to go into a game store and see my game, and talk to game store owners and people playing it, and get their feedback there’s no greater feeling.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“I love hearing all the stories of people saying ‘I won with this character, and I really want to try these other characters’”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Shire and Uboldi shared a common appreciation of hearing peoples stories of winning the game. Whether it be a slow burn through the game, taking out specific Princesses immediately, or using an ability to steal everyone’s Clout etc.</p>

<p>Uboldi admitted “Those stories of people playing the game, that’s why I really do this.”</p>

<h2>How To Build A Princess</h2>

<p>When Shire brought the game to Uboldi and the Darrington Press team he already had a lot of ideas for the Princesses, how they would perform uniquely, and what kind of personality they would have.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-game-board_0.jpg?itok=M0jQriZg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-game-board_0.jpg?itok=VjnhS9aK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Azil With A Z is a new Princess for <em>Quarter Past</em></figcaption></figure><p>“We did a lot of working together to make sure the Princesses felt like they were their identities, they developed in cool and interesting ways. Neither of us expected as we were bouncing ideas off each other that these Princesses would develop into fully fledged characters that both of us are happy with.”</p>

<p>Speaking to the expansion Uboldi explained that the process was very similar “We wanted to make the expansion for this game because we love this world and we want to see more from it. Kyle laid out all of the design for the four new pricesses.” At that time Shire already had ideas for the vibes of each of these new Princesses as well as their mechanics to make them a unique play experience at the table.</p>



<p>Four new Princesses have been added as part of <em>Quarter Past</em>; Elise LeKraken, Azil With A Z, Kahurere Skyfisher, and Qasima Al-Basar.</p>

<p>Talking on the inspirations for these characters Shire explained that "if Ursula is to Devine, then you will have Elise LeKraken to Monet X Change. Dialing back to the original conceit behind Ursula and making that the focal point for our mermaid princess is just absolutely inspired."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>For more on the mechanics and gameplay style for each of these new Princesses you can check out our full review of <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>"Azil With A Z is our wonderful nod to Alice in Wonderland. Our absurdist and surreal princess. Her whole vibe is that she's the only princess who has access to all three classes. I always tell people that she's the chaos character, if you're not interested in winning but want to cause a bunch of chaos you've got to play Azil."</p>

<p>Uboldi continued describing the characters talking about Qasima Al-Basar "who is our Princess Jasmine meeds Aladdin analog. By day she's a princess and by night she's a vigilante who protects her kingdom personally. We wanted to create a character who felt like she hed a lot of tools for espionage, but if she needs to she doles out great damage."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-character-decks_0.jpg?itok=4FAHv1II 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-character-decks_0.jpg?itok=tEXcy-me 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each Princess has their own unique deck and playstyle</figcaption></figure><p>The last of the new characters is Kahurere Skyfisher who doesn't want to be Queen, but she wants to bring the whole system down. "She is Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia meets Moana. Because she doesn't have this grand kingdom she has to use more covert means. Her mechanic is laying traps for all the other Princesses. They can either keep the traps in their hand to be a dead card or play the trap to draw another card, but the trap will do something to help Skyfisher"</p>

<p>This deck is all about the other players making choices to have benefits together, or working against one another. Uboldi explained that what drew him to liking this character was that it's very "Interactive. It lets you talk to the whole table and it involves everyone and that's where the game is it's most fun"</p>

<p>While all four of these characters have their own unique mechanics Shire did explain that they designed each to be a far more aggressive character, making big moves quickly.</p>

<h2>There Might Be Two Lost Princesses?</h2>

<p>Interestingly when talking about how he came up with the original concepts for the Princesses that the first game would have twelve Princesses. "So I had cooked up rough ideas for 12 princesses, eventually I thought it was madness and cut it down to six that I felt like were the six most well baked out of them."</p>

<p>From the other six they were included in Shire's original draft of the first game for potential expansions and four of those are what we can now play. When asked if we would see these two final Princesses Shire said "I don't know, we'll have to figure that out, I have an idea but we'll see…" as Uboldi shrugged.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-clock_0.jpg?itok=h3MVrdxX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-clock_0.jpg?itok=yACaCTQb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Instead of the full clocktower <em>Quarter Past</em> tracks the game with this more portable alternative</figcaption></figure><h2>Creating Balance Across The Lands</h2>

<p>As each Princess has their own unique deck and you can now play with up to ten Princesses I was curious to understand how they approached balancing so many characters. Having already created the prior six helped them have a good baseline. Uboldi explained that "We looked at the original princesses and the baseline power level. We scaled everything to match that power level, but because we were making these changes to the core deck it changes the dynamic of these princesses to be much more aggressive."</p>

<p>By not having the ability to block an attack, it allowed them to design the pricesses to be more aggressive knowing that they're also more vulnerable to attacks.</p>

<p>"Against each other they felt very balanced, but against the Core Set Princesses there was interesting gameplay for the Princesses who are holding off an assault and trying to go over the top or Princesses who are trying to race down their opponents."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-errata-cards_0.jpg?itok=vni-9QJo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-errata-cards_0.jpg?itok=6ECpO2BL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This expansion also contains errata cards for the base version so you can play it in it's 'best' form</figcaption></figure><h2>Expansion As Well As Standalone</h2>

<p>Many board games when expanding a roster of playable characters would simply release a character expansion and move on. For <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em> I was impressed that not only was this four new playable characters that interact with one another but that it came with all that that you need to play it on it's own.</p>

<p>Uboldi explained that for Darrington Press they understood that the base game retailing at $70 that was a high price point for something you might not like. "We designed <em>Quarter Past</em> as a great entry place for newer players"</p>

<p>"We really wanted it to work well on it's own, we even designed the Princesses and Bazaar cards to be simpler but mechanically deep to make this as approachable for a new entry player as possible."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-review-more-princesses-more-problems<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's now been a little over a year since I played <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="449834bb-ce3a-4a84-8de1-5fb9557c6eb0" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/queen-by-midnight-review-im-prettiest-princess">Darrington Press' <em>Queen By Midnight</em></a>. Taking part in a deckbuilding battle royale where the victor walks away the titular Queen By Midnight this game showed off unique mechanics and a gorgeous cardboard craft clock that serves not only as an impressive setpiece but manages core game mechanics. Now with the standalone expansion, Queen By Midnight Quarter Past, four new Princesses join the fray.</p>



<p>Contained within the box of <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em> you'll find complete instructions for how to play the game (including boxes that specify what's new in this edition), a flat clock for turn tracking, boards and tokens for each of the four Princesses, specific decks for each Princess, and a deck of Bazaar cards broken up into three time segments.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-box-components.jpg?itok=Zq-p2lpO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-box-components.jpg?itok=oPzJKEbK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If you have played <em>Queen By Midnight</em>, then setting up and playing the game will come as no surprise. Players each pick which of the Princesses they wish to play as, gathering up the relevant character board and deck. Then, the clock is laid out and set up with Bazaar cards. Once everyone is ready you roll the dice to see who goes first and begin playing your cards.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>While in the original game the clock was a massive structure that doubled as a dice tower that you would build and place on a spinning platform the clock included in Quarter Past is a flat clock. While less intricate it does promote the idea of Quarter Past functioning as a 'travel' version of the game, while the larger box can stay at home.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>A quick gameplay overview</h2>

<p>Working to develop their decks players will use cards to increase their Clout, the primary currency in the game, and purchase new cards. Cards can be purchased from a Princesses specific Vault, which will contain abilities unique to the Princess, or they can be purchased from the Bazaar which offers a more generic, but useful nonetheless, variety of abilities.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>Each newly purchased card is sent to the Archive, this game's equivalent of a graveyard, when it will be shuffled back into their deck to then be used against other Princesses.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-game-board.jpg?itok=64-l8yI3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-azil-game-board.jpg?itok=kMf9E-a6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game is a constant balance of spending and regaining Clout, as your deck grows in size you'll quickly learn you can't just be spending Clout freely as your ability to regain it will return less and less frequently. Alternatively, leaving too much Clout on your board does leave it in a place where it can get stolen by another's card effects.</p>

<p>The deckbuilding alone is a lot of fun but after each player has completed a turn the clock will increment by one. At certain key times, like 5 o'clock or 8 O'Clock important events can happen such as the Bazaar cards being swapped out for a deck filled with more powerful abilities, or the hand size limit is increased.</p>

<p>The game ultimately ends after the clock reaches 12, or if only one competing Princess remains. This does a good job to keep a cap on the events of the game and to limit just how much power creep can occur.</p>

<h2>Drawing At The Start Slows The Game Down</h2>

<p>One of the largest issues that I've found with <em>Queen By Midnight</em> is that as long as you have clout you can be activating cards, in most scenarios, especially in the early game you'll be spending down your entire hand before the end of your turn.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-vault.jpg?itok=QXDKF-Bm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/queen-by-midnight-quarter-past-vault.jpg?itok=KrnB9LHl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Sitting at the table with nothing in your hand isn't anything I have an issue with, but not knowing what I'm going to draw next will mean I have no clue what any of my options are for next turn.</p>

<p>At the start of each player's turn momentum always slows. A fresh hand of cards are drawn, effects are read, Clout is increased, and the six purchasable cards may be reviewed.</p>

<p>This will mean that unless you're playing with a group that knows their Princesses' abilities inside and out that you are limited in how much time you can be strategizing, or you leave the table waiting on you for your move (while they too have no clue what they're going to do next).</p>

<h2>The new Princesses and their abilities</h2>

<p>As the name implies <em>Queen By Midnight Quarter Past</em> sees four new Princesses joining. This expansion includes Azil With-A-Z, Elise LaKraken, Kahurere Skyfisher, and Qasima Al-Basar. Each comes with their own unique mechanics and playstyle that let you mix and match against other players for strange situations.</p>

<p>Azil With-A-Z is a reference to Alice in Wonderland, with the ability to Shrink and Grow. By changing her size she also alters one of her Classes between Brawler and Schemer. Her abilities are incredibly strong, but as you can only perform certain abilities when a certain class you can also end up being stuck unable to deal damage.</p>

<p>I had a lot of fun playing with Azil, there's an important aspect of needing to plan your moves as far out as you can. If an ability would deal damage, but then cause you to shrink, what can you then do in that state? Do you have a way to grow again? It was very satisfying when everything fell into place.</p>

This would all be a power play to then unleash ultimate abilities near the end of the game to flip the game in her favour.</p>

<p>It was interesting that LeKraken worked almost as a sleeper character, but knowing her mechanics and targeting her early could also be an easy downfall depending on the number of players and how dedicated they were to knocking competition out of the game.</p>

<p>Kahurere Skyfisher is a Brawler/Schemer whose mechanic is in traps. She has a variety of cards that can be placed in other players Archives. When activated those cards might gain a benefit to the Princess, such as getting to draw a card, but it will also provide a boon to Skyfisher.</p>

<p>Whether it be ways to steal Clout or also be able to draw a card there's a lot of good that can be done for Skyfisher on another player's turn, not to mention the inclusion of a card like this is their deck might mean it takes them longer to draw a card they're actually interested in getting.</p>

This is a large amount of Clout to be able to freely obtain, but when early turns comprise of gaining a lot of Clout and then spending it down to zero we most often ended up in situations where there wasn't any Clout to steal effectively rendering that card useless.</p>

<p>If Elise LeKraken is a sleeper the opposite of that is Qasima Al-Basar, the Brawler/Caster. This character doesn't start extremely strong but with some smart purchases will not only be dealing consistent damage, but will also grant themselves permanent damage boosts. A hit of three or four damage might not be much early on, but when the pace doesn't even stop but she's now hitting with eight damage you're going to be in trouble very quickly.</p>

<p>While Skyfisher seemed to have a narrower range of effectiveness the engine that is driving each of these decks is wildly different and a lot of fun. Further fleshing out the availability from the previously released Princesses the idea of "there's a playstyle for any kind of deckbuilding player" is even more true than before.</p>

<p>I think one of the best compliments I can give for the game is that it feels like getting to play Magic The Gathering, without the need to build a deck and strategy from the ground up. That being said there's still a lot of building as you weigh up purchasing cards from the Vault and Bazaar.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>Everything included in the box allows you to play <em>Queen By Midnight</em> from start to finish with four players. As an expansion though all of the Princesses available in this box can be played with any of the six previously available Princesses.</p>

<p>While Skyfisher seemed to have issues when facing off against Azil, it might be that there's another Princess that she has a definite advantage against.</p>

<p>To add further to this being an expansion Errata Cards for the base game have also been included in this update. These cards should be swapped out with cards that appear in the base game to better balance the experience.</p>

<p>I genuinely enjoyed the original game when I played it so I was excited to hear that there would be an expansion. The triple versatility allowing it to add more characters for fans of the base game, be a smaller entry point for new players, and even serve as a way to send updated cards allows it to achieve it's goal perfectly.</p>

<p>Of the four new Princesses I'm a little iffy on Skyfisher, but had a blast seeing what the other three were able to accomplish.</p>

<p>If you were a fan of the original game then this expansion is a no brainer, and if you don't know the original but are looking for a fun and deep deckbuilder where the game naturally scales as time goes on then I'd highly recommend checking this out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-photo-puzzle-solved<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An enterprising&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>player has solved a rather involved puzzle involving examining in-game photos, earning himself some praise from the game's director into the bargain.</p>

<p>Redditor Dale Robinson <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1gine5k/i_solved_the_sh2_remake_photos_secret/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">created a lengthy post yesterday</a> detailing all the steps he took to solve the puzzle. I don't wish to spoil the steps just in case you want to discover it for yourself, but suffice it to say that you'll need a healthy dose of lateral thinking if you do.</p>

<p>Robinson's efforts were <a href="https://x.com/Mateusz_Lenart_/status/1853189523745730675" rel="noopener" target="_blank">lauded on X (formerly Twitter)</a> by&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>director Mateusz Lenart, who said he "knew it wouldn't stay hidden for long" and congratulated Robinson for solving the brain-teaser, suggesting that the "timing couldn't be better". Again, that post contains puzzle spoilers, so click at your peril.</p>

<p>Just in case you're unaware, the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake is, believe it or not, a reimagined version of the original 2002 survival horror classic. While the original game was created by Konami, this one's been developed by&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/medium">The Medium</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Layers of Fear&nbsp;</em>studio Bloober Team, with Konami serving as publisher.</p>

<p>The game hews fairly closely to the original&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>'s story, but it features a new over-the-shoulder camera perspective, as well as extra story elements and quality-of-life gameplay tweaks.</p>




<p>The game proved popular with both critics and fans, selling <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-1m">a million copies within its first three days</a> on sale, although that didn't stop <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-wikipedia-page-locked">Wikipedia trolls from trying to edit the game's page</a> to suggest it had received much lower scores than it actually did.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/netflix-goes-all-in-on-generative-ai-for-gaming-appoints-dedicated-vp.1026825/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has appointed a VP (vice president) of generative AI within its gaming division, indicating that the tech giant is serious about the controversial technology when it comes to video games.</p>

<p>The VP in question is none other than Mike Verdu, who confirmed the news <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mike-verdu-2a6113_new-role-at-netflix-vp-genai-for-games-activity-7259029850827423744-YMg4/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via his LinkedIn page</a>. Verdu says his new role at Netflix is to drive "a 'once in a generation' inflection point for game development and player experiences using generative AI".</p>

<p>Previously, Verdu worked as Netflix's overall games VP, but that role will now be filled by Alain Tascan, who Verdu says is "already in the process of taking Netflix Games in exciting new directions".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/netflix-games-generative-ai-vp-tiles.jpg?itok=pPu8zuXh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/netflix-games-generative-ai-vp-tiles.jpg?itok=cjQSaYPt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Netflix has appointed a VP to handle generative AI for its gaming division.</figcaption></figure><p>Verdu says that generative AI represents a return to "seemingly unlimited potential and the rapid pace of innvoation" in gaming, expressing excitement he says he hasn't felt "since the 90s".</p>

<p>He also exhorts readers to "pay no mind to the uninformed speculation in the media" about recent changes to Netflix Games, presumably referring to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-report">reported closure</a> of Netflix's in-house AAA development studio, codenamed Team Blue.</p>

<p>According to Verdu, everything that's happened within Netflix Games in the last several months "was actually a planned transition", suggesting that the closure of Team Blue wasn't a kneejerk response but a carefully-considered decision.</p>

<p>The vision for generative AI at Netflix, according to Verdu, is one that "puts creative talent at the center", uses AI as "a catalyst and an accelerant", and enables big development teams to "move much faster".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-generative-ai.jpg?itok=hcGzR3dw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-generative-ai.jpg?itok=IiC-FpfN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Other studios, like Ubisoft, are also leaning into generative AI.</figcaption></figure><p>The topic of generative AI is a controversial one in the gaming world (and, indeed, the rest of the world) right now.</p>

<p>Proponents like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-ceo-chris-cocks-expresses-support-of-ai-in-dungeons-dragons">Hasbro</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nihon-falcom-considering-ai-translation">Nihon Falcom</a>, and <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/5qXdxhshJBXoanFZApdG3L/how-ubisofts-new-generative-ai-prototype-changes-the-narrative-for-npcs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ubisoft</a>&nbsp;tout the potential benefits of the technology and seem enthusiastic about the ways in which they believe it could change the gaming landscape, but there are certainly no shortage of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-no-plans">ambivalent</a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/kobold-press-ceo-says-no-to-generative-ai">skeptical voices</a> in the industry on this front.</p>

<p>In any case, we don't know exactly how Verdu and Netflix intend to use generative AI, so we'll likely have to wait until a major project from the company is announced in order to learn more. Stay tuned!</p>
