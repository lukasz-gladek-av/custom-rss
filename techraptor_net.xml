            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Evil Hat Productions has announced it will be launching a crowdfunding campaign for Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins. This is not a reprint of the original documentary-style books, but rather a new collection of volumes that delve into the early years of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> and its numerous supplements.</p>

<h2>The <em>Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins</em> Backerkit Campaign Announcement</h2>

<p>According to its official <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/call_to_action/0477a26f-723e-4d2f-8f11-74cdc007daf1/landing" rel="nofollow">landing page</a>, <em>Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins</em> is a 4-volume set that covers the history of each and every product released by TSR for original <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, <em>AD&amp;D</em>, and <em>Basic D&amp;D</em>. This will include all Unearthed Arcana, the legendary orange-covered B3, and the rare 1986 <em>Up The Garden Path</em> prewritten adventure.</p>

She delves deeply into the artwork, design, and origins, as well as other iconic books released during the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG's formative years. Everything from the start of the TTRPG genre, to the discovery of the Forgotten Realms, to the fall of Mystara will be covered in these books.</p>

<p>Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins is a more comprehensive look at one of <em>D&amp;D's</em> eras by Appelcline. This is in comparison to past <em>Designers &amp; Dragons</em> books, which focused more on the broader history of the TTRPG industry. The origin of TSR and the influence of wargaming in the 1970s. The rise of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fighting-fantasy-solo-adventure-rpg-series-returns-to-us-through-steve-jackson-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steve Jackson</a> and West End Games in the 80s. The growth of independent publishers in the 2000s. The list goes on.</p>

<p>Evil Hat Productions is the publisher of many beloved TTRPGs throughout the years. Their work includes the electropunk dark fantasy heist game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/blades-in-dark-review-next-level-roleplaying" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Blades in the Dark</em></a>, the <em>Dresden Files</em> RPG, <em>Thirsty Sword Lesbians</em>, <em>Apocalypse Keys</em>, and <em>Monster of the Week</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the landing page, the Backerkit campaign for <em>Designers &amp; Dragons: Origins</em> will go live near the end of October.</p>
