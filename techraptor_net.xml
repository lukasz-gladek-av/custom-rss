            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the world of Garranox, 2 kill teams hunt in the industrial complexes and the depths of the newly discovered underground catacombs, where something dangerous for everyone stirs. We check out <em>Kill Team</em> Shadowhunt, the next expansion for <em>Kill Team</em>, looking at the 2 new kill teams and the new game style that includes both underground and overground maps.</p><p><em>Kill Team</em> is a skirmish wargame set in Games Workshop's larger <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> setting. As a skirmish game, <em>Kill Team</em> features a small number of elite troops, fighting special operations battles, rather than huge battles fought with entire armies. We've covered <em>Kill Team</em> in depth since the first edition, and you can read our review of the current <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Starter Set</a>,&nbsp;or the set that kicked off this season, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-tomb-world-review-original-kill-team-joins-purge" rel="nofollow">Kill Team Tomb World</a>.</p>
<h2>As Above, So Below</h2><p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Shadowhunt is an expansion for <em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;and requires a copy of the <em>Kill Team</em> core rulebook, dice, and a measuring tool to use. The campaign is set above and below ground, so having a set of above-ground scenery (the campaign recommends the set from <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-hivestorm-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Kill Team Hivestorm</a>) and an indoor set (from either the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-400000-kill-team-into-dark-preview" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Gallowdark</a> season or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-tomb-world-review-original-kill-team-joins-purge" rel="nofollow">Tomb World</a>).</p><p>The full box contents are:</p><ul><li data-list-item-id="efdece8a141a7386111bd9e81118c85ca"><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Shadowhunt Dossier</li><li data-list-item-id="e2e249c3be4d579f85565463214b9e006">6x Chaos Space Marines Murderwing&nbsp;kill team miniatures (6x Chaos Space Marines)</li><li data-list-item-id="eae980510fe1a74bb666548c64cf508bb">10x Adeptus Sororitas Celestian Insidiants kill team&nbsp;miniatures (10x Sisters)</li><li data-list-item-id="e515eeb6589924d8010f1ab3e43a74b73">Datacards and tokens for both kill teams</li><li data-list-item-id="eafa26dc62435d8059dc4e7b73b63030c">2 Game Boards</li></ul><picture>

  </picture><p>The included game boards are slightly smaller than the standard boards, to reflect the fact that you will be fighting in both at the same time. The joint and adversary ops missions in Shadowhunt have objectives both above and below ground, as well as entryways to move between the 2 maps. The Shadowhunt dossier also includes rules for Necron non-player operatives, and it all culminates in a battle with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-500-worlds-titus-review-titus-and-friends" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Shard of the Nightbringer</a> that had a new miniature for <em>Warhammer 40K </em>recently<em>. </em>The Shadowhunt narrative also fits in with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-40k-500-worlds-titus-review-titus-and-friends" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">500 Worlds</a> campaign, making it great to play alongside if you're also running a wider <em>40K</em> campaign.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>To Catch A Witch</h2><p>The Celestian Insidiants are a specialist unit of the Adeptus Soroitas, sometimes known as the Sisters of Battle. The Insidiants are the most witch-huntery witch hunters to enter the <em>Warhammer 40K</em> Universe. Inquisitors have insane levels of power and backing, but they are generally operating for the good of the imperium, even if some worlds get exterminated along the way. The Insidiants make use of null-technology, similar to the natural ability of the Sisters of Silence, and over time, this has pushed their paranoia beyond normal boundaries, and they now see witchcraft and heresy everywhere.</p><p>The Insidiants take faith and sacrifice seriously, and whenever one of their operatives charges or takes out an enemy with 6 or more wounds, they become inspiring. When an inspiring Insidiant is incapacitated, they can grant a nearby Insidiant a benediction, such as healing D3+2 wounds, adding 1 to their action points for the rest of the game, performing a free charge or dash (limited to 3 inches), or gaining the ceaseless rules for its weapons (which lets you reroll all results of 1 number). When an Insidiant becomes inspiring, they gain the severe rules for their weapons (letting you change a result into a crit if you don't roll any crits), and some of the different profiles also have special rules, like the basic Insidiant Warrior, which adds 1 to their crit damage if they're inspiring.</p><p>The Celestian Insidiants kill team can take 9 warriors into battle, and they have 8 operative types, including the Superior. You can take 2 Cremators, flamer-armed operatives, so you will usually take one of each specialist, 2 Cremators and 1 standard Warrior, and the box will let you build all the specialists, 2 Cremators and 2 Warriors (giving you a spare Warrior).</p><p>My favorite Insidiant is the Mortisanctus, who lets you issue a challenge to a specific enemy. If that enemy accepts, the Mortisanctus gains an additional attack while fighting them, and then gains it permanently if they incapacitate that operative. If the enemy refuses, they lose an attack when fighting against any of your Insidiants. A key operative for the Insidiants is the Censor, who carries the Virge of Admonition. Enemies in range of the Virge's null field, have their move stat reduced by 2 and find it harder to hit their targets. The null field starts with a range of 1 inch, but by taking a ritual action, it can be increased by 1, to a maximum of 5 inches.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Kill Team ShadowhuntLords Of Murder</h2><p>Murderwings are made up of Heretic, Traitor, or Renegade Astartes, those that either fell from the Emperor's light during the Horus Heresy, or have left the folds of the Imperium in the 10,000 years since. Murderwings are made up exclusively of jump pack-equipped Raptors, some of which have been twisted by the warp and now have the ability to teleport and are now known as Warp Talons.</p><p>All Murderwing operatives have the jump pack special rule, which allows them to boost during a straight-line element of their movement, ignoring terrain as long as they're not under a vantage point. It means that they can scale buildings easily to get higher than their opponents, which lets you trigger a lot of their ploys. Some operatives also have access to special boost abilities that can trigger if the operative boosted across the battlefield, targeting enemies that fall under their line of movement. The basic Murderwing Raptor can ignore any changes to its stats due to being injured for the rest of their activation if they boosted during their move.</p><p>Murderwings can take 6 operatives, but they have access to 9 different types, including the Chaos Lord. You only get 6 in the box, and 4 operatives also have some armament options, meaning you will need to make some choices when selecting your kill team.</p><p>My favorite operatives for the Murderwing are the Depredator, armed with a great chainaxe, which, along with 5 attacks dealing 7 damage on crits, they can also take a Carving Blow action that deals 2D3 damage to all operatives within 2 inches of them. &nbsp;I also love the Chaos Lord who leads the Murderwing. The Chaos Lord starts with 1 Damnation Point, and once per action, you can roll against your Damnation Points to get a boon, either ignoring damage equal to your damnation points if the attack is doing more than 3 damage to you, or dealing extra damage equal to your damnation points in an attack. But playing with the warp has its risks. If you roll under your damnation points, the Lord takes damage equal to their damnation points, roll above it, and you get the benefit, plus add one to your damnation points, making it more difficult to roll above later, and giving you more damage if you fail.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Kill Team Shadowhunt Final Thoughts?</h2><p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Shadowhunt includes 2 great new kill teams. The Murderwing are hyper-mobile, getting them into the thick of combat where they can dish out damage. The Insidiants are a more thoughtful kill team, looking to inspire their operatives and then sacrifice them to gain benefits for the surviving sisters, whilst keeping your key pieces alive, like the Censor to debuff your enemies' operatives. The new above and below-ground missions are great, offering some memorable races to get underground, and then maintain control above ground whilst battling Necrons as well as your original enemy. I also like how it links to the 500 Worlds narrative for the wider <em>Warhammer 40K</em> setting for anyone looking to link up their battles.</p><hr><p><em>The copy of</em> <strong>Kill Team Shadowhunt</strong>&nbsp;<em>used to produce this review was provided by Games Workshop.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the grim dark world of <em>Warhammer 40k</em> it appears that the masters at Games Workshop have sent out their legal arbiters again. This time the arbiters (or as others may call them, lawyers,) have fired off a <em>Void War </em>DMCA, taking down the video game from Steam.&nbsp;</p><p>Released last June, <em>Void War</em> is an <em>FTL</em>-like roguelite game that heavily homages the Games Workshop created <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6bc2812a-69f3-4947-89d3-4c79996f4d0f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40k</em></a>. In fact, when I <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/10-steam-next-fest-best-demos-february-2025" rel="nofollow">wrote about it as part of Steam Next Fest</a> in February 2025 I said that it seemed to have "scrubbed off" references, as in changing names and other elements sometimes called 'filing off the serial numbers'.</p><p>While not a huge success, <em>Void War</em> had done pretty well for itself on Steam, until last night when the game was mysteriously removed from the PC store front. At first there was no comment from the developer, and then a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2853590/discussions/0/685243800199705595/" rel="nofollow">general post</a> made that they were working with Steam to rectify the situation. Speculation abounded, but this afternoon, they provided a more in-depth response confirming that it was indeed a DMCA takedown.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>According to Tundra Interactive, they have not received any other communication from Games Workshop (and in fact <em>Void War</em> is up <a href="https://tundra-interactive.itch.io/void-war" rel="nofollow">on Itch.Io still</a>) and Valve provided merely the information of Games Workshop's public facing infringements inbox, and the name 'Mal Reynolds'.&nbsp;</p><p>For sci-fi fans, that name may ring a bell, as it is indeed the same as the main character from <em>Firefly</em>, which has led to Tundra Interactive wondering if someone else filed the <em>Void War</em> DMCA takedown. Their attempts to contact Games Workshop to confirm have so far failed to be replied to. In the meantime, Tundra Interactive is going through the DMCA process and says they will, "share further updates when we have confirmed information."&nbsp;</p><p>We also reached out to Games Workshop to inquire, but they did not immediately respond to our inquiry. In the interim, <em>Void War</em> isn't available on Steam though you can still see their <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2853590/discussions/" rel="nofollow">forums</a> there. If you want to pick up <em>Void War</em>, it's in early access and <a href="https://tundra-interactive.itch.io/void-war" rel="nofollow">available on Itch.io</a> for the moment. That version will also provide you with a Steam key if/when this current situation is resolved.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
