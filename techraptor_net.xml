<p>If you're not familiar with <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>, it's the followup to the well-received JRPG <em>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</em>.

It's a teaser, so it doesn't give too much away, but it should give you an idea of what to expect at any rate.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On the surface,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/relooted-is-unique-heist-game-for-2d-platforming-speedrun-fans" rel="nofollow"><em>Relooted</em> first appeared to be a very intriguing game</a> to be introduced to the industry, solely based on its overarching narrative. Since its reveal during the Day of the Devs showcase last year, there have been increased yet negative conversations regarding the controversial subject matter of cultural repatriation, rooted in misinformation and racism.</p><p>As such, one was quite cautious, maybe concerned about how nuanced developer Nyamakop will present its story and how it approached tackling this conversation, one that is still ongoing today.&nbsp;After hours of playtime,&nbsp;what&nbsp;it&nbsp;did was leave&nbsp;one feeling frustrated while raising some important questions regarding preservation and the future of modern museums&nbsp;regarding&nbsp;African art repatriation.</p><h2>Pulling Off Africa's Biggest Heist Of The Century</h2><picture>

  </picture><p>Nyamakop's 2D side-scrolling puzzle platformer,&nbsp;<em>Relooted</em>, is set in a semi-futuristic&nbsp;city&nbsp;of Johannesburg, South Africa, where&nbsp;we find&nbsp;the game's protagonist, Nomali,&nbsp;embarking&nbsp;on a&nbsp;dangerous mission to rescue her younger brother, Trevor.&nbsp;What follows is Nomali being convinced by her art historian grandmother,&nbsp;Professor Grace,&nbsp;to form a ragtag group of vigilante thieves in a high-stakes mission to reclaim stolen artifacts from the African continent and beyond in an effort to return them home.</p><p>Within the context of&nbsp;<em>Relooted</em> in&nbsp;the 21st century, the Transatlantic Returns Treaty has been&nbsp;put into power, operating as an intermediary body to ensure that African artifacts&nbsp;will be&nbsp;safely returned to their place of origin.&nbsp;As expected, there is one major caveat, largely due to some interesting phrasing, that this is only applicable to cultural artifacts that are being publicly displayed in museums globally.</p><p>As such, some Western museums have opted to quietly remove the artifacts in question and place them in secure vaults,&nbsp;while&nbsp;private collectors have&nbsp;continued&nbsp;to keep theirs behind locked doors in&nbsp;private&nbsp;collections.&nbsp;Sure, those museums aren't committing anything illegal, but morally, it's quite a heinous thing to do if one isn't planning on returning them.</p><p>This is where Nomali, Trevor, and their team come&nbsp;into play, as they've been tasked&nbsp;to&nbsp;"bypass" the&nbsp;Transatlantic Returns Treaty by acting outside the law and reclaiming those artifacts.&nbsp;From the many great heist films,&nbsp;like&nbsp;<em>The Thomas Crown Affair</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Italian Job</em>, the&nbsp;<em>Ocean's trilogy</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Inception</em> as examples, planning a heist&nbsp;looks&nbsp;almost&nbsp;near&nbsp;effortless with careful planning, reconnaissance work, and exceptional&nbsp;team building by using&nbsp;every member's strengths to their advantage.</p><p>In the case of&nbsp;<em>Relooted</em>, the&nbsp;team Nomali builds&nbsp;are not hardened criminals nor have criminal backgrounds, but are skilled in their respective areas of expertise, which adds a shade of unpredictability that gives&nbsp;<em>Relooted</em> that&nbsp;thrilling charm.&nbsp;As the game progressed, more members were added, but with these additions came a greater risk of carelessness, overexposure, and&nbsp;failure that jeopardized their plans, team morale, and overall mission of returning priceless cultural artifacts to their native homelands.</p><h2>Reclaiming Africa's Cultural History</h2><picture>

  </picture><p><em>Relooted</em> looks and plays like a well-designed side-scrolling platforming game, but due to the immense amount of research into the game's development lies a game with plenty of heart, soul, and reverence. Relooted features 70 cultural artifacts from the African continent and a few from other cultures outside Africa.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/144812/relooted-is-a-stylish-and-topical-heist-game-about-doing-crime-for-the-right-reasons" rel="nofollow">a Shacknews interview with Nyamakop's Creative Director Ben Myers</a>, the team employed full-time researchers who assisted and advised the development team with deciding which historical and cultural artifacts would be included in-game. <em>"Not a lot of people realize the scale of African artifacts that aren't in Africa,"</em> and as such, for the developers, <em>"a lot of the research was finding the most interesting stories, trying to find artifacts that had huge cultural [or] spiritual importance to the people they were taken from."</em></p><p>Within the context of <em>Relooted</em>, Nomali's art historian grandmother mentions that any and all African artifacts that are returned under the&nbsp;Transatlantic Returns Treaty are granted once a deal is brokered. However, much like in real life, where certain bodies and countries just outright decline to return these historical and cultural African artifacts back to their place of origin, the same situation is being played out in-game.</p><p>It has been publicly documented within the media over the last few decades that many African countries have pleaded with museums, private bodies, and organizations to return stolen artifacts to Africa. An example was 39 pieces that were returned to the Ugandan government by the University of Cambridge in 2024; however, the condition was that they were loaned back to the government for a three-year period, which can be extended,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/africa-stolen-artifacts-colonial-deaccessioning-repatriation/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">according to a news report from CBS News</a>.</p><p>Similarly, Germany has promised to return 1,130 artifacts to Nigeria in 2022, with 22 Benin Bronzes already back in the country, based on&nbsp;<a href="https://apnews.com/article/africa-germany-berlin-13e1a65da1b08644d3c5d5032d24e426" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">reporting from the Associated Press</a>. Sadly, not all requests have been approved, as in 2018, <a href="https://www.theartnewspaper.com/2018/01/12/pariss-dapper-foundation-stalls-talks-over-cameroonian-sculpture" rel="nofollow">the Dapper Foundation has stalled talks to return the&nbsp;Bangwa Queen</a>, which is featured in&nbsp;<em>Relooted</em>, and is still being held in France despite requests for it to be returned to Cameroon.</p><p>These cultural pieces still hold great religious significance in their respective countries in today's modern times, yet despite being looted as rewards for the violence invoked across the continent, the request for them to be returned is being denied on the basis that they best belong in the gilded halls of museums around the world. <em>Relooted</em> greatly emphasizes the need for increased dialogue surrounding cultural repatriation by placing&nbsp;a lot of care, dedication, and great detail into highlighting and restoring the historical significance of these artifacts.</p><p>Not only are the artifacts intricately recreated by talented 3D artists, but each artifact has well-researched descriptions and is accurately pronounced in the dialogue. <em>"And then we also had a woman who produced our pronunciation guide to make sure the way the artifacts and ethnicities are pronounced is correct and accurate, too,”</em> Myers explained in the&nbsp;Shacknews interview.</p><h2>Error Controls In The Planning Phase</h2><picture>

  </picture><p><em>Relooted</em> has many tremendous components to love and appreciate, especially given the great level of detail that went into the research and development of the game. While <em>Relooted</em> offers a new, fresh, and nuanced experience that one has never seen in the industry to date, the game is held back by some technical and creative issues that were annoying or confusing at times.</p><p>A combination of controller issues, gameplay bugs relating to the parkour movement and wall-jumping, and game crashes were the most prevalent technical issues that had one forcibly close the game before relaunching. Sadly, this meant having to backtrack on progress, as the auto-save feature didn't kick in to advance the game and its narrative.</p><p>Dealing with controller issues was annoying at times, as some incidents were isolated from other issues. However, it becomes&nbsp;frustrating when it snowballs&nbsp;with other problems, resulting in lost gameplay time and important saved progress if the auto-save wasn't triggered.</p><p>The game's platforming was quite an arduous experience, especially in certain locations like the House of Horrors and the Shiny Place heist locations, as timed jumps and speed boosts felt like they were on a delay or couldn't clear gaps with free-running and jumping distance. There were some hilarious ones to boot, like during the Maiden Voyage training session, where, during the Ndedi training session, smashing into a window left one in a glitched state and suspended mid-air, which surely was added to the <strong>"Funny Screenshot Moments"</strong> folder.</p><p>As an addendum, one noticed the disconnect between the planning phase and the heist itself, as many of the questions raised and inquiries asked didn't correspond to the plans that eventually unfolded in the subsequent heist mission, other than finding the artifacts and marking a path to the exit. It is certain that some technical issues are likely to be patched in the coming weeks; what could be slightly improved on is the disjointed character interactions and dialogue options during gameplay.</p><p>Some of the performances didn't feel compelling enough to care about certain characters, and there wasn't enough natural or organic chemistry where actors would play off of each other. This wasn't the case in a handful of the cutscenes, naturally, as the interactions were more convincing and well-performed, but the gameplay performances left more to be desired, which is not the fault of the actors but possibly the voice direction that was given.</p><h2><em>Relooted</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/relooted_review_screenshot-1281-nomali_scouting_nyamakop.jpg?itok=fSC7CXxn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1408" height="792">

  </picture><p>Undoubtedly, <em>Relooted</em> is a game unlike anything we've seen in today's gaming landscape, which is certainly needed. As a heist sidescrolling platformer, it checks most of the boxes, providing a decent platforming experience, albeit with some technical issues hindering it.</p><p>Where it shines the brightest is that it serves as a historical reminder of the continual aftermath of colonialism by illustrating the broad scale of the violent plundering of cultural artifacts by its oppressors. While some have made their way back home, there are still thousands of artifacts that are being withheld by museums, private collections, and other institutions.</p><p>In the end, the game recontextualizes the "treasure hunter" trope we see all too often by giving us, the players, the power to do the right thing in reclaiming artifacts and returning them home. This may be some kind of dream come true, but maybe, just maybe, getting to make history by writing a new chapter illustrating that taking back what belongs to them is the right and honorable thing to do.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Relooted</strong> was reviewed on PC via Steam, with a copy provided by the publisher over the course of 20 hours&nbsp;- all screenshots were taken during the review.</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/relooted-review-restoring-pride-ownership-to-african-art-history]]></content:encoded>
