            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-sales-250k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Viral indie sensation&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>has passed a major sales milestone within its first week on Steam, developer Cyberwave and publisher rokaplay Bou-tique have announced.</p>

<p>Since being released on February 7th (which is less than a week ago at time of writing),&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>has hit 250,000 sales, which isn't bad at all for a title "developed by a solo artist from Cyberwave...as a fun side project".</p>

<p>The game's success probably won't come as a surprise if you spend any time watching content creators on Twitch and other platforms. The studios claim&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>racked up "over 5 million views on TikTok, 2.2 million views on YouTube shorts, and...14.5 million views on Instagram Reels".</p>

<p>Positive reviews highlight the game's simplicity, lack of pretension, and strong Steam Deck support, so if those are things you're looking for in your next snack-size indie game, then this could well be one for you to try out.</p>

<p>Be aware, though, that some negative reviews point to&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em>'s short length, and for some, the very simplicity praised by its adherents is enough to put them off. Caveat emptor, as they say.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em>, it's probably one of the most self-descriptive games available on Steam right now. It is, in a very real sense, a game about digging a hole.</p>




<p>Bearing similarities to games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/minecraft" rel="nofollow"><em>Minecraft</em></a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld&nbsp;</em>series,&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>is simplicity itself: you must dig a hole. That's pretty much all there is to it!</p>

<p>As you dig, you can gather resources from the underground, using the money you get from selling them to upgrade your gear. There's also a story to discover, one that revolves around a "mysterious secret" you'll uncover as you dig deeper (literally).</p>

<p><em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3244220/A_Game_About_Digging_A_Hole/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. It's also set to come to consoles at some point in the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/avowed-review-pillars-of-excellence<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If there's one thing Obsidian Entertainment is known for, it's for fantastic writing. That was true with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/star-wars-knights-of-old-republic-ii-sith-lords-kotor-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II</em></a> in 2004, true&nbsp;with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fallout-new-vegas" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a> in 2010, and still true all the way in 2022 with the release of the incredible game that is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/pentiment-review" rel="nofollow">Pentiment</a>. In 2025, we have <em>Avowed</em>.</p>

<p>Fear not, for Obsidian's quality of writing is still there with <em>Avowed</em>. It is, in essence, Obsidian doing what they do best: Adventures with gripping narratives and fleshed-out characters. <em>Avowed</em> is an epic fantasy in the truest sense, giving us one of the best RPGs this decade.</p>

<p>In this ambitious role-playing experience, players can expect to travel across the continent of The Living Lands. A terrible fate awaits those who live in The Living Lands, with an enigmatic malady called the "Dreamscourge" affecting not only its people, but the continent's wildlife and terrain as well. All of these elements are a recipe for a grand adventure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed_pillar.jpg?itok=vCtni87o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed_pillar.jpg?itok=9QrvgzCt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Look! It's one of the pillars... of eternity!</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Avowed</em>:<em> </em>A Wonderful Continuation to <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>'s Lore</h2>

<p>First things first,&nbsp;I'd like to acknowledge the setting of <em>Avowed</em>. Yes, it takes place in The Living Lands, but the world itself -- called Eora -- is one that has a great deal of existing lore. <em>Avowed</em> is set within the <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/pillars-of-eternity" rel="nofollow"><em>Pillars of Eternity</em></a> universe -- the first game of which was released in 2015 and following that several years later in 2018,&nbsp;<em>Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</em>.</p>

<p>As a result, <em>Avowed</em> feels like a living world. The lore has had time to develop over the course of a decade, and in doing so, we see a masterful display of worldbuilding in <em>Avowed</em>. Indeed, Carrie Patel, one of the lead writers for <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, is the director for <em>Avowed</em>, and her love for the lore is evident here. It's treated with reverence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, you, the player, are the star of the show here. You'll have a great deal of agency over how the plot develops throughout the 40+ hour campaign, with a myriad of side quests with equally excellent writing to string players along.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed_roleplaying.jpg?itok=7khg1Lki 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed_roleplaying.jpg?itok=NBTpC_Uc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There are plenty of choices in dialogue, and sometimes even skill checks or ones that leverage your chosen background.</figcaption></figure><p>The most impressive aspect of <em>Avowed</em>'s writing is the ability to roleplay<em>. </em>At the start, you create a character, but two things are persistent across all playthroughs: we're Godlike from the Aedyr Empire. Godlike are a race of individuals touched by the gods before birth -- they are extremely rare in the world of Eora and that is a very important aspect of your character.</p>

<p>Godlike's appearances are jarring for some. As a side-effect of being a Godlike, your features reflect the characteristics of your deity. In this case, we have fungal growths covering our face and head. This leads to our character being extremely recognizable among the crowd in <em>Avowed</em>, but also sometimes reviled.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-character-screenshot.jpg?itok=KqbCDSHy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-character-screenshot.jpg?itok=QT3nNXqH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>These pillars of adra sure are mysterious.</figcaption></figure><p>In any case, you can also choose a backstory for your character, all of which tie you back to Aedyr. I chose to become a noble, and throughout my campaign, I was a selfish, somewhat emotionless individual with undying loyalty for the Empire and hellbent on completing my duty of discovering the cause of the Dreamscourge.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The most impressive aspect of <em>Avowed</em>'s writing is the ability to roleplay<em>.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The Empire wants to colonize the Forgotten Lands, because that's what empires do, of course. As the representative of the Emperor himself, you're often thrust into awkward situations. The locale does <em>not</em> like you, and you can either play as a sympathetic ambassador, a ruthless inquisitor, or anything in between.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-choices.jpg?itok=uwOdOxhX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-choices.jpg?itok=Nke4Fj0h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Is that so, Mr. Pastor? I'll keep that in mind.</figcaption></figure><h2>Choices, Choices<em>...</em></h2>

<p>Indeed, it was refreshing to see the amount of dialogue choices in <em>Avowed</em>. At any point during a conversation, I'd consciously decide how I would respond, and nine times out of ten, there would be a dialogue choice that fit exactly what I wanted.</p>

<p>This goes back to my original point: You have a great deal of agency over how the story develops. There are a myriad of choices, some inconsequential and some substantial. Many choices will come back to rear its ugly head many hours after the fact.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-companions.jpg?itok=30r-N29R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-companions.jpg?itok=yd-jq8TM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Companions aren't just static characters -- they are very present in both dialogue and gameplay.</figcaption></figure><p>The impact of your choices varies in severity, but rest assured: <em>Avowed</em> is a game where choices <em>do</em> matter. Even your companions (of which there are four) remember your decisions, and they aren't afraid to either shower you with praise or chastise you for your actions.</p>

<p>As for companions themselves, we have a likable bunch of characters. From the reclusive scout Marius to the chaotic wizard Yatzli, these characters will go through arcs of their own, which make them feel more realistic and relatable. They are beneficial in combat too, of course, but writing is what truly makes these individuals shine.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-mushroom-boi.jpg?itok=CHGUloyo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-mushroom-boi.jpg?itok=wBHVtlsp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'd switch my loadout often until I found my ideal gear to settle with, but loot is fun to find!</figcaption></figure><h2>Loot? Yes Please!</h2>

<p>Really, I could gush about the narrative for days. Still, <em>Avowed</em> also has excellent combat, loot, and exploration. The way in which Obsidian Entertainment designed these systems makes for an engaging game in both narrative <em>and </em>gameplay.</p>

<p><em>Avowed</em>'s gameplay is designed to be versatile. There are numerous weapon types like spears, swords, bows, axes, and uh... guns? Yes, there are guns, and they are awesome. Of course, we can't forget magic and the abilities that come with it, which is just as fleshed out as the other weapon types in <em>Avowed</em>.</p>

<p>A very smart design decision on Obsidian's part was to incorporate two separate weapon load-outs players can switch on the fly. In the middle of combat, I might want to engage the enemy by sneaking up with a bow. Upon getting the enemy's attention, it takes but a moment to switch to melee and fight back.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-gear_0.jpg?itok=V8EGiz_B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-gear_0.jpg?itok=xfQSzHhL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Guns and magic can indeed work well!</figcaption></figure><p>Some weapons take up two slots, but for most weapons, they are one-handed. This means you can duel-wield, and you are most certainly encouraged to take advantage of this. Holding a pistol in the right hand and a tome of magic in the other allows for a gun-and-sorcery type of build, giving you plenty of combat options.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Yes, there are guns, and they are awesome.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the most part, I stuck with two swords as one loadout and two pistols on the other. Leveling up allows players to spend points into simplified skill trees, so I ended up creating a duelist type of character.</p>

<p>Engaging the enemy with two shots from my pistol either outright kills them or deals a great amount of damage. Enemies, which are often found in packs, would then charge at me. I'd jump into the fray with my two swords and slash away furiously. Increasing my attack speed and damage with one-handed weapons made me a fearsome opponent.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-swords.jpg?itok=YhNLtyt2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-swords.jpg?itok=OMKGx1B0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Two swords sounds like a solid set of gear to me!</figcaption></figure><p>While I'm on the topic of enemies, that's one part of <em>Avowed</em> that needs work. Enemy variety leaves me wanting; I could probably count on my hand the number of enemy types. Most of the foes you fight comprise xaurips (lizard men), spiders, keth (an encompassing term for humanoids), skeletons, and bears.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Enemies do vary in power, and that is where I find the level system to be quite engaging and innovative. Enemies are not assigned a level, so they don't scale to you as you level up. Instead, enemy power is reflected in item quality.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-loot.jpg?itok=5e907SDx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-loot.jpg?itok=zODDwhwl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There are also trinkets like rings, as well as boots and gloves to help with your loadout. Take this, uh, Wahaki Tua for example...</figcaption></figure><h2>A Quality Way to Handle Scaling and Gear in <em>Avowed</em></h2>

<p>The whole enemy level/item quality system can be a bit confusing to grasp at first, but once you start picking up loot of better quality and encountering enemies that are a bit stronger, everything clicks. I love the way loot is handled in <em>Avowed</em>, making gear seem just as important as your character. Perhaps my favorite aspect, however, is unique items.</p>

<p>Unique items are, well, unique. Swords, axes, maces, guns, whatever it is, there's a chance you'll find a unique item in your travels. These are hand-made by Obsidian Entertainment and one-of-a-kind pieces of gear that all have different "unique abilities" attached to them. They also have individualized flavor text to make them stand out.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I love the way loot is handled in <em>Avowed</em>, making gear seem just as important as your character.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These are especially exciting pieces of loot to find, and as a result, exploration feels exceedingly rewarding in <em>Avowed</em>. While you can purchase some of these items from vendors or receive them as quest rewards, it's through exploration that you'll get the bulk of these uniques. You'll find them tucked away in various ruins or stowed in treasure chests.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-pistols.jpg?itok=lgg36vLq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-pistols.jpg?itok=07gqUx1z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Why have one pistol when you can use two?</figcaption></figure><p>With the incentive to explore, it makes <em>Avowed</em> feel like an exciting adventure -- you never know what you'll stumble across. Of course, it's important to pick up other, regular ol' items as well because of <em>Avowed</em>'s loot system. It's in this crafting where the game also shines. Basically any item, no matter how low in quality, matters.</p>

<p>Items are broken down into resources (you can also find some of these resources in the world) and are used to improve your weapons and armor. Even if you find junk, it has value because of the resources gained from scrapping them. From there, you can use it to improve the quality of your weapons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You could improve that one unique you found in the starting zone and have it carry you through the whole game, so long as you keep improving on it. I know this because I used a pistol from the first area throughout my entire 40+ hours of play, and it was consistently a great weapon. Items you enjoy using don't become obsolete, which gives more agency to the player to use what they want.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avowed-xaurips.jpg?itok=oco4UEpG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avowed-xaurips.jpg?itok=kLGpu0rW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Expect to kill many xaurips.</figcaption></figure><h2>Fighting for The Living Lands</h2>

<p>All this talk about gear and I've barely touched on combat. Sure, enemies are repetitive, but being able to use the gear you like against your foes makes for a satisfying combat experience. Fighting is fast-paced and simply fun, especially when switching between loadouts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Buffing my attack speed with a perk I unlocked allowed me to eviscerate foes. Enhancing my ability to dodge made me untouchable. I became a force to be reckoned with, and if you're looking for that sort of power fantasy of being the biggest badass in all the realm, well, you can do that here.&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Items don't become obsolete, which gives more agency to the player to use what they want.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For the most part, everything I tried felt viable, and you can respec really quickly if you find that you don't like your current perks. Since you're likely to find so many different weapons, <em>Avowed</em> encourages players to experiment and try different builds, which means combat will always feel fresh if you like trying new things.</p>

<p><em>Avowed</em> is a gorgeous game, with some of the best environments I've seen in gaming. The art design for The Living Lands is absolutely on point, effectively portraying this fungal-infested, untamed wilderness. There are certain key moments during the game where the overall aesthetic took me by surprise -- moments I won't spoil but you'll know when you see it.</p>

<p>Though I won't be surprised if others experience some instability in their game's performance on PC, such is the price of such a beautiful game. FPS tended to fluctuate on my rig - <em>especially</em> in cities and towns -- which made me a bit too reliant on DLSS and frame generation. Performance will definitely depend on your rig, as always, but it's worth keeping in mind.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>That, and there are a lot of bugs in <em>Avowed</em>. Obsidian Entertainment's been very responsive to any bugs and issues reviewers encountered, and there will be a patch to fix many issues, but still... for a game as ambitious and big as <em>Avowed</em>, expect bugs. Just as an example, I wasn't able to complete a few side quests, but that was the worst of it.</p>

<p><em>Avowed</em> impressed me in many ways. The way it handled gear and enemy scaling, its rewarding exploration, and unparalleled storytelling and world-building are most certainly the highlights, but its combat is also immensely fun. What more can you ask from an RPG? Obsidian Entertainment is one of the best in the business, and that's proven with <em>Avowed</em>.</p>
