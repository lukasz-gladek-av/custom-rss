            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remaster-officially-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bethesda has finally officially revealed the long-mooted&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster, and more information about the game is coming tomorrow, although it's not clear whether the much-discussed shadowdrop will be happening.</p>

<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1914341006188712023" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Bethesda X account, the studio simply says "tomorrow, 11am EST", pointing to links to the official Bethesda and Twitch channels. The post is accompanied by an image that includes an "IV" logo and the outline of an armored face.</p>

<p>It's pretty clear the post refers to the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster;&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>is, after all, the fourth&nbsp;<em>Elder Scrolls&nbsp;</em>game, and the "IV" in the image looks the same as the one included as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-oblivion-remake-images-seemingly-leaked" rel="nofollow">a set of leaked images</a> depicting scenes and artwork from the remaster last week.</p>

<p>Rumors of the remaster have been swirling for some time, and the existence of the project was essentially <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remake-reportedly-confirmed" rel="nofollow">confirmed back in January</a>, when reports pointed to a mistakenly-uploaded website that included information about the game, as well as screenshots.</p>

<p>Following that, new images appeared on the website of developer Virtuos, which is widely believed to be the studio handling the project. Those images included pretty conclusive proof that the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster is happening, including the aforementioned artwork that matches Bethesda's latest announcement.</p>

<p>Further leaks appeared earlier today when the file size of the remaster was supposedly <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/04/21/oblivion-remastered-file-size-on-steam-datamined/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">datamined</a>, with reports suggesting the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster will come in at a hefty 120GB. Better clear up some space on that SSD.</p>

<p>Either way, it looks like Bethesda's&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster is definitely happening. Stay tuned for more.</p>
