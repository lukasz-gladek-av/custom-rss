            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-changes-grinding-gear<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>developer Grinding Gear Games has announced a sweeping set of changes which appear to be aimed at tackling the game's plummeting Steam review rating.</p>

<p>Right now, the&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>-esque action RPG is sitting at a rather uncomfortable <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mostly Negative rating</a> on Steam, with players bemoaning what appears to be a significant drop in the game's pacing. Players refer to the pace as "extremely slow and boring" and "a total slog", among other complaints.</p>

<p>The changes were apparently introduced as part of&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-dawn-of-hunts-new-huntress-and-ascendancy-classes-look-sick" rel="nofollow">recent Dawn of the Hunt update</a>, which introduced new classes and gameplay elements, as well as some of the gameplay changes that appear to have proven controversial among players.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/path-of-exile-2-mostly-negative-changes-jamanra.jpg?itok=h_GfefW_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/path-of-exile-2-mostly-negative-changes-jamanra.jpg?itok=ORYIH8dQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Path of Exile 2</em>'s latest update hasn't exactly proven popular.</figcaption></figure><p>Yesterday, Grinding Gear Games <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2694490/view/497192510562500616" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> a sweeping set of changes ostensibly aimed at addressing much of players' criticism. The changes, which the developer says "do not represent a full list" of players' grievances, include buffs to various classes, as well as a number of other gameplay tweaks.</p>

<p>Several more changes were also announced <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2694490/view/640181878351986722" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">earlier today</a>, including many changes to monsters to make them less overwhelming, as well as alterations to bosses, player minions, and more.</p>

<p>Whether or not these changes do anything to alleviate players' ire regarding Dawn of the Hunt remains to be seen, but&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile</em>'s next update drops tomorrow at about 3pm Pacific (that's about 6pm Eastern and around 11pm GMT).</p>




<p>Grinding Gear will doubtless hope that these changes mollify players, especially given that it's put all of its eggs in the&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>basket, having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-updates-paused-poe-2" rel="nofollow">paused updates to the original game</a> back in January to focus on the sequel.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>is available to buy right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/path-of-exile-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/path-of-exile-2/9ND8N4RW5GHX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. Full patch notes for the above changes will be available when the update lands tomorrow.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-season-6-adventure-mode-pve</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dark-and-darker-season-6-brings-brand-new-pve-mode-and-more.1160349/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-season-6-adventure-mode-pve<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ironmace has released the Season 6 update for PvPvE dungeon-crawler&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker</em>, and if you're the kind of player who prefers the PvE part of that equation to the PvP part, then you're in luck.</p>

<p>Previous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-season-4" rel="nofollow">seasons</a> of&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>have focused on adding features like reworked maps, new bosses, and other tweaks, but this one's bringing a whole new mode in the form of Adventure, which Ironmace describes as "an exciting co-op dungeon-crawling experience".</p>

<p>Essentially, it sounds like Adventure mode removes the PvP component from&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker</em>, leaving you and your friends free only to worry about the monsters trying to kill you rather than your fellow adventurers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dark-and-darker-season-6-adventure-mode.jpg?itok=RZd36rMn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dark-and-darker-season-6-adventure-mode.jpg?itok=FMp5xByE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dark and Darker</em>'s Adventure Mode is perfect for conflict-averse players.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it's not just Adventure Mode. Ironmace has also added a number of new monsters and sub-bosses to&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker</em>, as well as new monster patterns for certain Nightmare enemies.</p>

<p>You'll also find new items in the shop, as well as a whole host of other quality-of-life improvements and gameplay tweaks designed to make the&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>experience a little smoother for everyone.</p>

<p>The full list of changes to&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>as part of Season 6 is pretty extensive, but if you'd like to read everything that's new, you can check out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2016590/view/587264582368624660" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the full patch notes here</a>.</p>




<p>In case you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker</em>, it's a multiplayer dungeon-crawler with a focus on both player-versus-player and player-versus-environment combat (although the Adventure Mode removes one part of that gameplay makeup entirely).</p>

<p>The game has been subject to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-developers-respond-to-dmca-takedown-from-nexon-after-removal-from-steam" rel="nofollow">protracted legal battle</a> between developer Ironmace and Korean publisher Nexon, with the latter alleging that Ironmace essentially stole company secrets for an upcoming game Nexon was working on.</p>

<p>A Korean court recently ruled that Ironmace <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-lawsuit-trade-secret-infringement" rel="nofollow">infringed on Nexon's secrets</a> when making&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker</em>, although that ruling also means Ironmace hasn't been found guilty of copyright infringement.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Dark and Darker&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2016590/Dark_and_Darker/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-edition-carts-games-upgrades</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-edition-carts-will-contain-games-and-upgrades-nintendo-says.1160328/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-edition-carts-games-upgrades<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has clarified that Switch 2 Edition cartridges will contain both the original Switch version of the game in question and the Switch 2 upgrade, meaning you won't have to download anything extra to play them.</p>

<p>In a statement provided to Australian Nintendo news platform <a href="https://www.vooks.net/nintendo-confirms-no-download-codes-needed-for-physical-switch-2-edition-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Vooks</a>, Nintendo said that physical Switch 2 Edition games will "include the original Nintendo Switch game and its upgrade pack all on the same game card".</p>

<p>Nintendo goes on to say that "no download code" will be included in Switch 2 Edition packs and that the cartridges therein will be "exclusively Nintendo Switch 2 game cards". Good news if you were hoping to resell your Switch 2 Edition games at some point, or if your internet connection is spotty.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-edition-carts-download-super-mario-party-jamboree.jpg?itok=__wNfzGO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-edition-carts-download-super-mario-party-jamboree.jpg?itok=2EilFBrg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Several games, like&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, will be getting Switch 2 Edition versions with console-specific upgrades.</figcaption></figure><p>Frustratingly, however, Nintendo then says that "some publishers may release Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games as download codes in physical packaging" if they choose, and that such releases would contain "no game card".</p>

<p>In essence, then, first-party Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games will always contain both the original game and the upgrade code, but that might not be the case for third-party publishers. Caveat emptor, I suppose.</p>

<p>Just in case you've somehow missed the hubbub, the Nintendo Switch 2 was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">announced in full last week</a>, with a worldwide release date of June 5th and a US price (for now, at least) of $449.99, jumping to $499.99 with a copy of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">launch title&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></a>.</p>

<p>Though the console is still on track to launch on June 5th, pre-orders have been delayed in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-tariffs" rel="nofollow">the US</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-canada" rel="nofollow">Canada</a> due to President Donald Trump's sweeping economic tariffs. Nintendo also appears to be weighing up whether releasing the Switch 2 in China <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-delayed-in-china-thanks-to-government-regulations-and-demand" rel="nofollow">will be worth its while</a>.</p>




<p>Games confirmed to be getting Switch 2 Editions so far include&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>,&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. Not all of them are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">launching alongside the console</a>, though.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-producer-teruyuki-toriyama-sirius-studio</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bloodborne-producer-teruyuki-toriyama-announces-sirius-studio.1160277/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-producer-teruyuki-toriyama-sirius-studio<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Producer Teruyuki Toriyama, who worked on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>and 2020's&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>remake has opened up a brand new studio, and it sounds like he's going big right out of the gate.</p>

<p>According to an Automaton Media <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/bloodborne-demons-souls-producer-establishes-new-game-company-sirius-studio-following-departure-from-sie-japan-studio/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Toriyama's new venture will be called Sirius Studio, and it's been opened under the auspices of Osaka's Gz Group, which is usually focused on creating games in the PC and mobile spaces, as well as VR games.</p>

<p>Despite that, Automaton says Toriyama's Sirius Studio will be focusing on making "high-end console" games, as well as VR and XR (virtual and extended reality) titles. Sirius' efforts will span a range of both new and existing IPs as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/demons-souls-producer-teruyuki-toriyama-new-studio.jpg?itok=b1M0IGME 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/demons-souls-producer-teruyuki-toriyama-new-studio.jpg?itok=5-MKMlV7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Teruyuki Toriyama's name is on games like 2020's&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls</em>&nbsp;remake.</figcaption></figure><p>Per Automaton, Toriyama says that it's going to take a while before Sirius Studio is ready to announce its first project, but that the company is looking to start with a major project rather than easing itself in through a smaller effort.</p>

<p>Toriyama's time as a producer with Sony's Japan Studio includes credits on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Demon's Souls&nbsp;</em>(both in its original form and its remade version),&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne</em>, and the PS Vita game&nbsp;<em>Freedom Wars</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/freedom-wars-remastered-announced" rel="nofollow">got a remaster earlier this year</a>.</p>

<p>He left Japan Studio, as well as Sony as a whole, in 2020, and his former outfit was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-japan-studio-reportedly-shutting-down-this-year" rel="nofollow">shut down in 2021</a>&nbsp;(which may be a significant contributing factor in the lack of a&nbsp;<em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>remaster or remake).</p>

<p>After working with Sony, Toriyama moved to&nbsp;<em>Soul Covenant&nbsp;</em>developer Thirdverse, but according to a Famitsu <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202504/38560" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">interview</a> (with Automaton's translation), he left when it became clear Thirdverse was shifting away from higher-end console and PC game development.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teruyuki-toriyama-soul-covenant-sirius-studio.jpg?itok=kEcz4bBA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teruyuki-toriyama-soul-covenant-sirius-studio.jpg?itok=Y5pYAc2r 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Soul Covenant&nbsp;</em>studio Thirdverse wouldn't prove to be Teruyuki Toriyama's permanent home.</figcaption></figure><p>What Toriyama will do with Sirius Studio remains to be seen, but the studio enters the industry at a time when <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spectre-divide-mountaintop-studios-shutting-down" rel="nofollow">many</a> are finding it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ballistic-moon-closed-report-until-dawn" rel="nofollow">difficult</a> to secure or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown" rel="nofollow">maintain funding</a>.</p>

<p>Additionally, layoffs are still sweeping across the industry, affecting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">bigger</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-layoffs-restructuring" rel="nofollow">smaller</a> studios alike. Toriyama certainly faces a challenge in founding a new studio and creating a high-budget game in this climate, so let's hope he and Sirius can surmount that challenge.</p>
