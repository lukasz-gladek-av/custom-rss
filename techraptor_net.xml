            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/campfire-cabal-expeditions-still-alive<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>franchise steward Campfire Cabal has confirmed that it isn't dead, and that a new game in the series is in the works, despite the past couple of years of "radio silence".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://campfirecabal.com/still-alive/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> rather appropriately titled "Still Alive" on the official Campfire Cabal website, the studio says that it "never stopped" working on the newest entry in the series, but that it did go through some hardships as a result of the turmoil currently facing the gaming industry.</p>

<p>Campfire Cabal says that although it was never shut down, it did have to "say goodbye to many of [its] colleagues", leaving a "compact team" behind to work on the new&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>game, which began production back in 2022.</p>

<p>According to Campfire Cabal, the next&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>game will be set in a "new period of our history" and "a new part of the world for the series", and it will represent "another step up in quality" from&nbsp;<em>Expeditions: Rome</em>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Campfire Cabal, the studio was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/campfire-cabal-is-new-development-studio-from-expeditions-rome-developers" rel="nofollow">founded all the way back in 2022</a> to steward the&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>series of historical RPGs, following the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/expeditions-rome-developer-logic-artists-closing-down-to-make-nft-games" rel="nofollow">disbandment of original developer Logic Artists</a> to pursue NFT game development alongside new parent Dynasty Studios.</p>

<p>As it stands, there are three games in the&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>series: 2013's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/expeditions-conquistador" rel="nofollow"><em>Expeditions: Conquistador</em></a>, which kicked off the franchise, and its two followups&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/expeditions-viking" rel="nofollow">Expeditions: Viking</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/expeditions-rome" rel="nofollow"><i>Expeditions: Rome</i></a>.</p>




<p>If you're wondering where 2024's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/expeditions-mudrunner-game-announced" rel="nofollow">Expeditions: A MudRunner Game</a>&nbsp;</em>fits into things, well, it doesn't. It's a completely unrelated title, so don't worry about fitting that one into your schedule if you're looking to complete the series.</p>

<p>In any case, it looks like the&nbsp;<em>Expeditions&nbsp;</em>series will continue its explorations, although we don't know where or when. Stay tuned for more.</p>
