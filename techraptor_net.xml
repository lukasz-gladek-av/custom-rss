            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-raiders-splatoon-3-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first ever&nbsp;<em>Splatoon&nbsp;</em>spinoff,&nbsp;<em>Splatoon Raiders</em>, has been revealed for Switch 2, and what's more,&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>will also be getting an update for the new machine in the next couple of days.</p>

<p>Over on the Nintendo Today app, Nintendo revealed&nbsp;<em>Splatoon Raiders&nbsp;</em>with a brand new trailer that shows Deep Cut members Shiver, Big Man, and Frye en route to a new location known as the Spirhalite Islands.</p>

<p>Of course, their helicopter crash-lands on the islands, presumably along with the player character, so it sounds like it'll be up to you to get yourself and Deep Cut off the Spirhalite Islands, presumably while fending off threats.</p>

Nintendo says it will be an "adventure" in which you'll play as a mechanic, and that Deep Cut will be joining you for your adventure, but we didn't get to learn exactly what kind of game&nbsp;<em>Raiders&nbsp;</em>will be.</p>

<p>We do, however, know that&nbsp;<em>Splatoon Raiders&nbsp;</em>will be a Switch 2 exclusive, so you won't be able to play it on the original Switch, unfortunately. Nintendo says more info will be shared later down the line.</p>

<h2><em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>is also getting a Switch 2 update</h2>

<p>Happily,&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>is also getting some love for the Switch 2. The game will be getting an update later this week that smooths out some perfomance issues and brings improved visuals as well.</p>

<p>Despite major updates for&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-updates-ending" rel="nofollow">coming to an end in September last year</a>,&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>Version 10.0.0 will also be getting new weapons as part of the Splatlands Collection. They'll be based on previous weapons, but will sport "fresh new looks".</p>




<p>If you're worried about not being able to splat with your Switch friends, fret not: you'll still be able to enjoy crossplay between Switch 2 and original Switch.</p>

<p>We don't have a release window for&nbsp;<em>Splatoon Raiders&nbsp;</em>yet, but the&nbsp;<em>Splatoon 3&nbsp;</em>Switch 2 update launches on June 12th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Some Kind of Halo PS5 Release Is Apparently On the Cards]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-ps5-rumor</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/some-kind-of-halo-ps5-release-is-apparently-on-the-cards.1214307/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-ps5-rumor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new leak has emerged which suggests that&nbsp;the venerated&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>series, previously exclusive to Xbox consoles and PCs, could be on its way to the PS5 at some point in the near future.</p>

<p>As spotted by leaker <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1932240994939834370" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">eXtas1s</a>, trusted&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>source <a href="https://x.com/gruntdotapi/status/1932217175885938726" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">grunt.api</a> spotted a reference to a&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>game for PS5 within the series' API, an information repository that provides info for developers.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the API listing doesn't show which game in the&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>series is coming to PS5, although they do say that since the listing has a <a href="https://x.com/gruntdotapi/status/1932218210528739642" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"new ID"</a>, it probably won't be the <i>Master Chief Collection</i>, <a href="https://x.com/gruntdotapi/status/1932405680742580324" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">nor will it be</a>&nbsp;<em>Halo Infinite</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/halo-infinite-halo-ps5-leak-rumor.jpg?itok=OkbVTTeo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/halo-infinite-halo-ps5-leak-rumor.jpg?itok=X3mRoUcB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>game for PS5 apparently won't be&nbsp;<em>Halo Infinite&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Master Chief Collection</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If grunt.api is correct, then this could mean that a brand new <i>Halo&nbsp;</i>game will be arriving on PS5, presumably at the same time as it comes to other platforms, although there's no mention of a Nintendo Switch or Switch 2 release for the game.</p>

<p>Alternatively, of course, it's possible the API listing could be for a rebrand or a remastered version of an existing game, so we could well be getting an&nbsp;<em>Infinite&nbsp;</em>port for PS5.</p>

<p>If I was launching a long-running series like <i>Halo&nbsp;</i>for the first time on a new ecosystem, then I'd probably release a remake or remaster of the very first game in the series to introduce new fans, but hey; I'm not Microsoft, nor am I Sony.</p>

<p>I guess we'll just have to wait and see what the&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>PS5 listing turns out to be, assuming that it's legit in the first place, of course. None of this has been confirmed by any of the major parties involved, so take that with a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>The franchise was also subject to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/huge-halo-leak-digsite" rel="nofollow">massive leak back in December</a>, with around 90GB of data being leaked from 343 Industries. That data included in-development game builds, documents, and tools relating to the&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>series, plus lots of other tidbits.</p>
