            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox Game Studios has reportedly canceled&nbsp;<em>Contraband</em>, the next game from <i>Just Cause&nbsp;</i>developer Avalanche Studios, following four years of silence from both studios regarding the game.</p>

<p>That's according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, who reported the cancellation on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lvt7g4p7fs2k" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>. Given that we haven't heard anything about&nbsp;<em>Contraband&nbsp;</em>for four years, its cancellation is perhaps unsurprising, but it's a shame nonetheless.</p>

<p>Of course, we didn't know that much about&nbsp;<em>Contraband&nbsp;</em>to begin with. When it was <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2021/06/13/announcing-contraband/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced in 2021</a>, Avalanche said the game, which was to be a "co-op smuggler's paradise", would be the studio's "most ambitious and spectacular game to date", but beyond that, not much was revealed about the project.</p>

<p><em>Contraband</em>'s cancellation comes after a massive wave of Microsoft layoffs that saw around 9,000 company employees lose their jobs, as well as high-profile game and studio shutdowns under the Xbox brand.</p>

<p>These included the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">cancellation of Rare's&nbsp;<em>Everwild</em></a>, as well as the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">shuttering</a> of The Initiative's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/report-indicates-perfect-dark-studio-initiative-hemorrhaging-staff" rel="nofollow">reportedly troubled</a>&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot, along with the closure of that studio. As far as we know, Rare remains operational, although it doesn't have any active projects that have been announced publicly.</p>

<p>According to what a Microsoft spokesperson told Schreier, despite these high-profile shutdowns, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-announces-new-game-od-in-partnership-with-xbox-and-filmmaker-jordan-peele" rel="nofollow">Hideo Kojima's&nbsp;<em>OD</em></a>, which will serve as a collaboration with Xbox Game Studios, is still in development (for the time being, at least).</p>
