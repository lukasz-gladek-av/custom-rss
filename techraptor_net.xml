            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The earliest known cartridge copy of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.</em>, which may also be the iconic platformer's master copy, is going up for auction next month, with the proceeds entirely going to benefit a major gaming preservation charity.</p>

<p>Auction house <a href="https://www.christies.com/en/lot/lot-6566468" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Christie's</a> will play host to the auction, in which a 1985-era&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;</em>cartridge will be up for grabs. The price will be pretty steep, though; Christie's estimates the cart will cost you somewhere in the region of £100,000 to £150,000 (about $130,000 to $200,000).</p>

<p>The auction is being held to benefit the Video Game History Foundation (VGHF), a charity organization that's involved with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/simcity-nes-prototype-digitized-and-dissected-by-video-game-history-foundation" rel="nofollow">preserving</a> some of the most <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/video-game-history-foundation-computer-entertainer" rel="nofollow">important</a> (and esoteric!) artifacts from throughout gaming history.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/super-mario-bros-cartridge-auction-shot.jpg?itok=5q1pvI1f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/super-mario-bros-cartridge-auction-shot.jpg?itok=SeT4JrqA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It may not look like much, but this could be the master copy of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The Video Game History Foundation says that this cartridge was created at Nintendo before mass production on&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;</em>began, and that while the charity can't be certain, "it is possible that this was the original master copy of the game", i.e. the one on which all retail copies were based.</p>

<p>Of course, given the cartridge's age, it's possible that the game wouldn't work if you were to slot it into a Famicom console, but I don't suppose anyone picking this up will be buying it so they can play&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.</em>; it's more of a collector's item.</p>

<p>This is far from the first&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.</em>-related retro gaming auction. During 2021 alone, two&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-bros-sells-for-over-600k-at-auction" rel="nofollow">cartridges</a> sold for eye-watering <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-bros-copy-sells-for-record-breaking-price" rel="nofollow">amounts</a>, and other games in the franchise have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-bros-3-most-expensive-game-ever-sold" rel="nofollow">commanded incredible prices</a> at auction as well.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros.&nbsp;</em>itself, well, the game needs no introduction; as the Christie's lot essay for the above cartridge says, it's "the most influential video game of all time", or at least a strong contender for that title.</p>

Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-python-commandos-warbond-brings-a-minigun-and-more-next-week.1364515/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrowhead and Sony have announced Python Commandos, a brand new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, and it's bringing an honest-to-god minigun and more next week.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/25/helldivers-2-python-commandos-premium-warbond-airdrops-dec-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Python Commandos launches on December 2nd (that's next Tuesday at time of writing), and as has been the case with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-control-group-warbond" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-force-of-law-warbond" rel="nofollow">Warbonds</a>, you can expect new weapons, new armor, and new emotes to bring with you into the field.</p>

<p>First off, the M-1000 Maxigun is a belt-fed, ultra-high-capacity minigun that should let you tear through bugs, bots, and whatever else gets in your way with aplomb. Just try not to turn it on your teammates.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-python-commandos-warbond-minigun.jpg?itok=Z7NgMf0G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-python-commandos-warbond-minigun.jpg?itok=Uhnai22j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new Warbond has a minigun for you to lay waste to your enemies with.</figcaption></figure><p>A new Guard Dog drone equipped with a flamethrower is also being added, but once again, you'll need to make sure it doesn't accidentally set your teammates on fire (or perhaps they'll need to make sure they're not in its way).</p>

<p>Hacking your way through&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s jungles just got a lot easier, too, as the aptly-named CQC-9 Defoliation Tool (which, yes, is basically a machete) can cut through everything, be it brush, bugs, or, uh, buddies.</p>

<p>You can also get to grips with a brand new primary weapon in Python Commandos, namely the AR/GL-21 One-Two, a "combination assault rifle and grenade launcher" that lets you switch between these two modes depending on what you need.</p>

<p>All of this is, of course, in addition to brand new armor sets with a passive that makes your Helldiver harder to ragdoll, as well as two new capes, a new emote, and a brand new camo pattern for your gear.</p>




<p>You'll be able to get your hands on <i>Helldivers 2</i>'s Python Commandos Warbond when it arrives across all platforms on December 2nd. The game is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/helldivers-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can read our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/helldivers-2-review-fighting-for-managed-democracy" rel="nofollow">review right here</a>.</p>
