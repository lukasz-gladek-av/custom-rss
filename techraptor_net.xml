            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-ps5-xbox-summer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher VOID Interactive has announced that tactical FPS&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>is coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S later this year, and it'll be accompanied by two brand new levels for everyone to try out.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>will land on current-gen consoles in the summer, although it doesn't have a release date yet. The game will also be made available on the Epic Games Store and the Microsoft Store at the same time.</p>

<p>Along with the console release,&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>will also be getting a free DLC pack by the name of&nbsp;<em>Stories from Los Sueños</em>, which will add two new stages you can tackle either in single-player or alongside friends in online co-op.</p>

VOID says PC players will get the two extra stages "day-and-date" with the console release. That is, of course, in addition to levels and features that have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/huge-ready-or-not-november-update-adds-new-maps-and-more" rel="nofollow">already been added</a> to the game via <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ready-or-not-update-includes-new-maps-and-physics" rel="nofollow">updates</a>.</p>

<p>Pre-ordering&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>on either PS5 or Xbox Series X|S will also get you three special weapons, but if you're a PC player, you'll get these items for free.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not</em>, VOID Interactive describes it as an "intense, tactical first-person shooter" in which you and your co-op partners (or just you, if you're in single-player mode) are SWAT officers sent in to defuse potentially volatile situations.</p>

<p>You may, for example, be sent in to negotiate the release of hostages, or you might be taking care of bomb disposal or dealing with suspects who've barricaded themselves inside a location. Suffice it to say this isn't one for the faint of heart.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Ready or Not&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1144200/Ready_or_Not/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. It's launching for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S sometime this summer.</p>
