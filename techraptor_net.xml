            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new update has been released for remastered platformer <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>, and it's bringing enhancements for the Switch 2, the ability to play as Dixie Kong, and more.</p><p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2013781050707558700" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">social media post</a> by Nintendo, the update allows you to play as Dixie Kong instead of Diddy Kong in either single-player mode or co-op play, so if you prefer swinging through the air with your helicopter hair, this is the update for you.</p><p>Not only that, but there's a brand new mode available by the name of Turbo Attack, and, as the name suggests, it'll allow you to run through speedier versions of <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>'s existing levels for an extra layer of challenge.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>You can now play as Dixie Kong in <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>, should you wish to.</figcaption>

<p>If you happen to be playing the game on Switch 2, then this update will also introduce "enhanced resolution, higher-definition graphics, and quicker load times", and what's more, you're getting all of that for free, which is more than you can say for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-free-update" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d3f0290f-c6b5-44ad-83e5-8a42cbb6e299" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">some</a> Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-sales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="91a21696-562a-4257-aaec-a7380b13a7fc" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">upgrades</a>.</p><p>In case you're unfamiliar with <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>, it is, as the name implies, an "HD" remaster of Wii platformer <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns</em>, although it'd perhaps be more accurate to call it a remaster of the 3DS version.</p><p>The game packs in all of the levels from the original release, plus the extra content the 3DS version offered, including the extra difficulty modifiers and items offered by New Mode to make things just a little less tricky.</p><p>You can check out a trailer that shows off the new content in this <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD </em>update right here.</p>
<p><em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD </em>is available right now on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Donkey-Kong-Country-Returns-HD-2590475.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a> (there's no native Switch 2 version, so you'll still be buying the original then applying the update).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">I was a huge fan of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4e42e5a-dfe6-4ff1-8f4c-038c992edcea" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></a> when it first hit the PlayStation 4. It was crazy to see, after so many years of rumors, tech demos, fan-made projects, and mods, we were getting a retelling of Cloud's story (mostly) in high definition. While it's been six years since that initial release, I've been very impressed these past two weeks getting to re-experience that story on the Switch 2.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">For this piece we're going to go into the Switch 2 edition of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>, if you want to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-remake-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f0a283a2-3dd7-4884-b100-70af1b924153" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">check out what we thought of the game when we gave it a 9.5/10</a>, be sure to check out our review.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">To start from the beginning of the experience, I was shocked when I had to delete a large number of games from my Switch 2 as the console announced to me that I would need 90.4 GB of space to load the game. That's almost half of the base Switch 2's storage and over quadruple what is required for <em>Mario Kart World</em> or <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> Gameplay - Nintendo Switch</h2><p dir="ltr">Once I was into the game itself, I was very impressed with the level of detail that the Switch 2 was able to pump out. From the opening sweeping shots of Midgar, to the close-up facial detail on Aerith and Cloud playing in Handheld mode, I was honestly a bit shocked at just how great this game looked, knowing I was playing it on mobile hardware.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/undefined" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Moving from the Mako Reactor and its neon lights to the soft city streets and the full light of the Sector 7 slums, the game looked and played incredibly well. While there were obvious downgrades in the graphical quality to accommodate the Switch 2, it's a fantastic way to experience the game for the first time, or return, letting you play while enjoying a second screen experience.</p><p dir="ltr">The one aspect of the game that was noticeably downgraded was that of characters' hair and certain particle effects. For a character so well known for his hairstyle, it's a shame to have a Cloud whose face is so clear and expressive have a grainy mop on top of it.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the same for all hair in the game, which becomes very apparent when completing the side quest where it's your goal to round up cats.</p><picture>

              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-vii-remake-switch-2-feathers.jpg?itok=rSF_u2nW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">In cutscenes, the lower quality hair is very apparent, but when in gameplay, it's easier to ignore.</p><p dir="ltr">Within gameplay, I found little to no stutters or hitching of the frame rate. Whirling around the screen as Cloud, particle effects from various spells and Barrett's gunfire, and enemy explosions didn't tank the framerate in any noticeable way.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the cutscenes. There would be a variety of times when hitching would appear not when looking at something impressive, but instead a few moments beforehand. I suspect this is to do with something loading off screen, and then the camera turning towards it.</p><p dir="ltr">The first example of this I ran into was when deboarding the train in the initial cutscene, as it swings from Jesse and AVALANCHE to Barrett and Cloud jumping off the train, there's noticeable stutter.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-vii-remake-switch-2-exploration.jpg?itok=x8C8hyZu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">While it isn't present in every cutscene, I do have to at least appreciate that if the game is going to hitch while in cutscenes, at least it does it before the cool thing instead of directly during it?</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> Cheats For Efficient Replays</h2><p dir="ltr">One fantastic upgrade to <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> with this new release, and one that will be coming to all versions of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> is a number of toggleable settings that the game calls "Streamlined Progression."</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-vii-remake-switch-2-lighting.jpg?itok=nL3IiVVZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-vii-remake-switch-2-lighting.jpg?itok=NXTtJ8-d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">These options essentially act like cheats, similar to the ones that you can find on the remakes of the classic <em>Final Fantasy</em> titles, and let you constantly have Max HP or MP, always deal Max Damage, increase your experience gain by double, and even have Max Gil and Recovery Items.</p><p dir="ltr">While I wouldn't recommend these options for a first playthrough, knowing that Remake and Rebirth are two 40+ hour games that are getting a finale to their trilogy sometime in the future, it's nice that you can replay the story with a bit more efficiency. As this was my third time playing through the game, I happily enabled the 2x EXP &amp; 3x AP Gain and had a very leisurely jaunt through the game.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Should You Pick Up <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> <em>Intergrade </em>For Switch 2?</h2><p dir="ltr">Six years after the release of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake,</em> I think it's definitely worth picking up <em>FFVII Remake Intergrade</em> for the Switch 2… if you haven't played it/had access to it before, or you want to be able to play it specifically in handheld.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-vii-remake-switch-2-explosion.jpg?itok=yvhUUo9x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">The gameplay and story are still of fine quality, and while the graphics do take a notable hit, it's to be expected with the console you're playing it on. Even with the downgrade, it's one of the prettiest looking games available on the Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Knowing that it's already been out, and can likely be picked up at a massive discount on PS4/PS5 and PC, it is likely not going to be worth the full price of entry, especially with the downgrades to the visuals.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong> was previewed with a code provided by the publisher over the course of 8 hours - All images were taken by the previewer.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>
