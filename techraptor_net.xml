            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Cairn</em>, the latest game from <em>Furi </em>and <em>Haven </em>developer The Game Bakers, has shot past a huge sales milestone within just a few days of its initial release, the studio has revealed.</p><p>As announced in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1588550/view/493841450487776602" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a Steam post</a>, <em>Cairn </em>has hit 200,000 sales already, and The Game Bakers says it "couldn't be happier" to have achieved this result in just a handful of days.</p><p>In case you need a reminder, <em>Cairn </em>was released on February 29th (that's this past Thursday at time of writing). The game was originally due to arrive last year, but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cairn-delayed-q1-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="30dd9fa3-66ad-41d8-be13-bae5c22cb83b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">was delayed</a> back in September in order to give The Game Bakers extra time to polish it up. It now seems that time was well-spent.</p><figure role="group">

<p><em>Cairn </em>is the latest project from The Game Bakers, whose previous efforts include boss rush bullet hell action game <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/furi" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="68c7153c-22c9-4290-a476-9bdf9c4a6ecc" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Furi</em></a><em> </em>and co-op RPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/haven" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ebce69ab-0435-4600-82ab-b692ec1e416a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Haven</em></a>, and it continues the studio's track record of not repeating itself with subsequent releases.</p><p>The studio describes <em>Cairn </em>as a "survival-climber" in which your goal is to plan a route of ascension up the "unforgiving" Mount Kami, checking your resources and plans to make sure you've got enough to make each climb.</p><p>Along the way, you'll discover the stories of both the mountain itself and protagonist Aava, meeting "unexpected companions" as you go, as well as hearing from the people left at the mountain's base.</p><p>You can check out a trailer that shows off the kind of thing you can expect from <em>Cairn </em>right here.</p>
<p><em>Cairn </em>isn't the only climbing sim to have been released in recent years; it joins the likes of Don't Nod's meditative <em>Jusant </em>(which, sadly, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-financials-first-half-2024" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b15eacd1-370f-48d4-a7cd-49ccd57bc1ab" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">underperformed for the studio</a>) and "friendslop" multiplayer game <em>Peak </em>(which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/peak-2m-sales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="39196bca-464e-4fee-9f7e-6c78d8d44d76" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">very much did not</a>).</p><p>If you'd like to join in the fun, you can check out <em>Cairn </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588550/Cairn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014085" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>.
