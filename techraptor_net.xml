            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/vampire-hunters-review-night-will-always-win<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With every earthquake comes aftershocks. At this point, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/vampire-survivors" rel="nofollow"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a> hasn’t just made its mark on the world, it’s still a primary point of the gaming culture space, not just unfettered by new releases, but also a point of influence for many a copycat to “improve” the formula. Everything always needs X to improve on, it needs X to provide Y, in the palatable form of Z! <em>Vampire Hunters</em>, if anything else, is one of many such cases.</p>

<p>This is the latest game from Brazilian developers Gamecraft Studios, a team that also dabbles in assisting development with other devs and games, like 2023’s <em>BIT.TRIP ReRunner</em>. <em>Vampire Hunters</em> has toured the circuit as an Early Access title for some time before kicking into gear with a 1.0 release at the end of October. The result is ideas on top of ideas.</p>

<p>It’s a first-person shooter, relying on some boomer shooter-esque inclinations, while never fully going all the way. You’re in an arena, almost perfectly equipped for some old-school, 90s <em>Unreal Tournament</em> action, and set spawn points will release an endless barrage of increasingly difficult monsters to defeat within an allotted time. As time goes on, you’ll also completely fill your screen with up to 12 weapons, each of which is an extension of your God-given power to completely decimate the battlefield.</p>



<p>The structure is more encroaching than your usual <em>Survivors</em>-type shenanigans. The maps are very tight, both in their designs, and their chokepoints, with it teaching you these basic facets almost immediately. Not only that, but every map has different objectives in order to “complete” the map, whether it’s closing off spawn points, collecting items, or destroying bigger bosses and their minions.</p>

<p>“Tight” is probably the only way one can describe it. Tunnel vision is an almost inevitable effect of the game, especially as the screen fills with monsters, bullets, effects, triggers, health bars, warning icons, damage indicators, and so much more. As a result, the game relays more of its influence from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/serious-sam-4" rel="nofollow"><em>Serious Sam</em></a> – where walking back and never letting go of the fire button is a primary function of its core gameplay loop – and as such, calling it a “boomer shooter” seems almost counter-intuitive to what a boomer shooter actually is.</p>

<p>That isn’t to say <em>Vampire Hunters</em> or indeed, even <em>Serious Sam</em>, fail to exhibit certain qualities of the memetic genre, but in <em>Vampire Hunters</em>’ case, the pacing is there, yet the speed isn’t. You can make the body count rise to the thousands in low-polygon gibbing glory, but it’s never to the same tune of progression. Progression is defined by time here, not by how you execute it, so many cases of victory will be made by playing the game like <em>Snake</em>.</p>



<p>This isn’t new for <em>Vampire Survivors</em> and their ilk however, the constant backpedaling and kiting, so <em>Vampire Hunters</em> rides or dies on how it executes it all at a peak. The result is a mixed bag, where on the one hand, it excels in the chaos, the invigorating colorful steam of bullets, bombs, and bodies being presented wonderfully. On the other hand, the feedback of certain items, and the conveying of information in regards to progression, is obfuscated for no other reason than to seemingly imply complexity that isn’t there.</p>

<p>It’s all so singular in its craft, less about creating a zone for which death is certainly instantaneous for any monster that dares to breach the 12ft gap between you and the enemy. Instead, you’re constantly proactive, removing the privilege of going AFK in favor of making you feel more in control with the damage you deal. As a game following the <em>Survivors</em>-like formula, it easily does the most to make every action an opportunistic one, as you watch damage counters rise, and the timer tick by.</p>

<p>This is best accentuated by its “Classic Mode”, a more innately basic iteration of its FPS gameplay that removes the crafted arenas in favor of a long, seemingly endless hallway. It’s a firing range on an escalator, one which provides endless runner-esque mechanics in the form of a damaging mist that will envelop you if you lag too far behind. It relies a lot more on pacing, yet introduces a lot more confusing elements like manual weapon combination and an engineering stat, neither of which are explained adequately at any point.</p>



<p>Regardless of whether you choose Classic mode or not, <em>Vampire Hunters</em> is a numbers game in its most generic sense, one which it manages to elevate with the mechanic of reloading. Whether it’s manually or automatic, even with 12 weapons strapped to your person, the amount of legitimate tactical intervention that spawns from when and where to reload is honestly staggering. Weapons waver between heavy beasts and quick-fire repellent, although you’d be hard-pressed to figure out which is which based on sight.</p>

<p>While it may be a result of how much more zoomed in the action is, <em>Vampire Hunters</em>’ aesthetic and visual design still leaves a lot to be desired. Its crusty nature, and overall inability to truly commit to a direction that isn’t just “low-poly” leaves a lot of the action undefined in the wake of more focused destruction. You can tell what weapons have brought you to your destination in games like <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, <em>Army of Ruin</em>, and <em>Slime 3K</em>, but here, a revolver looks the same as a rifle, which looks the same as a machine gun, which looks the same as a minigun.</p>

<p>It’s strange because while I can certainly class <em>Vampire Hunters</em> as an addictive experience, one that is proactive, consistently engaging, and rewarding – more so than most other <em>Vampire Survivors</em> clones on the market – I struggle to call it an objectively good experience. So much of it is left to interpretation, or an upcoming Steam guide where stuff is answered for you, despite the fact that so much of it is smoke and mirrors. It’s not that there isn’t depth, but the word is merely an excuse for why the game doesn't explain itself.</p>

<h2><em>Vampire Hunters </em>Review | Final Verdict</h2>

<p><em>Vampire Hunters</em> is a video game, a minimal hardline for what an FPS, a game adjacent to <em>Vampire Survivors</em> and its kin, and a game inheriting certain boomer shooter aesthetics should provide. Its quality isn’t necessarily defined by what it does right or wrong, but by how it exemplifies the averages one must attain before being a part of the discussion for what constitutes being a good game. So many moving parts to contribute to a core that is, ultimately, formless.</p>

<p>As it stands, this is an experience. An experience without cause, but not without merit.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/superstore-3000-review-shoppers-delight<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the far future, we’ll commute on trains full of aliens, fly around in zippy little spaceships, and hang out with robot buddies, but <i>where</i> will we get a haircut or catch a movie? That’s the question at the heart of <a href="https://store.asmodee.com/products/superstore-3000" rel="nofollow"><i>Superstore 3000</i></a>, a new tile-placing game from Space Cowboys. Distributor Asmodee sent along a copy for me to check out, so read on for my thoughts in TechRaptor’s <i>Superstore 3000</i> review!</p>

<h2>The Mall of Tomorrow… Today!</h2>

<p>I grew up in a suburb of Philadelphia, in a little town called King of Prussia. Funny name for a town, but that’s not what made it famous - that honor goes to the King of Prussia Mall, a sprawling complex full of all the staples, from Cinnabon to Hot Topic. Living walking distance from one of the largest malls in America, my friends and I truly lived the mall rat life. So when I got the chance to check out <i>Superstore 3000</i>, I knew they’d have me on theme alone.</p>

<p>But what is the theme of <i>Superstore 3000</i>? In the game, designed by Rodrigo Rego, you and up to three other opponents are vying to create the most attractive mall in the galaxy. To do so, you’ll draft mall store tiles from an automatic store creator, place them onto your play space to create as a growing, sprawling, and potentially spiraling out of control mall.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/superstore-3000-mall-building-taller.jpg?itok=VVYzrva8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/superstore-3000-mall-building-taller.jpg?itok=pC_-T6v9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Build your mall up into the sky to score points, unlock more resources, and give your shoppers what they're looking for.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Gameplay Basics of <i>Superstore 3000</i></h2>

<p>The reason you’ll be drafting and laying down tiles is simple - you want to attract customers to your mall, and you want them to find what they’re looking for a remain satisfied customers. Each turn, you’ll draft one of four different colored tiles which all correspond to a type of store - except for the red tiles, which are entrances that’ll be placed with two little customer tokens.</p>

<p>Those customers know what they want, and they’re coming to get it. If placed within three spaces of the kind of store they’re looking for, you’ll move them to that store and they’ll remain there as a satisfied customer. At the end of the game, these happy shoppers will be the key to your scoring success.</p>

<p>One of the aspects of the game I really like is that you have to juggle money and your stores. The store on the bottom of the automatic dispenser is free, but any store tile above it costs money. You start with a little bit of money, but can also get money instead of taking a store tile. This creates a sense of urgency as you try to figure out exactly what to do that will be most beneficial. This is all complicated by the fact that as soon as you draw a tile, you have to immediately place it on your board.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/superstore-3000-man-wants-clothing.jpg?itok=UAVmsI6E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/superstore-3000-man-wants-clothing.jpg?itok=yL4yhcM9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The shopper on this tile is looking for a clothing store, as soon as the clothing store tile is placed, he'll move there be counted as satisfied.</figcaption></figure><p>At first, you’ll only be able to build in a vertical line going up, above your main entrance - but you’ll soon be scoring special agendas to let you put parking garages on your first floor (which can be built upon) and even big, audaciously shaped special features like a big, round aquarium, a long bowling alley, a zig-zagging space floating attraction, and more!</p>

<p>This is where the real fun of the game comes in, you’ll find it sometimes difficult to lay the tiles out in a way that makes cohesive sense in your mall… but that’s not the point! We’re in the far-flung future, and in this future the zanier the better!</p>

<p>My only wish from the gameplay was that there was a bit more to these special tiles. I would love tiles that let you break the rules a bit more, and right now these are simply meant to take up space, branch your mall out in fun directions, and look very cool on the board. But it would have been nice to see some effects that changed how we drafted tiles, placed our shoppers, etc.</p>

<h2>Light but Intuitive Competition</h2>

<p>The game isn’t the most cutthroat new game on the market, but it does involve a little bit of friendly competition. You’ll be competing against the other players at the table for the stores as they show up on the automatic store dispenser. But you’ll <i>also</i> be competing for the specialty tiles I mentioned above.</p>

<p>Not only do these tiles open up new avenues for you to build out from your base mall, but they’re also worth valuably points at the end of the game. Because they’re achieved by a specific objective, you may find yourself naturally racing against your opponents to fulfill the pre-requisites to get that special tile.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/superstore-3000-tornado-simulator-attraction.jpg?itok=CZ_7C-_L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/superstore-3000-tornado-simulator-attraction.jpg?itok=zsODIoyr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Attractions add spice to the game in <em>Superstore 3000</em>, like this tornado simulator attraction!</figcaption></figure><p>That’s why I like this game’s approach to competition - it’s what I would call light, but still intuitive. You don’t need to puzzle out how you can best your opponent, it’ll be quite clear what they’re going for. And it’s up to you to decide if it’s more valuable to try to stop them by drafting tiles they need, or whether you’d be better served worrying about your own board.</p>

<p>This intrinsic push and pull is a hallmark of a lot of lighter-weight games that encourage competition, and you’ll find it put to perfect use here.</p>

<h2>Retro Futurism - Take Me Back!</h2>

<p>Before I get into my final thoughts of the game, I <i>have</i> to talk about the artwork by Ryan Goldsberry, which absolutely exudes a sort of bubbly, over-the-top (and yet somehow still refined) design. This game could have featured snarling aliens and realistic robots, or it could have looked like a kid’s cartoon. But instead, much to my delight, the artist took a retro-futuristic approach.</p>

<p>Think <i>Jetsons </i>here when we talk about the artwork, and as you can see from the photos it’s all a vision of the far future as seen through the lens of a 1960s illustrative style. I love it, I think it perfectly fits a game about a mall in the future, and it helps the game stand out amongst its peers. It’s absolutely an art style I wish would truly have a resurgence, and maybe we will see more hand-drawn, personality-first artwork as the world slides into AI image generation drudgery.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/superstore-3000-shopping-figurines.jpg?itok=xhAiEia5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/superstore-3000-shopping-figurines.jpg?itok=UQ3YZjLo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Everything from the construction to the illustration of the shopper meeples just screams retro-futurism in Superstore 3000</figcaption></figure><h2>Superstore 3000 - Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>As you can maybe tell by now, I’m very high on <i>Superstore 3000</i>. I think the gameplay is fun, light, and evocative. I think the artwork is bold, bright, and full of personality. And even though it’s not the deepest or most complex game in the world, there’s a lot of fun to be had here against your fellow players. I do wish it could support more players, which might be my only real mark against it.</p>

<p>I recently wrote a pretty rough review for another tile laying game, where I felt like everything the game had you doing was a bit predictable. And that the central puzzle of laying the tiles wasn’t very engaging. With <i>Superstore 3000</i>, I couldn’t feel more differently. Here, you’re hoping and praying for that one specific tile, you have a lot more agency over what you’re picking, and you need to balance spending money with getting tiles that could be useful.</p>

<p>If you’re looking for a fun but light gaming experience with friends, and you like tile-placing games where you have to think on your feet to score points and achieve goals, <i>Superstore 3000</i> is definitely for you.</p>

The global tabletop publisher known for producing many beloved titles like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fantasy-flight-games-announces-marvel-champions-next-evolution" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Marvel Champions</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/river-of-gold-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>River of Gold</em></a> has announced a unique spin-off of Sand Castle Games' competitive board game series, one designed for two players.</p>

<h2>The <em>Res Arcana Duo</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the store page listing, <em>Res Arcana Duo</em> is a standalone installment in the <em>Res Arcana</em> series. Like the main series, players take on the roles of powerful magicians caught in an elaborate game of mystic supremacy. A visual trademark of the series is the detailed artwork provided by Julien Delval.</p>
