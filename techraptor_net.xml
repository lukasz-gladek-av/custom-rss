            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Lethal League&nbsp;</em>developer Team Reptile has revealed its latest game&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk</em>, and if you're a fan of the studio's last effort, it looks like you're going to love this one as well.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk&nbsp;</em>is an "extreme trick and graffiti game" in which you must pull off stylish trick combos in order to build your boost and speed through the city.</p>

<p>Per the game's brand new Steam page,&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk&nbsp;</em>takes place in a "bright future" in which society is built around an online space known as the Hyper and graffiti crews compete with one another regarding "how to interpret this new world".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hyperfunk-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-dev-trick.jpg?itok=6b0rbfO3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hyperfunk-bomb-rush-cyberfunk-dev-trick.jpg?itok=-MwxBttC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hyperfunk&nbsp;</em>is the next game from&nbsp;<em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk&nbsp;</em>studio Team Reptile.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're a fan of&nbsp;<em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk</em>, you'll likely recognize the visual style Team Reptile is going for with&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk</em>; this is very much a closely-related spiritual successor rather than a departure from existing styles.</p>

<p>Still, the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk&nbsp;</em>shows a game that looks like it's built much more around speed, trick combos, and traversal than its predecessor was, so if you thought&nbsp;<em>Bomb Rush Cyberfunk&nbsp;</em>could do with being more kinetic and speedy, you're in luck.</p>

<p>There's also an online component to&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk</em>; you can hang out with random players online in the Hyper, but if you prefer to keep things local to you and your friends, you can chill with them in the streets of the game's city as well.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer for&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk</em>, which shows off the game's very&nbsp;<em>Jet Set Radio</em>-inspired visual aesthetic and gameplay style, right here. No "Fly Like a Butterfly", though, sadly.</p>




<p>We don't have a release date or even a broad release window for&nbsp;<em>Hyperfunk&nbsp;</em>yet, but you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183480/HYPERFUNK/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a> if you like. Hopefully, this one doesn't get <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bomb-rush-cyberfunk-delayed-to-2023-for-polish" rel="nofollow">delayed like its predecessor did</a>, eh?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Iconic Persona 3 Reload Song Gets Franchise's First Ever Music Video]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-3-reload-music-video</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/iconic-persona-3-reload-song-gets-franchises-first-ever-music-video.1302501/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atlus has released the first ever official music video for a song from the&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>series, and the video sets one of&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>'s most iconic battle themes to a very thematically relevant visual element.</p>

<p>The video is for the battle theme "It's Going Down Now", which plays whenever the party gets the drop on an enemy in the Tartarus dungeon in&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>. If you're anything like me, that means you'll be hearing the song hundreds of times over the course of your time with the game.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release, "It's Going Down Now" is the most-streamed song from the&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>soundtrack on Spotify, having built up over 100 million plays. It makes sense, then, that this was the song chosen for the series' first music video.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-3-reload-music-video-battle.jpg?itok=HVo2nqiA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-3-reload-music-video-battle.jpg?itok=2wf_ubTj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Persona</em>'s first ever music video is for a battle theme from&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The track was created specifically for&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>; it doesn't have an equivalent in the original&nbsp;<em>Persona 3</em>, which simply uses the equally iconic "Mass Destruction" as its general battle theme. That song still plays in&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, but only for battles in which you don't have the advantage.</p>

<p>The music video for "It's Going Down Now" sees rapper Lotus Juice and singer Azumi Takahashi performing in front of&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>'s famous Tartarus steps, which lead up to the dungeon proper. The video is also interspersed with other visuals you'll recognize if you're a&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>fan.</p>

<p>You can check out the music video for "It's Going Down Now" in its entirety right here. If you've played the game, it's a great opportunity to hear the song for that extra-special thousand-and-first time.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-3-reload-persona-5-tactica-leaked-by-atlus-itself" rel="nofollow">a remake</a> of Atlus' cult hit JRPG&nbsp;<em>Persona 3</em>&nbsp;that boasts all-new visuals, gameplay improvements, and a rearranged soundtrack.</p>

<p>The game proved a success for publisher Sega and developer Atlus, having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-3-reload-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">racked up two million sales</a> around the world at last count. A remake of its successor,&nbsp;<em>Persona 4</em>, was announced during this year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">Xbox summer showcase</a>.</p>

<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2161700/Persona_3_Reload/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/persona-3-reload/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/persona-3-reload/9NKK6Z0K3RH2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. A version for the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/persona-3-reload-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is also planned for release next month.</p>
