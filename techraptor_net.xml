            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/croc-legend-of-gobbos-remaster-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Argonaut Games has announced the release date for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>remaster, and it won't be long before you get to revisit this cult platforming classic.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/ArgonautGames_/status/1902030119524331617" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X,&nbsp;<em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>arrives on PC and consoles on April 2nd. You can wishlist the game on PC now via GOG, but wishlisting isn't yet available for the console platforms; it's coming "soon", according to Argonaut.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what's happened to the Steam version of the game, Argonaut revealed back in October that the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/croc-legend-of-gobbos-remaster-no-steam-release" rel="nofollow">wouldn't be coming to Valve's platform</a>, citing a desire for the game to remain DRM-free on PC (although not on consoles, of course).</p>

<p>The game was part of a rush of mascot platformers released around that period, going up against the likes of Nintendo's&nbsp;<em>Super Mario 64</em>, Naughty Dog's&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot</em>, and Insomniac Games'&nbsp;<em>Spyro the Dragon</em>, all of which were released within a couple of years of one another.</p>

<p><em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>wasn't quite as well-received as the aforementioned titles during its time, but it garnered a cult following, and in August last year, its original publisher Argonaut <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/croc-legend-of-gobbos-remaster" rel="nofollow">announced its revival</a>, as well as the game's remaster.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>remaster will, of course, sport fresh HD graphics, as well as new controls and an updated camera to make the game's occasionally janky platforming a little less frustrating. You can also expect a&nbsp;<em>Croc</em>&nbsp;treasure trove with lots of materials pertaining to the game's creation.</p>




<p><em>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/croc_legend_of_the_gobbos" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via GOG</a>, as well as on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, on April 2nd.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-n64-delayed-july<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Retro gaming specialist company Analogue has announced that its upcoming Analogue 3D, a "reimagining" of the original Nintendo 64 console, has once again been delayed.</p>

<p>Back in October, the console was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-n64-delayed-2025" rel="nofollow">delayed until the first quarter of this year</a>, but in an updated <a href="https://www.analogue.co/support/resource/3d-preorder-faq" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> for the machine, Analogue says it's now intended to ship "by July 2025" following a delay. The company doesn't give the reason for said delay.</p>

<p>Analogue does, however, say it's "working hard to get your 3D order in hands ASAP" and that it "appreciate[s] your patience". The company also reiterates that its refund policy is still "no questions asked", so while you don't need to do anything if you're happy with your pre-order, you can cancel it and get your money back if you wish.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/analogue-3d-delayed-july-2025-top-down.jpg?itok=iqnLh1d3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/analogue-3d-delayed-july-2025-top-down.jpg?itok=zJAucjb- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The upcoming Analogue 3D retro console has been delayed once again.</figcaption></figure><p>In closing, Analogue says that it will email customers a week in advance of the eventual shipping date (which has not yet been announced) to ensure that it has the correct address.</p>

<p>If you're not aware of the Analogue 3D, it's a retro console that's intended to serve as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/analogue-3d-announced-and-its-4k-nintendo-64" rel="nofollow">sort of supercharged N64</a>; it can play any cartridge officially released for Nintendo's console, but it's got a bunch of upscaling tricks up its sleeve.</p>

<p>The Analogue 3D will be fully region-free, and it'll support Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, as well as sporting its own operating system. The console is engineered in FGPA, too, so Analogue says it won't have any of the kind of glitches you might expect from software-level emulation.</p>

<p>Of course, since this is basically a reimagined N64, it'll also feature the same four controller ports included with the original console, and you can even use your original N64 controllers with it, although you may prefer to use the (not included with purchase) 8BitDo 64 controller.</p>

You can head over to the <a href="https://store.analogue.co/products/analogue-3d-black" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">store page</a> if you'd like to be notified when it arrives.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Lego Pokemon Sets Officially Announced for 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-pokemon-announced-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-pokemon-sets-officially-announced-for-2026.1137846/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-pokemon-announced-2026<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lego and The Pokemon Company have announced that a Lego&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>collaboration is coming in 2026, although details about the collaboration are fairly scant right now.</p>

<p>The collaboration was <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/pokemon/about" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> on the official Lego website today, accompanied by a single teaser image that shows both the Lego and&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>logos, as well as what appears to be a Pikachu's tail rendered in Lego form.</p>

<p>As such, we can probably expect to see Pikachu making an appearance in the Lego sets, but considering that the little electric mouse is easily the most popular Pokemon in the world, that shouldn't come as too much of a surprise.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-pokemon-set-pikachu-anime.jpg?itok=7fvNQQJH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-pokemon-set-pikachu-anime.jpg?itok=4Zc4HSKc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We can reasonably expect to see Pikachu appear as part of the recently-revealed Lego&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>collaboration.</figcaption></figure><p>Lego describes the collaboration as "a brand-new collaboration that brings your love for bricks and your love for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>together", asking "Pokemon Trainers" to come together next year to "build and catch some of their favorite Pokemon".</p>

<p>The company goes on to describe its&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>crossover as "a real Lego&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>adventure", so it sounds like it'll be more than just some sets you can build with bricks; we can, perhaps, expect some interactive elements along the lines of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/build-real-life-mario-courses-with-lego-super-mario" rel="nofollow">the Lego&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>sets</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to keep up to date with the Lego <i>Pokemon&nbsp;</i>collaboration, you can do so by signing up to the Lego Insiders <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/insiders" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newsletter program</a>, which will keep you informed about everything to do with the crossover going forward.</p>

<p>Of course, this won't be the first collaboration between Nintendo and Lego; the two have crossed over on the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>Lego sets, as well as sets for&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-ever-lego-mario-kart-sets" rel="nofollow"><em>Mario Kart</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-animal-crossing" rel="nofollow"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a>.</p>

<p>The presentation also revealed a new battling game by the name of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Champions</em>, as well as several updates to existing&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>titles. It's all go for the world's biggest media franchise.</p>
