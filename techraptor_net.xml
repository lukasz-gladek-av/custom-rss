      <div><p>Square Enix has announced a new music tour by the name of Magic, Memories, and Melodies, and as you can imagine, it'll feature new arrangements of classic pieces from throughout Square Enix's history.</p>

<p>As revealed on the official tour website, The Music of Square Enix: Magic, Memories, and Melodies will present music from huge franchises like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts</em>,&nbsp;<em>Octopath Traveler</em>, and more as part of what the publisher calls a "spectacular multimedia experience".</p>

<p>Tickets for the tour will be available around the world; it'll kick off with two dates in Tokyo on April 25th and 26th at the International Forum Hall A before going to locations around the US, Europe, and Asia.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Let It Die Offline Version Confirmed, Data Will Carry Over]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/let-it-die-offline-version</link>
            <guid>1370542</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Supertrick Games and publisher GungHo Online Entertainment have announced that they're bringing an offline mode to free-to-play action game&nbsp;<em>Let It Die</em>, thus, ironically, refusing to do what the game's title suggests.</p>

<p>During a recent stream focused on upcoming sequel&nbsp;<em>Let It Die: Inferno&nbsp;</em>(thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/let-it-die-offline-version-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>), producer Uncle Death confirmed that an offline version of the game is coming since the studio has "gotten feedback from customers for a long time" asking for the feature.</p>

<p>The producer went on to say that Supertrick doesn't yet know when&nbsp;<em>Let It Die</em>'s offline mode will be available, but that data will be carried over from the online version, so you shouldn't lose any progress when the new mode does arrive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/let-it-die-offline-mode-store.jpg?itok=DDbVqkPo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/let-it-die-offline-mode-store.jpg?itok=bZRo6xH0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Let It Die&nbsp;</em>is getting an offline mode soon.</figcaption></figure><p>The stream didn't contain any more information about&nbsp;<em>Let It Die</em>'s offline mode, but presumably, when it does arrive, you'll be able to play it on both PS4 and PC, assuming <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-ending-in-november" rel="nofollow">support for the former</a> hasn't <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-finals-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow">ended by then</a>.</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Let It Die</em>'s offline mode comes amid controversy surrounding upcoming sequel&nbsp;<em>Let It Die: Inferno</em>, which, according to its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2576150/LET_IT_DIE_INFERNO/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam page</a>, uses generative AI for several assets and elements, including voices, music, background textures, and images.</p>

<p>Of course, GungHo and Supertrick aren't the only companies to be putting their eggs in the AI basket; our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/examining-generative-ais-usage-in-steam-next-fest-2025" rel="nofollow">very own Don's recent report</a> shows that AI usage is becoming increasingly common in games on Steam, and companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow">Krafton</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-generative-ai-vp" rel="nofollow">Netflix</a> have declared an affinity for the technology as well.</p>

<p>In any case, as far as we know, the original&nbsp;<em>Let It Die&nbsp;</em>doesn't use generative AI. What it does do, however, is offer a free-to-play action experience in which you can watch the Grim Reaper pull some sick skateboard tricks, and what more could you possibly want?</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Let It Die&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/794600/LET_IT_DIE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0747-CUSA03769_00-APPLETITDIEUS000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS4</a>, and the sequel,&nbsp;<em>Let It Die: Inferno&nbsp;</em>(which isn't free-to-play), launches on December 4th.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Helldivers Movie Scores Fast and Furious Director]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-movie-director</link>
            <guid>1370539</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fast and Furious&nbsp;</em>director Justin Lin has signed on to direct Sony's upcoming&nbsp;<em>Helldivers&nbsp;</em>movie, it's emerged, and the film will also boast the involvement of an experienced writer.</p>

<p>As revealed in the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/helldivers-movie-justin-lin-sony-1236438370/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hollywood Reporter</a>, Lin will both direct and produce the movie, with his production company Perfect Storm Entertainment handling production duties alongside longtime producer Hutch Parker and PlayStation Productions.</p>

<p>Writing duties will be handled by Gary Dauberman, who's best known for his work on movies like&nbsp;<em>Annabelle&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>It</em>. Could this indicate that the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers&nbsp;</em>movie will be heading in a more horror-oriented direction than we might previously have expected? We'll have to wait and see.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-movie-justin-lin-bugs.jpg?itok=Rdh3wDn9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-movie-justin-lin-bugs.jpg?itok=BOg95fr- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The upcoming&nbsp;<em>Helldivers&nbsp;</em>movie now has a director.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the Hollywood Reporter's, erm, report, Lin "leaned into" the fact that he's "not a gamer" in order to make the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers&nbsp;</em>movie, with "insiders" suggesting that Lin is aiming to "find the humanity in the characters and weave timely themes into the story".</p>

<p>I'm not entirely sure I like the inference in that; it sounds to me like finding humanity in characters and finding "timely themes" in stories is somehow antithetical to video games, but perhaps I'm reading too much into things.</p>

<p>In any case, there's a lot we still don't know about the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers&nbsp;</em>movie, including what kind of story it's looking to tell and how it'll reconcile the franchise's satirical approach to individuality and democracy with movies' need to focus on individual characters.</p>

<p>What we do know is that the movie is just one of several visual media projects based on Sony games currently in the works; at the same time as the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers&nbsp;</em>movie was announced, Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-helldivers-horizon-movies-ghost-of-tsushima-anime" rel="nofollow">also revealed a movie based on the&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>franchise</a>, as well as a&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>anime.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/horizon-movie-sony.jpg?itok=66xo-hLR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/horizon-movie-sony.jpg?itok=Bvviocjj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>movie is also on the...er, horizon.</figcaption></figure><p>There's still no release date for the&nbsp;<em>Helldivers&nbsp;</em>movie, nor has the project been revealed in full yet. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things video game movie-related.</p>
