            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bendy-lone-wolf-roguelike-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Joey Drew Studios has announced a new&nbsp;<em>Bendy&nbsp;</em>game in the form of&nbsp;<em>Bendy: Lone Wolf</em>, but it looks like this one will be taking a slightly different tack with regards to genre.</p>

<p>Where previous&nbsp;<em>Bendy&nbsp;</em>games were (by and large) first-person horror affairs,&nbsp;<em>Bendy: Lone Wolf&nbsp;</em>is a roguelike that pits its titular canine Boris against "endlessly generated corridors" and "ever increasing odds".</p>

<p>Exploring the twisting hallways of the <em>Bendy&nbsp;</em>series' fictional Joey Drew Studios (for which the developer is also named), Boris will need his wits about him as "monsters and obstacles emerge from every direction".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bendy-lone-wolf-announced-boris.jpg?itok=U1Bd5DSa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bendy-lone-wolf-announced-boris.jpg?itok=6YeGBlx2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Bendy: Lone Wolf&nbsp;</em>pits Boris against the ever-shifting corridors of Joey Drew Studios.</figcaption></figure><p>As Boris explores, he'll come up against the "cartoon creeps of the Dark Puddles", and it's up to you to use the weapons and resources you've gathered, as well as "the clever use of dangerous traps", to get rid of them.</p>

<p>Additionally, you'll be chased by a truly terrifying foe known only as the Ink Demon, and it sounds like you won't be able to fight him. Instead, you'll have to "run and hide" when you hear the "beating of his ink heart".</p>

<p>It's a shift away from&nbsp;<em>Bendy</em>'s traditional first-person horror puzzling, but it looks like the game still retains the signature atmosphere of the&nbsp;<em>Bendy&nbsp;</em>series. You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Bendy: Lone Wolf&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>Action roguelikes (or roguelites) based on popular franchises are becoming increasingly prevalent. In the last couple of years alone, we've seen the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/rogue-prince-of-persia-is-another-stellar-aa-addition-to-prince-of-persia-franchise" rel="nofollow"><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Callisto Protocol&nbsp;</em>spinoff&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/redacted-callisto-protocol-spinoff-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Redacted</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-in-random-eternal-die-roguelike-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</em></a>&nbsp;carrying that particular torch.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Bendy: Lone Wolf&nbsp;</em>will be released sometime next year for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3232610/Bendy_Lone_Wolf/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch, and it'll also be available on mobile devices. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Bendy</em>-related.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/agatha-christie-death-on-nile-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/agatha-christie-death-on-the-nile-brings-a-classic-detective-mystery-next-year.1062579/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/agatha-christie-death-on-nile-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microids has announced&nbsp;<em>Agatha Christie: Death on the Nile</em>, a brand new adaptation of one of the mystery writer's most celebrated books, and the adventure game is due to hit PC and current-gen consoles next year.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.microids.com/microids-unveils-the-video-game-adaptation-of-the-iconic-novel-agatha-christie-death-on-the-nile/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post</a>, Microids says its&nbsp;<em>Death on the Nile&nbsp;</em>adaptation will explore "all-new plots, advanced gameplay mechanics and a unique setting" in the form of 1970s Egypt, so even if you've read the book, it sounds like you'll still have plenty to discover.</p>

<p>This time around, you won't just be playing as the legendary Hercule Poirot, but also as new detective Jane Royce, who must pursue her own investigation adjacent to Poirot's. The two investigations will then "collide" in Abu Simbel, an important location in the original novel.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/agatha-christie-death-on-the-nile-jane-royce.jpg?itok=Xo8KrHNY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/agatha-christie-death-on-the-nile-jane-royce.jpg?itok=Yc5zzHQJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Agatha Christie: Death on the Nile&nbsp;</em>introduces us to Jane Royce, a new detective character.</figcaption></figure><p>As you'll know if you've read Christie's original book, Jane Royce is an entirely new creation for this game, so it'll be interesting to see where her investigation takes her and how it dovetails with the mystery from the novel.</p>

<p>As well as a new character and new plot threads, Microids' adaptation of&nbsp;<em>Death on the Nile&nbsp;</em>will also offer a raised level of difficulty, "more complex puzzles", and "more freedom in the progression of the investigation", according to Microids head David Chomard.</p>

<p>He also promises a closer dovetailing of Poirot's and Royce's stories when compared to those of Poirot and Joanna Locke in&nbsp;<em>Murder on the Orient Express</em>, which was Microids Studio Lyon's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/murder-on-orient-express-release-date" rel="nofollow">previous stab at a Poirot game</a>.</p>

<p>You'll use the detectives' mindmap - which looks not unlike the mind palace from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sherlock-holmes-awakened-gets-release-date-goes-gold" rel="nofollow">Frogwares'</a>&nbsp;<em>Sherlock Holmes&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/how-frogwares-created-sherlock-holmes-chapter-one-without-crunch" rel="nofollow">games</a> - to piece the cases together, and you'll then confront suspects to expose their lies. It all sounds like classic detective adventure stuff.</p>




<p>We don't have a release date for <i>Agatha Christie: Death on the Nile&nbsp;</i>yet, but when it arrives, you'll be able to play it for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3150480/Agatha_Christie__Death_on_the_Nile/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/festive-stellar-blade-update-brings-new-costumes-and-more-tomorrow.1062546/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/festive-stellar-blade-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Shift Up has announced a holiday-themed&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>update, and it's bringing all kinds of festive goodies for you to enjoy, including new costumes, new decorations for certain areas, and more.</p>

<p>Previous&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>updates have brought things like a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-nier-automata-crossover" rel="nofollow"><em>Nier: Automata&nbsp;</em>crossover</a>&nbsp;and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-new-game-plus-mode" rel="nofollow">New Game Plus mode</a>, but this one's all about celebrating the holiday season, and the new costumes and content reflect that aim.</p>

<p>First up, Xion now sports its own Christmas tree, and The Last Gulp has been "decorated for the holidays". New seasonal music will play in the camp as well, contributing to a festive atmosphere and "melting away battle tension".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stellar-blade-holiday-update-festive-outfit.jpg?itok=jXGU0VJX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stellar-blade-holiday-update-festive-outfit.jpg?itok=I95xgi7y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stellar Blade</em>'s new holiday update brings new costumes and more.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it wouldn't be much of a&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>update without new costumes, and this one brings a festive Santa dress for Eve to wear, described by Shift Up as giving the game's protagonist an "adorable and festive appearance".</p>

<p>A new hairstyle, Santa Girl, has also been added, in addition to accessories like "Snow Crystal Glasses, Wreath Earrings, and Sleigh Ear Cuffs". Suffice it to say Shift Up's going all in with the holiday theming for this one.</p>

<p>It's not just Eve getting in on the festive fun, either. Adam also gets a new costume in the form of "I'm No Santa", which sees him riding atop the shoulders of a fake Santa. It's a cute costume idea, but perhaps not as cute (or horrifying) as your drone's Rudolph cosmetic.</p>

<p>If you want to, you can disable all of this festive fun and just play&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>as it was originally intended, but where's the fun in being a grinch, eh?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Tales Series Remasters to Be Released "Fairly Consistently", Bandai Namco Says]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-series-remasters-regular</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tales-series-remasters-to-be-released-fairly-consistently-bandai-namco-says.1062489/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-series-remasters-regular<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series publisher Bandai Namco has revealed that it plans to release remastered versions of games in the series on a regular basis, and that a special development initiative has been set up to this end.</p>

<p>Speaking as part of a new 30th-anniversary broadcast (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/12/bandai-namco-to-release-remastered-tales-of-titles-fairly-consistently" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>),&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series producer Yusuke Tomizawa says that remastered&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>titles will be released "fairly consistently", and that the studio "intends to continue" remastering&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>games "as much as possible".</p>

<p>He then goes on to say that what he calls the "Remastered Project" now has a dedicated development initiative devoted to it, and that the team is hard at work on that project, although he didn't say which&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game is up for a remaster next.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-combat-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=uhSZKwAP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-combat-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=qITewjIS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More remastered&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>games are on the way, Bandai Namco says.</figcaption></figure><p>Tomizawa's words come around a month before the newest&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game,&nbsp;<em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em>, is set to launch. It's a remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Tales of Graces f</em>, which is itself a port of the 2009 Wii game&nbsp;<em>Tales of Graces</em>, with the Wii version only ever being released in Japan.</p>

<p>Contrary to what you might believe, the&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series does not include the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tales-of-shire" rel="nofollow">Tales of the Shire</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-kenzera-zau-developer-redundancy-notice" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em></a>. It's confusing, I know, but Bandai Namco's&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>games carry a specific action RPG formula that marries real-time combat with fairly typical JRPG dungeon and overworld exploration.</p>

<p>The most recent mainline&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game, and the series' 17th main entry overall, is 2021's&nbsp;<em>Tales of Arise</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-arise-has-sold-3-million-copies-before-releasing-on-game-pass-and-playstation" rel="nofollow">managed to rack up three million sales for itself</a> before being added to Microsoft and Sony's subscription services earlier this year.</p>

<p>Tomizawa has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tales-of-arise-interview-yusuke-tomizawa/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">described</a>&nbsp;<em>Arise&nbsp;</em>as a&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game for first-timers, but he has also acknowledged the importance of making the RPG, which has a slightly more realistic visual sensibility than many of its predecessors, appeal to "everyone".</p>




<p>As for which&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game is next to get the remastering treatment, it's far too early to say.</p>

<p>Tomizawa and Bandai Namco are staying tight-lipped, and since&nbsp;<em>Tales of Graces f Remastered&nbsp;</em>still hasn't come out yet, it's likely that launch will take up a lot of the publisher's attention for the foreseeable future. Stay tuned for more.</p>
