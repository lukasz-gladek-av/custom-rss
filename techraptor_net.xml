            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-special-horror-point-and-click<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie studio Yahaha Games has announced that&nbsp;<em>Midnight Special</em>, a nostalgic horror point-and-click adventure inspired by the likes of&nbsp;<em>Clock Tower&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>, will be coming to Steam Early Access "soon".</p>

<p>In a press release, the studio describes the game as a mixture of "nostalgic '90s 16-bit gameplay" and "cinematic horror", with touchstones like Dario Argento's giallo movies and classic 80s slashers contributing to its tone and aesthetic.</p>

<p><em>Midnight Special&nbsp;</em>casts you as Sarah, a babysitter (because of course she is) who gets caught up in what Yahaha describes as "a night of psychological terror". I don't think it's possible to be a babysitter without going through at least one of those.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/midnight-special-horror-point-and-click-dialogue.jpg?itok=FIbhkWE- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/midnight-special-horror-point-and-click-dialogue.jpg?itok=57pO8UWO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Midnight Special&nbsp;</em>is a nostalgic horror point-and-click adventure, and you can try it out right now.</figcaption></figure><p>You can look forward to spooky delights like "eerie phone calls", which feel like a classic trope for 70s and 80s horror, and "a seemingly alive plastic dinosaur", which absolutely doesn't feel like a trope.</p>

<p>Yahaha says you'll like this one if you're a fan of old-school survival horror, point-and-click adventure games, and "atmospheric mysteries that keep you guessing", and it's hard to imagine anyone who isn't a fan of the last one on that list, at least.</p>

<p>Most intriguingly, the developer promises a touch of "retro sci-fi" in&nbsp;<em>Midnight Special&nbsp;</em>as well, so it sounds like things take a decidedly weird turn. Consider me on board for this one.</p>

<p>The game's Steam page shows off some rather evocative imagery, including what looks like a millipede crawling in and out of the mouth and eye sockets of a corpse. You'll probably know whether this one's for you or not based on that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/midnight-special-horror-point-and-click-room.jpg?itok=F9qXw-5W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/midnight-special-horror-point-and-click-room.jpg?itok=3sXYyJPx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you like spooky vibes and 80s horror,&nbsp;<em>Midnight Special&nbsp;</em>is for you.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, you don't have to judge by screenshots alone; a demo is available for you to check out right now. All you've got to do is download it on Steam and you're set.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Midnight Special&nbsp;</em>yet, but when it lands, it'll come to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2560100/Midnight_Special/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam Early Access</a>. The devs estimate it'll stay there for around 12-18 months before getting a full release.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sega-introduces-new-unified-account-system-with-free-pirate-yakuza-skin.1088745/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sega-account-system-pirate-yakuza-skin<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has introduced a brand new unified account system that promises to give you access to rewards when playing either Sega or Atlus games, as well as "using their online services". The first of those bonuses is available to grab right now if you sign up.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://sega-account.com/auth/content/notice/01JJ1QNG67ZW54BR35EAZRAJ7Y" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">notice</a> on its website, Sega says that signing up for an account will give you "the latest news" about Sega and Atlus games and promotions, and that it'll also grant you access to "exclusive bonuses", as well as "the ability to link accounts" across platforms.</p>

<p>Signing up before March 7th will give you access to a special&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/like-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-announced" rel="nofollow">Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</a>&nbsp;</em>skin, which lets protagonist Goro Majima wear the iconic gray suit sported by longtime series main character Kazuma Kiryu (except in&nbsp;<em>Infinite Wealth</em>, of course).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-majima-sega-account.jpg?itok=txvBflv7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-majima-sega-account.jpg?itok=myRBjEN_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can get yourself a free&nbsp;<em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</em>skin if you sign up for a Sega account.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, you won't be able to use the skin until the game itself comes out, and signing up for an account doesn't get you a copy of&nbsp;<em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>, unfortunately. Still, if you're planning to play it anyway, signing up can't hurt, right?</p>

<p>If you want your free skin, you'll simply need to create a Sega account <a href="https://cp.sega-account.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>, then link it to a corresponding platform in order to redeem the skin on that platform. Obviously, you won't be able to redeem it on Switch, since&nbsp;<em>Pirate Yakuza&nbsp;</em>isn't coming out for that console.</p>

<p>Could the fact that Kiryu's iconic suit is appearing as a skin in the game perhaps portend further development of his story in&nbsp;<em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>'s plot? I sure hope so, because&nbsp;<em>Infinite Wealth</em>'s ending left me desperate to know what happens to him next.</p>




<p>At the moment, there's no suggestion that the Sega account will become mandatory for playing Sega or Atlus' games, although I'm sure if that does happen, Sega and Atlus will know how their fans feel about it pretty quickly.</p>

<p>Sega has also <a href="https://sega-account.com/auth/content/notice/01JJ71YSH5ZR99A3GSYS1CMTTX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">acknowledged</a> that some users are having trouble authenticating their accounts, promising to resolve the issue soon. Hang on in there if that's you.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mortal-kombat-1-sales-have-passed-5m.1088688/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-sales<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>co-creator Ed Boon has revealed the latest sales figures for&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>, the most recent entry in the long-running fighting game franchise, and it turns out the game is doing about as well as a recent indie smash hit.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1881825218538467395" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X, Boon reveals that&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>is currently sitting at five million sales, as well as the fact that it's still ranking in the top 15 most-played games on PlayStation 5 (according to data that looks suspiciously similar to Circana's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-sales-data-july-circana" rel="nofollow">usual roundup</a>).</p>

<p>That figure puts&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>'s sales roughly on par with those of indie smash hit poker roguelike&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-5m" rel="nofollow">revealed to have hit the same milestone yesterday</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mortal-kombat-1-sales-fight.jpg?itok=IBARtKWX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mortal-kombat-1-sales-fight.jpg?itok=YG0Rx-Ir 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>has apparently reached five million sales.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course,&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>belongs to one of the longest-running fighting game franchises in the world, and it was also released several months before&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, so its achievement is perhaps a little more humble in that light.</p>

<p>Back in November 2023, around two months after&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>'s initial release, Warner Bros <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-eyes-more-live-services-as-mortal-kombat-1-sells-nearly-3-million-copies" rel="nofollow">revealed that the game had sold three million copies</a>. That means it's picked up another two million in just over a year.</p>

<p>Since launch,&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>has enjoyed a slew of crossovers that have no doubt boosted its profile. These have included DLC fighters like <i>Invincible</i>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-omni-man-gets-gameplay-reveal-november-release-window" rel="nofollow">Omni-Man</a>,&nbsp;<em>The Boys</em>' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-homelander-first-look" rel="nofollow">Homelander</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Peacemaker</em>'s...uh...<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-peacemaker-gameplay" rel="nofollow">Peacemaker</a>.</p>

<p>The game's latest crossover DLC fighter is Conan the Barbarian, and believe it or not, he's never appeared in a&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>game before, although another iconic Arnie character, the T-800 Terminator, was added to&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 11&nbsp;</em>as post-launch DLC.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>, it is, despite its name, the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>Released in September 2023, the game's story serves as another reboot, realigning some characters and reimagining others to create a new narrative continuity. It's still got plenty of the same blood-spattered fighting gameplay you know and love, though.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971870/Mortal_Kombat_1/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/mortal-kombat-1/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/mortal-kombat-1/9N7271QN4SGB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mortal-kombat-1-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>
