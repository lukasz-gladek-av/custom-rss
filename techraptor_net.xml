            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Digital gaming storefront and preservation platform GOG is being acquired by original co-founder Michał Kiciński, who's also one of the original founders of what is now GOG's former parent company CD Projekt.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.gog.com/blog/gog-is-getting-acquired-by-its-original-co-founder-what-it-means-for-you/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> on the GOG website, the GOG team confirm that the platform is being purchased by Kiciński, but they say that the acquisition is about "doubling down" on the platform's vision of games that "truly belong to [players], forever".</p><p>According to the GOG team, "DRM-free [gaming] is more central to GOG than ever", and the platform's relationship with ex-parent CD Projekt isn't changing either; games by development wing CD Projekt Red will continue to be released on GOG, but the company will no longer own the storefront.</p><figure role="group">

<p>In an accompanying FAQ, the GOG team says Kiciński wants to "preserve and grow the original philosophy behind GOG", namely to "preserve the classics of the past, celebrate standout games of today, and help shape the classics of tomorrow".</p><p>The team says that nothing about your GOG account or library will change, and that games released on the platform will remain free of DRM. Not only that, but your tips and GOG Patron contributions won't be shared with Kiciński or "any other party".</p><p>Contrary to what you might think this means, GOG says it isn't "financially unstable"; quite the contrary, in fact. The team says it's "had a really encouraging year" and that gamers have shown "more enthusiasm" towards its preservation mission than ever before.</p><p>In short, then, it sounds like nothing about the material GOG experience will change for you, but that ownership has shifted from <em>Cyberpunk </em>and <em>The Witcher </em>parent company CD Projekt to a single individual.</p>
