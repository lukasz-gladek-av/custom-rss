            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Eleventh Hour Games, the developer and publisher of hack-and-slash action RPG&nbsp;<em>Last Epoch</em>, has announced that it's been acquired by&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton for an undisclosed sum.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://forum.lastepoch.com/t/a-new-chapter-for-eleventh-hour-games/78482" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Last Epoch&nbsp;</em>forum, Eleventh Hour founder Judd Cobler, also known as moxjet200, says Krafton was the right choice for his studio because the publisher "shares [Eleventh Hour's] passion for the ARPG genre".</p>

<p>Cobler says the partnership between Eleventh Hour and Krafton will give his studio "the opportunity and resources to execute on [its] goal of creating the very best ARPG in the genre", which is a lofty goal indeed given just how much <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-changes-grinding-gear" rel="nofollow">competition</a> there is in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-4-roadmap-2025" rel="nofollow">space</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/last-epoch-eleventh-hour-games-krafton-purchase-beam.jpg?itok=fMd3ZiI2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/last-epoch-eleventh-hour-games-krafton-purchase-beam.jpg?itok=arPPcM7g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Last Epoch&nbsp;</em>developer Eleventh Hour Games has been purchased by Krafton.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Cobler, he spoke to "dozens of strategics and potential partners" before settling on Krafton, having decided that the partnership will guide Eleventh Hour through "some of the largest upcoming challenges [it will] face as a studio".</p>

<p>This is far from the first acquisition Krafton has made in recent years. Back in August last year, the publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion" rel="nofollow">acquired Tango Gameworks and its&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>IP</a>&nbsp;following its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">shutdown at the hands of Microsoft</a> (which, in retrospect, would seemingly prove to be the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">start of a pattern</a> for the tech giant).</p>

<p>Prior to that, Krafton <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-ascent-developer-neon-giant" rel="nofollow">snapped up&nbsp;<em>The Ascent&nbsp;</em>studio Neon Giant</a> in 2022, which itself followed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-owner-krafton-buys-subnautica-dev-unknown-worlds" rel="nofollow">purchase of&nbsp;<em>Subnautica&nbsp;</em>developer Unknown Worlds</a> the year prior.</p>

<p>The latter would prove to be a somewhat poisoned chalice for Krafton; earlier this month, the publisher fired the former heads and founders of Unknown Worlds, prompting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-charlie-cleveland-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">a lawsuit</a>&nbsp;in which said founders alleged their ousting (and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-delayed-2026" rel="nofollow"><em>Subnautica 2</em>'s delay</a>) was part of a plot to avoid paying employees a sizable bonus.</p>

He <a href="https://forum.lastepoch.com/t/a-new-chapter-for-eleventh-hour-games/78482/4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> his studio will remain a subsidiary under Krafton and won't be merged into the publisher; in fact, new staff will be hired soon, apparently.</p>

<p>In any case, if you'd like to check out&nbsp;<em>Last Epoch</em>, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/899770/Last_Epoch/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, where it'll cost you $34.99 or your regional equivalent.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Trails Beyond the Horizon</em>, the latest game in the long-running JRPG series' Calvard arc, has finally received a Western release date, and it won't be too long before you can check this one out.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Trails Beyond the Horizon&nbsp;</em>(or, to give it its full title,&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon</em>) will be arriving across PC, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch consoles on January 15th.</p>

<p>The game will follow on from the previous titles in the Calvard arc, namely&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-heroes-trails-through-daybreak-release-date" rel="nofollow">Trails through Daybreak</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trails-through-daybreak-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">its sequel</a>. You'll play as three protagonists with intertwining stories:&nbsp;<em>Trails of Cold Steel</em>'s Rean Schwarzer,&nbsp;<em>Daybreak</em>'s Van Arkride, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-heroes-trails-in-sky-3rd" rel="nofollow"><em>Trails in the Sky the 3rd</em></a>'s Kevin Graham.</p>

Rean, Kevin, and Van are drawn into intrigue when Marduk invites them to "co-operate in a high-tech training exercise", setting them on a "collision course with the secrets that lay at the very core of Zemuria".</p>

<p>The game will feature an adapted and enhanced version of&nbsp;<em>Trails through Daybreak</em>'s battle system, allowing you to swap between the action-based Field Battle mode and the more strategic Command Battle system.</p>

<p>New features include the ability to slow time with the Z.O.C. system, boosting your damage and allowing for devastating chain attacks, as well as new Shard Commands to grant your party "a range of benefits during battle".</p>

<p><em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Beyond the Horizon&nbsp;</em>arrives for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3316940/The_Legend_of_Heroes_Trails_beyond_the_Horizon/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012789" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and both Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 on January 15th, and if you're not caught up yet, be sure to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/how-to-get-into-trails-series-nihon-falcom" rel="nofollow">check out our guide</a> on how to get into the series!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dying Light: The Beast Delayed for "Extra Polishing"]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Techland has announced that upcoming zombie sandbox parkour-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>has been delayed by a few weeks in order to ensure additional polish.</p>

<p>While the game was originally intended to launch on August 22nd, Techland now says it needs extra time "to make&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>the best&nbsp;<em>Dying Light&nbsp;</em>game [it's] ever released", which is why the latest title in the series will now be launching on September 19th.</p>

<p>Techland says it understands the delay "may be disappointing", but that its "experience has shown how important the first impression is", and that four extra weeks of development will help the studio "address final details that make all the difference between good and great".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-delayed-parkour.jpg?itok=Y6RIMyVL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dying-light-the-beast-delayed-parkour.jpg?itok=FaYlAqVJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>needs a few more weeks before it can be unleashed.</figcaption></figure><p>Areas that Techland will be working on between now and the new September release date include gameplay balance, "clarity of UI", physics quality, and animation tweaking, as well as the addition of "last little details".</p>

<p>Additionally, Techland will be releasing more information about&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>regularly until September, so if you're disappointed you won't be able to play the game in August, the new reveals should tide you over.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast</em>, it's a standalone followup to 2022's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dying-light-2-stay-human" rel="nofollow"><em>Dying Light 2: Stay Human</em></a>&nbsp;in which you'll once again take on the mantle of Kyle Crane, the protagonist of the original&nbsp;<em>Dying Light</em>.</p>

<p>The game was <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/turns-out-dying-light-the-beast-started-out-as-leaked-dying-light-2-dlc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">originally intended</a> to be a DLC expansion for&nbsp;<em>Dying Light 2</em>, but after plot details for that DLC were leaked by hackers in 2023, Techland decided to turn&nbsp;<em>The Beast&nbsp;</em>into a full standalone followup instead.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Dying Light: The Beast&nbsp;</em>when it launches on September 19th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008130/Dying_Light_The_Beast/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011468" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dying-light-the-beast/9p7zg9mqkkln" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
