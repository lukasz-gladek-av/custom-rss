<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1337100/view/523078230806103089" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post on Steam</a>, Carbon says that it's delisting the game "as our license reaches its conclusion", and that it'll no longer be available on any storefront. That means you won't be able to buy it on Steam, Meta, or Viveport.</p>

<p><em>Tempestfall&nbsp;</em>will first be removed from Steam on January 10th, which is also when support for the game on that platform will be rescinded. Carbon says the timeline for delisting on Meta and Viveport is "still under review" and that an update will be provided "as soon as more information becomes available".</p>

<p>Carbon says it understands that news of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Tempestfall</em>'s delisting "may come as a disappointment". It sounds like the studio had no choice but to pull the game from stores since the license holders (likely Games Workshop in this case) were unwilling to renew said license.</p>

<p><em>Tempestfall&nbsp;</em>isn't the only game based on a major fantasy license being pulled from stores soon.&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeons-dragons-dark-alliance-delisted-february" rel="nofollow">also making its exit from digital storefronts</a> in February, although I imagine that's probably less sad news than&nbsp;<em>Tempestfall</em>'s demise for many.</p>

<p>To combat games being delisted and support being removed from said games, digital storefront GOG recently launched its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program-warcraft-delisting" rel="nofollow">Preservation Program</a>, which guarantees that any game belonging to the Program will be supported forever, regardless of whether its developers or publishers support it.</p>

<p>If you want to buy <i>Warhammer Age of Sigmar: Tempestfall&nbsp;</i>before it's delisted, you can do so via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1337100/Warhammer_Age_of_Sigmar_Tempestfall/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/pcvr/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-tempestfall/4617889574904734/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Meta</a>, or <a href="https://www.viveport.com/apps/8e1e49fc-e4df-4c3e-8387-df8cca8a8890?hl=en-US&amp;srsltid=AfmBOoq3HWS0qANSe2mG4MZJk1fg5WhBIm24ZN04WPak9As-Q9oUaIjK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Viveport</a> right now. Be aware that you will need a VR headset to enjoy it, though.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/legless-in-london-brings-accessible-victorian-ambition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new board game is bringing more visibility to the disabled community. Focus Games has partnered with an accomplished humanities professor to produce <em>Legless in London</em>, a board game about playing as an amputee in Victorian London.</p>

<h2>The <em>Legless in London</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the game's <a href="https://www.leglessinlondon.com/" rel="nofollow">official page</a>, <em>Legless in London</em> is a nuanced board game about disability.</p>

<p>It is a game where players face challenges, opportunities, and choices at every turn. They will navigate the workplace, the marriage market, property ownership, medicine, and the prosthesis market while aiming to achieve their character's personal goals.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/legless-in-london-character-card.jpg?itok=KiLoYxbx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/legless-in-london-character-card.jpg?itok=G8FuaE5x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The playable characters in Legless in London are all inspired by Victorian amputees and fictional characters from 19th-century literature. Everyone from beloved poet William Ernest Henley to <em>Moby Dick's</em> Captain Ahab are represented here.</p>

<p>In addition to being designed for fun, Legless in London encourages players to think about the various barriers that disabled people face in real life and the different hurdles they confront. Furthermore, the designers hope players will reflect on how disabled people are represented in fiction and popular culture.</p>

<p><em>Legless in London</em> was designed in collaboration with Focus Games and Dr. Ryan Sweet, a Senior Lecturer in Humanities at Swansea University, alongside a focus group of members of the disabled community.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Disability and disability history are underrepresented in culture—and especially in tabletop gaming. Many mainstream tabletop games also present accessibility problems for disabled players (for example, wordy and/or complex rules, which can be troublesome for neurodivergent users). Legless in London addresses both representational and accessibility concerns as it provides a balanced, researched-informed, positive, and fun portrayal of disability in an inclusive format.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That consideration for disability also extends to the game's design. It will launch with a smartphone app, providing a digital alternative to the game's physical components including dice rolls, event cards, health tracker, and in-game money.</p>

<p>As for the physical components, the game will ship with large accessible font text, screen reader-friendly resources, easy-read rules, and more.</p>

<p><em>Legless in London</em> will launch in February 2025.</p>
