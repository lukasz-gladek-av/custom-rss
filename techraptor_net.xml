            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo and Monolith Soft have announced <i>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</i>, a remastered version of the 2015 Wii U JRPG&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>.</p>

<p>Launching on March 20th,&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition&nbsp;</em>looks to be doing for its parent game what 2020's&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition-announced-for-switch">did for the first game</a> in the series.</p>

<p>Right now, we don't know a lot about what kind of enhancements we can expect from this remaster, other than that it will be "visually enhanced" and that it'll also feature new story elements, although we don't know what those story elements are yet.</p>

<p>Although it bears the&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade&nbsp;</em>name, it's not actually narratively connected to any previous entries in the series, although you'll likely recognize some common elements and themes if you're a fan of the franchise.</p>

<p>Unlike other&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade&nbsp;</em>games, you play as a custom-created character in&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>. When you awake from a lifepod after a crash-landing on an alien planet, you must help humanity to explore and colonize this planet, dealing with its dangers as you go.</p>

<p>Broadly speaking,&nbsp;<em>Xenoblade Chronicles X&nbsp;</em>offers similar action-RPG gameplay to its predecessors, although the core exploration gameplay is much more about cataloguing and surveying a new planet.</p>




<p>At first, you'll be exploring the beautiful and savage planet of Mira on foot, but after a while, you'll gain access to a mech with which you can reach certain areas and defeat certain enemies more easily.</p>

<p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X&nbsp;</em>is the latest in a line of Wii U games to get Switch remasters. Others include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-announced-for-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario 3D World</em></a>, horror game&nbsp;<em>Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/wonderful-101-remastered-preview">quirky actioner&nbsp;<em>The Wonderful 101</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition&nbsp;</em>launches <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">exclusively on Nintendo Switch</a> on March 20th.</p>
