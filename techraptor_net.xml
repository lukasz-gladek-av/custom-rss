            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/into-dead-our-darkest-days-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PikPok has announced the release date for zombie shelter survival game&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days</em>, the latest entry in the developer's&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead&nbsp;</em>series and the first one to land on PC.</p>

<p>As revealed during today's Future Games Show presentation,&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>will arrive on PC via Steam Early Access on April 9th. PikPok says it's intending the game to remain in Early Access for "at least a year", but that timeline "may shift".</p>

<p>Previous&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead&nbsp;</em>games were released on mobile devices (and Switch), but&nbsp;<em>Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>represents the franchise's first foray into the land of PC. It's also getting a native Mac port.</p>

<p>From your shelter (which can, of course, be upgraded), you'll sally forth into the city of Walton to scavenge for supplies and help your camp to survive. Of course, along the way, you'll have to deal with the undead.</p>

<p>PikPok describes&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days</em>' world as "dynamic and challenging"; you'll be faced with decisions like whether to recruit allies or leave people to fend for themselves, how to manage your camp's "physical and psychological needs", and more.</p>

<p>Intriguingly, the developer says that entire parts of the town "may become overrun and completely uninhabitable" as you play, necessitating a shelter move or perhaps even abandonment. It's all down to you.</p>




<p>You may be a little worried about&nbsp;<em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>if you can remember the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/day-before-will-completely-shut-down-in-janhuary-as-steam-will-refund-all-players" rel="nofollow">last zombie survival game</a> that tried to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fntastic-the-day-before-social-media" rel="nofollow">make a name for itself</a> on Steam, but this one looks like it's much more reasonably scoped, so hopefully, we won't get a repeat of that debacle.</p>

<p><em>Into the Dead: Our Darkest Days&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2239710/Into_the_Dead_Our_Darkest_Days/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on April 9th. A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3182520/Into_the_Dead_Our_Darkest_Days_Demo/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">demo of the game</a> is also available to check out right now if you're on the fence.</p>
