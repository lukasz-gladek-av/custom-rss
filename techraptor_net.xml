            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-roadmap-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has shared the&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>roadmap for 2025, showing what you can expect from the multiplayer-focused ghost-hunting horror game throughout the rest of this year.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-2025-roadmap" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its blog, Kinetic splits said&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>roadmap into three elements: major updates, maps and reworks, and seasonal events. In the first column, you can look forward to the Chronicle update first, which will revamp evidence recording and bring "a few extra bits". It has no release date yet, sadly.</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s second major update this year will bring a player character overhaul to give you more choices when it comes to your ghost hunter. You can expect refreshed models, improved animations, and more. Full customization, however, isn't coming until 2026.</p>

Kinetic is keeping its cards close to its chest, but the developer does say the map will be "small" and based in a "totally unique" location.</p>

<p>Reworks are also coming for several maps. You can expect redone versions of Bleasdale and Grafton Farmhouses, as well as 6 Tanglewood Drive.</p>

<p>The first rework for Bleasdale Farmhouse will arrive sometime in March, Kinetic says, and the latter two will be coming sometime later in the year. In 2026, more map reworks and new maps will be coming, although Kinetic doesn't share any details about those.</p>

<p>Finally, the new 2025&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>roadmap looks ahead to seasonal events, with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-crimson-eye-update" rel="nofollow">Halloween</a> and winter events repeating "with the same themes" this year. A "new take" on the Easter event will also be coming in April.</p>

That's not bad given it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-sales" rel="nofollow">hit a million back in December</a>.</p>
