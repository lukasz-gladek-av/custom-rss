            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>developer HoYoverse has revealed a brand new game in the&nbsp;<em>Honkai&nbsp;</em>sub-series, and if you're a fan of creature-collecting strategy games, then&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima&nbsp;</em>is one you'll want to check out.</p>

<p>Per a press release, you'll be building bonds with creatures made of Anima, unlocking abilities that embody their "unique concepts", and engaging in strategic combat using "diverse battle tactics".</p>

<p>By the looks of things,&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima&nbsp;</em>will take the form of a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-surprise-riot-makes-teamfight-tactics-permanent-league-of-legends-mode" rel="nofollow"><em>Teamfight Tactics</em></a>-style auto-chess game, but you'll also be tasked with exploring the world around you and uncovering "the mysteries of the protagonist's past", which is becoming a bit of a theme for HoYoverse.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/honkai-nexus-anima-announced-combat.jpg?itok=_L4YEtZf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/honkai-nexus-anima-announced-combat.jpg?itok=W-1RY9Zb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Honkai: Nexus Anima&nbsp;</em>brings&nbsp;<em>Teamfight Tactics</em>-style auto-chess combat and more to the&nbsp;<em>Honkai&nbsp;</em>series.</figcaption></figure><p>Although the combat will take the form of auto-chess-style strategy gameplay, the way you'll explore&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em>'s world looks a lot closer to traditional HoYoverse stuff; the trailer shows the player exploring a fully-fledged 3D world, engaging in minigames, and exploring with the aid of creature companions.</p>

<p>As such, this is probably gearing up to take the form of a classic HoYoverse-style grab bag of mechanics and gameplay styles, so if you're put off by the auto-chess angle, there'll almost certainly be something else in&nbsp;<em>Nexus Anima&nbsp;</em>you'll love.</p>

<p>HoYoverse hasn't specified whether you'll need any prior knowledge of the previous&nbsp;<em>Honkai&nbsp;</em>games (namely&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/honkai-star-rail" rel="nofollow">Star Rail</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Impact 3rd</em>) to enjoy this one, but on the basis of&nbsp;<em>Star Rail</em>, it's unlikely you'll need to have played them beforehand.</p>

<p>You can take a look at&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima&nbsp;</em>in action via the all-new gameplay trailer, which includes a look at things like combat, character creation, and world exploration, right here.</p>




<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima&nbsp;</em>yet, but it's coming to PC and iOS at some point in the future. If you want a chance to try it out, you can <a href="https://hna.hoyoverse.com/en-us" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sign up for the closed beta right here</a>.</p>
