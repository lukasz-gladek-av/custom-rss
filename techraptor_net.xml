            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has announced a new Developer Direct presentation for later this month, and it will include information on several upcoming games, one of which I'll be particularly interested in learning about.</p><p>As revealed on the official Xbox <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/08/xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">website</a>, the first Developer Direct of this year will air on January 22nd and will focus on three titles, namely <em>Fable</em>, <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>, and Game Freak's <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em>.</p><p>I'll be watching the progress Playground Games has made on <em>Fable </em>with interest; the game, which was delayed to 2026 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fable-reboot-delayed-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="48a951d3-c822-4051-88a7-e27a8ee10808" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back in February last year</a>, is still a bit of an unknown quantity, and Xbox is promising "a first extended look" at it, so we'll hopefully get to learn exactly what it is during the show.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>We'll finally get a first look at <em>Fable </em>later this month.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As well as <em>Fable</em>, the Developer Direct will also be checking in with another Playground Games title in the form of <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>, which will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-horizon-6-revealed-ps5" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7ede297d-3bdf-4de5-b00a-3479b4a33aab" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">launching sometime this year</a> on PC and Xbox (and on PS5 later after that).</p><p>We already know the racer will be moving its open-world simcade action to Japan this time around, but Xbox is promising we'll get to see gameplay during the Developer Direct. I'm willing to bet you'll be racing cars; in fact, I'd put good money on it.</p><p>Finally, the Xbox Developer Direct will be taking a look at <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em>, the action RPG being worked on by <em>Pokemon </em>developer Game Freak that was revealed during Xbox's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4fbf63a2-36dd-4f58-96b0-c33fd1eb85da" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">summer showcase last year</a>.</p><p><em>Beast of Reincarnation </em>is the only game the show will focus on that isn't being published by Xbox Game Studios, but this isn't exclusively a first-party presentation, after all, so why not, I say.</p>
<p>Xbox hasn't promised any new reveals for the show, so it's possible these will be the only three games we get to see. We'll find out on January 22nd, when the next Xbox Developer Direct airs. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

This year, there's some new games on the list, and they seem to have the juice for quite a bit of staying power into the future.</p><p>Here are the nominees for TechRaptor's 2025 Best Evolving Game Award for outstanding continued development on an existing game.</p><ul><li>Final Fantasy XIV</li><li>Fortnite</li><li>Helldivers 2</li><li>Marvel Rivals</li><li>No Man's Sky</li></ul><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/awards" rel="nofollow">Check out here</a>&nbsp;for our other award categories.</p><hr><picture>

  </picture><h2>Third Place - No Man's Sky</h2><p>Developer: Hello Games | Release Date: August 12th, 2016</p><p>Written by Ashley Erickson</p><p><em>No Man’s Sky</em> had an abysmal launch, lacking many of the gameplay elements touted in the various trailers and presentations. Since then, Hello Games has worked tirelessly to improve their ground breaking title. Underwater exploration, fishing, multiplayer, haunted wrecks, and more were all added to the space exploration game to have it meet player expectations.</p><p>These improvements continued into, and throughout, 2025. Worlds Part II kicked off the year with a new star system, gas giants, and quality of life updates. It was followed up by more Expeditions and improvements to settlements. Voyagers finished out the year in regards to big updates and introduced completely customizable ships that can be used as flying bases. It was one of the biggest years for <em>No Man’s Sky</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>With 2026 marking the game’s 10th anniversary, who knows what the Hello Games team has in store for us next.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Second Place - Marvel Rivals</h2><p>Developer: NetEase Games | Release Date: December 6th, 2024</p><p>Written by Samuel Guglielmo</p><p>Cards on the table: I am not a huge Marvel comics fan, and only really got into it with the movies. When <em>Marvel Rival</em>s came out at the very end of 2024, I suggested it to my friends as an alternative to <em>Overwatch 2</em> (and<em> League of Legends</em>, mostly because that game just made them worse people). I did not know I would be setting us up for a game that would keep us playing all year.</p><p>2025 was an amazing first year for <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. Hero shooters can expect maybe 3 or 4 new characters a year. <em>Marvel Rivals </em>added 12, and this was to an already massive roster of 35 at launch. Several of the new heroes, such as Emma Frost, Ultron, and Phoenix, have entered my rotation of regularly played characters. Others, such as Rogue and Mister Fantastic, have been picked up by my friends. There are already two characters announced for next year, and I can’t wait to get my hands on them.</p><p>But it’s not just new characters. New maps and gameplay modes have kept the game lively. There’s an all new 18v18 mode that is chaotic nonsense. There has been new experimental seasonal modes all year, ranging from really strange matches where everyone plays the same character, to “what if <em>Splatoon </em>but everyone is Jeff?” There’s even been an absurdly fun PVE zombie survival mode that mostly reminded me of <em>Left 4 Dead</em> but with a sort of a<em> Vampire Surviors</em>-styled upgrade element. I love it.</p><p>If <em>Marvel Rivals </em>sees even half the love it got in 2025 next year, it deserves all this praise again. I have a feeling we’re still going to see plenty of more for this game though.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Helldivers 2</h2><p>Developer: Arrowhead Game Studios | Release Date: February 8th, 2024</p><p>Written by Andrew Otton</p><p>Back to back wins for<em> Helldivers 2</em>, as the level of amazing support has continued throughout 2025. From how great the team is at engaging with its community with interesting events to the new content, it was a great year for Helldivers 2 fans.</p><p>One of the biggest things for<em> Helldivers 2</em> this year was releasing on Xbox, which came with a crossover event with <em>Halo ODST</em>-themed content in the game.&nbsp;</p><p>More than that, there were two major content updates this year with the first, Heart of Democracy, centered around repelling an invasion of Super Earth. New, dense cityscape maps, that come with its own challenges like civilians to save.&nbsp;</p><p>The next, Into the Unjust, added giant caves to explore with holes in the roof for stratagems, destructible walls, and a ton of bugs to wipe out of course.&nbsp;</p><p>There was even an ARG, Station-81, that tasked the community with cracking codes, aligning antennae a la Twitch Plays <em>Pokemon </em>style, and more to reveal the invasion of Super Earth, which led into Heart of Democracy.</p><p>All in all, <em>Helldivers 2</em> continues to be a masterclass in how to keep a community engaged.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
       
    <p>There's no I in TEAM!! We're all on the case, and this is how you know it :)</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Phasmophobia </em>developer Kinetic Games has announced Kinetic Publishing, a brand new venture aimed at championing "innovation within the independent game development space", and it's looking to hear your pitches.</p><p>Per a press release, Kinetic Publishing will focus on a "small slate", so it won't be taking on hundreds of games from across the industry; instead, it's keeping the scope small so it can give "meaningful attention" and "tailored support" to its games.</p><p>If you decide to sign up with Kinetic Publishing, you can expect "financial, legal, and marketing support", as well as "wider development guidance" to help you get your game over the finish line.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Kinetic Games isn't just about <em>Phasmophobia </em>anymore.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em>Phasmophobia </em>director and Kinetic CEO Daniel Knight says his studio's growth means the company is now in a position to "provide the support [he'd have] appreciated at the start of [his] journey", while marketing director Asim Tanvir says Kinetic Publishing hopes to "champion and encourage creativity" in indie development.</p><p>Knight and Tanvir will spearhead Kinetic Publishing alongside three other senior team members, but don't worry; work on <em>Phasmophobia </em>won't be slowing down. Developers at Kinetic will be "entirely focused" on the game, the studio says.</p><p>With regards to <em>Phasmophobia</em>, Kinetic says it will reveal the ghost-hunting game's 2026 roadmap "soon". We already know that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-1-0-coming-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="edc0a99d-8664-4093-82db-df3ab1a960ee" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the 1.0 release is scheduled for this year</a>, and that a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-switch-2-version-on-way-next-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="159fca3c-8df3-41ad-98da-95af3a28123c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Switch 2 release is also on the cards</a> for the game.</p><p>According to Kinetic, <em>Phasmophobia </em>enjoyed 16 million Steam page visits this year, as well as "an increase of over 700,000 in broader community growth" and 150,000 new Discord members. It's been a big year for <em>Phasmophobia</em>, that's for sure.</p>
<p>Kinetic Publishing doesn't seem to have signed its first game yet, but the studio says it's currently accepting pitches from indie developers.</p><p>If you want your game to be considered, Kinetic says you'll need to be "12-18 months from release" and to have a "clear vision" for your game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has unveiled the first new colors you'll be able to pick up for the Switch 2's Joy-Con 2 controllers, and they're launching in February, but there's a slight catch for the aesthetically-inclined.</p><p>As revealed via the Nintendo Today app, new purple and green Joy-Con 2s will be released on February 12th this year, and as you've probably surmised, the edges of the controllers will be light purple and light green, respectively.</p><p>The body of the Joy-Con 2 will remain black in both instances, however, and what's more, the colors won't correspond to the edges of the console, so you'll have to deal with a mismatch every time you attach your Joy-Con 2s to your Switch 2.</p><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption>The Switch 2 is getting new Joy-Con 2 colors soon.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Happily, however, it doesn't look like you'll be able to tell that the colors don't match when the controllers are docked on the console, so the clash shouldn't be too much of an eyesore.</p><p>Introducing new Joy-Con colors was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-pastel-joy-cons" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ba98a8b8-8ce9-4458-b4e9-813635a22d7e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a staple of the original Switch</a> for Nintendo, so it's nice to know that tradition will continue for the Switch 2, although I'm hoping for some slightly more interesting designs on the actual controllers themselves next time.</p><p>Of course, these controllers aren't any different to the original Joy-Con 2s you'll have received as part of your Switch 2, so they're just as susceptible to problems like controller drift as the originals (and, indeed, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/consumer-watchdog-urges-nintendo-to-get-grip-on-joy-con-drift" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="10da3ff4-d0cf-4623-9c10-63fda942fd3f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">as the Switch 1 controllers were</a>, seemingly).</p><p>Still, perhaps you'll be able to use <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-voice-command-software-hitachi" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c6fddd4a-de7d-4262-8492-e73298196a0a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Hitachi's new voice control protocol</a> to interact with games if your controllers do start showing signs of drift, or maybe Nintendo will switch to Hall effect sticks at some point in the future (although that seems unlikely if you ask me).</p><figure role="group">

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Krafton and developer ARC Team have announced the Early Access release date for their free-to-play top-down tactical shooter <em>PUBG: Blindspot</em>, and it's heading to PC via Steam next month.</p><p>As revealed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3143710/view/535497844504658077" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">a post</a> on Steam, <em>PUBG: Blindspot </em>will be available to play in its Early Access form starting from February 5th. Again, the game will be free at the point of entry, so it won't cost you anything other than time to try it out.</p><p>Krafton says that <em>PUBG: Blindspot</em>'s Early Access version "may include limited content", but that the project will "evolve through ongoing balance updates, improvements, and live development", which is pretty much the dictionary definition of an Early Access game, I think.</p><figure role="group">

<p>More details about <em>PUBG: Blindspot</em>'s Early Access release, as well as a "full FAQ", will be made available via the game's official Discord server at some point in the near future, so look out for that if you want to know more.</p><p>If you're wondering exactly what <em>PUBG: Blindspot </em>is, Krafton describes the game as "a 5v5 top-down tactical shooter built on clever positioning, tight teamwork, and shared vision".</p><p>Each game will see one team trying to gain entry to a building in order to access its Crypt, while the other team tries to defend the building from the first team's incursion. Krafton and ARC Team are promising unique classes, as well as iconic weapons from <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> for you to try out.</p><p>&nbsp;You can check out a trailer for <em>PUBG: Blindspot</em>, which should give you a sense of what kind of gameplay you can expect from the project, right here.</p>
