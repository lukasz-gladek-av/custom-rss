The successfully crowdfunded cinematic RPG's developer Two Little Mice and Free League Publishing have officially announced a publishing partnership, bringing the game to store shelves worldwide.</p>



<p>According to an official press release, <em>Outgunned</em> will be published under Free League Workshop. This is the sub-label for games not internally developed by Free League.</p>

<p>It features a unique RPG system called Director's Cut. It revolves around players using small pools of six-sided dice to determine the outcome of their players' actions. But instead of rolling high or rolling low, the goal is to roll doubles, triples, or even quadruples.</p>

<p>This simple gameplay is to facilitate <em>Outgunned's</em> cinematic action movie gameplay. The TTRPG is inspired by classic action and heist movies like <em>Die Hard</em> or <em>Mission Impossible</em>. The players are the Heroes struggling against the machinations of a Villain to save the day. But, as the title implies, the Heroes are outnumbered and outgunned.</p>

It was fully funded within five minutes of going live and ended with its stretch goals fulfilled. It went on to win two silver ENNIEs in 2024's "Best Game" and "Product of the Year" categories.</p>

<p>This puts <em>Outgunned</em> alongside other award-winning projects by Two Little Mice such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-games-announces-household-ttrpg-coming-to-west" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Household</em></a> and <em>Broken Compass</em>.</p>

<p>Free League's body of work contains similarly acclaimed work. Alongside the meticulously authentic Middle-earth TTRPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/one-ring-rpg-second-edition-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The One Ring</em></a>, they have released the Swedish fantasy TTRPG <em>Dragonbane</em> and an RPG adaptation of the sci-fi book, <em>The Electric State</em>.</p>

<p><em>Outgunned</em> and its associated expansions and products are available for purchase now on Free League's webstore. If you are attending PAX Unplugged this year, the TTRPG will be featured at Free League's booth.</p>
