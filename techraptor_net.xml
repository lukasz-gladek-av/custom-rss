            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie extraction shooter and <i>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</i>spoof <i>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</i>has managed to sell a pretty impressive number of copies since launching on Thursday, developer Team Soda and publisher bilibili have announced.</p>

<p>According to a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3167020/view/617681009992795859" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>sales have hit 500,000 since last week's release, an achievement Team Soda says has its developers "quacking with joy and flapping [their] wings in excitement".</p>

<p>The studio promises that every subsequent update for&nbsp;<em>Duckov&nbsp;</em>will "live up to your expectations" and reminds everyone who hasn't bought the game yet that it's still available at a 12% discount, so if you are at all interested in&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov</em>, now's the time to pick it up.</p>

<p>It's not a bad figure at all for a game that almost certainly started out as a joke based on its title, so kudos to Team Soda and bilibili for seeing this one through. I'd say they deserve to reap the benefits, especially if the game's Overwhelmingly Positive Steam <a href="http://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">rating</a> is anything to go by.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov</em>, it's a top-down extraction shooter openly inspired by Battlestate's popular&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em>, although it's obviously a good deal less realistic than that game.</p>

<p>Although&nbsp;<em>Duckov&nbsp;</em>bases its core gameplay loop, inventory management system, and general atmosphere on&nbsp;<em>Tarkov</em>, it's not a multiplayer game; this is a strictly single-player PvE affair, so if you're put off from&nbsp;<em>Tarkov&nbsp;</em>by other players (and its lack of ducks), this one's for you.</p>




<p>You can grab&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> if you're interested in checking it out. Stay tuned for more.</p>
