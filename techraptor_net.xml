            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capstone Games' newest tabletop game, Aquaria, is available now for pre-order. The game is a family-friendly experience about who can build and maintain the most impressive aquarium.</p>

<h2>The <em>Aquaria</em> Pre-Order Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="https://capstone-games.com/product/aquaria/" rel="nofollow">store page</a>, <em>Aquaria</em> is a board game designed for 1-4 players and takes about 60-180 minutes to complete. Each player takes turns building their own aquarium with its own unique ecosystem of marine life. Those turns are spent buying new fish, feeding them, and keeping the aquarium in good condition.</p>

The encyclopedia rewards points for how involved each player becomes in their understanding of marine biology and their aquarium maintenance. Whoever has the most points at the end wins the game. Notably, the game revolves less around exotic fish and more around aquascaping and fauna management.</p>

<p>The lead designer of <em>Aquaria</em> is&nbsp;Tomáš Holek, the award-winning tabletop designer, no stranger to management-oriented tabletop experiences. His work includes <em>Tea Garden</em>, a game about managing and cultivating your own tea garden in China's Yunnan region, and <em>SETI: Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence</em>, a sci-fi game about searching for life beyond planet Earth.</p>

<p>This management focus is also not unheard of for Capstone Games. Their most beloved board game is 2012's <em>Terra Mystica</em>, a euro-game designed by&nbsp;Jens Drögemüller and&nbsp;Helge Ostertag about managing your own small part of a vast fantasy kingdom. It is an experience so beloved it has won multiple awards over the years, including the acclaimed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/diana-jones-award-2025-winners-have-been-announced-their-prize-includes-trip-to" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Diana Jones Award</a>, Meeples' Choice, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/designer-of-bomb-busters-board-game-wins-this-years-spiel-des-jahres" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Spiel des Jahres</a>.</p>

<p>The acclaim is so profound that Steamforged Games has announced plans to <a href="https://steamforged.com/blogs/brands/terra-mystica-special-edition" rel="nofollow">reprint the game</a> through a crowdfunding campaign.</p>

<p>The <em>Aquaria</em> board game is available for pre-order at an MSRP of $74.95 not including shipping. It is expected to ship out to customers in November.</p>
