            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Crisol: Theater of Idols </em>is, at the very least, an aptly-named game. It really does feel like a theater of idols; in fact, it feels like a theater that pays tribute to two idols in particular, namely <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/bioshock" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="59ad10c9-4ae1-417e-a4af-d1ad3147da86" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>BioShock</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/resident-evil-village" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7d76fc24-612e-4e7e-9804-64ccee40af28" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Resident Evil Village</em></a>.</p><p>The DNA of both games can be found everywhere in developer Vermila Studios and publisher Blumhouse Games' horror shooter. Whether it's the gloomy, glitzy post-disaster setting of Tormentosa, a suspiciously familiar weapon upgrade system, or structural similarities that are hard to ignore, there's no denying the connections.</p><p>Of course, it's one thing to pay tribute to your idols and quite another to transcend those influences in order to create something truly original. <em>Crisol: Theater of Idols </em>knows what it likes, but it can't quite find a way to translate those heady origins into something new and compelling.</p><h2><em>Crisol: Theater of Idols </em>Is Atmospheric, but Uninvolving</h2><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p><em>Crisol </em>tells the story of Gabriel, a religious soldier sent to the island of Tormentosa on a holy mission. In true <em>BioShock </em>fashion, Gabriel awakens on the coast of Tormentosa at the outset of his quest and journeys inland, encountering horrors aplenty as he goes.</p><p>It's clear that <em>Crisol </em>wants religion and dogma to be the central pillars of its narrative, but it lacks the courage to say anything meaningful about its subject matter.&nbsp;</p><p>What unfolds is not a tale of zealotry and the lengths to which religion will go to subjugate its victims; rather, it's a histrionic, uneven story that takes some pretty egregious logical leaps in attempting to deliver shocking twists.</p><p>I don't want to spoil anything, but I found <em>Crisol: Theater of Idols</em>' narrative to be equal parts uninvolving and baffling. Many of its key mysteries felt unresolved, and the conclusions of those that did receive some sort of closure felt unsatisfying and weak.</p><p>The problem lies chiefly with characters. Gabriel is about as stock a protagonist as you could hope to find, and his radio support companion Mediodia is intensely, desperately annoying (not to mention horribly animated).</p><p>Unfortunately, there aren't many other major characters to get to know; the enemies Gabriel comes across are generally stock characters indebted to their key influences. One major villain even directly paraphrases <em>BioShock </em>during a climactic moment, and it feels like a cheap reference rather than a sly wink.</p><p>It's a shame, because the atmosphere on display can be very effective indeed. The sound design here is excellent, capturing the feel of an abandoned city and its labyrinthine horrors perfectly.</p><p>When the moon hits a ramshackle dock or a glittering carnival just right, <em>Crisol: Theater of Idols </em>threatens to become immersive, but knowing there's another lame narrative twist around the corner derails that sense of tension.</p><p>Not only that, but <em>Crisol </em>is in deep with the yellow paint mob. Its largely linear environments are covered in these patronizing, obvious directional signals, and it lessens immersion even further. Who's painting the entrances of these tunnels? Who knows Gabriel's journey better than he does?</p><h2>Combat In <em>Crisol: Theater of Idols </em>Struggles With Repetition</h2><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Get used to this enemy. You'll be seeing it a lot.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>During <em>Crisol</em>'s opening moments, Gabriel comes face-to-face with a creepy porcelain mannequin enemy, which wrenches itself off the wall and rushes him with nary a change of its painted expression.</p><p>It's a very effective opener, and the ways in which Gabriel can dismember the creature and even behead it without making a dent set up an adaptable, worryingly durable foe that will take smarts and perseverance to overcome.</p><p>Sadly, this is another area in which <em>Crisol </em>disappoints. These mannequins will form the vast bulk of the enemies you'll face throughout a roughly 10-12-hour playthrough; I reckon about 90% of the enemy encounters are made up solely of these guys.</p><p>Over the course of my time with <em>Crisol</em>, I counted four distinct enemy types. One, a sort of goblin creature that crawls between paintings, isn't really a combat encounter; it and its friends infinitely respawn, meaning it's much more worth your time to sprint to your goal rather than engage the monster.</p><p>The best survival horror games constantly wrong-foot you with new enemy types and changes to existing enemies, meaning you're never quite able to relax. <em>Crisol </em>absolutely fails on this front; its encounters are so repetitive that they're almost comforting.</p><p>Your weapons themselves feel...fine. It's a pretty bog-standard lineup - think pistol, shotgun, rifle - but bullets land with a satisfying enough thud. That's only half of the equation, though, and when enemies are this boring to fight, even <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/doom-eternal" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1cbdb0ce-87bb-479c-9216-3442b390a2cf" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Doom Eternal</em></a>'s gunplay wouldn't suffice.</p><h2>There's Simply No Scarcity in <em>Crisol: Theater of Idols</em></h2><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Crisol: Theater of Idols </em>can't manage scares or tension at any point.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I bring up survival horror because <em>Crisol: Theater of Idols </em>explicitly bills itself as such, and judged on these terms, it's an abject failure.</p><p><em>Crisol </em>revolves around a rather neat little mechanic whereby blood serves as ammunition, so if you want to keep yourself stocked up, you'll have to sacrifice health to do so.</p><p>Blood can be recovered by draining animals (and, sometimes, humans) throughout your environment, as well as by using consumable syringes. As such, <em>Crisol </em>clearly wants you to constantly be asking whether it's worth draining that last scrap of health to give yourself a fighting chance in a battle.</p><p>It's unfortunate, then, that <em>Crisol </em>suffers from an almost total lack of scarcity. There was not a single point during my playthrough when I struggled for resources. I was awash with blood, drowning in corpses, carrying a bag bulging with syringes.</p><p>Ironically enough for a horror game, <em>Crisol </em>seems terrified of alienating you or frustrating you, so its levels are absolutely chock-full of health pickups. I was constantly ignoring syringes or using them with 95% of my health remaining just so I could pick up more.</p><p>Without scarcity, a survival horror game can no longer deliver on dread. If you're constantly well-prepared for whatever's coming around the next corner, then it won't surprise you or terrify you.</p><p>Combined with the terminal lack of enemy variety, any chance that <em>Crisol </em>can provide a tense or scary experience is gone.</p><p>The problem, though, is this: if <em>Crisol </em>doesn't work as a survival horror shooter, and its enemies are nowhere near varied enough for a serviceable action-horror game, then what, exactly, do we have before us?</p><h2><em>Crisol: Theater of Idols </em>- Final Thoughts</h2><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Sometimes, <em>Crisol: Theater of Idols </em>looks nice. It's not enough to save it.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It pains me to say it, given the obvious ambition on display, but <em>Crisol: Theater of Idols </em>just...doesn't work.</p><p>Its survival horror elements are undone by a total lack of scarcity, thus making resource management a complete non-issue, and its enemy encounters are stultifyingly repetitive, thus kneecapping any chance of high-octane and exciting combat.</p><p><em>Crisol </em>just feels like it keeps getting in its own way. Its atmosphere is moody and compelling, but undone by overbearing yellow paint guidance. Its guns feel weighty, but the enemies you'll use them on are too boring to provide catharsis.</p><p><em>BioShock </em>worked because it had a message, and <em>Resident Evil Village </em>worked because it constantly kept you guessing. <em>Crisol </em>does neither, and as such, it's a safe skip, even if you love its influences.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Crisol: Theater of Idols</strong> was reviewed on PC with a copy provided by the developer over the course of 12 hours of gameplay.

<h2>Time Travel Shenanigans</h2><p><em>Code Vein 2</em> is an interesting case of ditching the story of its first game and creating a new world for its sequel; as far as I know, there aren't any connections to the first game besides the fact that there are these Vampiric entities called Revenants, as well as Revenant Hunters.</p><p>The premise of <em>Code Vein 2</em>'s narrative is actually intriguing and held a great deal of potential to capture my attention, but we're met with mixed results. It revolves around this idea of the "Resurgence," a calamity-level event that threatens to destroy the world.&nbsp;</p><p>100 years in the past, heroes attempted to stop the Resurgence, but in doing so, they became sealed in cocoons to hold off this mysterious threat. With the heroes' bodies in a stasis of sorts, the Resurgence is returning, and to end it, you'll have to destroy the cocoons.</p><figure role="group">

<p><em>But</em>, in order to open these cocoons and destroy the heroes inside, you'll have to use a Revenant called Lou to time travel into the past. You'll befriend these heroes, learn about their stories, and -- as it is the only known way to end the threat -- return to the present to slay them with a catalyst that opens their cocoons.</p><p>It sounds convoluted, and it's a bit intimidating to jump into with all the lore. That said, I was more concerned about the stories of the heroes in <em>Code Vein 2, </em>and how my interactions with them in the past would affect the present timeline.&nbsp;</p><p>You have a wide range of personalities for said heroes -- ones that definitely fit into some cliche anime archetypes -- from the doting and flirtatious doctor Holly, to Lyle, your local edgy boy. There are five heroes in total, and you'll learn about each of their stories, with most of them having some sort of tragic background.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Alright Holly, not the most appropriate attire for a doctor.&nbsp;</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I did develop some emotional connection to the characters, since you're going into the past with the knowledge that, in the present, they're in their cocoons and must be slain. Only tragedy awaits them, and all of these characters also lead tumultuous lives.&nbsp;</p><p>Their backstories are explained a bit crudely, however, as you embark on quests with them. They'll often go into long lore dumps for no reason (perhaps because you're a silent protagonist), so <em>Code Vein 2</em> is more of the "tell, don't show" type of game.</p><p>Some characters are deeper than others, with Lyle not being all that compelling and Holly being somewhat likable but otherwise a tad too "fan servicey" for my taste. Josee was much more captivating as a character, with her dominating personality and a past filled with familial trauma. Her story is emotional, but it would probably have more of an impact were she not tramping around in her underwear the whole time.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<p>Then there's Zenon, a gregarious and towering Revenant that is introduced via a musical number. Despite the tonal whiplash, that was a pretty silly moment that I haven't seen in many games, and it immediately told me what I needed to know about Zenon.</p><p>From a narrative perspective, the time travel aspect isn't really all that well utilized in <em>Code Vein 2</em>. You're changing the present timeline, but in what seem to be very, very minute ways. The payoff happens if you decide to pursue the two additional endings in <em>Code Vein 2 </em>beyond the first, but you'll have to contend with this game's combat to see those -- both the good and the bad.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<h2>Weapons Come in Many Formae</h2><p>When I play a Soulslike, my first thought is always, "How am I going to build this character?" Almost always, I default to strength -- pure strength. <em>Code Vein 2, </em>like its predecessor, is a bit different in that regard. You gain Haze (which operates as this game's runes or souls), and that is spent for a level increase. Leveling up increases all stats, not just the ones of your choosing.&nbsp;</p><p>So how, then, do you build a strength-based character, or a dexterity one, for that matter? It's all in the Blood Code. These are basically equipable classes that automatically scale stats a certain way. So it all comes down to finding the right Blood Code, which, if you use it enough times, upgrades to unlock better ones.</p><figure role="group">

<p>This system is great -- it rewards players for sticking with a certain style of play. Not only that, it allows you to switch classes on the fly, so you're not pigeonholed into one specific archetype if it's not working for you. Though if you're stubborn like me, you'll just stick to the same thing throughout.</p><p>This type of flexibility is where <em>Code Vein 2</em> shines. There's also a lot of equipment to choose from to further enhance your build. The in-game names for these items are a bit confusing -- Jails, Bequeathed Formae, Defensive Formae, Boosters -- but it's easier to just think of them as weapons or tools for your kit.</p><p>For instance, Jails are used to suck ichor from injured enemies, which is a precious resource that allows you to use Weapon Formae (simply, weapon skills), and that is your main source of damage. Bequethed Formae is a powerful, secondary weapon that uses ichor, and Defensive Formae are defensive items like shields or dashes that allow you to avoid or reduce damage.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<p>Boosters, on the other hand, are additional little items that can give base stat increases, increase damage with certain weapon types, and more. I preferred running with boosters that increased my offense, defense, and gave extra hammer damage. All of these terms are intimidating at first, but you can intuit what they all mean pretty quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>And so, with all of these parts working in tandem, there's a great deal of depth to <em>Code Vein 2</em>'s combat. You can also roll with one additional weapon that can be switched on the fly, but that'll increase your burden a bit, but the options seem pretty limitless.</p><figure role="group">

<h2>Tossed Around</h2><p>Bosses are large and imposing, with attack patterns and almost too much health for it to be reasonable, and enemies can even pack a punch too. Thankfully, you can run with an AI companion to lighten the burden of <em>Code Vein 2</em>'s difficulty, though you can also decide to go without them for an extra challenge.</p><p>For me, though, <em>Code Vein 2</em> was a constant battle to stay ahead. The beginning stages were challenging as I was formulating my build, until I eventually landed on the proper Blood Code and weapons I wanted to use. After you pin that down, things can be a bit less grueling, though I couldn't help but think that this game wasn't built for players like me.</p><p>I opt for slow and heavy weapons, hence my hammer, and that's what I usually play in most Soulslikes. So, I expected to be a warrior who packs a punch while also taking a punch. If only it worked out that way.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<p>Enemies, particularly bosses, in <em>Code Vein 2</em> feel quite overtuned. Their attacks will almost always toss you, so it's nearly impossible to <em>not</em> have your poise broken. Seriously, it felt like <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/monster-hunter" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Hunter</em></a> at times when you'd get hit by an enemy. I'd just get tossed into the air by some over-aggressive abomination while I whittled away at bosses' insane health pools.</p><p>Boss patterns feel almost too aggressive and too fast, and the window to dodge felt off. As a heavy player, I expected to tank some hits, but in most cases, I'd have to chug a potion or two, only to be tossed again. Most of the time, I was able to damage bosses when they targeted my AI companion, because it's very hard to stand toe-to-toe with bosses when they're constantly on your ass.</p><p>The ideal scenario is winning a fight and feeling satisfied, but that was rarely the case. <em>Code Vein 2</em> just doesn't feel like it's built to accommodate gamers with my style of play, which is a shame.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Here's just a snippet of a single region in <em>Code Vein 2</em>.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>An Open World, But Also an Empty One</h2><p>I say all this already knowing, however, that Bandai Namco is aware of these issues and is addressing them in a future patch; indeed, the highlights of said patch would "adjust Evasion performance for higher effectiveness," and "Implement other balance adjustments, including changes to enemy behaviors."</p><p>Even so, there are several more issues that will take more than a patch or two in order to fix. I'd actually be very surprised if these next few complaints are fixed at all. I have issues with the open world and dungeon design. I suppose it all boils down to these areas of <em>Code Vein 2</em> being relatively uninteresting and empty.</p><p>The concept of an open world has promise; after all, it worked for <em>Elden Ring</em> splendidly. You could turn in almost any direction and see something that catches your eye in <em>Elden Ring</em>, whereas it's the opposite in <em>Code Vein 2.&nbsp;</em></p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>You have a motorcycle that can traverse the world, and it also doubles as a glider.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's a shame, because the world is vast, and each zone has its own distinct feel. Even so, there are few dungeons out in the open world, so there's very little incentive to explore. I'd usually just go from Point A to Point B, wherever my current quest wanted to take me, as you rarely stumble upon anything worthwhile.</p><p>Once you discover part of the map, you can actually see where most points of interest are, so that almost destroys the feeling of discovering something rare or special. For instance, the ruins of the Sunken City, despite having miles and miles of dilapidated buildings and facilities, generally doesn't have much beyond a few key areas.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Okay, there is one exception to the mostly linear dungeons.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When you do come across a dungeon, they have the feel of the catacombs with those creepy little gargoyles from <em>Elden Ring</em>. Arguably, those dungeons are the worst part of <em>Elden Ring</em>, since they all look the same. For the most part, <em>Code Vein 2</em>'s dungeons follow that same formula. These drab, grey facilities filled with enemies feel samey and do nothing to stand out. Rewards at the end don't particularly feel useful beyond the Haze you get from killing all the enemies.</p><p>There are a few exceptions to this critique, but this is mainly during the main storyline. One such area is this floating, fractured theme park with perilous drops and enemies lurking in corners, waiting to push you over. These work well and hearken back to <em>Dark Souls</em> level design of being able to explore in unconventional ways. For the most part, though, dungeons are almost always completely linear in nature and have little exploration.&nbsp;</p><figure role="group">

<h2><em>Code Vein 2 </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p>Performance is another area where <em>Code Vein 2 </em>is found to be lacking, though it's also on the list for fixes in the upcoming patches. On PS5's Performance Mode, frame rates are super choppy and inconsistent. I don't think I ever reached 60 FPS, which is the minimum I'd expect for a game such as this.</p><p>While <em>Code Vein 2</em> has excellent visual design, Performance Mode definitely doesn't do it any favors. It makes <em>Code Vein 2</em> look like an early title from the previous generation. The scale of the world and the detail can actually be impressive, but it desperately needs these optimization fixes to show its true potential.&nbsp;</p><p>I've been pretty harsh on <em>Code Vein 2</em>, but despite my gripes, it's a promising game. Combat is versatile and challenging (if unfair, for the time being), and the characters are still more memorable than most other games of its genre. Once a few more patches start to roll out, I'm sure <em>Code Vein 2</em> will be in a much better state.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em><strong>Code Vein 2 </strong>was reviewed on PS5 with a copy provided by the publisher over the course of around 35 hours of gameplay.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile </em>will be shutting down completely in April, publisher Activision has announced, so make sure you get in the games you want to play before it goes away.</p><p>In a <a href="https://support.activision.com/warzone-mobile/articles/warzone-mobile-service-changes" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">blog post</a> on the official <em>Warzone Mobile </em>website, Activision says that the game's servers will be closing on April 17th, after which point you won't be able to play it at all.</p><p>In May last year, <em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile </em>was delisted after not meeting Activision's "expectations", so its closure probably shouldn't come as a surprise. Still, it's a little disappointing that <em>Warzone Mobile </em>will be disappearing entirely and that you won't be able to play it at all anymore.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>If you still happen to have <em>Warzone Mobile </em>installed, you can use any COD Points you may have left over in order to buy in-game content until the April shutdown, but you can't buy any more of it with real cash.</p><p>You also won't be able to get any refunds for COD Points you've purchased, so it's best to use those points towards anything you might want in <em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile </em>before it shuts down.</p><p>It's worth noting that this shutdown won't affect the more popular <em>Call of Duty: Mobile</em>; that game will continue to operate as normal, as will the PC and console-based <em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>. This shutdown strictly applies to <em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile</em>.</p><p>It's a little confusing, but you can remember it this way: if you can currently download and play the game on your platform of choice, then it's probably not shutting down anytime soon.</p>
<p>This is where I'd usually tell you where to download and play <em>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile</em>, but, well, unless it's already installed on your device, you can't, unfortunately. The game will be shutting down on both Android and iOS on April 17th.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
