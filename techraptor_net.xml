            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/upcoming-sci-fi-game-exodus-is-getting-official-ttrpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The upcoming sci-fi game, <em>Exodus</em>, is getting a TTRPG. This original game property, formally announced during 2023's The Game Awards, has yet to show official gameplay, but will offer early adopters a chance to buy an official core rulebook. Given the developer's parent company, that isn't a major stretch.</p>

<h2>The <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG Announcement</h2>

<p>According to its <a href="https://www.exodusgame.com/en-US/founders-special-limited-time-offer" rel="nofollow">official website</a>, the <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG is part of a special, limited-time offer for those part of the game's Founder program. You can become a Founder by simply providing your email address and signing up for game development updates.</p>

You can use the link and the code to purchase the <em>Exodus Traveler's Handbook</em>.</p>

<p>The post explains that the <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG's announcement is to celebrate the first anniversary of the announcement of the game and as a special thanks to its community. Aside from this text, no other concrete details about the TTRPG are provided. No game system is mentioned. No confirmed long-term support. No associated products like custom dice or GM Screens are included.</p>

<p>This same vibes-driven marketing is echoed in the <em>Exodus</em> videogame itself. Outside of some prerendered trailers, no gameplay footage has been shown. It's not even clear what its core gameplay will center around. Is it a single-player survival sim? A multiplayer survival game in the style of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/rust" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Rust</em></a>? No one knows.</p>

This is a deliberate choice since the game's announcement at 2023's The Game Awards was introduced <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkbPhbyPWCk" rel="nofollow">by Matthew McConaughey</a>, the star of that film.</p>

<p>This does not mean that <em>Exodus</em> and its associated TTRPG are vaporware of any kind. The game is being developed by Archetype Entertainment, whose founders include former Bioware developers, the creative voices behind the original <em>Baldur's Gate</em> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/mass-effect-legendary-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Mass Effect</em></a> trilogy.</p>

<p>Furthermore, Archetype is a subsidiary of Wizards of the Coast, the tabletop giant behind <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>. Given that much of Bioware's early work was built on the gameplay foundations of earlier editions of <em>D&amp;D</em>, there's a good chance the <em>Exodus</em> TTRPG may be built on similar foundations.</p>

<p>The <em>Exodus</em> videogame has no official release date at time of writing.</p>
