<hr><h2>Fifth Place - Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</h2>



<p>Developer: Square Enix | Release Date: Februrary 29th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p>

<p>The reimagining of Cloud's legendary adventure took its second big step this year. With the escape from Midgar and quest to seek Sephiroth, the doors of the world flew open and Square Enix managed to take core elements of what made <em>Remake </em>so great; enhanced combat, compelling performances from the cast, and incredible visuals and improve on them even more.</p>

<p>This adventure made further deviations from the original story, continuing to remind fans of the original game of what made the adventure so great, while also providing new mystery all leading to an incredible and action-packed finale.</p>

<h2>Fourth Place - Astro Bot</h2>



<p>Developer: Team Asobi | Release Date: September 6th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Austin Suther</p>

<p><em>Astro Bot</em> took Game of the Year at Geoff Keighly’s The Game Awards, so it’s no wonder this delightful platformer makes an appearance on this list.<em> Astro Bot</em> is pure childhood joy molded into video game form, creating an experience that’ll have you smiling from start to finish.</p>

<p>Though <em>Astro Bot</em> features a myriad of PlayStation mascots and other gaming characters, the real highlight is this platformer’s stellar level design. Each level is a new experience to enjoy, as Team Asobi made sure to incorporate as many fun ideas as they could into one video game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Its use of DuelSense is another marvel in game design. It’s not just an auditory and visual experience, but a tactile one as well. It’s something you’ll just have to experience for yourself, and once you do, you’ll see what makes <em>Astro Bot</em> such a triumph.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Third Place -&nbsp;Balatro</h2>



<p>Developer: LocalThunk | Release Date: February 20th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Blair Bishop</p>

<p>When The Game Awards announced the nominees for their awards show, some saw <em>Balatro </em>not just as the token indie pick, but as something that took a more deserving spot from something like, say, <em>Silent Hill 2</em>&nbsp;or <em>Helldivers 2</em>. Not only were they wrong, but it was the first year where the token indie nod had a legitimate chance to upset the entire industry and come out on top.</p>

<p>While it wasn’t meant to be, that still doesn’t detract from the sheer power <em>Balatro </em>possesses. Since its 1.0 release in February of 2024, it’s only grown bigger and bigger, a supermassive black hole which sucks up your free time. A true indie powerhouse, it’s an incredible time-sink, a deceptively welcome experience, and a soaring entry into the upper echelon of roguelikes.</p>

<h2>Second Place - Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h2>



<p>Developer: MachineGames | Release Date: December 9th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p>

<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> is the <em>Indiana Jones</em> adventure of the 80s we never got. This game features an almost perfect blend of exploration, puzzle solving, and combat that allows you to get invested not only in the greater mystery of the game, but in the world as you stumble into interesting side quests and puzzles alike.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Most impressive of all is how the character of Indiana Jones is performed so faithfully with a mix of nailing Harrison Ford-esque facial expressions and a stellar performance by Troy Baker. We're transported to the past while also getting to enjoy the evolution of action-exploration games.</p>

<h2>Winner - Metaphor: ReFantazio</h2>



<p>Developer: Atlus | Release Date: October 11th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by&nbsp;Veerender Singh Jubbal</p>

<p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio’</em>s Bond system improves upon recent mainline <em>Persona </em>games’ Social Link mechanics to expedite the relationships your player character has with the cast and allows more player choice in building teams the way you would like. Being able to defeat lower-level enemies in the overworld to not trigger an encounter or being able to easily restart any battle, so you can get the best results pushes you further in tackling the game’s tough enemies even on the Normal difficulty setting.</p>

<p>One of <em>Metaphor</em>’s main theses early on is: can fictional media change the views and ideologies of real people for the better? Can fictional representation in stories bring about real-world change? The game handles the topics of racism/xenophobia directly and poignantly with hopeful lenses, but also does not shy away from showcasing that hatred/discrimination/despair to the player through degradation and ostracization in an impactful way from NPCs exuding microaggressions, subtle racism and/or unapologetic racism—all of various levels, types, and intricacies.</p>

<p>A remarkable and all-new intellectual property that showcases colorful style with its cutscenes, artful UI, dedicated substance, and an excellent soundtrack with simple, but effective gameplay mechanics ushers in a new age not just of JRPGs, but RPGs as a whole is TechRaptor’s 2024 Game of the Year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-details<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is getting trading sometime this month, and while we still don't have a release date for the update, we do now know a little more about how trading will work.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1880012156504084895" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X, the devs behind the app confirm that trading is still planned to arrive in January, and they also reveal more details regarding what you'll be able to trade and with whom.</p>

<p>According to the post, trading will only be possible between friends, and only cards of the same rarity can be traded, so you won't be able to demand that your friend trade their ultra-rare Mewtwo card for your Caterpie.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-cards.jpg?itok=S3QiZ_k0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-cards.jpg?itok=1LZJM9yD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Trading is coming to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, but there are several caveats.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, only "certain cards" from&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s first two sets - Genetic Apex and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion" rel="nofollow">expansion set Mythical Island</a> - will be tradeable at the time trading launches. The devs say they'll be expanding the booster packs you can trade in the future.</p>

<p>Only the first five rarity tiers of cards will be tradeable, too, so you can't trade anything with a rarity rating of two stars or above. The&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>devs don't provide any kind of reason for this decision (or, indeed, for any of the other restrictions being imposed on trading).</p>

<p>Finally, it sounds like there will be some kind of unique currency for trading, as the devs say "items must be consumed" if you want to trade.</p>

<p>It looks as though the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>community isn't particularly happy with some of these terms, as in a <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1880027099836411924" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup message</a>, the devs say the community's "concerns are seen" and that players should wait until the feature has arrived to "try it and provide feedback".</p>




<p>Unfortunately, the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>devs don't provide any info about when we can expect trading to arrive, but it's set to launch sometime in January. You can play&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>right now for free on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a> devices.</p>
