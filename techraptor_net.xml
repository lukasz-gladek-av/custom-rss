            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced the next GameCube game to join its Switch Online library, and it's none other than much-loved mid-2000s 3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo!</em>.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer, Skip Ltd and Nintendo's game will be added to Switch Online next week. It'll be the second major <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gamecube-switch-2-online" rel="nofollow">GameCube game</a> to join the service after the Switch 2's launch, following on from&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-mario-strikers-switch-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Super Mario Strikers</em></a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo!</em>, it was released in Japan in 2005, but it didn't get a Western release until the following year (as was fairly common for Japanese releases back then). You play as the titular Chibi-Robo, an adorable robot performing household tasks and aiming to become the best Chibi-Robo in the world.</p>

You'll also need to keep an eye on your battery levels, which are essentially your health bar; failing to charge yourself up on a regular basis will result in the loss of half of your accumulated currency.</p>

<p>Since the release of the original game,&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo!&nbsp;</em>has spawned several sequels, with the latest being 2015's 3DS exclusive&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash</em>. Incidentally, that game, along with its predecessor&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo! Photo Finder</em>, is currently unavailable on any modern system.</p>

<p>It's one of several GameCube games to be available as part of a Switch Online membership on Switch 2, joining the likes of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>,&nbsp;<em>Soulcalibur II</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, among others. You'll need an Expansion Pack addon if you want to play it, though.</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo!&nbsp;</em>on Nintendo Switch Online 2 right here.</p>




<p><em>Chibi-Robo!&nbsp;</em>will be available on Nintendo Switch Online for Switch 2 players (but not original Switch players) on August 21st, so keep an eye out for it if you're a member.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fae Farm Updates and Online Services to End in September]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fae-farm-updates-ending-september</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fae-farm-updates-and-online-services-to-end-in-september.1268940/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Phoenix Labs has announced that&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>updates will be coming to an end in September, and that the game's online servers will be shutting down at the same time.</p>

<p>In an update on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2230110/Fae_Farm/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam page</a>, the studio says the game "will be going offline" on September 10th at 11:59pm Pacific (or around 2am the following day by Eastern time), and that there won't be any further updates for the game after that.</p>

<p>While&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>'s updates and online services will be coming to a close, Phoenix Labs has assured fans that the single-player offline version of the game will remain playable, so if you do own&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>and you're yet to get around to checking it out, you haven't missed your chance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fae-farm-updates-ending-farm.jpg?itok=Cm2kwdHq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fae-farm-updates-ending-farm.jpg?itok=bfK8-fcs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Updates for&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>are ending next month.</figcaption></figure><p>It doesn't seem as though the game is being delisted, either, so you should still be able to buy&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>if you don't already own it.</p>

<p>The end of&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>updates comes after Phoenix Labs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-developer-phoenix-labs-more-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off "the majority" of its staff</a> earlier this year, a move the studio referred to as "unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations" at the time.</p>

<p>That decision followed the release of an update for monster-hunting RPG&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>by the name of Awakening, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-awakening-update-apology" rel="nofollow">proved hugely unpopular with players</a> and caused the game's player base to dwindle. The failure of Awakening also led Phoenix Labs to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-shutting-down-in-may" rel="nofollow">shut down <i>Dauntless&nbsp;</i>in May</a>.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>has closed down and that updates for&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>are ending, it's not too difficult to extrapolate that Phoenix Labs itself might be about to close down. It certainly wouldn't be the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">only studio</a> to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/echtra-games-shut-down-torchlight-3" rel="nofollow">do so this year</a>, unfortunately.</p>




<p>If you've yet to check out&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>, you can pick it up right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2230110/Fae_Farm/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010439" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fae-farm/9N0QS2277QHF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fae-farm-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fae-farm-review-little-bit-of-magic" rel="nofollow">read our review right here</a>.</p>
