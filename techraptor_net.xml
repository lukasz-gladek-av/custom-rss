            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-generation-zero-update-last<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Systemic Reaction has announced that the next major&nbsp;<em>Generation Zero&nbsp;</em>update will serve as the game's final major content drop.</p>

<p>The Showdown Update currently doesn't have a release date, but Systemic Reaction describes it as&nbsp;<em>Generation Zero</em>'s "last hurrah", promising that it will conclude the story arc that's been running throughout the game's "main missions and in-game lore".</p>

<p>The update will take you to "a new area that you haven't been to before", and Systemic Reaction is promising that while it's not quite as big as some of the game's other areas, it will give the studio "the space needed to tell the last part of our story".</p>

<p>As well as the story coming to a head, Systemic Reaction is also promising that the update will add new Experimental weapons, and it'll also remove the skill point cap, allowing you to "unlock all skill upgrades and complete the endgame experience".</p>

<p>New cosmetics are also on the way, as well as a host of quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes that are the bread and butter of any self-respecting game update.</p>

<p>Although you won't need&nbsp;<em>Generation Zero</em>'s&nbsp;<em>FNIX Rising&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alpine Unrest&nbsp;</em>expansions to enjoy the Showdown Update, Systemic Reaction does recommend them for "more context".</p>

<p>The game launched in 2019 and received numerous updates over the course of its life, adding features like a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/open-world-shooter-generation-zero-is-getting-photo-mode-next-week">photo mode</a>, destructible <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/generation-zero-update-lets-you-storm-fully-destructible-bases">bases</a>, and even a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/generation-zero-companion-update">cute little robot friend</a> to keep you company on your travels.</p>

<p>You can pick up&nbsp;<em>Generation Zero&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/704270/Generation_Zero/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/generation-zero/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/generation-zero/C20WW4W29FQ1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and it's also playable on current-gen consoles through backwards compatibility. The game will remain online, so even though it won't be getting more updates, it'll still be playable.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-outlaws-gets-new-creative-director-for-future-updates.1027995/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-new-creative-director<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced that&nbsp;it has appointed a new&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>creative director, and he'll be helming what will be the game's biggest update yet.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/7n2akTSlEV3Wk1aRRwONFZ/star-wars-outlaws-dev-update-1-pushing-into-hyperdrive" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a blog post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>website, Drew Rechner will be stepping up to the plate as the game's new creative director. Whether previous directors Julian Gerighty and Mathias Karlson will still be playing a role in the game's ongoing development remains to be seen.</p>

<p>In the blog post, Rechner says he's identified "three key areas" in which he and the team would like to improve&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, namely combat, stealth, and character control.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-creative-director-new-combat.jpg?itok=G116zB68 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-creative-director-new-combat.jpg?itok=YZ6CPU3O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft still wants to improve&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>across the board, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to combat, Rechner says the studio is looking to add "more depth and excitement to the experience" in order to further reward players' "tactics and precision".</p>

<p>When it comes to stealth, the plan is to improve the "readability and consistency of enemy detection" and to provide more "choice" in how you want to approach encounters.</p>

<p>Finally, character control improvements will apparently involve "improving the reliability of cover, increasing the responsiveness of climbing and crouching, and generally improving the consistency of the controls".</p>

<p>These are areas in which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-update-112">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>updates have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-update-130-stealth-speeder">sought to make improvements</a> as well, particularly in the case of stealth, but Rechner says the forthcoming update 1.4 will be&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>' "biggest yet" when it lands on November 21st.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, it's an open-world action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft and set, believe it or not, in the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>universe.</p>

<p>You play scoundrel Kay Vess, who must wheel and deal her way through the underworld's crime syndicates as she plans the heist of a lifetime. The game mixes shooter-style combat, stealth, and open-world exploration.</p>

<p>Despite the popularity of its IP,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february">underperformed for Ubisoft financially</a>, leading to the company rethinking some of its strategies; Ubisoft games will be released on Steam on day one from now on, and the company is also dropping the season pass model for future releases.</p>

<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/star-wars/outlaws" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also coming to Steam on November 21st, the same day the next update arrives.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-souls-of-frozen-frontier-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>has received a brand new update, and it's being described by developer and publisher Keen Games as the game's biggest update yet.</p>

<p>The Souls of the Frozen Frontier update follows on from other major content drops like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/enshrouded-melodies-of-mire-update">Melodies of the Mire</a> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-major-enshrouded-update-hollow-halls">Hollow Halls</a>, and it's seemingly on a similar scale, introducing a whole new biome, a new dynamic weather system, and more.</p>

<p>First up, the Albaneve Summits, a "breathtaking new mountain region", are now yours for the exploring. They're packed with "fresh challenges, discoveries, and opportunities", according to Keen Games, so you should have plenty to keep you busy.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/enshrouded-souls-of-the-frozen-frontier-update-snow.jpg?itok=m-ss7dI_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/enshrouded-souls-of-the-frozen-frontier-update-snow.jpg?itok=msiYLG7J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Enshrouded</em>'s new update has a whole new biome for you to explore.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the new biome, you can also look forward to a brand new dynamic weather system that sees weather patterns change as you explore. The higher you go, the more snow and cold you'll encounter, and you'll need to accommodate that change with food and clothing.</p>

<p>You can also now tame non-hostile animals and take them back to your base, and just in case you're wondering, it is possible to pet non-hostile animals as well. That alone should be reason enough to head back into&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>.</p>

<p>The game's level cap has been increased to 35, and new crafting resources have been added as part of the new biome's appearance, along with new crafting stations and new armor sets.</p>

<p>In short, there's lots to discover as part of the&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>Souls of the Frozen Frontier update. You can read the full list of changes (which, as you'd expect from a large update like this, is extensive) <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203620/view/4461471496628338725" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>




<p>In case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafting game which sees you exploring a vast world, gathering resources to craft a base, and venturing into dangerous mist in order to collect powerful rewards from dangerous enemies.</p>

<p>The game is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1203620/Enshrouded/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and if you want to know what we think of this ambitious survival-crafter, you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/enshrouded-final-preview-survival-progression-at-its-finest">check out our preview here</a>.</p>
