According to staff at the studio, Wildlight layoffs have happened following <em>Highguard</em>'s release.</p><p>Level designer Alex Graner was the first to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/alex-graner-a37262114_alex-graners-resume-activity-7427480816940892161-hmDh/" rel="nofollow">post on LinkedIn</a>, sharing the following:</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;Unfortunately, along with most of the team at Wildlight, I was laid off today.</p><p>This one really stings as there was a lot of unreleased content I was really looking forward to that I and others designed for Highguard.</p><p>However, I'm excited for my next adventure. If your team or anyone you know needs an experienced Level Designer, hit me up!</p></blockquote><p>This comes after <em>Highguard</em> was a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-game-awards-2025-recap" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7f71e644-2289-45c0-a1c9-dc56c3797e8a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">high profile announcement at The Game Awards </a>before releasing on January 30th to middling Steam user counts. Since release it has released several videos, and updates, including a 5v5 mode which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/highguards-5v5-experiment-is-now-a-permanent-game-mode/1100-6537863/" rel="nofollow">quickly made permanent</a>, and was generally the preferred mode to play the game.&nbsp;</p><p>It is the latest in the bloodbath of developer layoffs, following <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/2xko-layoffs-riot" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="156c400e-add5-4e40-ad10-9f36c14e77e9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Riot Games laying off </a>many of the staff on its fighting game <em>2XKO</em>, various layoffs from Ubisoft, and a couple of very tough years in the industry. Presumably, the team at Wildlight was hoping for their release of <em>Highguard</em> to more closely mirror the success of <em>Apex Legends</em>, which they were attempting to emulate in release pattern, including initially p<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/highguard-was-planned-as-a-shadow-drop-but-geoff-keighley-had-another-idea/1100-6537655/" rel="nofollow">lanning to shadowdrop</a> the game and hopefully ride a wave of word of mouth to success.</p><p>We have reached out to Wildlight Entertainment, but they didn't immediately reply.
