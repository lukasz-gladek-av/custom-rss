            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netmarble has announced the release date for upcoming anime action RPG&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive</em>, which, contrary to what you might think from the title, is not the same game as mobile gacha RPG&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise</em>.</p>

<p>First revealed during the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">Xbox showcase back in June</a>,&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on PC on November 17th, with a current-gen console version due to follow sometime next year (although not for Switch 2, unfortunately).</p>

<p>Despite what the name might have you believe,&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</em>has nothing to do with&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise</em>; Netmarble says it's an "entirely different game, developed as an independent project by a separate team".</p>

<p>You'll also be able to use boss materials in order to craft weapons, so there won't be any kind of gacha mechanic for obtaining those materials or for crafting the gear you can get from them either, it seems.</p>

<p>You can also expect sharper controls than&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise</em>, as well as higher-fidelity backgrounds that Kim Gwang-Hoon says will "bridge the gap between comic and realism". The backgrounds are still based on the original&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling&nbsp;</em>webtoon, though, so you'll recognize them if you're a fan.</p>

<p>If you want to see&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</em>in action, then you can check out Netmarble's new release date trailer for the game right here.</p>




<p><em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</em>is set to launch on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2373990/Solo_Leveling_ARISE_OVERDRIVE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/solo-leveling-arise-overdrive/9MVHCQ7CJX01" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox app</a> on November 17th. A version of the game is also due for release on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in 2026, so stay tuned for more on that.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Crystal Dynamics Hit by Layoffs, Tomb Raider "Unaffected"]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>studio Crystal Dynamics has announced that it's been hit by layoffs, but the developer says that work on the next game in the aforementioned action-adventure series remains "unaffected".</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on LinkedIn, Crystal Dynamics says it has "made the very difficult decision to part ways with a number of [its] talented colleagues", blaming "evolving business conditions" for the decision. The studio stops short of revealing how many employees have been let go.</p>

<p>Crystal Dynamics goes on to say that while its decision was not "made lightly", it was "necessary...to ensure the long-term health of [the] studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-crystal-dynamics-layoffs.jpg?itok=a9edtL6I 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-crystal-dynamics-layoffs.jpg?itok=9WvQuSUE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Crystal Dynamics has been hit by layoffs, but&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>is "unaffected", the studio says.</figcaption></figure><p>In closing, Crystal Dynamics thanks its "teams, players, and partners" for helping it to "build a creative, sustainable, and resilient tomorrow". That, the studio says, "includes the future of&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>, which remains unaffected" by the layoffs.</p>

<p>It's been five years since Crystal Dynamics' last original game, namely 2020's&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Avengers</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvels-avengers-ending-development-support" rel="nofollow">ended service in January 2023</a>. Other than that, the studio has also worked alongside Aspyr on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-i-ii-iii-remastered" rel="nofollow">remasters</a> of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-announced" rel="nofollow">first six</a>&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>games and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/soul-reaver-remasters-leaked-psn" rel="nofollow">first two titles</a> in the&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver&nbsp;</em>sub-series.</p>

<p>Technically speaking, a new game in the&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series is in development, although Crystal Dynamics and publisher Amazon Games have revealed nothing about the new project yet. It's likely to be a while before we learn exactly what direction the studios intend to take with the property in future.</p>

<p>Still, even without a flagship game announcement, the&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>franchise remains active. Last year, an animated series by the name of&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft&nbsp;</em>debuted on Netflix, and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-live-action-series" rel="nofollow">live-action series is also in the works</a>.</p>




<p>Crystal Dynamics' decision to lay off employees may well be connected to the fact that in July, Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">canceled its&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot</a>, on which Crystal Dynamics was serving as a co-development studio alongside The Initiative.</p>
