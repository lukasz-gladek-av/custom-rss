            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-best-selling-japan<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>have become the series' best-selling games of all time in Japan, beating out the previous record-holder for the first time in decades.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202411/24646" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Famitsu report</a> (for which we're using machine translation),&nbsp;<em>Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>have sold over 8.3 million copies between them in Japan, which means they've officially sold more than the original&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Red and Green&nbsp;</em>(since Japan's game was&nbsp;<em>Green&nbsp;</em>rather than&nbsp;<em>Blue</em>).</p>

<p>Until this moment, those original games held the record for Japan's best-selling&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games, and given just how much of a phenomenon&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>was when it first arrived, that's no mean feat.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-sales-record-coalossal.jpg?itok=klUuspfK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-sales-record-coalossal.jpg?itok=aE4MZqtO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>have become the best-selling games in the series in Japan.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that these sales figures do only apply to Japan, so&nbsp;<em>Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>may well not be the best-selling&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games elsewhere in the world.</p>

<p>However, given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-has-sold-13936-million-units-super-mario-bros-wonder-sold-1196-million" rel="nofollow">huge success of the Nintendo Switch</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-25-million-players-matching-pokemon-scarlet-violet" rel="nofollow">sky-high sales numbers</a> of&nbsp;<em>Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>around the world, I wouldn't be surprised if the newest games were also the best-selling in other regions.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, mainline <i>Pokemon&nbsp;</i>games are released every three years or so, and since&nbsp;<em>Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>launched in 2022, we can perhaps expect an announcement regarding the next major&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games soon.</p>

<p>It's likely, though, that Nintendo will wait until the successor to the Switch is announced. We're expecting news on that front <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">sometime before April 2025</a>, so the new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games may well be revealed alongside the console.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-sales-record-venonat.jpg?itok=LgYrtUII 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-sales-record-venonat.jpg?itok=cvyror6x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games could be announced before the fiscal year is out.</figcaption></figure><p>That announcement seems especially likely to coincide with the Switch 2's given that&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>met with criticism at launch regarding their lackluster performance on Switch.</p>

<p>They're not the only games in that particular firing line, either. It seems that devs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-onl-2024-switch" rel="nofollow">may be avoiding releasing games</a> on the Switch owing to its aging internals, so a successor would presumably improve things on that front, not just for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>but across the board.</p>

<p>Still, since it's been confirmed that the Nintendo Switch 2 (or whatever the console ends up being called) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-backwards-compatible" rel="nofollow">will be backwards compatible</a>, perhaps there'll be some sort of performance boost for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>on that front. We can but hope.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em><a href="https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-gb/buy/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now on Nintendo Switch</a>. A DLC pack,&nbsp;<em>The Treasure of Area Zero</em>, which comprises two extra story episodes, is also available now.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kunitsu-gami-path-of-goddess-underperformed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-admits-new-ip-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-underperformed.1038447/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kunitsu-gami-path-of-goddess-underperformed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has admitted that&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>, an action-tower defense hybrid that also represents a foray into new IP for the studio, underperformed compared to its expectations.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcoms-new-ip-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-missed-sales-targets-despite-high-reviews/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a> (which, in turn, cites a Japanese <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/396057" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GameBiz report</a>),&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami&nbsp;</em>received strong reviews from both critics and players, but failed to translate those reviews into unit sales.</p>

<p>Capcom blames this deficiency on "insufficient marketing and the failure to generate buzz prior to release", as Automaton says. In essence, not enough was done to let people know what exactly&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami&nbsp;</em>was before release, and that's never going to help unit sales.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-capcom-tower-defense.jpg?itok=209PJ2rg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-capcom-tower-defense.jpg?itok=zgTImkld 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess&nbsp;</em>didn't sell quite as well as Capcom hoped for.</figcaption></figure><p>The studio certainly isn't wrong when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>' critical performance. The game has an 82 critic average on <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/16948/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OpenCritic</a>, with 90% of critics recommending it, and it enjoys scores in the 80-85 range across <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-series-x" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all</a> three current-gen&nbsp;<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">platforms</a> on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/critic-reviews/?platform=pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Metacritic</a> as well.</p>

<p>Users also seem to have broadly positive opinions about the game. It currently has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510710/KunitsuGami_Path_of_the_Goddess/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">91% Very Positive rating on Steam</a> across 1,149 reviews (at time of writing), so it's clear that those who are playing&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami&nbsp;</em>are enjoying it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it's often the case that critically-acclaimed games that exist within a particular niche can't drum up sales.&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess&nbsp;</em>might be a tough sell for a lot of players; it's an action-tower defense hybrid, and it's not easy to see exactly what kind of game it is from screenshots, either.</p>

<p>Still, in the GameBiz report (for which we're using machine translation), Capcom says it intends to continue promoting&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami&nbsp;</em>in order to achieve its initial sales target, although it wasn't clear about what that target actually is.</p>




<p>Although sales of&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess&nbsp;</em>were apparently lackluster, Capcom says games like&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Ace Attorney Investigations Collection&nbsp;</em>have been selling as expected.</p>

<p>Additionally, the company is currently gearing up for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">release of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>in February</a>, and if its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">beta performance</a> is anything to go by, that game is likely to provide a massive boost to Capcom's finances when it's released.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Lego Horizon Playset Announced Following Lego Horizon Adventures Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-lego-horizon-adventures-playset</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-lego-horizon-playset-announced-following-lego-horizon-adventures-launch.1038402/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-lego-horizon-adventures-playset<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lego, Guerrilla, and Studio Gobo have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures&nbsp;</em>playset to commemorate the release of the game of the same name.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/18/celebrating-the-lego-horizon-adventures-launch-with-a-brand-new-lego-set/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new PlayStation Blog post</a>, the "<em>Lego Horizon Adventures&nbsp;</em>Aloy &amp; Varl vs. Shell-walker &amp; Sawtooth Playset" (try saying that one fast ten times) will come with 768 Lego pieces and will feature Aloy, Varl, and two of the series' most iconic creatures.</p>

<p>Aloy comes complete with her signature bow, while Varl carries his spear. They've both got pretty confident expressions on their faces; these are very much the&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures&nbsp;</em>versions of the characters rather than those from the original games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lego-horizon-adventures-playset-pieces.jpg?itok=i2O88y79 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lego-horizon-adventures-playset-pieces.jpg?itok=LG9sKv9p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures&nbsp;</em>playset packs in several iconic&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>elements.</figcaption></figure><p>The Shell-walker and Sawtooth, which are the machines you'll find in this new Lego playset, are both fully jointed, with the Shell-walker coming complete with "posable legs and arms, opening claws and a detachable cargo pod and energy shield".</p>

<p>The Sawtooth, meanwhile, is fully articulated, and has "opening jaws, a swivelling torso, and a posable neck, head and legs". These might be Lego creatures, but they're no less formidable as a result.</p>

<p>You'll be able to grab the new&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures&nbsp;</em>playset starting from March 1st, but pre-orders are already open <a href="http://lego.com/product/Aloy-Varl-vs-Shell-Walker-Sawtooth-77037" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via Lego.com</a> if you know that you're going to be picking this one up. The set costs £39.99 or your local equivalent.</p>




<p>This new playset has been released to coincide with the launch of&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em>, a new Lego adventure game set within the world of Guerrilla's&nbsp;<em>Horizon&nbsp;</em>games.</p>

<p>Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-horizon-adventures-release-date" rel="nofollow">on November 14th</a>, the game's narrative serves as a retelling of&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, albeit with significantly less doom and gloom and significantly more comedy Lego pratfalls.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Lego Horizon Adventures&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2428810/LEGO_Horizon_Adventures/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/lego-horizon-adventures/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/lego-horizon-adventures-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.
