<p>In a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250613.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Capcom reveals that&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry 5&nbsp;</em>sales have hit the 10 million mark. As usual when it comes to sales figures, these numbers apply across all platforms on which the game is available, and they apply to both physical and digital sales as well.</p>

<p>As for the reason behind the game's strong sales performance, Capcom cites its "exceptional gameplay experience", as well as "efforts to enhance brand awareness by leveraging the title beyond the scope of video games".</p>

According to the studio,&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>attracted over 5.3 million views in its first week, as well as garnering critical acclaim worldwide. The show has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-devil-may-cry-renewed-second-season" rel="nofollow">already been renewed for a second season</a>.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry 5</em>, it is, as the name suggests, the fifth mainline installment in the&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>series, which began on the PlayStation 2 in 2001.</p>

<p>At time of writing, it's the latest mainline entry in the franchise, and it features three core playable characters across its campaign: series mainstay Dante,&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry 4&nbsp;</em>newcomer Nero, and V, a mysterious individual with the ability to command monsters.</p>

<p>In a post-launch update, Capcom also added Dante's brother Vergil to the mix as another playable character; it's possible to play as him throughout&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry 5</em>'s campaign, as well as its Bloody Palace and The Void modes.</p>
