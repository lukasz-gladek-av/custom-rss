            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-program-march-3rd-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has announced that a special&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>broadcast is set to air next week, bringing more news about the cult JRPG franchise.</p>

<p>In a rather brief <a href="https://x.com/Konami/status/1894938037122957766" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Konami says that the broadcast, which will air on March 3rd at 3pm Pacific (that's 6pm Eastern), will bring you "all the latest news on&nbsp;<em>Suikoden</em>".</p>

<p>That's a particularly interesting way of wording it, because we already know the release date for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Suikoden II&nbsp;</em>remasters, so presumably, the broadcast will contain some new information about the future of the series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suikoden-special-program-remaster.jpg?itok=pZdUOGOa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suikoden-special-program-remaster.jpg?itok=q7rTwVNf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>news could be on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>If Konami does have more to reveal about the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>franchise, I'd put my money on potential remasters for the third, fourth, and fifth games in the series.&nbsp;<em>Suikoden V</em>, in particular, is well-liked by many fans, although the other two were perhaps a little more cautiously received.</p>

<p>I think more remasters are significantly more likely than a brand new game in the franchise, although Konami must be pretty confident in&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>if it's doing more than just the upcoming remasters of the first two games.</p>

<p>News of the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>broadcast comes as Konami revisits some of its biggest franchises in the form of remasters and remakes. Last year, for instance, the company worked with Bloober Team for the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake, which has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">amassed more than two million sales</a> around the world so far.</p>

<p>The studio is also gearing up for the release of&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, a remake of the 2004 stealth-action classic, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">in August</a>. The game will feature a visual overhaul thanks to the magic of Unreal Engine 5, as well as updated gameplay mechanics.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>itself, the snappily-titled&nbsp;<em>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars&nbsp;</em>collection is due to launch next week.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, the collection remasters the first two games in the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>series, which are connected by a number of recurring characters and narrative elements. The remasters will feature updated visuals, new animations, and extra quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>remasters when they land on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1932640/Suikoden_III_HD_Remaster_Gate_Rune_and_Dunan_Unification_Wars/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10004292" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/suikoden-iii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars-pre-order-bonus/9P9FM62WZXR2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/suikoden-i-and-ii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on March 6th.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>broadcast, meanwhile, is set for March 3rd, and you can watch it via Konami's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KONAMI573ch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>. The link in Konami's post on X leads to the Japanese channel, but the post itself is in English, so it's not clear whether the show will air in English or just in Japanese.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-financials-2024-revenue-falls<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros. has released its financial summary for both the fourth quarter of 2024 and the year as a whole, and it probably won't surprise you to learn that it's been a pretty bad year for the media giant's gaming wing.</p>

<p>In its earnings <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_earnings/2024/q4/earnings-result/WBD-4Q24-Earnings-Release.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">release</a>, Warner Bros. says its gaming division's revenue dropped by 29% in Q4 when compared to the previous year's quarter, which the studio puts down to the "better performance" of big sellers&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">Hogwarts Legacy</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-sales" rel="nofollow">Mortal Kombat 1</a>&nbsp;</em>last year.</p>

<p>This is likely at least one of the figures that caused Warner Bros. to&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games" rel="nofollow">close three of its studios recently</a>, namely Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and WB San Diego. They're not mentioned in the financial report, but that could just be because the report covers the period ending December 31st last year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warner-bros-financials-2024-monolith.jpg?itok=b5odTwrZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warner-bros-financials-2024-monolith.jpg?itok=rIJTz3Ba 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Warner Bros. recently closed&nbsp;<em>Middle-earth: Shadow of War&nbsp;</em>developer Monolith, as well as two other studios.</figcaption></figure><p>The weak performance of two major Warner Bros. games last year, namely superhero live-service looter-shooter&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win" rel="nofollow">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>&nbsp;</em>and crossover fighter&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow"><em>MultiVersus</em></a>, both contributed to WB Games' weak year.</p>

<p>Both games performed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024" rel="nofollow">so poorly</a> that they were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-updates-ending-season-5-offline" rel="nofollow">shut down</a> before being on general release for a year (although&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>technically spent some time in a sort of beta-Early Access limbo between mid-2022 and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-open-beta-will-close-in-june-full-release-coming-in-early-2024" rel="nofollow">spring 2023</a>).</p>

<p>Back in January, it was revealed that Warner Bros. gaming head David Haddad <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-david-haddad-stepping-down" rel="nofollow">would step down</a> after over a decade with the company. The reason for his departure wasn't officially announced, but I can't imagine&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>' failures had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>As for what the future holds for Warner Bros., the company says it's planning to refocus on "proven IP" like&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter</em>,&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones</em>,&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat</em>, and the wider DC universe, including "top tier characters like&nbsp;<em>Batman</em>".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warner-bros-financials-2024-batman.jpg?itok=64LAPPnr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warner-bros-financials-2024-batman.jpg?itok=wkA8H8fr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Warner Bros. says it wants to refocus its efforts on proven IP like&nbsp;<em>Batman</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>To that end, it was recently revealed that DC Studios boss James Gunn <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dc-boss-in-talks-with-rocksteady-and-netherrealm-to-develop-dc-universe-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">has been talking</a> to Warner Bros. studios Rocksteady and NetherRealm to develop DC games, although it's not clear which games those might be.</p>

<p>Given that the closure of Monolith also includes the cancellation of that studio's&nbsp;<em>Wonder Woman&nbsp;</em>game, though, I wouldn't hold your breath for anything but a new game starring Batman or one of his extended family. Stay tuned for more.</p>
