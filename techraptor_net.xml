            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>War Thunder&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Enlisted&nbsp;</em>studio Gaijin Entertainment has announced EdenSpark, a game creation tool that the company says will "let anyone make games for consoles and share them with the gaming community".</p>

<p>According to a press release, EdenSpark will enter closed beta testing in November, and Gaijin is eyeing a full release sometime next year. The tool aims to give developers access to console development "without a registered company or costly legal paperwork".</p>

<p>Despite its focus on console development, EdenSpark won't launch with full console support; that will be added in fall next year, while the closed beta will give you the opportunity to access "a number of game prototypes". You'll also be able to "upload personal projects" during this time.</p>

<p>EdenSpark's generative AI assistant will be able to create "art, sound, and gameplay logic" for you, and Gaijin even says it can "build worlds using plain prompts". If you don't want to bother with that side of things, you can still "dive deep into code" if you wish.</p>

<p>The idea behind EdenSpark is that you'll retain full ownership over any game you make using the tool; you can either keep your creations within EdenSpark's community or release them to the world, but either way, they'll be entirely yours to do with as you please.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer for EdenSpark right here. Honestly, I'm very much not sold on the slightly ghoulish AI voiceover; if it's not AI, then whoever performed it is definitely aiming for that uncanny, flat tone, and I don't like it either way. Still, here's the trailer!</p>




<p>Like it or not, generative AI usage is on the rise in the gaming industry. During the most recent Steam Next Fest, more than 500 demos available on the platform <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/over-500-steam-next-demos-disclosed-generative-ai-usage" rel="nofollow">disclosed their usage of gen AI</a>, and there may well have been many more that didn't, despite Valve's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-explains-its-rules-on-ai-content-in-steam-games" rel="nofollow">policies</a>.</p>

<p>Gaijin doesn't seem to be accepting closed beta applications for EdenSpark yet, but if you want to keep up with the tool's progress, you can visit the official website <a href="https://edenspark.io/en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Kenny Sun and publisher Devolver Digital have announced that their indie roguelite&nbsp;<em>Ball x Pit</em>, which marries roguelite-style progression with&nbsp;<em>Breakout</em>-esque ball-based chaos, has hit a big sales milestone.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Ball x Pit&nbsp;</em>has hit 300,000 sales just five days after its initial release. As is usually the case, that figure is inclusive of all the platforms on which the game is available, so that's PC, current-gen consoles, and the Switch (with a Switch 2 port on the way later in 2025).</p>

<p>It comes after&nbsp;<em>Ball x Pit&nbsp;</em>managed to rack up 100,000 sales for itself in its first 24 hours, which further makes it clear that there's definitely an audience for Sun and Devolver Digital's brand of spherical mayhem. I should know - I'm <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ball-x-pit-review-bubble-bobble-toil-and-trouble" rel="nofollow">part of that audience</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ball-x-pit-sales-300k-grasslands.jpg?itok=bXAqAI2T 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ball-x-pit-sales-300k-grasslands.jpg?itok=FALsOArz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ball x Pit&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a major milestone.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Ball x Pit</em>, it's a roguelite that combines&nbsp;<em>Breakout</em>-style ball-batting gameplay with&nbsp;<em>Survivors</em>-esque bullet heaven elements, roguelite progression, and base-building. Believe it or not, the combination works pretty well.</p>

<p>The game features a number of different characters, all of whom bring their own gameplay quirks; one character is actually two people who fire their balls in opposing directions, for instance, while another transforms the gameplay into a turn-based tactical affair.</p>

<p>Naturally,&nbsp;<em>Ball x Pit&nbsp;</em>also has lots of different ball types for you to discover, many of which synergize in ways that provide that sought-after roguelite feeling of "should I really be allowed to do this?".</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer for&nbsp;<em>Ball x Pit</em>, which should give you a good sense of the kind of manic visual noise you can expect if you decide to give this one a try (and I heartily recommend that you do), right here.</p>
