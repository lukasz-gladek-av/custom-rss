<p>Other Take-Two Switch 2 releases, like upcoming sports titles <em>PGA Tour 2K25 </em>and <em>WWE 2K26</em>, are unaffected, of course, but <em>Borderlands 4 </em>probably isn't going to be making an appearance on the console anytime soon.</p><p>Of course, given the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-pc-performance-top-priority" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5688e820-72a9-4399-b5b3-7c667ee289da" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">well-documented performance woes</a> on PC (whatever <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/randy-pitchford-borderlands-4-performance-comments" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ee451f31-ff9e-4b56-9889-1f0581a00b2d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Gearbox head Randy Pitchford might say</a>), it's not really a surprise that Take-Two doesn't seem to have been able to arrive at a satisfactory Switch 2 port for <em>Borderlands 4</em>.</p><p>This news was revealed alongside Take-Two's quarterly earnings report for the third quarter of the fiscal year, in which the company revealed its net bookings have grown by 28% compared to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gta-6-still-on-track-for-fall" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="181a935f-1c61-410f-b3d0-545f99839ba0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">same period last year</a>.</p><p>Back then, CEO Strauss Zelnick was confident that upcoming juggernaut <em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>would arrive in a timely fashion in fall 2025, but as we now know, that proved to be a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-delay" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fbc88268-1772-45bc-9881-7e2e1cd1ca6d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">rather optimistic estimate</a> for the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-november-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e57d7053-b3ca-42ed-afdb-4ef5c5958b99" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">release date</a>.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Despite that, Take-Two reaffirms <em>GTA 6</em>'s current release date of November 19th in its earnings release, as well as confirming that <em>Grand Theft Auto 5 </em>has now sold over 225 million copies across all platforms.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you're a fan of the Game Boy, then it's time to fire up your Switch or Switch 2, because two more titles from the classic handheld have been added to the Nintendo Switch Online library.</p><p>Game Boy games are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-november-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="51c81ac8-6d32-47dd-add7-67bb3b2780c3" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">added</a> to the Switch's subscription-based retro lineup on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-game-boy-may-2025" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8c715e7b-2994-4442-80d7-048cd1a0d0ba" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">semi-regular basis</a>, and now, it's the turn of two pretty major releases for the system, namely puzzler <em>Yoshi </em>and platformer <em>Balloon Kid</em>.</p><p>On the surface, <em>Yoshi </em>shares similarities with games like <em>Dr. Mario </em>and <em>Tetris</em>, but things work a little differently here; your goal is to eliminate pairs of enemies as they fall, and you can earn bonus points by combining falling eggshell halves with monster stacks as well.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Yoshi </em>is one of two Game Boy games that have joined Nintendo Switch Online.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The NES version of <em>Yoshi </em>launched as part of the inaugural Switch Online haul <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-revealed-includes-20-nes-games-at-launch" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4fc0ced9-ef21-4d57-8fc2-f219e6f3c917" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back in September 2018</a>, but it's nice to be able to play this alternate edition, even if it is a little more basic than even its NES counterpart.</p><p>Your other Game Boy game joining Switch Online today is <em>Balloon Kid</em>, which was originally released back in October 1990. Unlike <em>Yoshi</em>, this one's a bona fide Game Boy exclusive (although it is a sequel to <em>Balloon Fight</em>, which was a NES title).</p><p><em>Balloon Kid </em>tasks you with completing a series of scrolling stages by using <em>Balloon Fight</em>'s characteristic arm-flapping controls, as well as more conventional platforming if you're on the ground.</p><p>There's also a multiplayer mode in the game that plays more similarly to <em>Balloon Fight</em>, although it still comes complete with its own unique style. You can check out a trailer for both titles here.</p>
<p>Both <em>Yoshi </em>and <em>Balloon Kid </em>are available to check out right now on Nintendo Switch Online, along with a host of other retro titles. It'll <a href="https://ec.nintendo.com/US/en/membership/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">cost you $3.99 a month</a>, although three-monthly and yearly plans are also available if you'd prefer.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
