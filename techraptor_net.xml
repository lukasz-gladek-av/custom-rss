            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-star-wars-crossover-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic Games is releasing a new&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Star Wars&nbsp;</em>crossover just in time for the May 4th celebrations, and it's bringing new map areas for you to explore, new character skins, and more.</p>

<p>This won't be&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s first&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>crossover; the two have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-fortnite-may-2024" rel="nofollow">clashed lightsabers</a> on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-star-wars" rel="nofollow">number</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-comes-with-fortnite-skin" rel="nofollow">prior occasions</a>, but this one's got some all-new stuff for you to enjoy. First up, you'll find four new&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>-themed map areas to explore: the First Order Base, the Outpost Enclave, the Resistance Base, and Vader Samurai's Solitude, a modified version of the Shogun's Solitude area.</p>

<p>The new lightsaber weapon should give you new opportunities to get up close and personal with your enemies, although you'll have to train in the Force to use one (or loot one off a dead player, of course).</p>

<p>Others include Mace Windu, a Mandalorian you can customize, and General Grievous, and any&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>event that allows you to play as General Grievous is automatically above criticism. I don't make the rules.</p>

<p>Excitingly, this event also gives you the chance to pilot an Imperial TIE Fighter, as well as take part in a range of time-limited events that will drop as the month of May goes on.</p>

<p>It'll all culminate in the Death Star Sabotage event, a final showdown with Emperor Palpatine that takes place on June 7th. Let's see him "somehow return" from this one.</p>




<p>It's all go in the world of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>gaming right now. Recently, Respawn and Bit Reactor revealed&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Zero Company</em>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-zero-company-respawn-bit-reactor" rel="nofollow">turn-based tactics game</a> set during the dying days of the Clone Wars. It doesn't have a release date yet, though, unfortunately.</p>

<p>In addition, five classic games from the franchise's long and storied history were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-preservation-program-star-wars" rel="nofollow">recently added to GOG's Preservation Program</a>, by which the storefront swears to keep certain titles updated in perpetuity even if their developers or publishers haven't made the same commitment.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Star Wars&nbsp;</em>crossover event lands tomorrow, and you can read a full breakdown of what to expect from the event <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/strap-in-starfighter-star-wars-is-taking-over-in-fortnite-galactic-battle?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Hardware and Software Prices Going Up Due to "Market Conditions"]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-hardware-and-software-prices-going-up-due-to-market-conditions.1178712/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-prices-raised-hardware-software<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has announced that it's raising the prices of both of its consoles currently on the market, as well as "some" of its upcoming first-party games, in response to "market conditions".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website, Xbox says the changes have been made due to the aforementioned conditions, as well as the "rising cost of development". From today, you'll be paying $550 for a digital Xbox Series X and $600 for the version with a disc drive, while the Xbox Series S will set you back $380 and $430 for the 512GB and 1TB models, respectively.</p>

<p>In terms of software prices, Xbox will be raising the price of some of its games to $80 "starting this holiday season", although Xbox doesn't specify which games this will apply to.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-xbox-price-increases.jpg?itok=09JB4ePR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-xbox-price-increases.jpg?itok=KIg3cQmZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some upcoming Xbox Studios games will cost $80, although Xbox hasn't stated which ones yet.</figcaption></figure><p>Pricing for other regions, including the <a href="https://cms-assets.xboxservices.com/assets/39/48/394840bc-a7da-4c52-bd06-c8b5d19240dc.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">UK</a> and <a href="https://cms-assets.xboxservices.com/assets/40/a2/40a23424-36f7-43ee-a1b1-418ce55d17a4.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Europe</a>, will also be changing, so bear that in mind if you're planning to pick up a new Xbox console this year. Judging by the way Xbox hardware <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-hardware-revenue-continues-to-tumble-but-gaming-revenue-is-up-microsoft-reports" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sales are going</a>, though, there's a pretty good chance you're not.</p>

<p>Microsoft isn't the first company to announce that some of its games will get this kind of price jump. When the Nintendo Switch 2 was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">revealed last month</a>, Nintendo announced that certain first-party games, including launch title&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, will cost $80, although not every first-party Nintendo game will set you back that much;&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>, for instance, will retail for $70.</p>

<p>Given that both Nintendo and Microsoft have taken these steps, and that Sony also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-prices-rising-europe-uk-australia-new-zealand" rel="nofollow">raised the prices of the PS5</a> in certain territories recently, it's probably only a matter of time before some PS5 games retail for $80 as well.</p>

<p>Of course, in the background of all of this are the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-reduces-staff-and-pauses-board-game-development-amid-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow">tariffs</a> recently introduced by President Donald Trump. While many countries have received a 90-day reprieve from said tariffs, China, which is a manufacturing hub for much of the gaming world, is a notable exception from said reprieves.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-xbox-price-increases.jpg?itok=eAMtl019 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-xbox-price-increases.jpg?itok=kdsZOUDb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The tariffs are hitting other studios as well as Microsoft.</figcaption></figure><p>We'll have to wait and see how folks respond to Microsoft's pricing changes, but given the widespread criticism aimed at Nintendo for the same decision, I can't imagine this will go down well. Stay tuned for more.</p>
