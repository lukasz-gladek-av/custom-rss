            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's the original PlayStation's 30th anniversary today (for the US release, at the very least), and US sales analysis firm Circana has compiled a list of the brand's best-selling games since 1995 by way of celebration.</p>

<p>As always, we have the ever-reliable Mat Piscatella to thank for sharing this data on social media platform <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lyftys4rhk2u" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, and the list he's compiled is an interesting one, although you probably won't be too surprised by a lot of the names you see.</p>

<p>Obviously, eternal moneyspinner&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto V&nbsp;</em>tops the chart; it is, after all, a release that spans three PlayStation <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-v-ps5-and-xbox-series-details-revealed" rel="nofollow">generations</a>, and given the massive popularity of&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>as a franchise (as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-v-has-sold-over-195-million-units-red-dead-redemption-2-at-61-million" rel="nofollow">previously-reported sales figures</a> for the game),&nbsp;<em>GTA V</em>'s presence probably won't shock you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grand-theft-auto-v-playstation-top-selling-games-30th-anniversary.jpg?itok=ndeqnTh8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grand-theft-auto-v-playstation-top-selling-games-30th-anniversary.jpg?itok=FsekQJV6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Surprise surprise,&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto V&nbsp;</em>is PlayStation's best-selling game of all time.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Piscatella's data, there are no games from the original PlayStation era on the top 20 list, and only three were released on the PlayStation 2. Two of those are&nbsp;<em>GTA&nbsp;</em>titles as well, namely&nbsp;<em>San Andreas&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Vice City</em>, while the third is&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock</em>.</p>

<p>All of the others are PlayStation 3 releases or later. In second place, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare" rel="nofollow">the 2019 version</a> of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em>, with third place going to&nbsp;another Rockstar game in the form of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/red-dead-redemption-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Red Dead Redemption II</em></a>.</p>

<p>Places four through six are occupied by&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>releases as well, and blocky sandbox hit&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/minecraft" rel="nofollow">Minecraft</a>&nbsp;</em>is in seventh. Rounding out the top ten are&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</em>, then the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>San Andreas&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero III</em>.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that all of this is based on dollar sales; the unit sales column looks a little different, but there still aren't any original PlayStation games on it, and even fewer PS2 games appear on the unit sales list.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/red-dead-redemption-ii-playstation-top-selling-games.jpg?itok=ezPXSg0o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/red-dead-redemption-ii-playstation-top-selling-games.jpg?itok=i8S4iXog 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rockstar makes several appearances on Circana's PlayStation best-seller list.</figcaption></figure><p>It also happens to be the Sega Dreamcast's 26th birthday today, and to celebrate, Piscatella has compiled <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lyfu44xius2u" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a list</a> of that platform's top 20 best-selling games in the US as well.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, when it comes to dollar sales,<i>&nbsp;Sonic Adventure&nbsp;</i>doesn't top the chart (although it does top the unit sales list). That honor goes to&nbsp;<em>NFL 2K</em>, with successor&nbsp;<em>NFL 2K1&nbsp;</em>taking second place (followed by&nbsp;<em>Sonic Adventure</em>, naturally).</p>

<p>The Dreamcast may be dead, but many of the franchises on Piscatella's list, including&nbsp;<em>Sonic</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shenmue-iii-enhanced-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Shenmue</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crazy-taxi-reboot-open-world-mmo" rel="nofollow">even&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi</em></a>, are still around today. Both lists are well worth a look if you want to take a trip down memory (card) lane.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Panzer Dragoon II Zwei: Remake Still Happening, Platforms Confirmed]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Panzer Dragoon II Zwei: Remake&nbsp;</em>publisher Forever Entertainment has reassured fans that the game is still very much in development, and that a demo will be playable for attendees at this year's Tokyo Game Show.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ForeverEntert/status/1965340667414184266" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on social media</a>, the studio revealed that those who visit the Rainy Frog Games booth will be able to check out a demo version of the remake, which, much like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/panzer-dragoon-remake-revealed-at-e3-2019-coming-to-switch-this-winter" rel="nofollow">the remake of the first game</a>, will sport "modern visuals and remastered music".</p>

<p>As for which platforms you'll be able to play&nbsp;<em>Panzer Dragoon II Zwei: Remake&nbsp;</em>on, Forever <a href="https://x.com/ForeverEntert/status/1965355010331709584" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> the game will be coming to PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch. The studio doesn't mention a native Switch 2 version, unfortunately.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei-remake-original.jpg?itok=0hcjxnTU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/panzer-dragoon-ii-zwei-remake-original.jpg?itok=7JvsQYcb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Forever Entertainment also handled publishing for the original&nbsp;<em>Panzer Dragoon: Remake</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Panzer Dragoon II Zwei: Remake&nbsp;</em>was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-two-panzer-dragoon-games-getting-remakes-starting-next-year" rel="nofollow">all the way back in late 2018</a>, along with a remake of its predecessor. That game was released in March 2020, but its sequel has been largely missing in action until now.</p>

<p>You'll be able to enjoy the remake either with the original controls or a new, updated control scheme, and you can also switch between the game's original soundtrack and its newly-arranged version, which was handled by legendary&nbsp;<em>Panzer Dragoon Saga&nbsp;</em>composer Saori Kobayashi.</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Panzer Dragoon II Zwei: Remake</em>'s re-emergence is bittersweet for me; I'm a massive&nbsp;<em>Panzer Dragoon Saga&nbsp;</em>fan, so you can imagine that this news almost feels like one tantalizing step closer to a potential remake of that game.</p>

<p>A remake it would have to be, too, and a ground-up one at that; director Yukio Futatsugi has claimed that publisher Sega has lost the source code for&nbsp;<em>Saga</em>, thus making a remake based on the original code impossible.</p>

Stay tuned for more on this.</p>
