            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-mod-support<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has announced that&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>mod support is on the way, although it doesn't look like console players will be able to take advantage of the feature (for now, at least).</p>

<p>Per an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1771300/view/514075305730637907" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the game's Steam page, mod support is on its way to&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>via Steamworks, which means that you'll be able to download and play mods via Steam.</p>

<p>Of course, that also means PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S players are being left out in the cold to some degree, so unless Warhorse announces a separate modding solution for console players, it looks like PC is the way to go for modders. Twas ever thus, eh?</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, it's a medieval RPG set in 15th-century Bohemia. Like its <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance" rel="nofollow">predecessor</a>,&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>emphasizes historical realism and accuracy over fantasy, so you'll be fighting lots of regular ol' people and not so many dragons or wizards.</p>

<p>The game once again picks up the story of Henry of Skalitz, a blacksmith's son who's out to get revenge for his murdered parents. Along the way, he'll get dragged into exactly the kind of political intrigue you'd expect from such a volatile historical setting.</p>




<p>If you're in the market for a hefty, beefy RPG, this will almost certainly fit the bill; Warhorse says&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>'s script <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-script-words" rel="nofollow">has more than two million words</a>, so you can expect plenty of content to keep you entertained.</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9n4w31hsmvvd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.
