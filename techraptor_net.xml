            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>creator Toby Fox has revealed that the game's fifth chapter isn't going to be ready until at least the second half of next year, but there's some good news as well: a sixth chapter has officially been confirmed.</p>

<p>As part of the game's <a href="https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/autumn25/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">fall newsletter</a>, Fox says that he "[doesn't] think that the game will be released in the first half of 2026", presumably referring to&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>'s fifth chapter rather than to the game as a whole.</p>

<p>He says that as of September 8th this year, Chapter 5's early areas are complete but in need of polish for some optional areas, while the last 40% of the chapter is in a "rough first pass" state, with the final 10% currently being prototyped.</p>

<p>It was already fairly obvious that&nbsp;<em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>would have at least two more chapters following Chapter 5. The game's chapter selection screen shows space for seven chapters, but this is the first time Fox has overtly referred to a sixth chapter for&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>.</p>

<p>Of course, he doesn't provide any kind of timeline for Chapter 6's release; since Chapter 5 doesn't have a release date yet, it would perhaps be strange if Fox knew when its followup would arrive.</p>

<p>In the case of Chapter 5, Fox says he and his team will release it "when it's done", and that he'll continue to update expectant fans on the progress of the chapter as it's made. Hopefully, it won't be too long until the next update.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/deltarune-chapter-5-2026-battle.jpg?itok=HD6mVzkg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/deltarune-chapter-5-2026-battle.jpg?itok=V19o4CWl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A sixth chapter of&nbsp;<em>Deltarune&nbsp;</em>is officially in development.</figcaption></figure><p>Fox has traditionally been pretty transparent about&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>'s development. Back in October last year, he promised that the game's third and fourth chapters <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-chapters-three-and-four-2025" rel="nofollow">would definitely release this year</a>, which was subsequently confirmed during a Switch 2-focused Nintendo Direct show.</p>

<p>He's also pledged in the past that&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deltarune-update-promises-smoother-development" rel="nofollow">development would be "smoother"</a> following relatively lengthy waits for the game's first few chapters, so hopefully, Chapters 5 and 6 will arrive in a timely fashion.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>'s first four chapters on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1671210/DELTARUNE/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/deltarune/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/deltarune-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">both</a> Nintendo Switch <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/deltarune-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">consoles</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Borderlands 4 Performance Is "Pretty Damn Optimal", Says Randy Pitchford]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has been paying attention to comments about&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s performance since it launched this past Friday, and he's got a characteristically brusque suggestion for you if you're dissatisfied.</p>

<p>As part of a very lengthy <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1966953086448185650" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">string of posts</a> on social media platform X over the weekend (which also included multiple threads and responses to other users), Pitchford told one user who suggested&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>should "look good without relying on AI upscal[ing]" to "code [their] own engine".</p>

<p>Pitchford suggested the user "show [Gearbox] how it's done", sarcastically suggesting that those currently working on the game's technical side are "clearly dumb and don't know what they're doing", and that "the world's greatest" technical staff "don't seem to know what [the user seems] to know".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-comments-character.jpg?itok=b_ycA7dQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-comments-character.jpg?itok=GqinSjS1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Are you unsatisfied with&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s performance? Randy Pitchford reckons you should "code your own engine".</figcaption></figure><p>For context,&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-release-date-moving-forward-report" rel="nofollow">launched on Friday</a>, has attracted a Mixed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">user review score</a> on Steam, with the majority of negative reviews pointing to sub-optimal performance as their reason for scoring the game negatively.</p>

<p>Some users are suggesting that&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>runs poorly on hardware that's pretty new in PC terms, although others say that features like DLSS and frame generation alleviate the problem significantly.</p>

<p>Pitchford himself <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424849653236055" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recommends</a> that players use DLSS, since&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>was "built to take advantage of it", dismissing criticisms of input latency and describing&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s performance on PC as "pretty damn optimal". He suggests PC gamers should "tune to [their] preferences using the tools available".</p>

<p>Despite these comments, it is worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>did receive <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an update</a> over the weekend, and that said update was intended to address "stability for a wide range of PCs", so it does look like Gearbox and publisher 2K intend to address these performance issues.</p>




<p><em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>isn't the only game to come under fire for lackluster PC performance in recent years.</p>

<p>Others include the likes of Capcom's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragons-dogma-2-capcom-statement" rel="nofollow">Dragon's Dogma 2</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-optimizations-winter" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a>, as well as indie titles like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow"><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em></a>, although none of these games are built on Unreal Engine 5, which some&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>players are blaming for the game's issues.</p>

<p>In any case, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/borderlands-4/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/borderlands-4/9MX6HKF5647G" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and make sure to check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/randy-pitchford-how-20-years-of-borderlands-led-to-borderlands-4" rel="nofollow">our interview with Randy Pitchford</a> to find out how the game came together.</p>
