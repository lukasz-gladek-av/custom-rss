            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/geforce-now-monthly-playtime-limit-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nvidia has announced that streaming service GeForce Now will begin imposing monthly playtime limits on new subscribers to two of its three currently available tiers, starting from next year.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GeForceNOW/comments/1glr3yc/gfn_thursday_updates_november_7_2024/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Reddit update</a>, Nvidia says it's renaming its Priority subscription tier to Performance, and that new subscribers to both the Performance and Ultimate tiers will be limited to 100 hours per month of playtime beginning "at the start of next year".</p>

<p>If you're an existing Performance or Ultimate member on or before December 31st this year, then you won't start seeing the monthly limits kick in until January 2026, which Nvidia says is a gift "to thank the GeForce Now community for joining the cloud gaming revolution".</p>

<p>You'll be able to buy extra hours if you run over the limit, too; $2.99 will get you 15 more hours on the Performance tier, while you'll have to pay $5.99 for the same privilege if you're on the Ultimate tier, although naturally, the quality of your streaming is better on this tier.</p>

<p>In addition, up to 15 hours of unused playtime will roll over each month, so if you do find yourself going under the limit for one month, you'll be able to enjoy an equivalent amount of extra time the following month.</p>

<p>On the plus side, Performance members will be able to enjoy 1440p gaming instead of 1080p, and the tier is also getting access to ultrawide support, although 4K and 120fps remains reserved for Ultimate members.</p>

It's similar to services like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-cloud-gaming-beta-available-now-on-xbox-series-xs-and-xbox-one">Xbox Cloud Gaming</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-luna-announced-as-new-cloud-gaming-service-in-early-access">Amazon Luna</a>.</p>

<p>You can sign up for the service over on the official GeForce Now <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce-now/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website</a> if you're interested.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-xbox-release-kojima-ip</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/death-stranding-gets-surprise-xbox-release-kojima-snaps-up-ip.1029801/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-xbox-release-kojima-ip<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hideo Kojima's&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>has received a surprise Xbox release today, and the gaming legend has also announced that he and his studio Kojima Productions have acquired the&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>IP.</p>

<p>Per a press release, <i>Death Stranding&nbsp;</i>is now available on Xbox Series X|S (although not on Xbox One), as well as the Microsoft Store and, uh, Amazon Luna.</p>

<p>Kojima Productions says that this release is part of its strategy to "focus on bringing [its] award-winning IP&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>to more platforms and audiences", and as part of that mission, the studio also "now has full ownership" of&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>as an IP.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-stranding-xbox-kojima-dropkick.jpg?itok=jlin_5jD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-stranding-xbox-kojima-dropkick.jpg?itok=bIpoE2iv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>is now available on Xbox Series X|S, in all its weird glory.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that the version of <i>Death Stranding&nbsp;</i>that's&nbsp;available on Xbox Series X|S now is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-directors-cut-is-coming-soon-to-playstation-5">the Director's Cut</a>, which means it includes a new location, new delivery items to help you out with your treks, and extra combat moves, plus lots more.</p>

<p>That's in addition to the base&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>game, of course, which remains the same profoundly odd and yet strangely compelling "walking simulator" it was when it first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-release-date-announced-along-with-new-trailer">launched on PS4 back in 2019</a>.</p>

<p>Right now, Kojima Productions is hard at work on a sequel to&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em>. The appropriately-named&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</em>will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-trailer-revealed-at-game-awards-2022">once again star Norman Reedus</a> as protagonist Sam Porter-Bridges, along with other returning stars like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideo-kojima-explains-additional-hands-on-fragiles-shoulders-in-death-stranding-2-on">Léa Seydoux</a> and Troy Baker.</p>

<p>Said sequel is currently set to launch next year for PS5, although now that Kojima has gained control of the <i>Death Stranding&nbsp;</i>IP, it may very well come to other platforms in due course as well.</p>




<p>Filming for <i>Death Stranding 2&nbsp;</i>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-stranding-2-filming-and-recording-completed">completed back in May</a>, so it looks like progress on the game continues apace. Let's hope it doesn't get delayed.</p>

<p>While you wait for that, you can grab&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1850570/DEATH_STRANDING_DIRECTORS_CUT/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA11260_00-DEATHSTRAND00001" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and now <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/death-stranding/9nkchzztl308" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> as well. You can check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/death-stranding-review">our review of it here</a>, and I'd recommend doing so if you want a wild read.</p>
