            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Sega and developer Two Point Studios have announced&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Finds</em>, the first major DLC expansion for museum management sim&nbsp;<em>Two Point Museum</em>, and it's heading your way next month.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://community.twopointcounty.com/two-point-studios/two-point-museum/blogs/89-two-point-museum-fantasy-finds-coming-17th-july" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Two Point Museum&nbsp;</em>site,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Finds&nbsp;</em>will launch on July 17th across all platforms on which the game is currently available, and it'll bring a ton of extra stuff for you to enjoy, all of it fantasy-themed.</p>

<p>First off, you can look forward to 40 new exhibits "with magical properties to hypnotize guests with", and that's not necessarily a figure of speech, either. You'd better watch your guests around some of the more esoteric oddments.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/two-point-museum-dlc-fantasy-finds-gnomes.jpg?itok=47nUXFxD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/two-point-museum-dlc-fantasy-finds-gnomes.jpg?itok=rYpSmJPY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Two Point Museum</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Finds&nbsp;</em>DLC has weird stuff galore for you to check out.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the new exhibits,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Finds&nbsp;</em>will also introduce a new Expert type, a new map to explore, and plenty of "exclusive decorations, items, and utility items" for you to fill your museum up with.</p>

<p>More interactive displays will also be introduced in the DLC, as well as a new helicopter paint job and three new guest archetypes for you to keep happy. You'd better make sure they don't get hypnotized!</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Two Point Museum</em>, it's a management sim, and you'll never guess what you get to manage. That's right: your very own aquarium. The clue's in the name, I guess.</p>

<p>Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/two-point-museum-release-date" rel="nofollow">back in March</a>, Two Point Studios' latest lets you manage a museum, oversee its exhibits, and try to keep its guests happy, all while acquiring your own artifacts and trying to thwart the efforts of enterprising thieves.</p>




<p>The game is the latest management sim from Two Point Studios, who, as the name suggests, can also count <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/check-into-two-point-hospital-on-august-30" rel="nofollow">2018's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/check-into-two-point-hospital-on-august-30" rel="nofollow">Two Point Hospital</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/two-point-campus-release-date-revealed" rel="nofollow">2022's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/two-point-campus-release-date-revealed" rel="nofollow">Two Point Campus</a>&nbsp;</em>as feathers in their cap.</p>

<p><em>Two Point Museum</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Finds&nbsp;</em>DLC launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3592600/Two_Point_Museum_Fantasy_Finds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S on July 17th, and the base game is currently available on all of those platforms as well.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chris-avellone-republic-games-rpg</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/legendary-writer-chris-avellone-teams-up-with-ex-quantic-dream-dev-for-mature-rpg.1229082/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Chris Avellone, a legendary industry writer who's worked on the likes of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fallout: New Vegas</em>, has joined <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>&nbsp;writer Adam Williams' Republic Games for a "mature" fantasy RPG.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/chris-avellone-joins-former-quantic-dreams-writer-at-republic-games-to-work-on-ambitious-project-inspired-by-golden-age-of-rpgs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, Avellone has been added to Williams' team, and while his position in the company is unclear, it's likely that he'll be working as a writer on the project.</p>

<p>Avellone himself says he's the one who asked Williams to join Republic Games; he says that he loves both the "design principles" and the "narrative construction" Williams is building for the project, and that being on the "ground floor" of the game is "amazing".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-chris-avellone.jpg?itok=-8Huog4T 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-chris-avellone.jpg?itok=BsGBYDi9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Chris Avellone's industry credits include&nbsp;<em>Knights of the Old Republic II</em>, among other games.</figcaption></figure><p>Williams says that Republic Games' first title will be an RPG with a "rich, interesting story", and that it'll feature "lots of meaningful choices, branches, and endings".</p>

<p>The game will revolve around "a totalitarian regime seeking to crush a rebellion", and there will be "competing factions" the player can join. You'll have the "freedom to create the hero - or antihero - [you] want to be", according to Williams.</p>

<p>He goes on to say that the game will feature a "deep undercurrent of prophecy and the supernatural", and that it'll also revolve around "full, classic RPG gameplay" that will incorporate "combat, character creation, recruitable companions, romances, and more".</p>

<p>The goal with the as-yet-unnamed game, Williams says, is to "combine that 'golden-age-of-RPGs' design with next-level interactive storytelling". It all sounds pretty ambitious.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/detroit-become-human-adam-williams-quantic-dream.jpg?itok=2bE6Ph32 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/detroit-become-human-adam-williams-quantic-dream.jpg?itok=FKk5jwtD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Adam Williams has worked as a writer on Quantic Dream's&nbsp;<em>Detroit: Become Human</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Avellone's journey in recent years has been a rocky one. In 2020, multiple women <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chris-avellone-removed-from-games-over-assault-allegations" rel="nofollow">accused him of sexual assault</a>, and although he was later cleared of the allegations, his name hasn't popped up on many major releases since those claims were leveled at him.</p>

<p>For now, Republic Games' ambitious-sounding RPG remains unannounced. Hopefully, we'll get a full reveal in the coming months. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>You survived a killer before, and somehow, you've found yourself in another hunted situation. You keep trying to save the others, but what's hunting you is too quick, and as before, you're the only one left. Once again, you are the final girl.</em></p>

<p><em>Final Girl</em>, by Van Ryder Games, was an acclaimed Kickstarter launched in 2020, based on their already successful <em>Hostage Negotiator</em>&nbsp;system. Since its release, it's had 2 more Kickstarters, each combined into a series of releases. In this review, we will look at the <em>Final Girl</em> Series 2 Ultimate Box, which incorporates everything from Series 2 available at retail into a single handy storage box. If you want to know how to play <em>Final Girl</em>, check out our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-review" rel="nofollow">Final Girl Ultimate Box Series 1 review</a>, because in this article, we'll just be looking at the Series 2 contents&nbsp;and what our favorite parts of it are.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-6_0.jpg?itok=kDZp_mlO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-6_0.jpg?itok=6HZZt47C 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Final Girl</em> Core Box isn't incuded in the Series 2 Ultimate Box, but is in the Series 1 Ultimate Box, or can be picked up seperately for use with the Series 2 Ultimate Box.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Rules To Survive A Horror Movie Sequel</h2>

<p><i>Final Girl</i>&nbsp;is a modular system that begins with the <em>Final Girl</em> Core Box, which has the core rules and components. To play, a core box is combined with a feature film box, like Happy Trails Horror or Slaughter in the Groves. These feature film boxes include a unique killer, a unique location, and 2 final girls to choose from, which can all be mixed and matched with other feature film boxes in any combination of final girl, location, and killer to diversify your games as your collection expands.</p>

<p>The <em>Final Girl</em> Series 2 Ultimate Box doesn't include a <em>Final Girl </em>Core Box. So if you don't have the Series 1 Ultimate Box, you will need to pick up a Core Box separately. This is to avoid duplication, as the Ultimate Boxes are designed for players who want everything. If you want to try out <em>Final Girl</em>, pick up a Core Box and a feature film to test the experience first, and then if you love it, then the Ultimate Boxes are going to be for you.</p>

<h2>What's Your Favorite Scary Movie Sequel?</h2>

<p>The <em>Final Girl</em> Series 2 Ultimate Box contains a huge amount of content. We'll detail here what each item contains and talk about our favorite products from the Ultimate Box below.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-girl-series-2-ultimate-box-2.jpg?itok=z_KZBf1k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-girl-series-2-ultimate-box-2.jpg?itok=Bfc8Rn1V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Instead of the Core Box, the <em>Final Girl</em> Series 2 Ultimate Box includes a load of upgrades and content add-ons.</figcaption></figure><h4><em>Final Girl</em> Box of Props</h4>

<p>The <em>Final Girl</em> Box of Props includes a load of upgraded and extra components for <em>Final Girl</em>. It includes deluxe tokens for the horror track, bloodlust, and time, and solid plastic tokens for final health. It also includes a desperation dice, which you can choose to roll once per game instead of a red die for a 5 in 6 chance of an extra success, but a 1 in 6 chance of immediately losing. If you lose because of the desperation die, you can look up how you died in the included book of desperate deaths.</p>

<p>4 promo final girls are also included in the box, Layla, Agnes, and 2 tie-in characters from the upcoming <em>The Dark Quarter</em> game, Julia and Constance. They don't get special envelopes or miniatures in this box though, they come in the Series 3 Ultimate Box (I would have liked to see it all packaged up in this box together). Some new rules are also added for the characters, with signature action cards, which can be added to the game and function like normal action cards, and a choice of ultimate dice, which can be taken instead of unlocking your final girl's ultimate ability.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-girl-series-2-ultimate-box-3.jpg?itok=Crh8IQoX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-girl-series-2-ultimate-box-3.jpg?itok=k6dbWSHX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Final Girl</em> Series 2 Ultimate Box includes 5 new feature film boxes, with new locations, killers and final girls.</figcaption></figure><h4>Final Girl Feature Films Boxes</h4>

<p>The Series 2 Ultimate Box, like the first one, contains 5 feature film boxes, for a total of 5 locations, 5 killers, and 10 final girls (with 5 additional final girls and another killer we detail above and below) that can all be mixed and matched between sets. Each box also contains miniatures for the killer, to upgrade from the token in the core box and vehicles (that you can access with cards in the item and event decks), to upgrade from the tokens included in each feature film box. We'll discuss each feature film box below.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: Into the Void</strong></p>

<p>Into The Void is <em>Final Girl's</em> take on Alien, with the USS Konrad as the location, which has key card required access cards to move between parts of the ship, and the Evomorph as a killer that evolves over the course of the game. Ellen and Jenette are the final girls in this film box, with Ellen's ultimate always letting her find what she needs, and Jenette getting extra uses out of limited items. I love that this set includes the Super Loader (and miniature in the Ultimate Box) for enhanced combat damage when looking to take the fight to the Evomorph.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: Panic at Station 2891</strong></p>

<p>Panic at Station 2891 includes Station 2891 as a remote location that has a helicopter on a timer as the only way to save victims. It also includes indoor and outdoor spaces that use the rule for frostbite, should you or the victims stay in the elements too long. The Organism is the killer in this set, and it has 3 different variations. 3 victims may have been assimilated, and as many as all 3 could be an Organism. The final girls are Uki and Kate. Uki's ultimate is to always be considered to have the Guard card that can reduce damage, and Kate jumps back to full health when revealing her ultimate.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: A Knock at the Door</strong></p>

<p>A Knock at the Door has the Wingard Cottage as its location, which gives you access to crafting mechanics to combine items into more powerful weapons. The Intruders are the killers here, with 3 killers on the board, with only the active killer performing actions, until an All Killers card is drawn. Ava and Ginny are the final girls here, with Ava's ultimate letting you reroll a blank (1) horror roll, and Ginny's ultimate boosting her actions for the rest of the game.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: Once Upon a Full Moon</strong></p>

<p>Once Upon a Full Moon takes a fantasy turn with the Storybook Woods as the location, which is much smaller than other locations, and requires you to cross poorly built bridges or find the raft. The Big Bad Wolf is the killer, and has 2 different modes, track and slay, with actions depending on which mode they are in. The fantastically thematic Red and Gretel are the final girls in this set, with Red's ultimate letting her move if an enemy is within 2 spaces, and Gretel's ultimate converting a blank (2) horror roll to a star by discarding action cards.</p>

<p><strong><em>Final Girl</em>: Madness in the Dark</strong></p>

<p>Madness in the Dark takes place at the Wolfe Asylum location, which has risk-reward medicine and drugs that can help you against the killer. The killer in this set is the Ratchet Lady, who can turn victims into maniacs to help her hunt you down. Veronica and Heather are the final girls, with Veronica's ultimate resetting the time to 7 at the end of the planning phase, and Heather's ultimate letting her reroll 5 or 6 on the horror roll, and boosting her attacks for each success.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-girl-series-2-ultimate-box-4.jpg?itok=wpi3bB19 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-girl-series-2-ultimate-box-4.jpg?itok=OMMZBI5P 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Final Girl</em> Series 2 Ultimate Box game mats are different from those in the Series 1 Ultimate Box, with extra spaces for feature film rules.</figcaption></figure><h4><em>Final Girl</em>: S2 Game Mat bundle</h4>

<p>The game mat bundle includes 2 neoprene game mats that have space for all the game areas, including the killer and location boards, horror and time track, and card deck areas, and comes in a thematic VCR-style box. These mats are slightly different from the Series 1 mats, and have more spaces for cards and components, but at the cost of things being a little more cramped together.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-girl-series-2-ultimate-box-5.jpg?itok=gA5Owel1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-girl-series-2-ultimate-box-5.jpg?itok=1pricLq8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Following the same format as the&nbsp;<em>Final Girl</em> Series 1 Ultimate Box, the Series 2 Ultimate Box includes a whole host of extras to add more depth to your games.</figcaption></figure><h4><em>Final Girl</em>: S2 Bonus Features Box</h4>

<p>Along with the Feature and Core boxes, the Ultimate Box includes 2 other sets, the first is the Bonus Features Box, which includes several books:</p>

<ul><li><em>Final Girl</em>: S2&nbsp;Feature Films Rulebook&nbsp;- This handy book features all the killer and location looseleaf rules inserts from each of the Series 2&nbsp;feature films, along with some achievement sheets for each, and works the same way as the Series 1 book.</li>
	<li><em>Final Girl</em>: S2&nbsp;Gruesome Death Books - These 5&nbsp;books for each location contain gruesome details of kills for each terror card and some general death details, for each of the Series 2&nbsp;killers across the Series 2&nbsp;locations.</li>
	<li><em>Final Girl</em>: Lore Book Series 2 - The lore book contains background details for all of the Series 2&nbsp;killers and final girls, along with some detailed setup for some linked scenario games</li>
</ul><h4><em>Final Girl</em>: S2 Cast and Crew Box</h4>

<p>The other bonus set in the Ultimate Box is the The Series 2 Cast and Crew, which is a handy storage box for some additional components, and to gather up all the final girl stat cards and their secret envelopes (which you can open for a bonus card once you complete a game with that final girl). The box also contains:</p>

<ul><li><em>Final Girl </em>Miniatures - All of the killer miniatures are housed in their respective feature film boxes, but all of the final girl miniatures are here.</li>
	<li><em>Final Girl</em>: Terror from the Grave (vignette) - This fantastic little box contains a killer (zombies) but doesn't include a specific location (and as with all killers, can be used with any location you wish). It also includes a new final girl (who also has a miniature in this box), Patsy, whose ultimate allows her to spend 2 time to deal 2 damage.</li>
	<li><em>Final Girl</em>: Zombies Miniatures Pack - These miniatures replace the tokens in the Terror from the Grave vignette pack.</li>
</ul><h2>A Bloody Combination</h2>

<p>The <em>Final Girl</em> Series 2 Ultimate Box further adds an insane amount of variety in locations and killers, if added to the Series 1 Ultimate Box, but still stands alone and can simply be added to a Core Set if you just want to play the Feature Films in this box. Having to pick up the Core Set separately makes sense, as does the miniatures for the 2 tie-in final girls from <em>The Dark Quarter </em>(which I love, as the final girls are powerful and the tie in is handled well), but not having the miniatures and secret envelopes for the other 2 extra final girls who's promo cards are included feels off, and having to buy the Series 3 Ultimate Box to get them doesn't sit well. If you're a huge fan of <em>Final Girl</em>, you're probably picking it up anyway, but for something called the Ultimate Box, it doesn't feel very ultimate.</p>

<p>Aside from that, some of the content here is fantastic. Into the Void and Panic at Station 2891 are incredible, with thematic locations and killers, and the zombies from Terror from the Grave are fun. But it's Once Upon a Full Moon that's my favorite part of the content. The fairy tale horror includes my favorite location, killer and final girls so far.</p>



<p>If you've read the above and the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/final-girl-series-1-ultimate-box-review" rel="nofollow">Final Girl Ultimate Box Series 1 review</a>, you'll know that I'm a fan of the <em>Final Girl</em> mechanics and the sheer depth of variety that a single Ultimate Box can give you. Having 2 Ultimate Boxes just increases that, but will also stand on its own (with the addition of a Core Box with the Series 2 Ultimate Box).</p>

<p>I love the originality of the core horror feature films in the Series 1 Ultimate Box, but the Series 2 Ultimate Box is easily my pick of the 2, with Into the Void and Panic a Station 2891 being great experiences, but Once Upon a Full Moon being my favorite. The missing miniatures and sealed envelopes for 2 promo final girls sours it a little (they're in the Series 3 Ultimate Box), but the 2 tie in characters from A Dark Quarter are fantastic (but you will have to pick up a copy of that game for the miniatures - which we'll review when released).&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition-update-new-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition-gets-three-more-old-school-worms-games.1229001/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Team17 has released a brand new update for&nbsp;<em>Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition&nbsp;</em>on consoles, bringing three more retro&nbsp;<em>Worms&nbsp;</em>titles to the collection, as well as a new cheat code that will be familiar if you're a fan of the franchise.</p>

<p>Per a press release, the "Backworms Compatible Update" adds the SNES and Genesis (or Mega Drive for some regions) ports of&nbsp;<em>Worms&nbsp;</em>to&nbsp;<em>Anniversary Edition</em>, as well as the Game Boy Advance game&nbsp;<em>Worms World Party</em>.</p>

<p>Additionally, this update brings the legendary "Boggy B" cheat code for&nbsp;<em>Anniversary Edition</em>, which will unlock all of the game's content. This one was added by request of the community, and you can toggle it within the collection's options menu.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition-new-games-castle.jpg?itok=Ok-hYrk8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition-new-games-castle.jpg?itok=no_y-84N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition&nbsp;</em>now has new&nbsp;<em>Worms&nbsp;</em>games for you to enjoy.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, since this is an update specifically for&nbsp;<em>Anniversary Edition</em>, this extra stuff isn't coming to the PC version of the game, which is still just the old-fashioned classic&nbsp;<em>Worms Armageddon&nbsp;</em>release from the mists of 1999.</p>

<p>It's nice to see Team17 still working on updating&nbsp;<em>Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition</em>, but it does feel like a shame that the PC version isn't getting the same love. I guess we'll just have to wait and see if the community's voice becomes loud enough to change that.</p>

<p>If you've never played&nbsp;<em>Worms Armageddon</em>&nbsp;(or its console re-release), it's a classic 1999 strategy game that sees teams of worms battling it out for supremacy using a variety of comically dangerous weapons, just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worms-rumble-release-date-playstation-pc-crossplay-beta-announced-" rel="nofollow">many</a> of its franchise <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/worms-wmd-review-worm-has-returned" rel="nofollow">stablemates</a>.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Anniversary Edition&nbsp;</em>re-release packs in not only the original game (plus modern hardware improvements, natch), but also a digital&nbsp;<em>Worms&nbsp;</em>museum and documentary, offering a behind-the-scenes look at the creation of the game.</p>




<p><em>Worms Armageddon: Anniversary Edition&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10009765" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/worms-armageddon-anniversary-edition/9nh5hhr5w9wx" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Worms-Armageddon-Anniversary-Edition-2655288.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. The original&nbsp;<em>Worms Armageddon&nbsp;</em>can be found on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/217200/Worms_Armageddon/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> if you're on PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Umami Tiger and publisher Deck13 have announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant</em>, the upcoming story expansion DLC for the JRPG-inspired throwback&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1229240/view/519717485042205006" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new Steam post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>will launch across all platforms on August 7th, and that's also when you'll be able to purchase the soundtrack for the DLC if you're musically inclined.</p>

<p>As Umami Tiger (which is essentially just a moniker for solo dev Matthias Linda) says,&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>was originally scheduled to arrive <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chained-echoes-dlc-ashes-of-elrant-q2-2025" rel="nofollow">in the second quarter of the year</a>, but "game development is complicated".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chained-echoes-ashes-of-elrant-dlc-release-date-snails.jpg?itok=PzOgomru 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chained-echoes-ashes-of-elrant-dlc-release-date-snails.jpg?itok=vvQzRXr2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Chained Echoes</em>'&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>DLC is arriving in August.</figcaption></figure><p>Linda says that while the DLC itself was ready for release at the end of Q2, "translations were not", and more testing was additionally needed in order to "iron out the last small issues" with&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant</em>.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;you'll get for your money (since&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>isn't a free DLC), it'll add "more of what you enjoyed so much" the first time around.</p>

<p>You'll be getting a brand new playable character in the form of the White Wolf, a vicious fighter with plenty of damaging moves to test out. Additionally, you can look forward to new areas to visit, as well as "over 40 new enemies and bosses" to battle.</p>

<p>More music will, of course, be added to&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>&nbsp;through the&nbsp;<em>Ashes of Elrant&nbsp;</em>DLC, and you can also expect new gear to collect and new minigames to try out. All in all, if you liked&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes</em>, you'll probably want to give this a look.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes&nbsp;</em>itself, it's a throwback JRPG inspired by classics like&nbsp;<em>Chrono Trigger&nbsp;</em>and SNES-era&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>games. Developed by solo creator Matthias Linda, the game takes you to a "fantasy world where dragons are as common as piloted mechanical suits".</p>

<p>You can pick up&nbsp;<em>Chained Echoes&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229240/Chained_Echoes/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10003362" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/chained-echoes/9N1WWRPJ12FK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/chained-echoes-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and you can take a look at our very own Isaac's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/chained-echoes-review" rel="nofollow">review from back in 2022 right here</a>.</p>
