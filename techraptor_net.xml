            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/teamlfg-playstation-studios-ex-bungie<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PlayStation Studios has announced the formation of teamLFG, a brand new studio comprising ex-Bungie staffers and "developers from across the industry", and the studio is already hard at work on its first game.</p>

<p>As revealed in a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/07/welcome-teamlfg-to-the-playstation-studios-family/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, teamLFG "originated at Bungie", but it's now a separate entity that's working on what Sony Interactive head Hermen Hulst describes as "an ambitious incubation project that [he's] very excited about".</p>

<p>Just in case you're wondering, yes, the "LFG" in teamLFG's name stands for "Looking for Group", MMORPG-style. The studio says it's "driven by a mission to create games where players can find friendship, community, and belonging", hence the name.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/destiny-2-teamlfg-playstation-studios.jpg?itok=TGyMDIDC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/destiny-2-teamlfg-playstation-studios.jpg?itok=MSEYX2WM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Staffers at teamLFG have worked on&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>,&nbsp;<em>Halo</em>,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, and other games.</figcaption></figure><p>In the PlayStation Blog announcement, teamLFG says its debut project is "a team-based action game that draws inspiration from fighting games, platformers, MOBAs, life sims, and frog-type games". It'll all take place in a "lighthearted, comedic world".</p>

<p>If that wording sounds familiar to you, it's probably because the exact same project was "announced" by Bungie <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-teases-new-team-based-action-game-set-in-lighthearted-science-fantasy-universe" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in August 2023</a>, and it was still classed as an "incubation" project then, too. Looks like the game may still be some way away from being officially revealed.</p>

<p>According to teamLFG, its goal is not only to react to player feedback "in our lead-up to launch" (although it feels a little premature for the studio to say that when the game hasn't even been revealed yet), but also "throughout live service", so it sounds like this'll be yet another live-service experiment for Sony.</p>

<p>It'd be remiss of me not to once again bring up&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>here; the first-person shooter was a hugely costly endeavor for Sony, but it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">closed its doors</a> within just weeks of its launch, resulting in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator" rel="nofollow">closure of its developer</a>. I'm not sure yet another live-service game is the way to go, but hey, I'm not Sony.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marathon-bungie-playstation-studios.jpg?itok=YJSd8EUE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marathon-bungie-playstation-studios.jpg?itok=Br3HrOUx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bungie, from which teamLFG is a spinoff, is currently gearing up for the release of extraction shooter reboot&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The new studio's game will also find itself entering a landscape occupied by Bungie's next major live-service project, extraction shooter reboot&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">due to launch in September</a>.</p>

<p>Whether or not&nbsp;<em>Marathon&nbsp;</em>succeeds could well inform whether teamLFG's game manages to see the light of day, or whether it gets canned in a similar manner to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-project-cancellations" rel="nofollow">two Respawn incubation projects</a> which were shut down recently. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-us-age-verification-to-kick-in-later-this-month</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-us-age-verification-to-kick-in-later-this-month<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced that all US&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>players will soon be required to verify their age if they wish to continue playing the gacha action RPG.</p>

<p>Per an <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/155805" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on its official website, HoYoverse will require you to go through its age verification process to play <em>Genshin Impact</em>. The process&nbsp;will be rolled out to everyone across the US by May 20th.</p>

<p>You'll need to provide your age information by July 18th. Failure to do so will, according to HoYoverse, result in account suspension and "in-game friends and chat records" being deleted, as well as "no further notifications", since you won't be able to access your account anymore.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-us-age-verification-escoffier.jpg?itok=Jcl-vpYm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-us-age-verification-escoffier.jpg?itok=ehjY6iKQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>will soon require you to verify your age to play.</figcaption></figure><p>What's more, if you don't verify your age by July 20th next year, your HoYoverse account's personal information "will be deleted permanently", so naturally, that's a fate you'll want to avoid.</p>

<p>This requirement likely comes as a result of <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/genshin-impact-game-developer-will-be-banned-selling-lootboxes-teens-under-16-without-parental" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a decision</a> made by the FTC back in January, wherein the commission found that HoYoverse "violated a children's privacy law and deceived children and other users" about in-game transaction costs and rare prizes in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>'s gacha system.</p>

<p>The decision required HoYoverse to cease selling "loot boxes" to children under 16 without their parents' consent and also to pay a $20 million fine to "settle FTC charges". It's likely the new age verification process is a direct result of that ruling.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the gacha systems in&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</i>are very similar to those found in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>, it doesn't seem that the ruling applies to those games; it's likely they'd need to be assessed as their own cases.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-hoyoverse-genshin_0.jpg?itok=qJQQ2IHf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-hoyoverse-genshin_0.jpg?itok=FR76BZ_c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It doesn't seem&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>players will be required to disclose their age.</figcaption></figure><p>As for what's next for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>, the game's next major update, Version 5.6, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-56" rel="nofollow">launches today</a>. It takes you back to the land of Mondstadt, where your adventure began, in order to enjoy an "interlude chapter" before the next story chunk proper gets going.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-release-date-revealed.1183119/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trails-in-sky-1st-chapter-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Nihon Falcom and publisher GungHo Online Entertainment have seemingly revealed the&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>release date, with the JRPG remake getting a worldwide release later this year.</p>

<p>Back in December, the two studios <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trails-in-sky-1st-chapter-simultaneous-global-release-2025" rel="nofollow">announced</a> that the game would be getting a simultaneous global launch sometime in 2025, and now, thanks to Japanese news publication <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202505/40940" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Famitsu</a> (via leaker <a href="https://ryokutya2089.com/archives/86204" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ryokutya2089</a> and news platform <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-launches-september-19" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>), we know the date, at least for Japan: it's coming on September 19th.</p>

<p>Technically, publisher GungHo hasn't revealed a Western release date for&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>yet, but there's no reason to believe the aforementioned simultaneous worldwide release isn't still going ahead, at least for now.</p>

<p>As previously revealed, the game will be getting a release on PC and PlayStation 5 as well as Nintendo Switch. It'll be available in two different editions: the standard version and the Bracer Box edition, although we don't yet know what comes as part of the latter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=7Pcdz7o4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=RKVN5pmc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>launches in September.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>, it's a remake of the original&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky</em>, which is itself part of the wider&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Heroes&nbsp;</em>series (which has been running for much longer than you'd imagine).</p>

<p>The game will tell the same story as the original; it'll follow the adventures of Estelle and Joshua Bright, two "bracers" (think problem-solving bounty-hunter types) who are quickly drawn into a "conspiracy that threatens the very heart of their homeland", according to Falcom.</p>

<p>Since it's a remake, though, you can look forward to improved visuals across the board, plus "refined gameplay" that will allow you to choose between turn-based combat and real-time fighting.</p>

<p>You can also expect new voiceovers in English and Japanese, and, of course, you'll have the option of choosing which one of the two you want, so you don't have to suffer through the English dub if you don't want to. I'm sure it's perfectly fine, but I'll be picking Japanese. Sorry.</p>




<p><em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</em>launches on September 19th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3375780/Trails_in_the_Sky_1st_Chapter/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013078" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-4m-battlefield-skate<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has announced that Hazelight's co-op platformer&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has reached another big sales milestone, and the studio has also provided updates on when we can expect the next&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>games to arrive.</p>

<p>As part of its 2024-25 earnings report, EA reveals that&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has sold "nearly four million units" since launching in March, although developer Hazelight <a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1919852640189456892" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">subsequently said</a> it had passed that mark.</p>

<p>This figure means&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has racked up another two million sales for itself since the beginning of March; the game reached the two million mark <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">inside a single week</a>, having already reached a million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-1m-48-hours" rel="nofollow">within its first 48 hours</a>.</p>

<p>As well as a sales update for&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, EA also revealed when we can apparently expect new&nbsp;<em>Skate&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>games to arrive; both are due to land in the 2025-26 fiscal year, which means EA has until March 2026 to release them.</p>

<p>EA has already been drip-feeding information about the new&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>via its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-labs-announced-ea" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Battlefield Labs initiative</a>, whereby it continuously requests community feedback in order to shape and inform the development of the game.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Skate</em>, EA originally announced it was coming to Early Access in 2025 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skate-reboot-early-access-2025" rel="nofollow">last year</a>, although when it does, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-skate-reboot-no-offline-mode" rel="nofollow">won't be launching with any kind of offline mode</a>, unfortunately. You'll have to look to Activision's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-and-4-remasters" rel="nofollow">upcoming&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk&nbsp;</em>remasters</a> if you want offline skating sims.</p>
