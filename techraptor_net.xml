            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-shared-world-elements<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has released a new financial earnings call for the third quarter of the 2024-25 fiscal year, and in the call, CEO Andrew Wilson expresses what appears to be a theory as to why&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>flopped.</p>

<p>Recently, EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">admitted</a> that <i>Veilguard&nbsp;</i>and flagship sports game&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em>had both "underperformed", and in the new <a href="https://s204.q4cdn.com/701424631/files/doc_financials/2025/q3/Q3-FY25-Earnings-Call-Transcript-FINAL.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">call</a>, Wilson seems to draw a link between&nbsp;<em>Veilguard</em>'s failure and its lack of "shared world elements".</p>

<p>He says EA's games need to "directly connect" to players, who he says "increasingly seek shared world features and deeper engagement". That's likely a reference to&nbsp;<em>Veilguard</em>'s nature as a single-player-only title, rather than a game with multiplayer elements.</p>

<p>However, this version was subsequently scrapped (assuming the reports of its existence are correct), leading to&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>'s single-player focus. It seems that EA's management now regrets getting rid of those live service elements.</p>

<p>There is, of course, no guarantee that&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>would have performed any better if it did have the "shared world" elements EA seems so wistful about. After all,&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em>is undeniably a live service title, and it, too, underperformed.</p>

<p>Wilson, however, puts this down to people sticking with previous&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC&nbsp;</em>titles and not buying the new one, as well as "lower-than-expected engagement" due to "specific issues with balance".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed-play.jpg?itok=aO4FZa9y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed-play.jpg?itok=T3jxwU9x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>EA Sports FC 25</em>'s underperformance had nothing to do with live service, but&nbsp;<em>Veilguard</em>'s apparently did. Hmm.</figcaption></figure><p>I can't imagine that many of the people who felt dissatisfied with&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>would have been happier if the game had featured the "shared world elements" EA regrets not putting in, honestly.</p>

<p>It's hard to imagine that direction would have prevented the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-layoffs-veilguard-failure" rel="nofollow">BioWare layoffs that followed</a>, nor the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/veilguard-director-corinne-busche-leaving-bioware" rel="nofollow">departure</a> of <i>Veilguard&nbsp;</i>director Corinne Busche from the studio.</p>

<p>In any case, EA is probably looking very carefully at the next&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>game now. I'd be very surprised indeed if the publisher didn't try to ensure that some sort of "shared world elements" are present in that game, so we'll have to see how&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect 4&nbsp;</em>(name obviously not final) performs.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the call, EA confirms that the next&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>game will be launching in 2026 and reaffirms that you can sign up to get a chance to test it right now via the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-labs-announced-ea" rel="nofollow">Battlefield Labs initiative</a>.</p>

<p>The company also commits to a new $1 billion share buyback scheme, which feels like exactly the kind of thing you'd expect from a studio that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">paid its CEO $25 million in 2023</a> despite hundreds of layoffs. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/onimusha-2-remaster-capcom-fighting-collection-2-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/onimusha-2-remaster-and-capcom-fighting-collection-2-release-date-revealed.1100754/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/onimusha-2-remaster-capcom-fighting-collection-2-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that a remaster of PS2 cult classic&nbsp;<em>Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny&nbsp;</em>is in the works, and we now also have a release date for the upcoming retro pack&nbsp;<em>Capcom Fighting Collection 2</em>.</p>

<p>During a livestream, Capcom revealed the&nbsp;<em>Onimusha 2&nbsp;</em>remaster, which will come to last-gen consoles, Switch, and PC sometime this year. Strangely enough, it doesn't seem to be getting a native PS5 or Xbox Series X|S version, although you will likely be able to play it on those machines.</p>

<p>We don't know exactly what features the remaster will boast, but it's likely to sport revamped visuals and improved gameplay, so if you found the original&nbsp;<em>Onimusha 2&nbsp;</em>a bit too clunky in its PS2-era iteration, you'll probably want to check this out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/onimusha-2-remaster-gogandantess.jpg?itok=rw6mI1W2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/onimusha-2-remaster-gogandantess.jpg?itok=WwFQvPtU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The demon swordsman Gogandantess returns this year in Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Onimusha 2&nbsp;</em>remaster.</figcaption></figure><p>It's likely Capcom is reviving&nbsp;<em>Onimusha 2&nbsp;</em>in order to drum up interest in the series ahead of&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>, the next major entry in the series, which is due to land sometime next year. It'll serve that purpose alongside the&nbsp;<em>Onimusha&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-onimusha-anime-trailer" rel="nofollow">anime</a>, which aired on Netflix in 2023.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why the studio hasn't chosen to remaster the first game, that's probably because a remastered version is already available across PC and last-gen machines.</p>

<p>As well as the<em>&nbsp;Onimusha 2&nbsp;</em>remaster, Capcom also revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Capcom Fighting Collection 2&nbsp;</em>during the aforementioned livestream. The game will hit PC, Switch, and last-gen consoles on May 16th, and pre-orders are open now if that's your thing.</p>




<p><em>Capcom Fighting Collection 2&nbsp;</em>will feature eight retro Capcom fighting gems, and there's only one&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter&nbsp;</em>game in the collection as well, which arguably shows a pretty significant degree of restraint. Here's the full list!</p>

<ul><li><em>Capcom vs SNK: Millennium Fight 2000 Pro</em></li>
	<li><em>Capcom vs SNK 2: Mark of the Millennium 2001</em></li>
	<li><em>Capcom Fighting Evolution</em></li>
	<li><em>Street Fighter Alpha 3 UPPER</em></li>
	<li><em>Project Justice</em></li>
	<li><em>Power Stone</em></li>
	<li><em>Power Stone 2</em></li>
	<li><i>Plasma Sword: Nightmare of Bilstein</i></li>
</ul><p>As you'd probably expect from a modern fighting game, all of these games will support online play, and they'll boast rollback netcode as well.</p>

<p>If you want to watch Capcom's full Capcom Spotlight showcase, which also includes a full&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>presentation ahead of the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">release later this month</a>, you can do so below.</p>
