            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A public playtest is now live for The Black Company Roleplaying Game. Developer Arc Dream Publishing is now taking crucial player feedback for their TTRPG adaptation of the beloved dark fantasy series.</p><p>According to its official <a href="https://theblackcompanyrpg.com/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">web page</a>, <em>The Black Company Roleplaying Game</em> is a fast-paced game of swords, sorcery, and soldiers. The development team is the same studio behind <em>Delta Green</em>, the supernatural military RPG series.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>It is, appropriately, set in the dark fantasy setting of <em>The Black Company</em> series created by Glen Cook. The series is known for focusing on the experience of soldiers in heroic fantasy settings. Human fighters that just want to do their job, get a stiff drink, and stay alive one more day.&nbsp;</p><p>The players are mercenaries drafted into the titular Black Company, a group of soldiers sent to fight and die on deadly missions for an Empire ruled by sorcerers with godlike power. This means constant missions and campaigns against impossible odds where death is almost guaranteed.</p><p><em>The Black Company Roleplaying Game</em> will attempt to bring that level of grit and struggle to gaming tables. The game contains rules for making your own characters and campaigns as well as play as key characters from the books.</p><p>The core system revolves around percentile dice, much like Cubicle 7's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-old-world-rpg-players-guide-preview" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer</em></a> TTRPGs. Only the players roll dice for all skill tests. In addition, the game has no hit points or sanity points; players have a single Damage and Stress state respectively.&nbsp;</p><p>The first initial playtest for <em>The Black Company Roleplaying Game</em> will be available until February 1, 2026. This material will focus on the game's core rules. It will contain a 10-page packet, six premade characters, a prewritten adventure, and a one-page city map.</p><p>Players are encouraged to submit feedback via an online survey and are encouraged to do Actual Play recordings. All Arc Dream asks regarding the latter is to disclose the game is a playtest and not the final version.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Mario Kart World </em>has reached a new sales milestone in Japan, making it the series' fastest-selling game in that country to date.</p><p>According to sales data analyst <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pierre485.bsky.social/post/3mavc6fvttk2d" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">pierre485 over on Bluesky</a>, <em>Mario Kart World </em>has passed the 2.5 million sales mark in Japan, a milestone it took the game 29 weeks to reach.</p><p>That might sound like a long time, but according to pierre485's data, <em>Mario Kart Wii</em> took around 89 weeks (that's more than a year, by the way) to hit the same figure, so <em>Mario Kart World</em>'s achievement should be a little more impressive in that context.</p><figure role="group">

<p><em>Mario Kart World </em>is, according to pierre485's figures, also the fastest-selling Nintendo Switch 2 game, as well as the best-selling game of 2025 altogether. Remember, this data applies specifically to Japan and not to the rest of the world.</p><p>Back in November, Nintendo revealed that <em>Mario Kart World </em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-dk-bananza-switch-2-sales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4e02a144-2a45-4743-8394-5954013f8f00" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">nearing the 10 million sales mark</a>, with fellow Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>sitting at a very respectable 3.5 million at that time. It's not clear whether this new data has helped the game cross that line; we'll likely find out when Nintendo next announces its financials.</p><p>Indeed, it's been a strong year for the Switch 2 on the whole. Back in August, it was revealed that the console had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-financials-q1-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0df1a582-9b9c-40ce-97e3-524ba446cf4f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">managed to pass 6 million sales</a>, taking under two months to do so, and that Nintendo's revenue soared as a result (as you'd expect with the release of a successful new piece of hardware).</p><p>The console's lineup will be bolstered in the coming year by the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-switch-2-version-on-way-next-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="159fca3c-8df3-41ad-98da-95af3a28123c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Phasmophobia</em></a> and smash hit adventure <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dispatch-switch-2-switch-eshop-listing" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1bcf2169-2693-40a4-ab6c-88b2398c75da" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Dispatch</em></a>, as well as Nintendo's own <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-leak" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3eeb790b-1baf-43d8-afe2-99182049c947" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon Pokopia</em></a>, which, if my own (very amateur) predictions are correct, will make roughly all of the money that exists in the world right now. <em>Mario Kart </em>being <em>Mario Kart</em>, I'd expect <em>World </em>sales to trundle along nicely as well.</p>
<p>You can check out <em>Mario Kart World </em>right now exclusively on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mario-kart-world-switch-2/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
