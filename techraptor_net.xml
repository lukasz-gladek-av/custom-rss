            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-the-diver-like-dragon-dlc-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mintrocket has announced the release date for its upcoming&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>crossover, and the aptly-named&nbsp;<em>Ichiban's Holiday&nbsp;</em>is making its way to the cozy diving game-slash-restaurant sim next month.</p>

<p>As revealed by Mintrocket in a new Dev Dive video,&nbsp;<em>Ichiban's Holiday&nbsp;</em>is coming to&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>on April 10th. It'll be available across all platforms on which you can play the game, and it'll introduce everyone's favorite lovable goof Ichiban Kasuga to the Blue Hole.</p>

<p>This will be the latest in a long string of&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/big-dave-diver-collaboration-update-balatro" rel="nofollow">collaborations</a>; the game has also entertained the likes of fiendishly addictive roguelike&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, potion sim&nbsp;<em>Potion Craft</em>, and Shift Up's&nbsp;<em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke</em>, among others.</p>

<p>Rather sweetly, Hwang shows off some of the goodies he got when meeting longtime&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>producer Masayoshi Yokoyama at last year's Tokyo Games Show, including signed copies of&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth&nbsp;</em>and a Korean translation of the script for the first&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>game.</p>

<p>As for the crossover DLC itself, it'll see Ichiban and the bartender of his hangout spot Survive visiting Dave and Bancho's restaurant. As you might expect, it's not peaceful for long, and soon, Ichiban finds himself drawn into yet another adventure.</p>

<p>You can look forward to a new side-scrolling beat-'em-up minigame, as well as&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon</em>'s signature karaoke and appearances from several other franchise favorites. Hwang says he "basically put everything [he likes] about&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon&nbsp;</em>into this collaboration".</p>




<p>Unlike previous&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>crossovers,&nbsp;<em>Ichiban's Holiday&nbsp;</em>will be paid DLC, which Hwang acknowledges might be "disappointing" for some. He also announces that the DLC will only be available for a "limited time of six months".</p>

<p><em>Dave the Diver</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Ichiban's Holiday&nbsp;</em>DLC launches on April 10th. The game is available to buy right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1868140/DAVE_THE_DIVER/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dave-the-diver/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dave-the-diver-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-2-25th-anniversary-remaster-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nightdive has announced the&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>release date, with the reworked version of the classic FPS coming to PC and consoles in summer.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2</em>'s remaster will be launching across PC and consoles (that's current-gen and last-gen consoles, happily) on June 26th.</p>

<p>Just in case you're wondering what happened to Nightdive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-2-enhanced-edition-is-being-ported-to-kex-engine" rel="nofollow">previously-revealed</a>&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: Enhanced Edition</em>, this is, in fact, that very thing; the project was renamed to&nbsp;<em>25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>earlier this year, but it's still the same, ahem, enhanced edition Nightdive has been working on for the past few years.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/system-shock-2-remaster-release-date-robot.jpg?itok=u9-8m4kP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/system-shock-2-remaster-release-date-robot.jpg?itok=J5FgeGFv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>System Shock 2</em>'s remaster is coming in June.</figcaption></figure><p>As you've probably come to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-the-thing-remaster-tease" rel="nofollow">expect</a> from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/poed-definitive-edition-nightdive" rel="nofollow">previous</a> Nightdive <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-studios-remastering-shadow-man-restoring-cut-content" rel="nofollow">remaster projects</a>,&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>will bring a number of new features to the iconic 2000 FPS-RPG.</p>

<p>You can expect a visual revamp that will touch up some of the game's rougher edges and models without deviating from Irrational and Looking Glass' artistic vision, as well as some minor quality-of-life improvements, controller support, and more.</p>

<p>The game will also support Steam achievements, as well as achievements and trophies on the relevant consoles, and it'll boast 144fps and ultrawide support too, so this'll likely be the best-looking version of&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2&nbsp;</em>you can play (without mods, of course).</p>

<p>On the subject of mods, Nightdive is also promising expanded mod support for&nbsp;<em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</em>, so if you want to turn all the enemies into Mr. Blobby and work out some very specific trauma, you should find it pretty easy to do so.</p>




<p>It's worth remembering that although Nightdive is the studio responsible for 2023's excellent&nbsp;<em>System Shock&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/system-shock-goes-gold-release-date-for-pc-announced" rel="nofollow">remake</a>, this project isn't on the same scale; it's not a full reimagining, but a remaster, so bear that in mind if you pick it up.</p>

<p><em>System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster&nbsp;</em>launches for PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/866570/System_Shock_2_25th_Anniversary_Remaster/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/system_shockr_2_25th_anniversary_remaster" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>), <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013043" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/System-Shock-2-25th-Anniversary-Remaster/9P4FK543SMZF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and Nintendo Switch on June 26th. Make sure you pick this one up if you're interested in a revamped slice of FPS history.</p>
