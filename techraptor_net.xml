            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/evo-2025-lineup-leaked<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The lineup for this year's Evo tournament appears to have been leaked just a week or so before the official announcement is due to take place.</p>

<p>Per a Nintendo Life <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/oops-evo-2025s-lineup-has-accidentally-been-revealed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the official thumbnail for the upcoming livestream apparently gave away the games before seemingly being changed. It no longer features any of the participating games, instead simply depicting a plain "Evo Announcement Show" banner.</p>

<p>Obviously, this story will contain spoilers for the Evo 2025 lineup, so if you'd rather wait for the official broadcast, which is due to take place on January 14th at 8pm Eastern (that's 5pm Pacific), then make sure you don't read on. Here's an image of Evo 2024 so you can get out before it's too late!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/evo-2025-lineup-leaked-evo-2024.jpg?itok=_8bDRs1d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/evo-2025-lineup-leaked-evo-2024.jpg?itok=c8hKlVz8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is your last chance not to be spoiled on the Evo 2025 lineup.</figcaption></figure><p>Still here? Alright then. Here are the games that were apparently featured in the Evo 2025 livestream's thumbnail before they were hastily removed.</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/street-fighter-6" rel="nofollow"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a></li>
	<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tekken-8" rel="nofollow"><em>Tekken 8</em></a></li>
	<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/guilty-gear-strive" rel="nofollow"><em>Guilty Gear Strive</em></a></li>
	<li><em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising</em></li>
	<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/under-night-in-birth-ii-sysceles" rel="nofollow"><em>Under Night In-Birth II Sys:Celes</em></a></li>
	<li><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em></li>
	<li><em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em></li>
	<li><em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes</em></li>
</ul><p>After all that, it's a pretty straightforward lineup, featuring as it does several Evo mainstays; last year's competition also featured&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>, and a number of the other games on this list.</p>

<p>Two games have notably been subbed in, however:&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2&nbsp;</em>have been swapped in for&nbsp;<em>King of Fighters XV&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 3: 3rd Strike</em>.</p>

<p>While you should take this lineup with a small pinch of salt until the official announcement arrives, these games were featured in the Evo 2025 stream lineup before it was changed, so they're almost certainly the games in which you'll be watching competitors duke it out.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/robocraft-2-canceled-as-developer-freejam-shuts-down.1077912/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/robocraft-2-canceled-freejam-shuts-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Robocraft 2&nbsp;</em>developer Freejam has announced that ongoing development on the game is no longer sustainable, and that the studio itself will also be closing its doors and sunsetting its other titles.</p>

<p>In a message on&nbsp;<em>Robocraft</em>'s official Discord server, Freejam's Rawxas says that "the current market conditions and the server costs required" to keep&nbsp;<em>Robocraft 2&nbsp;</em>running mean that the studio is unable to launch the game's 1.0 version or continue development.</p>

<p>As such, Freejam says it'll spend "some time" sunsetting&nbsp;<em>Robocraft 2</em>, as well as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/301520/Robocraft/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">its predecessor</a>, "over the coming weeks". The studio's cardboard survival game&nbsp;<em>CardLife&nbsp;</em>will also be sunsetted along with the two&nbsp;<em>Robocraft&nbsp;</em>games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/robocraft-2-canceled-vehicle.jpg?itok=S4AgP3u4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/robocraft-2-canceled-vehicle.jpg?itok=UxzM1zeP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Robocraft 2&nbsp;</em>is no more as of today.</figcaption></figure><p>The dismantling of Freejam's work has already begun; it's no longer possible to buy&nbsp;<em>Robocraft 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1991140/Robocraft_2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on the Steam store</a>, although the original game, which is free-to-play, remains available, as does&nbsp;<em>CardLife&nbsp;</em>(at time of writing).</p>

<p>It may also not come as a surprise that&nbsp;<em>Robocraft 2&nbsp;</em>is being sunsetted if you've played the game; it's currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1991140/Robocraft_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sitting at a Mostly Negative review rating</a> on Steam, with 1,760 players weighing in with their opinions.</p>

<p>Some negative reviews point to technical issues like an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199588571283/recommended/1991140/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">inability to log in</a> or difficulty getting the game to run <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199127398025/recommended/1991140/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on certain platforms</a>, but others offer more <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198135029860/recommended/1991140/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in-depth critiques</a> of the game, suggesting it's failed to strike the same kind of chord that the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/301520/Robocraft/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">original&nbsp;<em>Robocraft&nbsp;</em>did</a>.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Robocraft 2&nbsp;</em>is (or was), it's an online-focused vehicular combat game in which you can create and deploy your own custom-created vehicles. Freejam says its game's "construction systems" allow players to create "a multitude of shapes at any scale".</p>

<p>Just this week,&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>developer Rocksteady <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024" rel="nofollow">was reported to have laid off a number of its staff</a> at the end of last year, and other companies such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-development" rel="nofollow">Thunderful</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-employees-strike" rel="nofollow">Don't Nod</a>, and many others have also been hit by layoffs.</p>

<p>Bigger companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Sony</a> have been affected too, although that hasn't stopped the C-suites at these companies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">raking in</a> frankly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">embarrassing amounts of money</a> while they hemorrhage staff.</p>
