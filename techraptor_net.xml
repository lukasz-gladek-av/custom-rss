            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-direct-duration<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that its upcoming Switch 2 Direct show will run for around an hour, and that you can expect to see hands-on gameplay footage of some Switch 2 games in the days to follow.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1907055353742700718" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on social media platform X, Nintendo confirms the Nintendo Direct, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">scheduled to air tomorrow</a> at 6am Pacific (9am Eastern), "will be approximately 60 minutes long". That's longer than Directs usually run; they're normally about 30-45 minutes.</p>

<p>A <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1907056611610243535" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">followup post</a>&nbsp;subsequently confirms that two Nintendo Treehouse presentations will be held on April 3rd and 4th, each of which will feature "hands-on gameplay of Nintendo Switch 2 games", although we don't know which games those will be just yet.</p>

<p>Other than that, however, the Switch 2's launch lineup is shrouded in mystery, so it'll be interesting to see what Nintendo has up its sleeve for which a console that the company is reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-20m-shipments-report" rel="nofollow">gearing up to ship 20 million units</a> during its first year.</p>

<p>We're also expecting that the Switch 2's release date will be revealed tomorrow; according <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-release-april-september-nacon" rel="nofollow">to accessory maker Nacon</a>, said date is likely to land somewhere in the April-September region. If I had to guess, I'd put my money on June or July.</p>




<p>Whatever the case may be, we'll find out exactly what Nintendo has up its sleeve for the Switch 2 during the Direct presentation tomorrow.</p>

<p>You can watch said presentation on Nintendo's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintendoAmerica" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official YouTube channel</a>, and we will, of course, have all the news from the show for you as it happens as well. Make sure to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">catch up on last week's</a> Direct if you're interested in what's happening with the OG Switch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/april-fools-day-2025-gaming-roundup<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's April Fools' Day once again, and you know what that means: time to take literally everything you read on the internet today with a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>Of course, that doesn't necessarily include this article; we're gathering up everything we see that looks like an April Fools' joke to us, but there's every chance we're wrong and some of these announcements are legit. In any case, here's our roundup of this year's April Fools' shenanigans!</p>

<hr><h2>Level-5 invites you to cross "New Horizons"</h2>




<p>Level-5's April Fools' joke this year involves a trailer that will look very familiar to you if you were glued to a certain Nintendo game during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. It's intended to promote the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-release-date" rel="nofollow">impending release</a> of RPG sequel&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em>.</p>

<h2><em>PUBG</em>&nbsp;gets romantic</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-dating-sim-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=qXtIPUXS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-dating-sim-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=JtFweEi4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Have you ever wanted to date your&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>weapons? Well, now you can.</figcaption></figure><p>Krafton is celebrating April Fools' Day in&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds&nbsp;</em>in the form of <a href="https://pubg.com/en/events/wwrdevent" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"Winner Winner Romantic Dinner"</a>, a dating sim that lets you romance, uh, your weapons. This one's been created with the help of gen AI, which is a bit yucky if you ask me.</p>

<h2><em>War Thunder&nbsp;</em>adds infantry into the mix</h2>




<p>This is one of those announcements where I'm not sure whether it's an April Fools' joke or not, but in any case, Gaijin has announced that <a href="https://warthunder.com/en/news/9447/current" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ground troops</a> are on their way to vehicular combat game&nbsp;<em>War Thunder</em>. Judging by the comments, this one might do well if it wasn't a gag.</p>

<h2><em>Sonic Racing: CrossWords&nbsp;</em>wants to have some words with you</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-racing-crosswords-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=S1Sx2Z8p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-racing-crosswords-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=X8RKD4KE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This game is extremely real. Honest.</figcaption></figure><p>You've heard of&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em>, but <a href="https://www.sonicracingcrosswords.com/special/crosswords" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">what about&nbsp;<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWords</em></a>? A "demo" for the game is available now, and it challenges you to, uh, solve a word puzzle as fast as you can. I see what you did there, Sega.</p>

<h2><em>Party Animals&nbsp;</em>is calling your bluff</h2>




<p>A brand new board game mode has been added to party game&nbsp;<em>Party Animals&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1260320/view/498317142563751751" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in the form of "Bluffalo Club"</a>, in which you must take turns saying ridiculous things and hoping your friends fall for them. There's more in the update besides the new game, too.</p>

<h2><em>My Time at Sandrock&nbsp;</em>wants you to sign a binding marriage contract</h2>

<p>Are you intending on marrying one of&nbsp;<em>My Time at Sandrock</em>'s handsome and beautiful NPCs? If so, then you'll want to sign this extensive and extremely legally binding <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1084600/view/514079741259548841" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">marriage contract</a>, which asks that you jump through all kinds of hoops in order to prove your love is enduring.</p>

<h2><em>Palworld</em>'s dating sim surely can't be real, right?</h2>




<p>I'm including this one mainly for posterity, but it's also worth mentioning the&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>dating sim that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-dating-sim-announced-again" rel="nofollow">once again announced yesterday</a>. There's...just no way&nbsp;<em>Palworld: More than Just Pals&nbsp;</em>can be real...is there?</p>

<h2><em>Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing&nbsp;</em>is making a triumphant return</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/big-rigs-over-the-road-racing-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=Zw7uyVVL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/big-rigs-over-the-road-racing-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=-0Zwutc1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Are you ready to very decidedly not race?</figcaption></figure><p>Notorious terrible, horrible, very bad, not good video game&nbsp;<em>Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing&nbsp;</em>is coming to Steam, apparently. Again, I can't tell if this one's serious or not, but hey, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3598130/Big_Rigs_Over_the_Road_Racing/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">you can wishlist it here</a> if you want to find out.</p>

<h2><em>Dave the Diver: Remastered&nbsp;</em>is bringing realistic visuals to Mintrocket's pixel art extravaganza</h2>




<p><em>Dave the Diver&nbsp;</em>is probably one of the most diverse and minigame-stuffed games of all time, but wouldn't it be better if it looked a little more...realistic? Well, Mintrocket clearly thinks so if this&nbsp;<em>Dave the Diver: Remastered&nbsp;</em>trailer is anything to go by. You'll only have to wait until 2049 to play it as well!</p>

<h2>THQ Nordic reveals&nbsp;<em>ArcAInia - The Fall of Sans Serif</em></h2>

<p>In the world of THQ Nordic's&nbsp;<em>ArcAInia - The Fall of Sans Serif</em>, "typography and magic are one", and you must destroy the corrupt sans serif fonts, who have allowed their power to go to their heads. This game is absolutely real and is absolutely launching in 2026. Cough, cough.</p>

<h2><em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke&nbsp;</em>is getting a feature film</h2>




<p>Jiggly mobile RPG&nbsp;<em>Goddess of Victory: Nikke&nbsp;</em>is apparently getting itself a feature film, complete with epic mecha battles and plenty of waifu-style characters. Whether or not this is all a huge, elaborate April Fools' Day prank remains to be seen (hint: it is).</p>

<h2><em>The Talos Principle Reawakened&nbsp;</em>has tons of features so you don't need to think anymore</h2>




<p>Are modern puzzle games too difficult for your brain? Do you wish they made you...well...think a little less? Croteam and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/talos-principle-reawakened-release-date" rel="nofollow">The Talos Principle Reawakened</a>&nbsp;</em>have you covered with a suite of hilarious features designed to stop your brain from needing to activate even once.</p>

<h2><em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>is, erm, throwing shade at&nbsp;<em>Smite</em>?</h2>

<p>I'll readily admit I don't get this one; I don't think there's any shame in that. Riot Games' FPS&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>is apparently either teaming up with, throwing shade at, or affectionately ribbing&nbsp;<em>Smite</em>&nbsp;in <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1907062942022910313" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this strange video message</a> posted on the game's official X account.</p>

<h2><em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>has some burger-flipping goodness for you</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/selaco-burger-flipper-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=kIEBeuwb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/selaco-burger-flipper-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=yOfo0Vkk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ready to flip some burgers in&nbsp;<em>Selaco</em>?</figcaption></figure><p><em>Selaco</em>'s Burger Flipper minigame <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1592280/view/517457440980076004" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">is in full swing</a>, and not only that, but it's getting all the good stuff like microtransactions and loot boxes as well. Don't worry; this isn't really happening. I think.</p>

<h2><em>Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis&nbsp;</em>has yet more school visual novel shenanigans for you</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-vii-ever-crisis-academy-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=tyaW0wBF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-vii-ever-crisis-academy-april-fools-day-2025.jpg?itok=SO2SLdbf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just look at them.</figcaption></figure><p>If there's a more iconic duo than&nbsp;April Fools' Day and visual novel spinoffs, I can't name it, and apparently, nor can Square Enix.&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis Academy&nbsp;</em><a href="https://en.ffviiec.com/ec-academy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">promises a cute school-set visual novel</a> starring Cloud, Tifa, and the gang, but it's almost certainly not real. Boo.</p>
