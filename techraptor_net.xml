            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-fastest-selling-nintendo-console<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed that the Switch 2 has become the gaming giant's fastest-selling console worldwide, having reached a major milestone in just four days.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1932620051955270127" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Nintendo says the Switch 2 sold 3.5 million copies within the first four days of its release, thus making it the "fastest-selling Nintendo hardware ever" around the world.</p>

<p>The console has also set records for Nintendo in specific regions of the globe; earlier this week, it was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-console-in-uk-history-but-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-launches-were-bigger" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announced</a> that the Switch 2 is Nintendo's fastest-selling machine in the UK, although it hasn't pipped the PS5 or the Xbox Series X|S to the post as the country's fastest-selling games console ever.</p>

Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">on June 5th</a>, the console packs more powerful internals than its predecessor, as well as a larger screen, magnetic Joy-Cons, and various other improvements.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">launched with&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a>&nbsp;</em>as its main draw, but it also has a number of last-gen and current-gen ports under its belt, and a number of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-upgrades-switch-1" rel="nofollow">original Switch games</a> have received either free or paid upgrades to enhance their performance on the new console.</p>

<p>It's not clear whether the console will go on to fulfil Nintendo's expectations. The company said last month that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-15m-switch-2-first-year" rel="nofollow">expects to sell 15 million</a> Switch 2 units in its first year, and a Bloomberg report earlier this year suggested that Nintendo is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-20m-shipments-report" rel="nofollow">preparing to manufacture 20 million units</a> for sale in the same time period.</p>

<p>This is a strong start for the Switch 2, though, and even if it hasn't beaten the PS5 or the Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo will be happy that the new machine appears to have outsold the original Switch, at least in terms of the first four days.</p>




<p>You can grab a Switch 2 right now from any number of retailers (assuming the console is in stock at the time you're reading this, of course).</p>
