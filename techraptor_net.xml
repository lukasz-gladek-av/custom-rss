            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Marc-Alexis Côté, the former boss of the <em>Assassin's Creed </em>franchise at Ubisoft, is suing his ex-employer to the tune of over $1.3 million, alleging "constructive dismissal".</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2221328/marc-alexis-cote-ubisoft-assassins-creed" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">CBC Radio Canada</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/former-assassins-creed-boss-sues-ubisoft-for-more-than-1-3-million-alleging-constructive-dismissal/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">VGC</a>), Côté says that during Ubisoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="acd9f3a1-9a63-4e42-9b91-122a243964e9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">reshuffle into its new Creative House structure</a>, he was told Ubisoft would be looking for a new "Head of Franchise" to oversee the three major IPs allocated to its new Vantage label (i.e. <em>Assassin's Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six</em>).</p><p>Côté says he wasn't considered for this position and was instead offered a role as "Head of Production", which he says would have meant he lost the chance to oversee the <em>Assassin's Creed </em>franchise and to make creative decisions about it.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As Côté tells it, Ubisoft offered him a leadership position at one of its new Creative Houses, but Côté saw this as a demotion since the Creative Houses wouldn't be in charge of Ubisoft's first-tier franchises.</p><p>Following this, Côté took two weeks off work, and when he returned, Ubisoft gave him an ultimatum to accept the job or not. Côté declined and formally demanded severance pay from Ubisoft, which he says they didn't give him.</p><p>For context, Côté <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-boss-leaves-ubisoft-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bedd26ab-2db9-443d-9a58-5d57561ce134" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">departed Ubisoft in October last year</a>. According to the studio, his departure was voluntary, with the company stating that he had decided to "pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft".</p><p>That's why Côté is demanding such a high sum of money; it effectively amounts to two years' worth of severance pay, as well as an extra $75,000 for moral damages (i.e. harm to his reputation and an abuse of power on Ubisoft's part).</p><figure role="group">

<p>We'll have to wait and see how successful Marc-Alexis Côté's lawsuit against Ubisoft is, but it doesn't sound like he's going to let go of this particular axe anytime soon. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
