            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/joe-allen-top-6-games-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are many ways in which 2024 has been, to put it mildly, a rough year, and our industry hasn't exactly been faring well.</p>

<p>Amid mass layoffs, C-suite executives pocketing embarrassing amounts of money, and studios shutting down left, right, and center, studios must have had an exponentially harder time releasing games worth talking about.</p>

<p>Thankfully, many of them managed to do just that. However harrowing a year it's been for the industry on a business level, the games happily speak for themselves, and while I don't think 2024 raised the bar like 2023 did, that bar's high enough that it can sit right where it is without feeling too bad.</p>

<p>Without further ado, then, here are my top 6 games from 2024!</p>

<h2>6.&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/black-myth-wukong-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=1PFY-PUS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/black-myth-wukong-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=vcW2dcNr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>made more than its fair share of contributions to the Soulslike genre this year.</figcaption></figure><p>The folks behind&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>might have made a couple of unsavory remarks surrounding the game's release, but that doesn't diminish the quality of what is thankfully an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/black-myth-wukong-review-serious-monkey-business" rel="nofollow">excellent Soulslike action RPG</a>.</p>

<p><em>Wukong</em>'s array of heavily Chinese mythology-inspired enemies and bosses is dizzying, and I've often said that Soulslikes live and die on their enemy variety, a brief developer GameScience seems to have understood very well indeed.</p>

<p>Couple that with satisfyingly complex levels that pack a plethora of optional paths to explore, and you've got yourself a Soulslike that deserves to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with some of the genre's greats. The story's a touch muddled, but when the combat's this fun, I'll let that slide.</p>

<h2>5.&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-3-reload-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=6GHwOoKH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-3-reload-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=-U0s4dwd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>may have been lengthy, but the payoff was worth it.</figcaption></figure><p>Oh,&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, how you broke my heart. I never quite managed to click with previous versions of&nbsp;<em>Persona 3</em>; they always felt just a touch incomplete, like each one could do with some of the features another one had.</p>

<p>For the most part,&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>feels like the holistic package I've been waiting for. It's another delightfully offbeat slice of&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>fun, complete with everything you could want from one of these games: relationship-building, great characterization, and music that won't leave your playlists for months.</p>

<p>Some of the improvements made by&nbsp;<em>Reload&nbsp;</em>easily elevate it above its forebears, too. Its improved visuals, extra story elements, and extensive quality-of-life changes make it a much more palatable and welcoming experience than the often-punishing original.</p>

<h2>4.&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astro-bot-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=Qa_l2_4P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astro-bot-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=dGdKbO_e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>For 3D platformer thrills of yesteryear, look no further than&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>I haven't been as much of a fan of Sony's more recent AAA output than many; games like&nbsp;<em>God of War Ragnarok&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>lean a little too heavily on cinematic setpieces for me. What I want is a game that could only ever be a game, and&nbsp;happily, Sony provided this year with&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>.</p>

<p>I'm about to praise it, so don't worry, but I've got a bit more of a bee in my bonnet about&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>than many of my peers seem to. Its celebration of properties Sony seems happy to leave buried troubles me, and I wish it wasn't quite so self-congratulatory.</p>

<p>Even so, I'd be a churl if I pretended Team Asobi's throwback 3D platformer was not, on a moment-to-moment basis, the most fun I've had with a video game this year. It's delightfully colorful, beautifully playable, and wonderfully childlike without ever feeling childish.</p>

<p>If you can sit in front of&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot</em>, DualSense clutched in your hands, and watch its expertly choreographed action unfold in front of your eyes without <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/astro-bot-review-90s-platformer-done-right" rel="nofollow">cracking a massive smile</a>, then I think your heart may have stopped beating.</p>

<h2>3.&nbsp;<em>Animal Well</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/animal-well-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=4aUtL7UU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/animal-well-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=-YG6mHTT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Animal Well&nbsp;</em>layered mysteries atop mysteries to great effect this year.</figcaption></figure><p>You can almost always rely on the indie circuit to go where AAA games fear to tread, and&nbsp;<em>Animal Well&nbsp;</em>certainly fulfilled that remit this year. Bigmode's inaugural title was a solo effort created by one-man outfit Shared Memory, and as opening salvos go, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/animal-well-review-icebergs-worth-of-puzzles-deep-below-surface" rel="nofollow">hard to top this one</a>.</p>

<p>It's been a long time since I've seen a game world so absolutely stuffed to the brim with secrets. Pretty much every screen of&nbsp;<em>Animal Well&nbsp;</em>is hiding something, and you can choose on what level you want to engage with those puzzles, creating a deeply satisfying experience for players of all stripes.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is heretical to admit, but I was absolutely not bothered about the deeper, more ARG-adjacent layers of&nbsp;<em>Animal Well</em>. I was content to potter about its world, discovering its surface-level secrets and engaging with its expertly crafted platforming.</p>

<p>That's the beauty of Bigmode and Billy Basso's game, though; whether you're a dungeon-delving dilettante or a spelunker of secrets, you'll find something to love here.</p>

<h2>2.&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nine-sols-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=YyKairIw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nine-sols-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=yfzMWdu0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>married satisfying combat and exploration with a surprisingly heartstring-tugging story.</figcaption></figure><p>It may be true that&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>' Metroidvania world isn't quite as complex and multi-layered as some of its contemporaries, but that's more than made up for by one of the most affecting and well-realized stories I've seen in games for quite some time.</p>

<p>Unlike the general template for Metroidvania games,&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>' protagonist, Yi, isn't a blank slate. He comes with his own personality, his own memories, and, perhaps most importantly for&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>' narrative, his own baggage.</p>

<p>The story of how Yi slowly comes to terms with what his past contains and what it means for the world around him propels&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols&nbsp;</em>into the pantheon of the greatest Metroidvania games of all time, but its combat is nothing to be sniffed at either.</p>

<p>You'll need your wits about you to master&nbsp;<em>Nine Sols</em>' precise parry-based combat, which you'll use to take down an impressive variety of enemies and bosses.</p>

<h2>1.&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=uymB31V4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-joe-allen-top-games-2024.jpg?itok=Io98e6RI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is a phenomenally generous, thrillingly layered expansion.</figcaption></figure><p>There was never really going to be anything else vying for my top spot in 2024.&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is about as close to a masterpiece as a game's DLC expansion can get.</p>

<p>The Realm of Shadow is a beautifully complex and dense open-world environment to explore. Like many, I'm not really sure why director Hidetaka Miyazaki chose to claim that the DLC's explorable landmass would rival that of the base game's Limgrave when it's so much larger and more layered.</p>

<p>Some found&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>'s level of challenge too much to bear, but I welcomed it. Each of the DLC's bosses <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree" rel="nofollow">felt like a true test</a> of the skills I'd learned during my time with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>, and to me, they all felt expertly designed and tuned.</p>

<p>Like the main game,&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>also comes complete with an incredible array of secrets to uncover. To share any of those secrets would be to spoil the surprise, so I'll just say that if you haven't played this one yet and you're an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>fan, please try to set aside the time. It's worth it.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-howl-soulslike-deckbuilder-11-bit</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/11-bit-announces-soulslike-deckbuilder-death-howl-demo-coming-monday.1085331/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/death-howl-soulslike-deckbuilder-11-bit<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>publisher 11 bit studios has announced&nbsp;<em>Death Howl</em>, a "Soulslike deckbuilder" which marries a gloomy atmosphere with run-based gameplay and card crafting.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Death Howl&nbsp;</em>promises "grid-based, turn-driven battles" that will demand "tactical precision" from you. In addition, you'll be battling "formidable enemies and fearsome bosses" which you'll need to build tactically sound decks to surmount.</p>

<p>The game will offer the chance to explore a grim open world in which you'll find biomes like the "Meadows of Delusion" or the "Forest of Howling Shadows". It's safe to say this isn't the kind of game you should play if you're looking for a cozy atmosphere.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-howl-soulslike-deckbuilder-combat.jpg?itok=7q2w-dbK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-howl-soulslike-deckbuilder-combat.jpg?itok=kUPb82Jc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Death Howl&nbsp;</em>marries Soulslike atmosphere with deckbuilding gameplay.</figcaption></figure><p>As you explore each of&nbsp;<em>Death Howl</em>'s regions, you'll unlock new cards to craft, and you'll also be able to piece together elements of protagonist Ro's backstory, which the devs say is "steeped in themes of love and loss".</p>

<p>Each realm you visit will present you with different challenges, necessitating the construction of various different deck types in order to overcome those challenges. You'll also be given the chance to use "shamanic totems" to deepen&nbsp;<em>Death Howl</em>'s "strategic layer" in order to expand your options.</p>

<p><em>Death Howl&nbsp;</em>comes to us from&nbsp;<em>Mind Scanners&nbsp;</em>developer The Outer Zone, a three-person-strong studio based in Copenhagen. Director&nbsp;Malte Burup describes the game as a "fresh take" on deckbuilders, something I think will probably be needed given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/breachway-release-date" rel="nofollow">crowded market</a> into which&nbsp;<em>Death Howl&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/slay-spire" rel="nofollow">hurling itself</a>.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Death Howl</em>, which gives a sense of the kind of hopeless atmosphere and turn-based deckbuilding gameplay the game is going for, right here.</p>




<p>I'm honestly not sure&nbsp;<em>Death Howl&nbsp;</em>is doing itself any favors by describing itself as a Soulslike; we are, after all, a million miles away from the kind of reflex-based stamina management-reliant combat for which the&nbsp;<em>Souls&nbsp;</em>games and their offshoots are known.</p>

<p>Still, you'll get the chance to find out whether I'm right or not on Monday, when a demo for the game will be made available via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2825880/Death_Howl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>. The game will also be coming to <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/death_howl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ace-combat-7-sales-6m</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ace-combat-7-sales-6m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has announced that flight sim&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>has reached a new sales milestone on the eve of the game's sixth anniversary.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/ace-combat/news/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown-reaches-6-million-units-sold-6th-anniversary" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">notice</a> on the game's official website,&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>has officially reached the six million sales mark, which feels particularly appropriate given that the game is about to turn six years old. This latest figure was no doubt helped by&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown-deluxe-edition-announced-for-nintendo-switch" rel="nofollow">launch on Nintendo Switch last year</a>.</p>

<p>Back in November 2023, Bandai Namco revealed that the game had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown-has-sold-5-million-copies" rel="nofollow">hit the five million sales milestone</a>, which means it's sold another million copies between then and now. It looks like&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>is a nice and stable little earner for the studio.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ace-combat-7-sales-shooting.jpg?itok=NMZF7vtp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ace-combat-7-sales-shooting.jpg?itok=_lEw9UtD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>sales have topped six million.</figcaption></figure><p>Game producer Kazutoki Kono, who's well-known for his work on the&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat&nbsp;</em>franchise, said the milestone meant that his team had achieved its goal to "connect with as many people as possible" through the game. He also thanked everyone who bought&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7</em>, as well as those involved with its creation.</p>

<p>Also included in Bandai Namco's milestone announcement post are some digital wallpapers you can download if you want your love of&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>to be reflected every time you're looking at your desktop. It's a pretty neat extra!</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7</em>, it's the latest major entry in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat&nbsp;</em>series, which began back in 1995 with the PlayStation flight sim&nbsp;<em>Air Combat&nbsp;</em>(released in Japan as&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat</em>).</p>




<p>After&nbsp;2014's&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat Infinity&nbsp;</em>took the series away from its fictional setting of Strangereal,&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>returns to that world once again, telling the story of fighter pilot Trigger as he tries to clear his name of a murder he didn't commit.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 7&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/502500/ACE_COMBAT_7_SKIES_UNKNOWN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0700-CUSA05636_00-AC7STANDARDED000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown/BRVM8RNWLXH1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown-deluxe-edition-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> (and also on current-gen consoles thanks to backwards compatibility).

<p>We don't know the exact reasons for Busche's departure, but according to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-game-director-leaving-bioware" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, which also confirmed the news, the commercial performance of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>&nbsp;- which, as the publication notes, is rumored to be "decent" but modest - isn't a factor.</p>

<p>It's also not known whether or not Busche will be leaving EA as a whole, where she's worked for over 18 years, or whether she'll be moving to another department within the company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-corinne-busche-leaving-bioware-emmrich.jpg?itok=DZ9qQ67o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-corinne-busche-leaving-bioware-emmrich.jpg?itok=uo8k6jus 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>'s director Corinne Busche is to leave BioWare.</figcaption></figure><p>Although rumors were also swirling that BioWare Edmonton was to shut down, Eurogamer says it understands this isn't the case and that the studio will be "unaffected by any other changes".</p>

<p>Busche began her career with EA in 2006, where she's worked on a number of games, including titles in the&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>series. Per her own <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/corinnebusche/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn page</a>, she specializes in "systems, gameplay, and UX", so she's very much on the technical side of things.</p>

<p>Alongside longtime BioWare staffer John Epler, who's been with the studio for more than 18 years, Busche helmed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-leaked-trailer" rel="nofollow">recently-released</a>&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, which "enjoyed" a protracted development cycle and went through several iterations before the version we know was released.</p>

<p>It's not clear what's next for Busche; since we're not sure whether she's still with EA or not, her name may pop up on a future project by the studio, or we may see her joining <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-bethesda-bioware-naughty-dog-near-studios-hawthorn" rel="nofollow">several</a> other <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-ea-staffers-three-thousands-studio" rel="nofollow">industry figures</a> who've <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-capcom-staffers-birdkin-hideaki-saori-utsumi" rel="nofollow">started their own studios</a>.</p>
