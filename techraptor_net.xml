            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Iconic Lovecraftian tabletop horror game&nbsp;<em>Eldritch Horror&nbsp;</em>is getting itself a PC adaptation next year, and it promises to deliver a faithful digital version of the "acclaimed globe-spanning mystery and adventure".</p>

<p>As revealed during an&nbsp;<em>Arkham Horror</em>-focused livestream,&nbsp;<em>Eldritch Horror&nbsp;</em>will be launching via Steam in the first quarter of 2026. Development is being handled by Cornerstone Software, and this appears to be the studio's first project.</p>

<p>The aptly-named&nbsp;<em>Eldritch Horror: Digital Edition&nbsp;</em>aims to bring the scares and strategic decision-making of the original tabletop game to PC audiences, so you can expect pretty much the same gameplay and atmosphere you'll experience if you play the board game version.</p>

You can also look forward to "countless monsters" and "hundreds of encounters", all based on the original&nbsp;<em>Eldritch Horror</em>'s "rich" lore.</p>

<p>This being a PC adaptation, though, you won't need to rely on YouTube ambience compilations for your soundscape;&nbsp;<em>Eldritch Horror: Digital Edition&nbsp;</em>will come complete with a "haunting original soundtrack", as well as new artwork that captures the game's "noir-inspired, 1920s supernatural aesthetic".</p>

<p>Of course, the game will attempt to faithfully translate Fantasy Flight's strategic party-based co-op gameplay into a digital arena as well, complete with "resource management, storytelling, and roguelite elements".</p>

<p>That being said, Cornerstone has made a couple of housekeeping changes; much of&nbsp;<em>Eldritch Horror</em>'s number-crunching and "bookkeeping" will be handled for you in the Steam version, allowing you to get straight to the spooky action, as it were.</p>

It'll set you back $24.99 or your regional equivalent.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.4, as well as some of the things you can expect from the patch when it lands, including a new dungeon, a new Trial, and more.</p>

<p>In the latest Letter from the Producer livestream, producer Naoki Yoshida revealed that&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>&nbsp;Patch 7.4, which follows on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-73-august" rel="nofollow">August's Patch 7.3</a>, will be arriving across all platforms on December 16th. That should give you just enough time to think of some excuses to avoid your relatives so you can play it.</p>

<p>When Patch 7.4 launches, it'll kick off the next major arc in the long-running MMO's sprawling story, with the narrative fallout from 2024's&nbsp;<em>Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>expansion having reached a climax in the previous patch.</p>

Not only that, but a new Trial, the rather intriguingly-named Hell on Rails, will be made available as well.</p>

<p>Four new raids are coming as part of the ongoing Arcadion raid series, tying up this sequence of eight-player battles, and you can expect a brand new Frontlines map that's sure to keep the bloodthirsty PvP marauders happy.</p>

<p>All of this is coming alongside a new Cosmic Exploration destination, a new Variant dungeon, and much more, so make sure to re-up your subscription if you're interested in finding out what happens to the Warriors of Light next.</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>'s latest patch comes just a few months after the reveal that the popular MMO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-ps4-yoshi-p-comments" rel="nofollow">may not maintain its PS4 version forever</a>, as rising technical requirements might preclude the development team from releasing further updates for the platform at some point in the future.</p>
