            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>All things change. With the passing of days, into seasons, into years, the cycle continues. The Jwar Isles are no different, and with these changes, come new opportunities, new allies, and consequences. In this article, we take a look at the new Consequences Cycle Deck for the <em>Bushido</em> skirmish wargame, along with 4 new fighters from among the Wave 25 releases.</p><p>We've been covering <em>Bushido&nbsp;</em>for years, so if you'd like to learn more about the game, check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/bushido-risen-sun-guide" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">our guide to <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em></a>, our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">review of the <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>&nbsp;2-player starter set</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/start-collecting-bushido-risen-sun-part-1-introduction-and-developer-interview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">our "Start Collecting" guide to <em>Bushido</em></a>, which includes an interview with the game's developer.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Ride The Wave</h2><p>You might be wondering what we mean by Wave 25. It's simply a way to refer to a combination of products that release together. In this case, Wave 25 for <em>Bushido</em> was a huge release, with 13 new miniatures and the Consequences Cycle Deck. Here we're only taking a look at 4 of the new miniatures, but also available were:</p><ul><li>Temple of Ro-Kan - Kongu, Kuren, and Masaru</li><li>Prfecture of Ryu - Takashi Horaki</li><li>Cult of Yurei - Lotus Kaidan</li><li>Minimoto Clan - Aida and the Kami of Enduring Embers</li><li>Ronin - Yu</li><li>Silvermoon Syndicate - Minori</li><li>The Kinshi Temple - Tomoaki</li></ul><picture>

  </picture><h2>Consequences Cycle Deck</h2><p>Cycle Decks in <em>Bushido</em> are a way for GCT to easily incorporate new cards, rather than packaging them with specific miniature releases. When constructing your warband, you can only use cards from 1 Cycle pack (Risen Sun, Weeping Sky, or Consequences). The Concequences Cycle Deck, like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-weeping-sky-cycle-deck-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Weeping Sky Cycle Deck</a> before it, contains 54 cards for a mixture of factions and card types, including:</p><ul><li>Events, usually actions that can be played during the game</li><li>Terrain, which can be deployed onto the battlefield for specific effects</li><li>Enhancements, that are attached to units to offer effects and abilities</li><li>Themes, offering new abilities if the warband construction restrictions are followed</li></ul><p>We recently previewed several cards from the Consequences Cycle Deck, which you can see <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-exclusive-preview" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p><p>The Consequences Cycle Deck contains cards for all factions, except the Awoken and Imperial March, the 2 newest factions that will receive cards in future Cycle decks. The faction breakdown for the deck is:</p><ul><li>Cult of Yurei - 4 cards (1 enhancement, 1 enhancement equipment, 2 events)</li><li>Ito Clan - 4 cards (2 enhancements, 2 events)</li><li>Jung Pirates - 4 cards (1 enhancement, 1 enhancement equipment, 2 events)</li><li>Minimoto Clan - 4 cards (2 enhancement, 1 event, 1 terrain)</li><li>Prefecture of Ryu - 4 cards (4 enhancement equipment)</li><li>Savage Wave - 4 cards (1 theme, 1 enhancement, 1 enhancement equipment, 1 event)</li><li>Shadow Wind Clan - 3 cards (1 enhancement, 1 enhancement equipment, 1 event)</li><li>Shiho Clan - 4 cards (1 theme, 1 enhancement, 2 events)</li><li>Silvermoon Trade Syndicate - 4 cards (2 enhancements, 1 enhancement equipment, 1 event)</li><li>Temple of Ro-Kan - 4 cards (3 enhancements, 1 enhancement equipment)</li><li>The Descension - 4 cards (2 enhancements, 2 events)</li><li>The Kinshi Temple - 4 cards (2 enhancements, 2 events)</li><li>Ronin - 7 cards (3 enhancements, 1 enhancement equipment, 3 events)</li></ul><p>Apart from those we previewed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-exclusive-preview" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">previously</a> (I'm a huge fan of Consequences of Kiyohara and New Eagle Army), my favorite card from the set is the Shadow Wind Clan's Opposition Preparation, which stops enemy fighters from using a whole host of abilities when targeted by North Star fighters for the first time. I love the thematic pre-battle reconnaissance that the ninjas would have done to preempt and disrupt enemy abilities before even going into combat with them.</p><p>As with previous cycle decks, the more factions you play, the more you will get out of this deck, but even players with a single faction (as long as it's not Awoken or Imperial March) will get their faction's cards and the Ronin cards to use. It will also give you an idea of what your opponent might be taking (as you can see the cards in the app for list building purposes, but not the details), and who knows when you'll pick up a new faction in the future. I've been strictly Shadow Wind and Shiho Clan for a while, but with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-wretched-review-living-nightmare" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Wretched</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-passing-night-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Passing the Night</a> themed warband releases (both of which are incredible), I've found myself suddenly playing 2 new factions this year.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Somabo the Blue Crane</h2><p>Somabo is a Ronin fighter that can only be recruited into The Descension warbands, or those that include Hiroto (either the Ronin Drunken Master or Shiho Black Eagle versions). &nbsp;Somabo is fast, with movement 5 (with +1 move if running and doesn't suffer melee penalties for running), 4 dice in attack, and armed with a +1 damage katana or claws (depending on whether you want the katana's critical attack/sidestep defence or claws' pierce, bleed, or combo attack).</p><p>Somabo's Squall Strike ki feat lets them move 1 inch after an attack if they make a damage roll, along with up to 2 other friendly Tengu models within 4 inches. Finally, their Umbrella Block ki feat gives them parry until the end of the melee exchange.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Vekye</h2><p>Vekye is a Cult of Yurei fighter with a move of 5 and 2 types of attacks. Vekye can either go for standard damage, with +1 damage claws with pierce, bleed, and combo attack, or the +0 damage tainted hands with grapple attack. If Veyke manages to hold their opponent with grapple, at the end of the round, the held model (as long as it's not soulless) takes an additional 2 wounds and gains a spirit block marker that stops them from generating ki tokens next round.</p><p>Veyke has a Mutation ki feat that gives them either +1 melee weapon strength, regenerate 2, or armor 1 for the turn, depending on what they need, and a Fight or Flight ki feat, which grants them Banzai, allowing them to charge as a simple action, or Clowdwalk, which lets them ignore terrain and zones of control for movement. They also have Indomitable 1, which means they ignore the first enemy penalty for assisting in combat, along with coordinated attack Tengu, to benefit them when they gang up on an opponent.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Yoshiko</h2><p>Yoshiko is the latest Rose for the Silvermoon Trade Syndicate. I picked up Yoshiko to add to my plan to make an entirely Rose warband because despite being part of the Silvermoon, their theme is very ninja-ish in their disguises, concealed weapons, and seduction techniques. Yoshiko is no different in that respect, but is a little more overt in her combat prowess. Yoshiko has move 5, as is standard with the Roses (except the veteran rose Misao), and jump up, evasive and lightfooted to keep them mobile, and disguise 5 to keep them protected. In attack, they roll 3 dice with their +0 damage Tachi that has push and stun attack, and sidestep defence.</p><p>For ki feats, Yoshiko has the powerful Contingency Plan, which can actually stop them from being removed and instead are placed out of the enemy's line of sight with all wounds healed by using the ki feat and passing an opposed ki test. She can also put scheme markers on nearby enemies at the end of her activations, and then remove them with the scheme ki feat that lets her recruit a permitted event card with a cost equal to the number of scheme tokens removed.</p><p>Yoshiko also has a 0-cost, once per turn, The Crowds Part ki feat that lets them move 2 inches. Enemies in base-to-base contact can spend 2 ki to stop it, but even that is very handy, either getting Yoshiko out of combat or burning 2 enemy ki. Finally, Yoshiko also lets you change the scenario target of a friendly VIM (Very Important Model) from the one selected to any with disguise. The model loses disguise, but it gives you control over the scenario target.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Shiho Kizo</h2><p>Kizo is my favorite release of this wave, a Ronin who plays into both my beloved Shiho Clan and Shadow Wind Clan. Kizo is not only a ninja, but also a samurai. Kizo's sculpt is covered in baby Karapan, and he comes with a 10-inch Karapling ranged attack with lightweight, so he doesn't suffer any modifications for moving and attacking with it. The attack doesn't need line of sight and ignores cover, can only be used once per turn, and instead of damage, gives a Bleed 2 marker to the target.</p><p>At the start of Kizo's activation, he can either heal 2 wounds on an animal in base-to-base contact or gain sixth sense until the end phase. When Kizo is recruited, it means that Shiho warbands can also recruit Karapan, and Shadow Wind warbands can recruit Ronin birds, both of which normally wouldn't be able to do so.&nbsp;</p><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Bushido Wave 25 Releases?</h2><p>There's a lot to love in Wave 25 of <em>Bushido</em> releases, and we've only covered 4 of the 13 miniatures that were released as part of it. The Temple of Ro-Kan did well with 3 releases in the wave, but there's a lot for most factions (with the Savage Wave and Awoken getting releases in the next wave, which is available to <a href="https://gctstudios.com/catalog/new-specials" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">preorder now</a>). I'm a fan of the Consequences Cycle Deck, mainly because it gave me a new theme for the Shiho clan, but there are some great cards for all factions here, and it will be interesting to see how the meta reacts in the next few months with this cycle deck and recent releases, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-bai-qian-themed-warband-review-for-emperor" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Imperials</a> and aggressive <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-ring-of-fire-review-to-battle" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Savage Wave</a>.</p><hr><p>The copies of&nbsp;<strong>Bushido Products from Wave 25</strong>&nbsp;<em>used to produce this review were provided by GCT Studios and bought by the Author.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atlus has launched a 30th anniversary website for the <em>Persona </em>franchise, and the first update, which will presumably bring more news about the series, is due next week.</p><p>Right now, the <a href="https://p-ch.jp/p30th/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">website</a> is pretty barebones; it simply shows artwork depicting some of the franchise's most iconic characters, including the protagonists of <em>Persona 3</em>, <em>4</em>, and <em>5</em>, as well as a banner promising an update on January 8th.</p><p>What we'll learn on that date remains to be seen, of course, although if I were a betting man, I'd expect more information about (and perhaps a release date for) the upcoming <em>Persona 4 Revival</em>. Perhaps we can even expect <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-4-remake-yuri-lowenthal" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3d0a3961-f7b9-4d4a-8bfd-9b72ce8d096a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Yuri Lowenthal to leak this one as well</a>!

<figcaption><em>Persona</em> has a new 30th anniversary website for you to check out.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The one thing I wouldn't hold your breath for when it comes to this website is an announcement for <em>Persona 6</em>. Atlus is busy with the aforementioned <em>Persona 4 </em>remake, and the studio is also still celebrating <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-sales-1m-already" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e36e5f7f-aa76-4099-89f0-cc0de577a8fe" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the success</a> of its latest RPG <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>(although that, admittedly, is made by the newly-formed Studio Zero).</p><p>With that said, Atlus has said that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-director-no-plans-series" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3eb30c86-5461-470b-923e-8c96fcd0675c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">doesn't currently have plans</a> to expand <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>into a series, so it's possible that the focus has shifted towards <em>Persona</em> for now. If <em>Persona 6 </em>was to be announced, then the 30th anniversary celebrations for the franchise as a whole would seem an ideal time to do so.</p><p>In the meantime, while you wait for a <em>Persona 6 </em>announcement (or whatever Atlus has in store for the anniversary), you can celebrate the franchise's music thanks to the <em>Persona </em>concert tour <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-concert-us-january-date-revealed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1d8554b0-8365-410f-a8ba-d0bee07489a8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">making its way to the US in January</a>.</p><p>Back in September, the franchise also received <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-3-reload-music-video" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dee0e73a-8716-4317-9058-a4d024355fa1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">its first official music video</a> in the form of a clip for "It's Going Down Now", the iconic battle theme from 2024's <em>Persona 3 Reload</em>.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what Atlus plans to reveal as part of the <em>Persona </em>30th anniversary celebrations. Make sure to keep an eye on the website if you want to be the first to see it!</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A PEGI rating has appeared for <em>Splatoon 3 </em>on Nintendo Switch 2, suggesting that a full Switch 2 Edition version of the game could be on the way soon.</p><p>The <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=Splatoon+3" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">rating</a> (which was first spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/splatoon-3-rated-for-switch-2-in-europe" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Gematsu</a>) lists the release date as December 31st, although that's almost certainly a placeholder, unless Nintendo intends to release the game in the next few hours. It's unlikely, but it's not impossible!</p><p>If a Switch 2 Edition of <em>Splatoon 3 </em>is planned, it'll be a different prospect to the free update released for the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-raiders-splatoon-3-switch-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="838585b0-e552-447b-bbf4-87e2329e177e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a few months ago</a>, which was announced alongside a brand new <em>Splatoon </em>spinoff game.

<p>Naturally, the game bears the same PEGI rating as its Switch version, which is to say a PEGI 7. The rating warns those buying <em>Splatoon 3 </em>about its "violence" and "in-game purchases", so if you're planning to pick it up on Switch 2, you have been warned.</p><p>The <em>Splatoon 3 </em>Switch 2 listing follows the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-updates-ending" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="606f040c-e9d7-4046-8557-17a8d3ce9a10" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">cessation of updates for the game</a> back in 2024, but don't worry if you haven't played for a while; the servers are very much still operational, so you can still enjoy games of <em>Splatoon 3 </em>whenever you like.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar with <em>Splatoon 3</em>, it is, as you might expect, the third installment of the <em>Splatoon </em>series, and like its predecessors, the game revolves around quick shootouts in which the goal is to ink the most territory for your team (although other modes are available as well).</p><p>The game also features a single-player campaign that's a little more fleshed out than those of its predecessors, as well as a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splatoon-3-fresh-season-2024-side-order-gameplay" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5c071dd8-431c-4f24-a396-4cd2494ff2fe" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">roguelike-focused DLC</a> expansion that was released back in 2024.</p>
<p>You can check out <em>Splatoon 3 </em>right now on Switch, and if this listing is to be believed, it'll be launching on Switch 2 soon as well. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>If you're not familiar with <em>2XKO</em>, it's a <em>League of Legends</em>-themed fighting game that includes characters from the celebrated MOBA.</p><p>Announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-fighting-game-officially-named-2xko-as-spectacular-new-gameplay-is" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f3ec28b2-9e16-4ae6-a24a-11a8af39db67" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back in 2024</a> (well, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-project-l-gameplay-details-revealed-by-riot" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6b4d1a85-12a2-46e6-82af-d985715a9e5d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">officially, at any rate</a>), the game features characters like Illaoi, Yasuo, and Teemo, and new characters are being added over time, so if your favorite isn't in the game yet, they may well be introduced soon.</p><p>After being in development for some years, <em>2XKO </em>launched in Early Access <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/2xko-early-access-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f9a82e6e-d1fa-4755-bf89-d3f786e17e74" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">in October last year</a>. It's free-to-play, so you can check it out without paying a penny if you want to, and presumably, the console releases will follow the same model.</p><p>The next champion to arrive in <em>2XKO </em>will be the sniper Caitlyn, and presumably, she'll be launching at the same time as the game does on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. That hasn't technically been announced yet, but we can probably expect a reveal when the trailer is officially launched.</p>
<p><em>2XKO </em>is available to <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">play right now for free on PC</a>, and it'll presumably be hitting PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S on January 20th. We'll have to wait and see whether that turns out to be the case or not. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
