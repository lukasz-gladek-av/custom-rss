            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has revealed the first sales figures for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, and it probably won't surprise you to learn that the game has dwarfed the two most recent entries in the series in terms of launch weekend figures.</p>

<p>Per a Capcom <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250304.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>managed to reach eight million sales within the first three days of its launch. That, as Capcom points out, is the quickest a&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game has reached that figure.</p>

<p>For comparison's sake,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World&nbsp;</em>hit <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/monster-hunter-world-shipped-5-million-units-in-a-weekend" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">five million</a> sales within the same period, while&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>, which was initially exclusive to the Nintendo Switch, reached four million.</p>

It's fair to say Capcom has a bona fide success on its hands with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>.</p>

<p>If you've been following&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' launch, its impressive sales performance probably won't surprise you. The game debuted to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">well over a million players on Steam at launch</a>, breaking records for both the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>franchise and Capcom as a whole.</p>

<p>The signs were there even before launch;&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>' first open beta, which was held across PC and consoles back in November, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">attracted more Steam players</a> than any game in the series had managed up to that point.</p>

<p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>was expected to do so well before launch that&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-pocketpair-monster-hunter-wilds-day-off" rel="nofollow">gave the majority of its staff the day off</a> on Friday, recognizing that many employees would just call in sick to play the game anyway.</p>




<p>The game's success hasn't come without a cost. Although critical reviews are broadly positive, players have provided much more mixed feedback for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, especially <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on PC</a>, with many pointing to lackluster performance and poor multiplayer implementation.</p>
