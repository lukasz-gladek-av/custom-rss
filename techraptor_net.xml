<p>As noted by Mechanistry in the aforementioned post, <em>Timberborn </em>has come a long way since launching in Early Access back in 2021, having received a number of major updates adding new features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/folktails-vs-iron-teeth-in-timberborn-guide" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bb42b48a-a7ed-45d4-ac0d-3e0e65fc6fce" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">distinct factions</a>, 3D <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-update-6" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d6f3a308-53b5-4b6b-98c6-0d19b287537f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">physics</a>, and new maps, plus lots more.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Timberborn</em>, it's a colony-building sim that takes place on an Earth ravaged by the worst excesses of mankind. Humans have disappeared, but it's okay; beavers are here to pick up the slack.</p><p>You'll guide your colony of beavers through the early stages of building their city, and you'll tend to important management aspects like food production, protection from the elements, and environmental engineering.</p><p>You can check out the new <em>Timberborn </em>lore trailer, which should give you a good sense of what kind of world the game takes place in, right here. Take it away, Shaun.</p>
<p>Upon launching into Early Access, <em>Timberborn </em>proved a pretty major success for Mechanistry, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-sales-surpass-100k-copies-in-first-week" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="66101916-f924-4827-b377-416c6d46fbb6" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">attracting over 100,000 sales</a> within the game's first week of release. Here's hoping it can replicate that early interest for the 1.0 release.</p><p><em>Timberborn </em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1062090/Timberborn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and it's getting its 1.0 release on March 5th. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
