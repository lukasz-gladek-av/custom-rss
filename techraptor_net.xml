            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks as though a new Lego <em>Zelda </em>set has been leaked for March, and if you're a fan of seminal Nintendo 64 adventure <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, then this set should make you very happy indeed.</p><p>As spotted by Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1qe6y4h/zelda_77093_the_final_battle_ocarina_of_time/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">BrickTap</a>, the set will seemingly be called "The Final Battle: <em>Ocarina of Time</em>", and, as the name suggests, it'll depict the climactic fight between Link and Ganondorf at the conclusion of the 1998 classic.</p><p>If the leak is correct, then the set will contain just over 1000 pieces and will feature minifigures for Link, Zelda, and Ganondorf, as well as a brick-built Ganon, Link's Megaton Hammer, and his indispensable fairy buddy Navi, as well as a set of recovery heart items.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Assuming BrickTap's information is solid, then The Final Battle: <em>Ocarina of Time </em>will be launching on March 1st and will set you back $130 (that's €120 or £100 if you're in Europe or the UK).</p><p>That might sound like a lot for what seems to be a relatively small set, but it works out at around 0.13 cents per piece, which, while slightly more expensive than the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-pokemon-fan-favorites-revealed" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="20154363-2140-41d8-aed8-9ac66d983fc8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">recently-revealed <em>Pokemon</em></a><em> </em>Lego set, still doesn't seem too bad.</p><p>The <em>Zelda </em>set also seems to be more expensive on a per-piece basis than many original Lego products, but it does look like the <em>Ocarina of Time </em>scene contains a lot of custom elements, so that could well be what's driving the price up.</p><p>This is, at any rate, far from Nintendo's only foray into the Lego world. There's the aforementioned <em>Pokemon </em>partnership, of course, but you can also grab Lego sets for properties like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-animal-crossing" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="25704771-aecd-4ebf-b2a8-3f90af39a5ca" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Animal Crossing</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-ever-lego-mario-kart-sets" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d55c03af-b288-4bcc-a242-7dec1b9f0687" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Mario</em></a>.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Nintendo hasn't officially announced The Final Battle: <em>Ocarina of Time</em> yet (<a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/categories/adults-welcome/article/legend-of-zelda-set-2026" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">in full, at least</a>), but if the leak is correct, there will probably be an official reveal soon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Netmarble has announced a delay for <em>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin</em>, which means you'll no longer be getting your hands on the free-to-play anime RPG in January.</p><p>As revealed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3679080/view/490461848218371595" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">a post on Steam</a>, <em>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin </em>will now be arriving in March. No more specific release date than that was given, though, so we still don't know exactly when you'll be able to play the game.</p><p>Netmarble says that the feedback it received during the game's recent beta period showed that more work was still needed on various key systems like UI, combat, and core controls, and so in order to deliver a more "polished experience", <em>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin </em>will take another couple of months.</p><figure role="group">

<p>If you want to know exactly what's changing with those extra couple of months, Netmarble has handily provided an <a href="https://7origin.netmarble.com/en/news/3/59" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">incredibly exhaustive rundown</a> of what the devs are doing to address user feedback.</p><p>The list includes refinements to various combat systems, improvements to the "convenience" of exploring <em>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin</em>'s world, and lots of quality-of-life improvements and visual enhancements as well.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin</em>, it is, as you've probably already surmised, an action RPG based on the popular <em>Seven Deadly Sins </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/seven-deadly-sins-origin-is-open-world-take-on-anime" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7c891282-93f2-45f2-b26d-54a896d4fd01" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">manga and anime series</a>.</p><p>The game, which will utilize gacha mechanics (because of course it will), casts you as Prince Tristan of Liones, who must embark on a journey through the land of Britannia to "restore order to a world thrown into chaos by the collision of time and space".</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out <em>The Seven Deadly Sins: Origin </em>when it launches sometime this March on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3679080/The_Seven_Deadly_Sins_Origin/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/the-seven-deadly-sins-origin/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and mobile devices. Stay tuned for more on this, including a new release date, as soon as we get it.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
