            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Critical Role has announced an upcoming Daggerheart charity stream. The aptly named Critical Role TGIT stream is a charity event, featuring both a live auction event and a Daggerheart one-shot set in the radical 1990s.</p>

<h2>The Critical Role TGIT Stream Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official blog post, the Critical Role TGIT stream will go live on Thursday, September 18 on eBay Live, Twitch, YouTube, and the Critical Role streaming platform, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-beacon-membership-service-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Beacon</a>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-wizard-artwork.jpg?itok=3zS1whLT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-wizard-artwork.jpg?itok=is2cqowM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The details on the post are scarce, but illustrative. The event will include Matt Mercer as the Gamemaster, Critical Role Foundation President and voice-actor Ashley Johnson, Will Friedle (<em>Batman Beyond</em>, <em>Boy Meets World</em>), Danielle Fishel (<em>Wizards Beyond Waverly Place</em>, <em>Shifting Gears</em>), Rider Strong (<em>Cabin Fever</em>), Jodie Sweetin (<em>Full House</em>), and Christine Lakin (<em>Step By Step</em>).</p>

<p>Those players will play a one-shot adventure using the blockbuster TTRPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a> set in a 90s-themed campaign frame. So get ready for Y2K anxiety, jnco jeans, neon, Tamagotchis,&nbsp; grunge music, and more. Given the actors at this table, expect a lot of cheeky references and inside jokes on top of these aesthetic trappings.</p>

<p>But this nostalgic time at the table is one part of the Critical Role TGIT stream. While the game is happening in real time, various pieces of Critical Role merchandise will be auctioned off through eBay Live. A portion of the proceeds will go to the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology (NCWIT).</p>

<p>The NCWIT provides 1,600 universities, companies, non-profits, and government organizations with resources for recruiting, retaining, and advancing women through industry and entrepreneurial careers in computers and technology nationwide.</p>

<p>In addition, some proceeds will go to the Critical Role Foundation's emergency relief fund. The Critical Role Foundation is a non-profit organization that partners with like-minded organizations to create grants. Those partners include <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/tonight-critical-role-asks-how-do-you-want-to-do-this-stephen-colbert" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Red Nose Day</a>, Shanti Bhavan, and the First Nations Development Institute.</p>
