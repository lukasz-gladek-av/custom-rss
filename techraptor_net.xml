            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has dropped a preview for another <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a> army. The upcoming <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Flesh-Eater Courts battletome contains new mechanics and updated rules for the delusional undead army, and GW has provided a sneak peek.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/nudwrxbe/knightly-bannermen-join-a-riotous-bacchanal-in-the-flesh-eater-courts-armies-and-regiments-of-renown/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community</a> post, Games Workshop provided a glimpse at the changes in the new <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Flesh-Eater Courts battletome. This is the second undead army to get a spotlight in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-fourth-edition-signals-new-age" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newest edition</a> of the fantasy miniatures war game recently. The other army was the ghostly <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-previews-changes-in-new-warhammer-age-of-sigmar-nighthaunt-battletome" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nighthaunt</a> army.</p>

That delusion can even be altered on the battlefield, adjusting the horde's behavior.</p>

<p>One of those changes are in the form of the Knights of New Summercourt delegation. It centers around Ushoran, Mortarch of Delusion. This delegation fights alongside Knights, Varghulf Courtiers, and Serfs. With "In Their Sire's Shadow," they can do a free Charge once per battle alongside Ushoran when certain conditions are met.</p>

<p>But Ushoran's behavior can change on a whim, which the <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Flesh-Eater Courts battletome embodies. Once per turn, Ushoran can use "A Duel, Good Sir!" to challenge an enemy general. If the general accepts, both they and Ushoran can only target each other until either one of them are defeated.</p>

<p>Since the Flesh-Eater Courts are undead, dying can be more of a setback than a danger. "Red Errantry Hosts" lets you set up a replacement unit of Knights that have been defeated, albeit with half the models (rounded up).</p>

<p>Additionally, all units can utilize certain passives. "Equinox Parade" gives units a Run bonus on round one. "Ritual Dance" gives a movement bonus in round 3. And "Eat Your Fill" lets units heal after combat on round four.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The <em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> Flesh-Eater Courts battletome will be available for pre-order this upcoming Saturday.</p>
