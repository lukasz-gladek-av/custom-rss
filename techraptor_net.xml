            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/z-man-games-announces-lord-of-rings-fate-of-fellowship-pandemic-middle-earth-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new licensed <em>Lord of the Rings</em> board game is coming to store shelves. Z-Man Games, the studio known for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/pandemic-legacy-season-0-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pandemic</em></a> series is using their beloved game system as a foundation for <em>Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</em>, a take on Tolkien's iconic world.</p>



<p>In an official blog post, Z-Man Games provides an overview of <em>Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</em>. It is, as expected, an adaptation of the Lord of the Rings trilogy where players must work together to destroy The One Ring in the fires of Mount Doom.</p>

Each player starts controlling two characters in their canon locations. Frodo starts in The Shire, Arwen starts in Rivendell, etc..From there, players can move characters to different places and join friendly characters and troops to form their fellowship.</p>

<p>Once the players finish their turn, shadow troops will deploy from Mordor and spread out, attempting to capture safe-havens. In addition, Sauron commands the Nazgul to stop Frodo from reaching Mount Doom. For the players to succeed, they will need to use stealth, resistance, friendship, and valor to overcome these dangerous challenges.</p>

<p>Like other <em>Pandemic</em> games, <em>Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</em> is replayable. The game includes 24 objective cards, each one based on iconic moments from the books, Each time you play, you can choose a different subset of cards, leading to other scenarios. Of course, there is the straightforward, but challenging scenario fans are familiar with.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time Z-Man Games has adapted a beloved fantasy property with their <em>Pandemic</em> system. The studio also adapted the iconic <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wrath-of-lich-king-board-game-available-now" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King</em></a> to gaming tables back in 2021. It even dipped into space fantasy with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-wars-clone-wars-pandemic-game-coming-to-target" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em></a> adaptation in 2022.</p>

<p><em>Lord of the Rings: Fate of the Fellowship</em> is available for pre-order right now. There is no official release date, but early adopters will receive a promotional Gandalf The White meeple and character card at no additional cost.</p>
