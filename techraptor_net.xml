<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th. It'll boast <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed" rel="nofollow">a 1080p screen</a>, a 4K-compatible dock, and support for up to 120fps, with 256GB of storage and backwards compatibility with original Switch games.</p>

<p>What's more, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-gamecube-switch-2-online" rel="nofollow">GameCube games will also be available</a> as part of the console's Switch Online library, although you will need an Expansion Pack membership to take advantage of that.</p>

<p>Pre-orders for the Switch 2 will open on April 8th, although it sounds like only "selected Nintendo Switch Online members" will be invited to pre-order the console first, with pre-orders subsequently opening up to more people. Stay tuned for more.</p>
