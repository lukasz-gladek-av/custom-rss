            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-festival-hatsune-miku-crossover<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has confirmed the rumored&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival&nbsp;</em>Hatsune Miku crossover, and it's coming as part of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s v33.20 update tomorrow, with the crossover set to run until early April.</p>

<p>In an official announcement post, Epic says that the crossover will give you the chance to unlock a Miku-themed outfit, as well as instruments and more, through the new Music Pass.</p>

<p>As a reminder, progressing any other&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>battle pass <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-battle-pass-xp-simplified" rel="nofollow">will now also progress the Music Pass</a>&nbsp;and give you the chance to earn all of its free stuff, although you will still need to pick up the premium pass if you want to unlock the extra rewards.</p>

<p>Instruments based on Miku's aesthetic are also available, including the Neko Miku Keytar and Guitar. The Keytar also packs a Brite Style which is perfect for the Brite Bomber-inspired outfit.</p>

<p>Additionally, Miku's "most iconic tunes" are also making their way to&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival</em>, including the legendary "M@GICAL☆CURE! LOVE SHOT!", which will be available as a Jam Track towards the end of the Music Pass.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-soul-aside-psn-requirement-pc-removed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-published-lost-soul-aside-wont-require-a-psn-account-on-pc-it-seems.1080744/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-soul-aside-psn-requirement-pc-removed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Ultizero Games appear to have quietly removed the requirement for PC players of upcoming action RPG&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>to have a PSN account in order to play.</p>

<p>According to the game's Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3378960/history/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">update history</a> (thanks, <a href="https://twistedvoxel.com/psn-account-no-longer-needed-for-lost-soul-aside-on-steam/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Twisted Voxel</a>), the PSN requirement was removed back in December, but Sony didn't announce the removal of said requirement at that point.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>isn't out yet, it's technically possible that the requirement was removed for some arcane administrative reason, and that Sony still fully intends to require PC players to sign up with a PSN account in order to play the game on PC.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-soul-aside-psn-pc-requirement-removed-snow.jpg?itok=UHtB-OHH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-soul-aside-psn-pc-requirement-removed-snow.jpg?itok=ghWu7udA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>may be one of the only PlayStation-published PC games not to require a PSN account to play.</figcaption></figure><p>However, if the PSN account requirement truly has been removed, then that would indicate it won't be necessary to sign up for a PSN account in order to play&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside&nbsp;</em>when it eventually comes out on PC.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, PSN accounts are required to play multiplayer Sony-published games on PC; games like&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>require one, if only for their multiplayer modes, while titles like&nbsp;<em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Returnal&nbsp;</em>don't need you to have a PSN account to play on Steam.</p>

<p>This isn't always the case, though. According to its <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2531310/info/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB page</a>, the upcoming PC port of&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered&nbsp;</em>will require players to sign up for PSN, even though it's a single-player game with no multiplayer component.</p>

<p>The PSN requirement for PC games is an issue for which Sony has gotten into trouble in the past. When Sony announced it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-account-link" rel="nofollow">would begin imposing a PSN account requirement</a> on&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>players, the backlash was so great that the company was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack" rel="nofollow">forced to walk its decision back</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-psn-requirement-pc.jpg?itok=SvbBRv23 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-psn-requirement-pc.jpg?itok=W1r2w-4m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered&nbsp;</em>will, for some reason, require a PSN account to play on PC.</figcaption></figure><p>We'll get to see whether&nbsp;<em>Lost Soul Aside</em>'s PSN account removal is for real when the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-soul-aside-release-window-2025" rel="nofollow">launches sometime this year</a>. It's set to arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3378960/Lost_Soul_Aside/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/lost-soul-aside/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> when it does.

If I'm just here to rack up an arcade score, I don't need to know the tragic backstory of my hero. Yet, there are plenty of games we do want to get lost in a good world or learn about a great character, and there's a lot of writing out there worth recognizing that goes above and beyond or gives us something we've never seen before.</p>

<p>Here are the nominees for TechRaptor's 2024 Best Writing Award for outstanding storytelling, worldbuilding, and character creation.</p>

<hr><h2>Third Place -&nbsp;1000xRESIST</h2>



<p>Developer: Sunset Visitor | Release Date: May 9th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p>

<p>Sunset Visitor's narrative game tells a potent tale, one that blends multiple themes with messy three-dimensional characters. The tale of Watcher and her glimpse into the life of her sovereign The All Mother is a nuanced spotlight on the effects of traumas small and large cascading into society. It is a meditative experience about what we do with our emotional baggage and how it can lead to the most horrible acts and the most noble of sacrifices.</p>

<p>For a debut title by a new studio, it is a narrative with measured confidence. One that expresses itself with passion, one that is spellbinding to experience start to finish</p>

<h2>Second Place - Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h2>



<p>Developer: MachineGames | Release Date: December 9th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p>

<p>You can create a game with a charming lead man with a fedora and a bullwhip that solves ancient puzzles, but it won't truly become<em> Indiana Jones</em> if the writing doesn't match the feel. A perfect mix of knowledgeable investigation into ancient cultures, sinister enemies monologuing, and quippy banter (but not too much of the last part.)</p>

<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> finds that mix introducing the players to a mystery and continuing to expand upon it, to new memorable characters that feel fully fleshed out in the world and giving us an Indiana Jones to embody that nails the original aesthetic to fulfil the nostalgia. All while offering new fans to the genre a faithful take to continue to explore the greater franchise (except <em>Crystal Skull</em>… you can ignore that one)</p>

<h2>Winner - Metaphor: ReFantazio</h2>



<p>Developer: Atlus | Release Date: October 11th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p>

<p>For everyone who cries out against politics in their video games, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> defiantly asks, "What if everything in the game was political?" It has the subtlety of a nuclear bomb, with metaphors veiled so thinly you could barely see the shrink wrap. Nonetheless, it's a poignant, meaningful story, especially amid the reality we've all (sort of) shared these past few years.</p>

<p><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> goes beyond simply saying, "This thing is unequivocally bad." There's nuance in its messaging, providing the player a launchpad to critically think for themself. For example, racism socioeconomically harms people, so we should see everyone as equals. But if you go too far, do we lose what makes each person and their culture special?</p>

<p>Louis and Sanctism aren't quite 1-to-1 caricatures of real-life figures, but there are enough parallels that the line between fantasy and reality can blur a bit. Is strongman leadership all it's cracked up to be? Is a church state really about religion, or power?</p>

<p>That blurring of reality and fantasy seems to be Studio Zero's goal, as portrayed by the (slightly convoluted) fantasy book within the game. The protagonist and his party often refer to a book about a skyscraper-laden utopia, both idealizing and questioning it. It's a direct commentary on what the player can and should do with the game itself.</p>

<p>Much like the <em>Persona </em>games before it, it's easy to come away with the overall message painting humanity in a bad light. But in reality, it's about finding the internal will and hope to fight for a better tomorrow for yourself and the ones around you.</p>
</div><div><p><span><div>
       
    <p>There's no I in TEAM!! We're all on the case, and this is how you know it :)</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-workaround<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>players have found a workaround for the game's recent clampdown on skin mods (as well as other mods), but it could result in your account being banned.</p>

<p>As reported on <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/marvel-rivals/marvel-rivals-players-already-found-a-way-to-bring-mods-back-3028424/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dexerto</a>, while it's no longer possible to simply use a mod manager to place&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>skin mods into the game's directories and expect them to work when booting up a match, a new workaround may still allow you to use your favorite mods.</p>

<p>There is, of course, a catch. Modding steadfastly remains a violation of NetEase's terms and conditions when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, so you could get banned if you're discovered using them, but that's always been the case.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-modding-ban-workaround-fight.jpg?itok=6DgmZkYw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-modding-ban-workaround-fight.jpg?itok=NJDiwzx1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to mod&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>&nbsp;despite the recent clampdown? You still can, but there's a big catch.</figcaption></figure><p>I don't want to get too technical here, but essentially, the new workaround involves gaining direct access to a certain kind of&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>file with the .pak extension.</p>

<p>As Dexerto points out, there's also <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/1162" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">another way</a> to circumvent&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' mod ban, but this one's creator has admitted it's a "temporary fix" and that unless you've got a specific hardware setup, you could damage your storage drive if you use it for character model modding.</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, NetEase <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-clampdown" rel="nofollow">clamped down</a> on&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>modding with the advent of Season 1 last week, introducing a new authenticity check for character skins that essentially invalidates most existing mods.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>skin modding scene was (and, to a certain extent, remains) quite active prior to this clampdown, with users creating mods that turned characters into the likes of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball</em>'s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/105" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Vegeta</a>,&nbsp;<em>GTA: San Andreas</em>' <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/63" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">CJ</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/83" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Big Smoke</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Chainsaw Man</em>'s <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/80" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pochita</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/awesome-games-done-quick-2025-raises-over-2-5m-for-cancer-charity.1080687/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/awesome-games-done-quick-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Charity speedrunning event Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 has come to a close, and the event has raised a huge amount of money for charity organization Prevent Cancer Foundation.</p>

<p>Per a press release, AGDQ 2025 has raised a grand total of $2,556,305 for the cancer charity, which advocates for cancer prevention and early detection. That's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/awesome-games-done-quick-raises-26-million-for-prevent-cancer-foundation" rel="nofollow">around the same amount raised</a> during Awesome Games Done Quick 2023 and slightly more than AGDQ 2024's total.</p>

<p>Like last year's event (but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/awesome-games-done-quick-2023-cancels-in-person-event" rel="nofollow">not the previous year's</a>), AGDQ 2025 took place over a seven-day period in Pittsburgh, PA, with over 2,000 people attending the event and "tens of thousands" of people streaming it online.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-awesome-games-done-quick-2025.jpg?itok=QtM_4ahR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-awesome-games-done-quick-2025.jpg?itok=S5BrogOk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Many games were streamed during Awesome Games Done Quick 2025, including&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As you'd expect if you've seen an AGDQ event before, many games were streamed during this year's marathon, and some of them enjoyed some pretty wacky accompaniments too.</p>

<p>Highlights, as a press release points out, include Dr. Doot's saxophone-driven&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>stream (which you can see below), as well as an actual opera performance by Xem upon completion of his&nbsp;run of&nbsp;<em>Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando</em>.</p>

<p>You may also have seen FunkopotamusWes playing&nbsp;<em>New Super Mario Bros. Wii&nbsp;</em>using his head and feet while using his hands to play the piano, then doing the same while blindfolded. No wonder the amount raised for charity was so high.</p>

<p>Lest you think AGDQ 2025 focused only on good games, though, think again; the Awful Block segment featured streamers playing through games like the legendarily godawful&nbsp;<em>Superman 64&nbsp;</em>and the just-plain-weird&nbsp;<em>Golf With Your Grandmother</em>.</p>




<p>Awesome Games Done Quick 2025 concluded on Sunday morning with a&nbsp;<em>Super Metroid&nbsp;</em>run, which feels like a nice, classic way to bring proceedings to a close.</p>

<p>If you missed any of the runs that took place during AGDQ 2025, you can check them all out via the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gamesdonequick" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Games Done Quick YouTube channel</a>. You can also still make a donation to Prevent Cancer Foundation <a href="https://preventcancer.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via its official website</a> if you'd like to.</p>
