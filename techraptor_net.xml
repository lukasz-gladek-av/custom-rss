            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you've been wondering what's happened to&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2</em>, then wonder no more, because Konami has an update for you on how development is going.</p>

<p>As spotted by social media user <a href="https://x.com/Kuwabara357/status/1971126048017322123" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Outsider Snake</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-is-still-moving-forward-properly-konami-says/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>),&nbsp;<em>Master Collection&nbsp;</em>producer Noriaki Okamura provided more information about the second volume of the collection during this week's Konami Tokyo Game Show spot.</p>

<p>According to Okamura (via Outsider Snake's translation), development on the second volume is "moving forward properly", and the collection as a whole is "shaping up to be something enjoyable", but fans should "wait just a little longer" for more information about the project.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol.-2-snake-eater.jpg?itok=Jkvw5vd8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol.-2-snake-eater.jpg?itok=A7d8P9Lc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1&nbsp;</em>was released back in 2023, and a second volume is expected.</figcaption></figure><p>Okamura goes on to say that it's "hard to say" exactly how much longer we'll have to wait for more&nbsp;<em>Master Collection Vol. 2&nbsp;</em>news, but that Konami is still working on the compilation, which feels like good news in and of itself.</p>

<p>Of course, we still know very little about what&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2&nbsp;</em>will feature. Presumably, since the last collection left off at&nbsp;<em>Snake Eater</em>, the new volume will offer a remastered version of&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</em>, but beyond that, it's tough to say.</p>

<p>If I had to guess, I'd say <i>Vol. 2&nbsp;</i>will remaster&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em>,&nbsp;<em>Portable Ops</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Peace Walker</em>, and that bonus versions of&nbsp;PSP card battlers&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Ac!d&nbsp;</em>and its sequel will be offered as well, although that might just be wishful thinking on my part.</p>




<p>In any case, if you want to play more&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear</em>, you'll have to content yourself with the recently-released (and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-1m-sales" rel="nofollow">rather successful</a>)&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>for now. Hopefully, we'll get more info about&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2&nbsp;</em>sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>Back in 2021, Konami <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-1m-sales" rel="nofollow">pledged to revive</a>&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>with new titles, as well as&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>. Since then, we've seen the release of the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>remake, as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-officially-revealed-konami" rel="nofollow"><em>Silent Hill f</em></a>, so perhaps&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>will get its turn in the sun next (although that would probably turn it to dust).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo of America president and COO Doug Bowser (yes, really) has announced he will step down from the company at the end of the year, and his replacement has already been appointed by the Japanese gaming giant.</p>

<p>Per a press release, Bowser, who has spent "more than a decade in multiple leadership positions" at Nintendo, will retire from the studio on December 31st. He'll be replaced by current marketing executive VP Devon Pritchard, who will also be joining the NOA board of directors.</p>

<p>Additionally, Nintendo's American division will gain Satoru Shibata as its CEO, although he'll be continuing to serve as managing exec and corporate director of Nintendo as a whole as well. That's a heck of a lot of plates to juggle.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-reggie-fils-aime-doug-bowser.jpg?itok=N3wyhGnJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-reggie-fils-aime-doug-bowser.jpg?itok=tTeHTxPU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bowser replaced Reggie Fils-Aime as Nintendo of America president back in 2019.</figcaption></figure><p>Doug Bowser has served as the president of Nintendo of America since 2019, when previous title holder Reggie Fils-Aime <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/reggie-fils-aime-retires-after-15-years-at-nintendo" rel="nofollow">stepped down</a> after over ten years in the position.</p>

<p>Fils-Aime was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/reggie-fils-aime-inducted-into-video-game-hall-of-fame" rel="nofollow">inducted into the International Video Game Hall of Fame</a> in October that same year, going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/reggie-fils-aime-joins-gamestops-board-of-directors" rel="nofollow">join GameStop's board of directors</a> shortly before the pandemic began (and around ten months before the whole <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamestop-stock-trading-halted-due-to-sudden-spike" rel="nofollow">GameStop stock debacle</a> kicked off).</p>

<p>Bowser hasn't revealed what he's intending to do next, but he did express pride in what he'd achieved during his time with Nintendo, "in both business results and the experience we've created for consumers".</p>

<p>He also praised his replacement, Devon Pritchard, calling her "exceptional" and pointing to her promotion as "a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to [Nintendo's] growth".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-doug-bowser-switch-2.jpg?itok=KYmDAiFJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-doug-bowser-switch-2.jpg?itok=lMpM2seN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Doug Bowser's final major launch at Nintendo was the Switch 2 earlier this year.</figcaption></figure><p>During his tenure with Nintendo, the company says Bowser "deliver[ed] on the promise of the Nintendo Switch" and "helped establish [the Switch 2] as the best-selling video game console of all time", which isn't a bad track record.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what Bowser does next, but given the way corporate America works, I'd be very surprised indeed if we don't see him popping up on another board of directors somewhere. Stay tuned for more.</p>
