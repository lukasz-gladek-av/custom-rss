            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Conatus Creative has announced that its retro side-scrolling beat-'em-up <em>River City Ransom: Underground </em>is being delisted from Steam soon, so if you want it, grab it while you can.</p><p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/422810/view/524236943144258012" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">rather brief post</a> on Steam, the developer says that the delisting is happening "due to the expiration of a licensing agreement", and that the delisting process "is currently underway", which likely means you can expect the game to disappear from Steam in the next week or two.</p><p>If you already happen to own <em>River City Ransom: Underground</em>, then, as Conatus says, "nothing changes". You'll still be able to play the game, and it'll still appear as part of your Steam library. It's worth saying that the game is also currently on sale at an 85% discount, so now's the time to pick it up.</p><figure role="group">

<p>It's not clear whether this delisting also applies to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gog-acquired-original-co-founder" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ac0fe303-b1f6-4fb9-85b5-0996e982944e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">under-new-management GOG</a>, where <em>River City Ransom: Underground </em>is also currently available (although the Steam discount doesn't apply there, so you'll be paying full price for the game if you pick it up from GOG).</p><p>Conatus also hasn't been clear about exactly what the "licensing issue" in question is, but it's possible it relates to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/river-city-ransom-underground-changing-soundtrack-alex-mauer-saga" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b63edfed-3fed-4ec0-8058-2670c03f1458" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">dispute with music creator Alex Mauer</a> back in 2017, which saw the creator issuing DMCA claims not only to Conatus, but also to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/updated-another-week-more-sets-of-dmcas-alex-mauer-saga" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e2e1c438-2fdb-407b-885c-ad191b1b159c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">other creators on YouTube</a>.</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>River City Ransom: Underground</em>, it's a beat-'em-up in the <em>River City </em>series, which is known in Japan as <em>Kunio-kun</em>. Unlike 2023's <em>River City: Rival Showdown</em>, this one <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/river-city-ransom-remake" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e10f316f-6ac8-4a1e-b2d7-9d8209ad5f21" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">isn't a remake</a>; rather, it's a completely new title in the franchise.</p><p>Like its forebears and successors, <em>River City Ransom: Underground </em>is a story-driven side-scrolling fighter in which you'll control one of 10 playable heroes across a campaign that will let you explore 140 different levels and upgrade your characters across 22 shops.</p><figure role="group">

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>New data has revealed that the Nintendo Switch 2 has already surpassed the lifetime sales of one of the Japanese gaming giant's previous pieces of hardware in the UK, as well as two other consoles from the annals of history.</p><p>As pointed out by <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/2006017882128285792" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">analyst Chris Dring on X</a> (citing data from the analytics firm NielsenIQ), the Switch 2 has now passed the lifetime sales of the Wii U, which was released back in 2012 (and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-cans-project-giant-robot-wii-u-production-ceases" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3f5a85c7-dec2-4131-b5e3-122748abca15" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">discontinued in 2017</a>) in the UK.</p><p>Admittedly, the Wii U was largely considered to be a commercial failure, but the Switch 2 managing to surpass its entire sales total in the UK within just six months or so is still a fairly impressive achievement, even if the competition isn't particularly fair.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Ah, Wii U. We hardly knew, er, U.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>According to Dring and NielsenIQ, the Switch 2 has also managed to pass the UK's lifetime sales total for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/days-of-playstation-vita-are-over" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4acfe571-2451-4f5a-a457-7180f86e895c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">PlayStation Vita</a> and the Sega Dreamcast, although, again, it's fair to say both of those machines were fairly ill-fated.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, though, fewer people bought those consoles across their entire life cycles than the Switch 2 in its first six months (in the UK, at least). Whether or not figures are similar across the world is hard to say, but I wouldn't be surprised if the picture is the same in the US and elsewhere.</p><p>Nintendo released the Switch 2 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c11b67d9-d8b1-4556-871d-041c5101dcf0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back in June this year</a>, and within the console's first two months on sale, it had managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-financials-q1-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0df1a582-9b9c-40ce-97e3-524ba446cf4f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">pass the six million sales mark</a>. Reportedly, Nintendo has asked its Switch 2 manufacturing partners to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-25m-production-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7d44c0b0-340a-4585-9a19-51b01545f6f9" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">produce 25 million units of the console</a> by March 2026.</p><p>Many popular games will be making their way to the Switch 2 in the coming months, too, including the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-switch-2-delayed-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e7fa2ba9-4e00-4f97-a4ff-d9244ef5b612" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, ghost-hunting game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-switch-2-version-on-way-next-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="159fca3c-8df3-41ad-98da-95af3a28123c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Phasmophobia</em></a>, and choice-based adventure title <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dispatch-switch-2-switch-eshop-listing" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1bcf2169-2693-40a4-ab6c-88b2398c75da" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Dispatch</em></a>.</p>
<p>You can nab a Nintendo Switch 2 for yourself via official channels right now. The same sadly can't be said for the Wii U, the Vita, or the Dreamcast, although I'm sure second-hand markets have their fair share of machines if you're interested. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
