            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has announced that it's teaming up with tech company LG in order to make its cloud streaming app accessible in a select number of vehicles, so it looks like cars can now be Xboxes as well.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer titled "This Is an Xbox That Goes Vroom", the Xbox Cloud Gaming app (which is still technically in beta) is "coming soon to select cars in partnership with LG".</p>

<p>Essentially, any car that uses LG's Automotive Content Platform will be able to access the Xbox Cloud Gaming app. As pointed out by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/774177/microsoft-xbox-car-lg-partnership-cloud-streaming" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Verge</a>, that includes the likes of the Kia EV3, as well as the brand's upcoming EV4, EV5, and Sportage vehicles.</p>

<p>For what I hope would be fairly obvious reasons, this system also appears to be limited to passenger screens. Still, it should help entertain your kids, your friends, or your partner while you're on a long (or short, I ain't judging) road trip.</p>

<p>This is all part of Xbox's ongoing "This Is an Xbox" campaign, which aims to expand the Xbox platform <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/next-gen-xbox-hardware-sneak-peek" rel="nofollow">beyond traditional console and gaming hardware</a> (although the company is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rog-xbox-ally-release-date" rel="nofollow">still very much putting its stamp on that as well</a>).</p>

<p>Other devices shown off as part of the campaign include smart TVs, VR headsets, and laptops, so it's clear that Xbox is looking to extend its reach beyond its ailing Xbox Series X|S consoles.</p>




<p>Xbox and LG don't provide a date for the debut of Xbox Cloud Gaming on the Automotive Content Platform, instead settling for "soon". Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Xbox-related.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-update-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksongs-first-update-will-make-some-bosses-slightly-easier.1292502/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Team Cherry has revealed what you can expect from the first major&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>update, and if you've been having a tough time with a couple of the game's early bosses, you'll appreciate this one.</p>

<p>As revealed in a Steam Community post, the much-hyped Metroidvania's first update is due sometime next week. If you're trying to play&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>completely blind, you may want to avert your eyes for <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595159519774039622/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">these patch notes</a>, but they shouldn't spoil anything too major.</p>

<p>The first big change is two early-game bosses, Moorwing and Sister Splinter, getting a "slight difficulty reduction". Additionally, some mid-game Bellway and Bell Bench prices have been reduced, which is good news for anyone who's constantly starved for Rosaries (myself included).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-update-boss.jpg?itok=lPylT6fc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-update-boss.jpg?itok=bk8ZMdbo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>'s early bosses have had their difficulty reduced.</figcaption></figure><p>Relics and psalm cylinders will now award slightly more Rosaries, on that note, as will courier deliveries. Additionally, you should take less damage from Sandcarvers once the update drops.</p>

<p>There are plenty more changes coming as part of this first patch, but they mostly pertain to bug fixes; there arguably isn't anything earth-shattering here, but it looks like Team Cherry is listening to the discussion around&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s difficulty, at the very least.</p>

<p>If you're somehow unaware of&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, it's a Metroidvania that serves as a sequel to 2017's much-celebrated&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>, and it's also one of the most talked-about indie games of the last decade.</p>

<p><em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">finally released last week</a> after a lengthy period of relative silence from Team Cherry, and the announcement of its release date in August caused several indie developers to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-delays" rel="nofollow">move the release dates</a> of their own games, while its actual launch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-crashing-storefronts" rel="nofollow">crashed several of the storefronts</a> on which it was made available.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/hollow-knight-silksong/9n116v0599hb" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and the Nintendo Switch family of consoles. The game's first major update is due to land somewhere in the middle of next week.</p>
