            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-their-first-chaos-vault-drop-for-magic-gathering<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast has announced a new Secret Lair drop for <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. But this drop isn't a crossover with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-magic-gathering-marvel-crossover-details-revealed-including-new-secret-lair-and" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Marvel</a> or packed with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-pixel-perfect-secret-lair-brings-retro-vibes-to-table" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">retro game vibes</a>. It is part of a new experiment being conducted by the tabletop company, a Secret Lair spin-off known as the Chaos Vault.</p>



<p>The announcement of the Chaos Vault Secret Lair drop was understated. There is a single <a href="https://x.com/MTGSecretLair/status/1866177659492843768" rel="nofollow">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) from the official <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> account. It simply reads, "The Vault Opens. Chaos Reigns." in block capitals alongside artwork and a link.</p>

The drop is called The Fairest Drop of All and the description states that it will operate differently from other Secret Lair drops.</p>

<p>First, there is only one version of the drop available: in foil. Second, orders are limited to one per customer, possibly to deter mass purchases by scalpers. Third, the drop is noticeably cheaper compared to other foil Secret Lair drops, being sold at an MSRP of $24.99.</p>

<p>As for what is in the Chaos Vault drop, it contains four foil reversible cards: <em>Estrid's Invocation</em>, <em>Steely Resolve</em>, <em>Estrid, the Masked,</em> and <em>Tuvasa, the Sunlit</em>. All four cards feature alternative artwork by artists Jessica Hische, Simen Meyer, Yehrin Tong, and Teagan White.</p>

The most elaborate of the cards is <em>Tuvasa, the Sunlit, </em>which gets the full profile treatment.</p>

<p>It is unclear at time of writing if this is the Chaos Vault drop of many. If the name is any indication, the artstyle or cards chosen may not be consistent either. As such, the appeal of these drops may hinge on novelty, scarcity, and fear of missing out. Only time will tell just how chaotic these drops will get.</p>
