            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pre-orders are now live for Osprey Games' newest skirmish game. <em>Hide, Stone, and Bone</em> is a notable departure from the studio's historical and fantastical routes, tasking players with ensuring the survival of early man during the Ice Age.</p><h2>The <em>Hide, Stone, and Bone</em> Pre-Order Announcement</h2><p>According to its store page, <em>Hide, Stone, and Bone</em> is a skirmish wargame of prehistoric survival. Players lead tribes of early men as they hunt and survive during the brutal conditions of the Ice Age.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>These moments of survival are broken up into Big Days. Big Days represent substantive events like mammoth hunts, cave bear attacks, and clashes with rival tribes. Between these events, you must gather food, craft tools and weapons, and consult shamans for guidance. Once these events happen, break out the miniatures and the dice. These skirmishes and hunts are resolved using a d10-based alternating activation system.</p><p>The core experience of <em>Hide, Stone, and Bone</em> is its detailed campaign system. The ultimate goal is survival. This means, even if the dice are against you while fighting other tribes, your group can still thrive in the long run.</p><p>The game is the tabletop debut of Austin Hunt. According to his bio, Hunt has been a war gamer for over two decades, playing in multiple games across different genres. The book features illustrations by Netherlands artist Mars Oosterveld, whose work has also featured in <em>Paleomythic</em>.</p><p>Osprey Games is known for a diverse catalog of skirmish games. Their work has ranged from the miniature agnostic sci-fi dogfights of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/voidfighter-review-sci-fi-dogfights-done-right" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Voidfighter</em></a> to the fantasy battles of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/frostgrave-limited-deluxe-edition-celebrates-10-years-of-skirmish-mayhem" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Frostgrave</em></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Steam Best of 2025 list has been announced, and it includes a list of the top-selling games on the platform this year, as well as other stats for the storefront.</p><p>According to the list, Steam's top-selling game in 2025 was <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>, a feat that perhaps isn't too surprising given the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-3m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c5a6dab0-4602-48f3-8a89-7254df3e04d7" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">impressive sales total</a> just a few months out from its launch.</p><p>Technically speaking, <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds </em>is the top-selling game of the year, but since it's a free-to-play title, I'm skipping over it. Strangely, despite its impressive performance in the sales stakes, <em>PUBG </em>isn't the most-played game of the year; that honor goes to <em>Grand Theft Auto V </em>(and, by extension, <em>GTA Online</em>).</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>GTA V</em>, and thus presumably <em>GTA Online</em>, has made it onto Steam's Best of 2025 list.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's a real live-service jamboree in the top sellers list; other titles include <em>Arc Raiders</em>, which also managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/arc-raiders-sales-4m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="08dd5792-c4a8-4824-90f6-27b50a7dc7fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hit a pretty impressive sales milestone</a> in its first couple of weeks, as well as <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, <em>Battlefield 6</em>, and <em>Apex Legends</em>.</p><p>The first non-multiplayer title on the list after <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II </em>is the drug-dealing simulator <em>Schedule I</em>, followed by <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which is arguably on the borderline given its cycle of frequent updates (although it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3047bd12-37c9-4b65-bd39-064968be79fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">certainly is a big seller</a>).</p><p>When it comes to the Steam Deck, the most-played games of the year skew much more towards time sink-style single-player adventures, including the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-v-has-sold-over-195-million-units-red-dead-redemption-2-at-61-million" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="79f14bf8-3a01-4742-90f0-f879fca71b70" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Red Dead Redemption II</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-has-way-over-10-million-players-mod-support-has-been-in-works-since" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a6faddb2-01d3-46aa-a769-c7be021e6a4f" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>, and <em>Hollow Knight </em>(although two of those do indeed support multiplayer).</p><p>The list even tracks the games most often played with a controller, and it won't shock you to learn that the likes of <em>Split Fiction</em>, <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, and, yes, <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em>figure heavily on that particular list.</p><figure role="group">

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>All things change. With the passing of days, into seasons, into years, the cycle continues. The Jwar Isles are no different, and with these changes, come new opportunities, new allies, and consequences. In this article, we take a look at the new Consequences Cycle Deck for the <em>Bushido</em> skirmish wargame, along with 4 new fighters from among the Wave 25 releases.</p><p>We've been covering <em>Bushido&nbsp;</em>for years, so if you'd like to learn more about the game, check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/bushido-risen-sun-guide" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">our guide to <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em></a>, our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">review of the <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>&nbsp;2-player starter set</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/start-collecting-bushido-risen-sun-part-1-introduction-and-developer-interview" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">our "Start Collecting" guide to <em>Bushido</em></a>, which includes an interview with the game's developer.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Ride The Wave</h2><p>You might be wondering what we mean by Wave 25. It's simply a way to refer to a combination of products that release together. In this case, Wave 25 for <em>Bushido</em> was a huge release, with 13 new miniatures and the Consequences Cycle Deck. Here we're only taking a look at 4 of the new miniatures, but also available were:</p><ul><li>Temple of Ro-Kan - Kongu, Kuren, and Masaru</li><li>Prfecture of Ryu - Takashi Horaki</li><li>Cult of Yurei - Lotus Kaidan</li><li>Minimoto Clan - Aida and the Kami of Enduring Embers</li><li>Ronin - Yu</li><li>Silvermoon Syndicate - Minori</li><li>The Kinshi Temple - Tomoaki</li></ul><picture>

  </picture><h2>Consequences Cycle Deck</h2><p>Cycle Decks in <em>Bushido</em> are a way for GCT to easily incorporate new cards, rather than packaging them with specific miniature releases. When constructing your warband, you can only use cards from 1 Cycle pack (Risen Sun, Weeping Sky, or Consequences). The Concequences Cycle Deck, like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-weeping-sky-cycle-deck-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Weeping Sky Cycle Deck</a> before it, contains 54 cards for a mixture of factions and card types, including:</p><ul><li>Events, usually actions that can be played during the game</li><li>Terrain, which can be deployed onto the battlefield for specific effects</li><li>Enhancements, that are attached to units to offer effects and abilities</li><li>Themes, offering new abilities if the warband construction restrictions are followed</li></ul><p>We recently previewed several cards from the Consequences Cycle Deck, which you can see <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-exclusive-preview" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p><p>The Consequences Cycle Deck contains cards for all factions, except the Awoken and Imperial March, the 2 newest factions that will receive cards in future Cycle decks. The faction breakdown for the deck is:</p><ul><li>Cult of Yurei - 4 cards (1 enhancement, 1 enhancement equipment, 2 events)</li><li>Ito Clan - 4 cards (2 enhancements, 2 events)</li><li>Jung Pirates - 4 cards (1 enhancement, 1 enhancement equipment, 2 events)</li><li>Minimoto Clan - 4 cards (2 enhancement, 1 event, 1 terrain)</li><li>Prefecture of Ryu - 4 cards (4 enhancement equipment)</li><li>Savage Wave - 4 cards (1 theme, 1 enhancement, 1 enhancement equipment, 1 event)</li><li>Shadow Wind Clan - 3 cards (1 enhancement, 1 enhancement equipment, 1 event)</li><li>Shiho Clan - 4 cards (1 theme, 1 enhancement, 2 events)</li><li>Silvermoon Trade Syndicate - 4 cards (2 enhancements, 1 enhancement equipment, 1 event)</li><li>Temple of Ro-Kan - 4 cards (3 enhancements, 1 enhancement equipment)</li><li>The Descension - 4 cards (2 enhancements, 2 events)</li><li>The Kinshi Temple - 4 cards (2 enhancements, 2 events)</li><li>Ronin - 7 cards (3 enhancements, 1 enhancement equipment, 3 events)</li></ul><p>Apart from those we previewed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/bushido-consequences-cycle-deck-exclusive-preview" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">previously</a> (I'm a huge fan of Consequences of Kiyohara and New Eagle Army), my favorite card from the set is the Shadow Wind Clan's Opposition Preparation, which stops enemy fighters from using a whole host of abilities when targeted by North Star fighters for the first time. I love the thematic pre-battle reconnaissance that the ninjas would have done to preempt and disrupt enemy abilities before even going into combat with them.</p><p>As with previous cycle decks, the more factions you play, the more you will get out of this deck, but even players with a single faction (as long as it's not Awoken or Imperial March) will get their faction's cards and the Ronin cards to use. It will also give you an idea of what your opponent might be taking (as you can see the cards in the app for list building purposes, but not the details), and who knows when you'll pick up a new faction in the future. I've been strictly Shadow Wind and Shiho Clan for a while, but with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-wretched-review-living-nightmare" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Wretched</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-passing-night-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Passing the Night</a> themed warband releases (both of which are incredible), I've found myself suddenly playing 2 new factions this year.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Somabo the Blue Crane</h2><p>Somabo is a Ronin fighter that can only be recruited into The Descension warbands, or those that include Hiroto (either the Ronin Drunken Master or Shiho Black Eagle versions). &nbsp;Somabo is fast, with movement 5 (with +1 move if running and doesn't suffer melee penalties for running), 4 dice in attack, and armed with a +1 damage katana or claws (depending on whether you want the katana's critical attack/sidestep defence or claws' pierce, bleed, or combo attack).</p><p>Somabo's Squall Strike ki feat lets them move 1 inch after an attack if they make a damage roll, along with up to 2 other friendly Tengu models within 4 inches. Finally, their Umbrella Block ki feat gives them parry until the end of the melee exchange.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Vekye</h2><p>Vekye is a Cult of Yurei fighter with a move of 5 and 2 types of attacks. Vekye can either go for standard damage, with +1 damage claws with pierce, bleed, and combo attack, or the +0 damage tainted hands with grapple attack. If Veyke manages to hold their opponent with grapple, at the end of the round, the held model (as long as it's not soulless) takes an additional 2 wounds and gains a spirit block marker that stops them from generating ki tokens next round.</p><p>Veyke has a Mutation ki feat that gives them either +1 melee weapon strength, regenerate 2, or armor 1 for the turn, depending on what they need, and a Fight or Flight ki feat, which grants them Banzai, allowing them to charge as a simple action, or Clowdwalk, which lets them ignore terrain and zones of control for movement. They also have Indomitable 1, which means they ignore the first enemy penalty for assisting in combat, along with coordinated attack Tengu, to benefit them when they gang up on an opponent.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-wave-25-spotlight-showcase-4.jpg?itok=Wjccdb6G 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-wave-25-spotlight-showcase-4.jpg?itok=TV2510E4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><h2>Yoshiko</h2><p>Yoshiko is the latest Rose for the Silvermoon Trade Syndicate. I picked up Yoshiko to add to my plan to make an entirely Rose warband because despite being part of the Silvermoon, their theme is very ninja-ish in their disguises, concealed weapons, and seduction techniques. Yoshiko is no different in that respect, but is a little more overt in her combat prowess. Yoshiko has move 5, as is standard with the Roses (except the veteran rose Misao), and jump up, evasive and lightfooted to keep them mobile, and disguise 5 to keep them protected. In attack, they roll 3 dice with their +0 damage Tachi that has push and stun attack, and sidestep defence.</p><p>For ki feats, Yoshiko has the powerful Contingency Plan, which can actually stop them from being removed and instead are placed out of the enemy's line of sight with all wounds healed by using the ki feat and passing an opposed ki test. She can also put scheme markers on nearby enemies at the end of her activations, and then remove them with the scheme ki feat that lets her recruit a permitted event card with a cost equal to the number of scheme tokens removed.</p><p>Yoshiko also has a 0-cost, once per turn, The Crowds Part ki feat that lets them move 2 inches. Enemies in base-to-base contact can spend 2 ki to stop it, but even that is very handy, either getting Yoshiko out of combat or burning 2 enemy ki. Finally, Yoshiko also lets you change the scenario target of a friendly VIM (Very Important Model) from the one selected to any with disguise. The model loses disguise, but it gives you control over the scenario target.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Shiho Kizo</h2><p>Kizo is my favorite release of this wave, a Ronin who plays into both my beloved Shiho Clan and Shadow Wind Clan. Kizo is not only a ninja, but also a samurai. Kizo's sculpt is covered in baby Karapan, and he comes with a 10-inch Karapling ranged attack with lightweight, so he doesn't suffer any modifications for moving and attacking with it. The attack doesn't need line of sight and ignores cover, can only be used once per turn, and instead of damage, gives a Bleed 2 marker to the target.</p><p>At the start of Kizo's activation, he can either heal 2 wounds on an animal in base-to-base contact or gain sixth sense until the end phase. When Kizo is recruited, it means that Shiho warbands can also recruit Karapan, and Shadow Wind warbands can recruit Ronin birds, both of which normally wouldn't be able to do so.&nbsp;</p><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Bushido Wave 25 Releases?</h2><p>There's a lot to love in Wave 25 of <em>Bushido</em> releases, and we've only covered 4 of the 13 miniatures that were released as part of it. The Temple of Ro-Kan did well with 3 releases in the wave, but there's a lot for most factions (with the Savage Wave and Awoken getting releases in the next wave, which is available to <a href="https://gctstudios.com/catalog/new-specials" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">preorder now</a>). I'm a fan of the Consequences Cycle Deck, mainly because it gave me a new theme for the Shiho clan, but there are some great cards for all factions here, and it will be interesting to see how the meta reacts in the next few months with this cycle deck and recent releases, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-bai-qian-themed-warband-review-for-emperor" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Imperials</a> and aggressive <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-ring-of-fire-review-to-battle" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Savage Wave</a>.</p><hr><p>The copies of&nbsp;<strong>Bushido Products from Wave 25</strong>&nbsp;<em>used to produce this review were provided by GCT Studios and bought by the Author.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>
