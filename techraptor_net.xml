      <div><p>The future of MCDM's fantasy RPG is looking bright. The crowdfunding campaign for <em>Draw Steel: Crack the Sun</em>, which introduces multiple substantive supplements to the game, has raised over $2 million.</p><h2>The <em>Draw Steel: Crack the Sun</em> BackerKit Campaign</h2><p>According to its <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/mcdm-productions/draw-steel-crack-the-sun" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, <em>Draw Steel: Crack the Sun</em> introduces seven new products to the game. This is the first major expansion for the fantasy RPG developed by MCDM, the studio founded by tabletop personality Matt Colville (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/flee-mortals-now-available-on-dd-beyond" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Flee, Mortals!</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mcdm-announces-end-of-arcadia-magazine" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Arcadia Magazine</a>).&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The first of these products is a third core rulebook full of nothing but premade encounters. Is it too much for your DM to make interesting or challenging encounters in <em>Draw Steel</em>? This 350-page hardcover book is for them.&nbsp;</p><p>The other two products introduce new player options. <em>Between Sun and Shadow</em> adds eight new ancestries to the game. <em>The Beastheart</em> adds the titular character class, letting you sneak and tear apart your foes with the fury of a hunter and their animal pet.</p><p>The last four products in the <em>Draw Steel: Crack the Sun</em> campaign are all prewritten adventures. The first three are smaller adventures for different tiers of play.&nbsp;</p><p><em>The Red Road</em> is a 2nd-level quest tasking players with stopping a horde of gnolls. <em>The Dark Heart of the Wood</em> is another 2nd-level quest about confronting an ancient evil in the woods. <em>The Condemned</em> is a third-level adventure around a group of gruff anti-heroes.</p><p>The last adventure is the biggest draw of the BackerKit campaign. Crack the Sun is Draw Steel's first epic campaign. It's an adventure broken up into five acts that guides players through the Metal Hurlant-inspired worlds of Orden and the Timescape.</p><p>The pledge levels for Draw Steel: Crack the Sun are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Draw Steel: Encounters Digital for $40:</strong> A PDF of the Encounters book</li><li><strong>Crack the Sun Digital for $40: </strong>A PDF of the Crack the Sun campaign</li><li><strong>Encounters Print and Digital for $70:</strong> A physical hardcover and PDF copy of the Encounters book</li><li><strong>Crack the Sun Print and Digital for $70:</strong> A physical hardcover and PDF copy of Crack the Sun campaign</li><li><strong>Crack the Sun &amp; Encounters Digital for $65:</strong> PDFs of Crack the Sun and the Encounters book</li><li><strong>Crack the Sun &amp; Encounters Print and Digital for $140:</strong> Physical hardcover and PDF copies of the Crack the Sun campaign and Encounters book, and a physical DM Screen</li><li><strong>Everything Digital for $135:</strong> PDFs of Crack the Sun, Encounters, Between Sun and Shadows, The Beastmaster, The Red Road, The Dark Heart of the Wood, and The Condemned</li><li><strong>Everything Print and Digital for $199:</strong> Everything in the Everything Digital pledge, Hardcover copies of Encounters, Crack the Sun, and softcover print copies of Between Sun and Shadow, The Red Road, The Dark Heart of the Wood, and The Condemned</li><li><strong>Limited Edition Crack the Sun Box Set for $299:</strong> A campaign-exclusive limited edition physical and PDF copy of Crack the Sun</li><li><strong>Cthrion Edition of Crack the Sun for $599:</strong> A campaign-exclusive Cthrion Edition physical and PDF copy of Crack the Sun</li></ul><p>As stated above, the <em>Draw Steel: Crack the Sun</em> campaign has raised <span data-controller="funding-counter" data-funding-counter-amount-value="2063038" data-funding-counter-currency-value="$" data-funding-counter-easing-value="easeOutCubic" data-funding-counter-target="amount" id="funding-counter-project-6808">$2,063,038, well over its initial funding goal of $1,250,000.
