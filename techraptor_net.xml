They have partnered with Rolling Wizards Games to produce <em>Onstage</em>, a trick-taking game that blends Vietnamese-inspired artwork with theater performances.</p>

<h2>The <em>Onstage</em> Board Game Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official press release, Arcane Wonders provides more details on the Onstage board game. Three to five players are part of a theater company competing for the best performers to join their troupe. It is a must-follow trick-taking game with a twist. The trump suit can (and often will) change mid-round, which will keep players on their toes. Each game takes 15-30 minutes to complete.</p>

Everything from the cards to the meeples to the game's pop-up stage all showcases a distinct art style featuring rich pinks, greens, blues, and dark reds.</p>

<p><em>Onstage</em> is the latest board game to join the Dice Tower Essentials line. This is a list of prestigious board games curated and hand-picked by board game critic Tom Vasel. This list has included the English language release of the 90s nostalgia-fueled board game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/video-game-champion-brings-retro-game-collecting-fun-to-gaming-tables" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Video Game Champion</em></a>, and Mitsuru Nakamura's cooperative number card game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ito-card-game-getting-western-localization" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Ito</em></a>.</p>

<p>Arcane Wonders has a similarly acclaimed body of work. Their past titles include the detective board game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/sherlock-13-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Sherlock 13</em></a>, and the deep diving board game <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/aquatica-board-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Aquatica</em></a>. They also helped produce an officially licensed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/call-of-duty-board-game-deploys-to-kickstarter-this-august" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Call of Duty</em> board game</a>. They partnered with Vasel in 2014 to expand its catalog with the curated Dice Tower Essentials line.</p>

The Vietnam-based studio's first game, <em>Stem and Branch</em>, is a fast-paced card game based on animals and elements from the Eastern zodiac. Each game is represented as a 60-year calendar.</p>

<p>The game will be sold during GenCon 2025. At time of writing there is no word on a retail release or price.</p>
