            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>Version 3.7, which brings a "highly anticipated" playable character, a brand new permanent game mode, and more early next month.</p>

<p>As announced in a press release, Version 3.7, "As Tomorrow Became Yesterday", launches on November 5th across all platforms. As you'd probably expect, the update's story follows on from that of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/honkai-star-rail-version-3-6-release-date" rel="nofollow">Version 3.6</a>&nbsp;and "marks the climactic finale of the Amphoreous saga".</p>

<p>You'll explore the Ruins of Time, where a huge sword marks the place in which Phainon used his power to seal away the dread Irontomb. Naturally, Irontomb is stirring once more, and it'll be up to you and your team to put him down again.</p>

Just by having her in your team, your party's damage will be increased.</p>

<p>Not only that, but Cyrene can deploy a Zone on the battlefield that deals an additional instance of damage to any enemy within it that's struck by an ally. Her Ultimate uses stacks of the Remembrance resource to activate her teammates' Ultimate abilities and to buff teammates further.</p>

<p>You can also expect a new gameplay mode in the form of Currency Wars, which sees players forming teams of up to ten fighters in order to take part in combat operations. 61 characters will be available as part of this mode, and you'll be able to try them all out as part of a free trial as well.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em><a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now for free</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices. Version 3.7, "As Tomorrow Became Yesterday", will launch on November 5th across all of these platforms. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokemon Legends: Z-A Sales Nearly at 6m for Opening Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-sales</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-legends-z-a-sales-nearly-at-6m-for-opening-week.1333954/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced first-week sales figures for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, and the game is outpacing past titles like&nbsp;<em>X&amp;Y&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Let's Go: Pikachu</em>, although it can't quite hold a candle to the series' heaviest hitters.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/PostImages/pokemon_pressreleases_20251023_2.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new official report</a> (thanks, <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1981553421472706640" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wario64</a>),&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>has sold 5.8 million copies since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-release-date-pokemon-presents" rel="nofollow">launching on October 16th</a>, and almost half of those sales were on Switch 2, so that's a pretty even split platform-wise.</p>

<p>As noted by sales analyst <a href="https://x.com/pierre485_/status/1981599907262714267" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pierre485</a>, this figure makes&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>the fifth fastest-selling&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>game in the series. It's lagging behind titles like <i>Scarlet and Violet</i>,&nbsp;<em>Sword and Shield</em>, and its predecessor&nbsp;<em>Legends: Arceus</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-sales-mega-gardevoir.jpg?itok=gHvRBstT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-sales-mega-gardevoir.jpg?itok=xbURqT-Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>sales have almost hit six million.</figcaption></figure><p>It's noteworthy that the five fastest-selling&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games are now all on Switch hardware. No doubt Nintendo will take this as an encouraging sign when it comes to the upcoming tenth generation of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games, details of which were apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-leak-2025-gen-10-more" rel="nofollow">leaked earlier this month</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, it's the second game in what is now the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends&nbsp;</em>sub-series, which shifts its gameplay away from the traditional series emphasis on catching 'em all in favor of a more narrative and research-led approach.</p>

<p>This time around, you're exploring the city of Lumiose in order to assist the Quasartico corporation with an urban redevelopment project, all while attempting to raise your trainer rank to the coveted A in the titular Z-A Royale event.</p>

<p>You can check out a trailer for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, which should give you a sense of what kind of game lies in store for you should you decide to check it out, right here.</p>




<p><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and the original <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-legends-z-a-121292/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.
