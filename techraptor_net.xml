            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has released its Q3 financial results for this fiscal year, and when it comes to consolidated results for the nine-month period as a whole, the studio is doing pretty well, as are some of its core franchises.</p><p>In its latest <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/3rd/explanation_2025_3rd_01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">financial presentation</a>, Capcom reveals that its sales, operating profit, and ordinary profit are all up by varying degrees when compared to March-December 2024, and the studio is on track for a better 2025-26 fiscal year as a whole, too.</p><p>When it comes to specific games, Capcom says the <em>Resident Evil </em>series, along with <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, "continued to grow" in sales terms, and that <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>managed to surpass the 11 million sales mark within the March-December period as well.</p><figure role="group">

<p>The new sales figure means <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>has garnered <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3047bd12-37c9-4b65-bd39-064968be79fa" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">another million sales since the end of March</a>, which rather validates Capcom's concern that sales slowed down dramatically after launch, although whether the so-called <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-barrier-capcom" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a0c5ff11-5fb9-4929-804b-8a8d4f7adae0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">"PS5 barrier" is to blame</a> is another matter.</p><p>Capcom also says that sales of the <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>remake<em> </em>and <em>Resident Evil Village </em>grew thanks to the announcement of <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, which is due to arrive next month. Both games had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-village-11m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="649d13dc-948c-45a4-b39b-fbab7260a9b1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">crossed the ten million sales barrier</a> at last count.</p><p>With regards to Capcom's future, the company has a pretty packed slate. The aforementioned <em>Resident Evil Requiem </em>leads the pack, but there's also <em>Monster Hunter Stories 3 </em>and <em>Mega Man Star Force Legacy Collection </em>to look forward to in March.</p><p>In total, Capcom sold 34.64 million game units between March and December 2025, which is around four million units higher than the previous year's total. It's fair to say Capcom is on the up right now.</p><figure role="group">

<p>We'll have to wait and see what else Capcom has in store for the year, but for now, the company will no doubt be celebrating this past nine-month period's improvements. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
