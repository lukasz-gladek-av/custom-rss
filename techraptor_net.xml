            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-and-closes-studio-making-it<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Electronic Arts has just cut up one of it's marquee upcoming games, the <em>Black Panther</em> game that Cliffhanger Games had been working on.</p>

<p>First reported by IGN, the information came from an email sent by EA Entertainment president Laura Miele, who shared that this change alongside others was to put their focus where they thought there was the opportunity for the most growth. Beyond Cliffhanger Games, and other recent cancellations like with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Respawn Layoffs Part of Wider EA Staff Cuts, Titanfall Project Reportedly Axed">Respawn and an untitled <em>Titanfall</em></a><em> </em>project, people have been laid off on its mobile, and central teams. While this is believed to be less than was laid off last month's 300 people, it is still a significant amount.</p>

<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-panther-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Black Panther Game Officially In The Works From New EA AAA Studio">Cliffhanger Games was announced in 2023 </a>along with the announcement of the <em>Black Panther</em> project, although formation of the team began in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ex-monolith-vp-kevin-stephens-starting-new-ea-studio" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Ex-Monolith VP Kevin Stephens starting new EA studio">2021 with Kevin Stephens</a>, formerly of Monolith Productions tagged as the studio lead. From the getgo, the goal was to target an area that EA has seemingly had some trouble with - the open world adventure category, particularly with sandboxes.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Stephens, a former VP at Monolith, brought experience working on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor"><em>Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor</em> </a>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/middle-earth-shadow-of-war-review-nemesis-reborn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Middle-earth: Shadow of War Review - A Nemesis Reborn"><em>Shadow of War</em> </a>games which were successes in the genre, with <em>Shadow of Mordor</em> a particularly innovative title. Rumors that it was a <em>Black Panther</em> game they were doing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rumor-black-panther-open-world-game-apparently-in-development" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" [Rumor] Black Panther Open World Game Apparently In Development">began circulating in 2022</a>, a year before it was revealed.</p>

<p>According to Miele, EA will be helping people find opportunities within EA, meaning that we may see less people laidoff than we would otherwise, instead merely having to uproot their lives at the whims of corporate decisions. The email also tells us a bit of what we can expect from EA Entertainment (Sports is it's own division): a focus on a handful of franchises. Those will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-battlefield-dev-diary-gunplay-movement" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" EA Details New Battlefield's Gunplay and Movement in First Dev Diary"><em>Battlefield</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sims-4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Sims 4"><em>The Sims</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-skate-reboot-no-offline-mode" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" EA's New Skate Game Won't Let You Play It Offline"><em>Skate</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/Apex%20Legends" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://techraptor.net/games/apex-legends"><em>Apex Legends</em></a>. Miele states that the <em>Iron Man</em> game in work at Motive Studios will continue, as will the third <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/Star%20Wars%20Jedi:%20Survivor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="https://techraptor.net/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor"><em>Star Wars: Jedi</em> </a>game, and&nbsp;Bioware's work on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-teases-new-mass-effect-epsilon-as-direct-sequel-to-me3-with-cryptic-video-hints" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="BioWare Teases New Mass Effect as Possible Sequel to ME3 With Cryptic Video &amp; Hints ">next <em>Mass Effect</em> game</a>. This comes also after they announced the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-rally-games-pausing-codemasters" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" EA &quot;Pausing Development on Future Rally Titles&quot;">pausing of various racing games </a>that had been in the works earlier this month.</p>

<p>One missing game from that list however is the third unannounced Marvel game that EA signed a deal for back when they announced <em>Iron Man</em> as part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/eas-iron-man-just-start-of-three-game-marvel-deal" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" EA's Iron Man Just The Start Of Three Game Marvel Deal">3 game deal</a>. Whether that game continues, or if it is never to even be announced is unknown with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Electronic Arts to Lay Off 5% of Its Workforce, Star Wars FPS Action Game by Respawn Canceled">EA souring on work with licensed properties</a>. Of course, we should take any future plans with a grain of salt - only two months ago Cliffhanger Games was <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cliffhanger-games_hiring-jobalert-jobopening-activity-7303112096915902466-2xDw?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAWFcNgBTnKdYM4ShDjI2C0H2DackkNIFLU" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cliffhanger Games Hiring People">looking to fill a number of roles</a>, and now it's shutting down.</p>

<p>Thus we can add <em>Black Panther</em> to the long list of games we'll never see, with its brief teaser being almost all the public footage that there is of it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/tales-of-valiant-players-guide-2-graces-kickstarter-today<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kobold Press has launched a new crowdfunding campaign for <em>Tales of the Valiant</em>. The aptly named <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> Player's Guide 2 campaign introduces expanded player options for the studio's fantasy TTRPG, including new subclasses and spells.</p>



<p>According to its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/deepmagic/players-guide-2-new-power-for-5e-and-tov-players/description" rel="nofollow">Kickstarter page</a>, <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> Player's Guide 2 offers players more customization options for their characters. This includes over 40 subclasses for pre-existing classes alongside three new classes: the Vanguard, Witch, and Theurge. Since <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> uses the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 5e <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-releasing-updated-dungeons-dragons-2024-srd-at-end-of-month" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SRD</a>, that means all material in the book is also compatible with Wizards of the Coast's TTRPG.</p>

This preview showcases the Vanguard, which can be described as a support martial character. They can deploy banners and use stratagems to protect and aid their allies. An example stratagem is Close Ranks, which makes your group immune to critical hits and from being forcibly moved for a turn.</p>

<p><em>Tales of the Valiant</em> Player's Guide 2 is a 250+ page supplement that includes the three new classes, 48 subclasses, 150 new spells, a magical tattoo system, rules on new downtime activities, customizable base-building rules, and new vehicle upgrades. Additionally, the campaign features a 32-page character journal, custom dice bags and luck tokens, and VTT support for Shard, Fantasy Grounds, Foundry, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/alchemy-rpg-kickstarter-fully-funded-in-one-day" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alchemy</a>.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers for Tales of the Valiant Player's Guide 2 are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Player's Guide 2 PDF for $29:</strong> A PDF of Player's Guide 2</li>
	<li><strong>Player's Guide 2 Hardcover and PDF for $59:</strong> PDF and physical copy of Player's Guide 2</li>

</ul><p>The campaign for <em>Tales of the Valiant</em> Player's Guide 2 addresses the concern of US <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/adjusted-us-trade-tariffs-to-china-still-poses-problems-to-board-game-industry" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trade tariffs</a>. As mentioned earlier, books are exempt from the tariffs; however, Kobold Press has fallback printers in the EU and Canada in case this situation changes.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the Kickstarter has raised&nbsp;$132,955, almost triple its initial funding goal of $50,000. the campaign ends June 27.</p>
