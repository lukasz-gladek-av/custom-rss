            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-march-2025-switch-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced a brand new Nintendo Direct presentation that's set to bring some more information about upcoming Switch titles tomorrow, but you should temper your expectations.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1904896350853960065" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new post</a> on social media platform X, tomorrow's Nintendo Direct will take place at 7am Pacific (that's 10am Eastern and 2pm GMT), and will feature "around 30 minutes" of info about "upcoming games for Nintendo Switch".</p>

<p>However, Nintendo swiftly clarifies that there won't be any information about the Switch 2 during tomorrow's Direct. If you want that, you'll have to tune in to the Direct <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">that will air next Wednesday</a>&nbsp;at 6am Pacific (and thanks to time zone shenanigans, that will also be around 2pm GMT).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-direct-march-2025-announcement.jpg?itok=cLYZaWsX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-direct-march-2025-announcement.jpg?itok=AtGCiPhN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Will we get more&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4&nbsp;</em>info during tomorrow's Direct?</figcaption></figure><p>As for what games we're likely to see during tomorrow's Nintendo Direct, there's a decent chance we'll be learning more about&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025" rel="nofollow">unveiled in full</a> during Nintendo's summer gaming show last year.</p>

<p>We still don't have a specific release date beyond (no pun intended) 2025 for&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, so hopefully, we'll get to learn exactly when we can play Samus' latest adventure. Of course, there's also a chance we'll learn it's coming to Switch 2 as well during next week's show.</p>

<p>A release date for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>doesn't seem especially likely given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-presents-february-2025-all-reveals-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">how recent its first gameplay reveal was</a>, but hey, I can't deny it's on my wishlist, so let's hope we get some more info about that one too.</p>

<p>Obviously, no gaming show, whether it's a Nintendo Direct, a State of Play, or an Xbox Developer Direct, is complete without a mention of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong" rel="nofollow"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a>. Will we get a release date for that tomorrow? It's highly unlikely, but a man can dream.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/war-of-visions-final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has announced that mobile tactical RPG&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>will shut down in May.</p>

<p>In August last year, it was revealed that&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down" rel="nofollow">would be ending service that October</a>, and now it's the turn of the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>-inspired strategy RPG spinoff to do the same, according to a <a href="https://wotvffbe.com/notice/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new announcement</a> on the game's official website.</p>

<p>According to Square Enix, while the studio attempted to "provide an enjoyable gaming experience" for&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions</em>' players, it's become "difficult to maintain a satisfactory app experience", hence the game's impending shutdown.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/war-of-the-visions-final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down-gameplay.jpg?itok=GHBnxXib 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/war-of-the-visions-final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down-gameplay.jpg?itok=eU648NzN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>will be shutting down in May.</figcaption></figure><p>As of today, it's no longer possible to purchase&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius</em>' Visiore currency from the game's shop, nor can you make any more Special Shop purchases.</p>

<p>Service will fully shut down on May 29th at 11:59PM Pacific, so you'll have until then to do whatever you need to do in&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions&nbsp;</em>before the game disappears forever. It doesn't sound like you'll be able to play any kind of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-offline-december" rel="nofollow"><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em>-style offline version</a>, either.</p>

<p>If you've got Google Play Points you want to exchange for items in&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions</em>, you'll be able to do so until April 30th, but any Visiore you've already got can be used right up until the game's service comes to an end.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not familiar,&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>is a tactical RPG spinoff of mobile RPG&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Brave Exvius</em>. It combines the strategic gameplay of games like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Tactics&nbsp;</em>with&nbsp;<em>Brave Exvius</em>' gacha mechanics and general free-to-play mobile trappings.</p>




<p>During its operation, the game crossed over with several major&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>titles, including the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/war-of-visions-final-fantasy-brave-exvius-reveals-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy X</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy V</em>.</p>

<p>You can still check out&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.WOTVffbeww&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/final-fantasy-be-wotv/id1484937345" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>. The game will be available until May 29th (or May 30th, depending on your time zone).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-157<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Polyphony Digital will release a new update for&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>later today, and as ever, it's adding some new cars, one of which is a certified British classic.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-156" rel="nofollow">last month's Update 1.56</a>, the aptly-named Update 1.57's first major addition to&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>is the Aston Martin Vantage '18, which Sony says has been referred to as "the best Aston Martin ever". It's the 2018 version of a car that became its own model line back in 2005.</p>

<p>Your second new car in this update is the&nbsp;Mazda CX-30 X Smart Edition ‘21, a crossover SUV designed to marry the best parts of sports utility vehicles with the convenience and compact nature of regular civvie cars.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mazda-cx-30-x-smart-edition-21-gran-turismo-7-update-1.57.jpg?itok=VPLPHh-2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mazda-cx-30-x-smart-edition-21-gran-turismo-7-update-1.57.jpg?itok=lP86IOP4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.57 has some new cars for you to try out.</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, you can also drive the&nbsp;Renault Kangoo 1.4 ‘01 in this update. It's a "popular leisure activity vehicle that started life as a commercial van", according to Sony. It's not a powerful machine, but it should get you from A to B, at least.</p>

<p>This being a&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>update, you can also look forward to new events in the World Circuits mode, as well as new Sophy AI enhancements and more. You can read everything that's new in this update <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/26/gran-turismo-7-update-1-57-available-today/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>In case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, it's the latest entry in Sony's long-running&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo&nbsp;</em>series of racing games. Like its predecessors, the game is a "simcade" racer, which means it balances realistic simulation with arcade-style accessibility and ease of use.</p>




<p><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>is also the only&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo&nbsp;</em>game it's currently possible to play without resorting to the second-hand market; last year, Sony delisted the PS4's&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo Sport&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-sport-delisted" rel="nofollow">without warning</a>, although it's still possible to play the offline portions of the game.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/gran-turismo-7/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>. Update 1.57 lands at 10pm Pacific tonight (that's 1am the following morning in Eastern time).</p>
