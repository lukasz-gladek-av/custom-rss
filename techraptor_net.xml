            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>ToeJam and Earl&nbsp;</em>co-creator Greg Johnson has announced his new game&nbsp;<em>Dancing with Ghosts</em>, which he and his company HumaNature Studios describe as a "life sim about finding joy from grief".</p>

<p>Set in a small Thai village,&nbsp;<em>Dancing with Ghosts&nbsp;</em>casts you as Mai, a young girl who loses both of her parents in an accident. When she meets Pim, a ghost who can't remember who she was in life or how she died, the two must set out on a journey to "process their identities".</p>

<p>Johnson got the idea for&nbsp;<em>Dancing with Ghosts&nbsp;</em>following the sad and untimely passing of his daughter at just 28 years old, as well as "his family's loss of everything in the 2023 <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Maui-wildfires-of-2023" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lahaina fires</a>", according to a press release announcing the game.</p>

<p>To make&nbsp;<em>Dancing with Ghosts</em>, Johnson sought the aid of local artists Ferrai Duanghathai and Tanta Voratawankul, as well as the Thai Bit Egg animation studio and "long-time" Indonesian collaborator Ferry Halim, so it's got some serious authenticity behind it.</p>

<p>In gameplay terms, Johnson says you can expect the "chill, sim-type gameplay of a living village" in which you'll help villagers with their problems, earn karma, and play "cultural mini-games that are integrated into the themes of the story". It's got serious&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/spirirfarer-review" rel="nofollow">Spiritfarer</a>&nbsp;</em>vibes, so if you love that game, you may well like this one too.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Dancing with Ghosts</em>, which gives a good sense of what the game will look like in motion, right here.</p>




<p><em>Dancing with Ghosts&nbsp;</em>debuts on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1352700/Dancing_with_Ghosts/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and Nintendo Switch sometime next year, and if you want to help support its development, there'll be a Kickstarter campaign to contribute to in October.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Playtonic has announced the <i>Yooka-Replaylee&nbsp;</i>release date, and it's being added to an October that's already stuffed to the gills with big releases.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Replaylee&nbsp;</em>will be launching across PC and current-gen consoles (including Switch 2) on October 9th. It'll set you back $29.99, with a physical version also available for an extra $20 if you prefer.</p>

<p>If you happen to own <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/yooka-laylee" rel="nofollow">the original</a>&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Laylee</em>, then you'll get a 30% discount if you buy&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Replaylee&nbsp;</em>on the same platform family. That means if you picked it up on PS4, you'll have to get it on PS5 for the discount, and so forth.</p>

Playtonic says it's "peeled, polished, and power-bounced" the original game "into its final form" with this new version.</p>

<p>According to Playtonic,&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Replaylee&nbsp;</em>will boast "not just...a fresh coat of paint", but also "thoughtful upgrades and joyful surprises" to enhance the original game's experience. The bat and lizard's adventure has been "carefully redesigned" to make it "more modern, more welcoming, and more joyful" for players.</p>

<p>As far as specifics go, you can expect a retooled story with new events and plot points, as well as improved visuals in both the art and animation departments. The controls and camera system have also been reworked, and the titular duo have access to all of their moves from the get-go as well.</p>

<p>Tons of gameplay improvements and tweaks are also on the way in&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Replaylee</em>, including a new map and collectibles tracker, a new currency to collect, and revamped Rextro minigames consisting of "brand-new isometric platforming challenges".</p>




<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Yooka-Replaylee</em>'s release date follows on from developer Playtonic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playtonic-layoffs-yooka-laylee" rel="nofollow">being hit by layoffs back in May</a>. It's likely not an exaggeration to say that the studio is probably banking on the new game to lift both its spirits and its finances.</p>

<p><em>Yooka-Replaylee&nbsp;</em>launches for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on October 9th.
