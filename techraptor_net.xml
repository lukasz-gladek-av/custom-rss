            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atomfall-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rebellion has announced the release date for its post-apocalyptic survival-action game&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>, and the UK-set game is set to arrive on PC and consoles in spring next year.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/801800/view/6491470391966433300" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a Steam post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>arrives on March 27th, and it's also coming to Game Pass on day one, so if you're a subscriber, you'll get to check it out at no additional cost on Xbox consoles.</p>

<p>Rather unusually, this one's coming to Xbox One and PS4 as well as current-gen machines, too. Let it never be said that Rebellion doesn't provide for those who are still attached to their last-gen consoles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atomfall-release-date-gunman.jpg?itok=mstIcy2k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atomfall-release-date-gunman.jpg?itok=mURP-yNj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>should provide succor for those who feel underserved by more recent Bethesda&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>fare.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>is, it's a post-apocalyptic action-RPG inspired by real events but with a decidedly fictional bent.</p>

<p>The game is set five years after the very real Windscale nuclear disaster, a 1957 fire that caused radioactive material to leak from the eponymous Windscale nuclear site. In&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>'s universe, though, that disaster had much more far-reaching consequences than it did in real life.</p>

<p>As you explore&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>'s quarantine zone, you'll scavenge for resources, meet the locals, and contend with "bizarre characters, mysticism, cults, and rogue government agencies". In real life, of course, most of us Brits just apologized profusely, as is our wont.</p>

<p>You can check out the&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>release date trailer, which also gives a glimpse into the game's peculiarly British post-nuclear landscape (although it's not quite the blasted hellhole of&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>or <em>Stalker</em>), right here.</p>




<p><em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>will give you the chance to use both ranged and melee weapons, but ammunition is scarce, so you'll have to blend firearms with melee weapons in order to create viable combat strategies.</p>

<p>If you're partial to the likes of the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-mod-million-downloads" rel="nofollow"><em>Fallout: London&nbsp;</em>mod</a> or the British dystopian vibes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/we-happy-few" rel="nofollow"><em>We Happy Few</em></a>, then&nbsp;<em>Atomfall&nbsp;</em>should definitely be on your wishlist. The game is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/801800/Atomfall/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007896" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/atomfall/9nc4wdl5kzbl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> on March 27th.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-development</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/thunderful-hit-by-yet-more-layoffs-as-studio-refocuses-on-publishing.1035759/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-development<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>SteamWorld&nbsp;</em>studio Thunderful has announced another round of layoffs in a further "strategic restructuring program" that's set to affect dozens of employees, mostly focused across the company's development divisions.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://thunderfulgames.com/thunderful-doubling-down-on-game-publishing-scaling-back-internal-development/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post on its official website</a>, Thunderful says these layoffs are intended to reflect "a greater focus on third-party game publishing and a reduction in investments in internally-developed projects".</p>

<p>Company CEO Martin Walfisz says announcing Thunderful's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-restructuring" rel="nofollow">second "restructuring" wave this year</a> is "unfortunate", but that the company "see[s] no other alternatives in order to ensure the Group's long-term sustainability".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-thunderful-layoffs.jpg?itok=nrjCFLcx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/steamworld-heist-2-thunderful-layoffs.jpg?itok=4D4NpPWP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You might know Thunderful's name from the&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld&nbsp;</em>franchise.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the news post, Thunderful's latest round of layoffs will "result in the termination of a large portion of the development team", although the layoffs won't exclusively be restricted to developers.</p>

<p>Between 80 and 100 employees will be affected by these layoffs. Thunderful says that its subsidiary Coatsink won't be in the firing line, but it seems like the company's other development divisions are all in the crosshairs, so to speak.</p>

<p>News of Thunderful's second layoff wave this year follows on from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-closes-studio-financials" rel="nofollow">closure of&nbsp;<em>Last Kids on Earth and the Staff of Doom&nbsp;</em>developer Stage Clear Studios</a> back in May, at which point Thunderful also reported a 28% drop in revenue on a year-on-year basis.</p>

<p>While Thunderful hasn't released official sales figures for its recent game launches, we do know that city-builder&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld Build&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/thunderful-says-steamworld-build-underperformed-reveals-it-s-looking-to-sell-headup" rel="nofollow">fell short of company expectations</a>, and it seems the release of tactical RPG&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld Heist 2&nbsp;</em>earlier this year wasn't enough to recover things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die-thunderful.jpg?itok=2l9OONUD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die-thunderful.jpg?itok=Cs_cjM5e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Upcoming Thunderful releases include&nbsp;<em>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Thunderful's news post doesn't make any suggestion that the company will be canceling upcoming releases, so you can expect recently-announced projects like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-in-random-eternal-die-roguelike-announced" rel="nofollow">the roguelite&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-in-random-eternal-die-roguelike-announced" rel="nofollow">Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</a>&nbsp;</em>to go ahead.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Thunderful isn't the only company being subjected to what companies would likely call "challenging market conditions" in recent times.</p>

<p>Big companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Sony</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Take-Two</a> are also being hit by layoffs and studio closures, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-employees-strike" rel="nofollow">smaller studios</a> aren't escaping unscathed either. These are truly difficult times for the gaming industry, it seems, although of course, that's not stopping <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">C-suite execs</a> reaping <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">rewards galore</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Infinity Nikki Release Date Revealed for Next Month]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/infinity-nikki-release-date-revealed-for-next-month.1035720/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Infold Games has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>release date, so if you've been waiting for an open-world game that's packed with cutesy and cozy vibes to get you through the winter, today's your lucky day.</p>

<p><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>officially arrives on December 5th, and it's coming to PC, PS5, and mobile devices. Sadly, it doesn't look like the game will be getting a Steam release anytime soon, so you'll have to grab it via its own launcher or via the Epic Games Store.</p>

<p>According to Infold Games,&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>has managed to attract 30 million pre-registrations in the runup to its release, so it's clearly striking a chord. Given that this is the fifth installment in the series, perhaps that's to be expected.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-nikki-release-date-platforming.jpg?itok=gGfjMrhp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-nikki-release-date-platforming.jpg?itok=OiBTDOQh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>lands next month.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>is helmed by&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>alumnus Kentaro Tominaga, who served as a game designer on 2017's influential&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-wild" rel="nofollow"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em></a>, as well as working in a directorial capacity on the likes of&nbsp;<em>The Wind Waker&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Twilight Princess</em>.</p>

<p>It's not hard to see the influence of more recent&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games on&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>, but Infold's game places much more of an emphasis on cozy open-world exploration rather than combat and conflict (although that's definitely in there too).</p>

<p>The studio is promising activities like pet grooming, fishing, and fashion competitions in&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki</em>, as well as "evocative and engaging story quests" and plenty of platforming challenges to keep you busy as well.</p>

<p>You can check out the release date announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>below. It also features the game's theme song, "Together Till Infinity", which is performed by pop star Jessie J.</p>




<p><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>arrives for PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices on December 5th.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/embracer-group-sales-fall-by-20-as-company-sells-casual-giant-easybrain-for-1-2b.1035717/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Swedish conglomerate Embracer Group has released its financial results for the second quarter of the 2024-25 fiscal year, and things aren't looking great for the company, although a massive casual studio sale might help things along a touch.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q2-july-september-2024-adjusted-ebit-amounted-to-sek-1207-million/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial statement summarizing the quarter</a>, Embracer reveals that net sales dropped by 21% on a year-on-year basis, while sales across the first six months of the financial year dipped by 23% (again compared to the same period last year).</p>

<p>More specifically, PC and console sales dropped by 46% for Embracer this quarter and by 40% across the first six months of the fiscal year. Embracer puts this down in part to the underperformance of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-mickey-rebrushed-release-date" rel="nofollow">remaster&nbsp;<em>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</em></a>, which the company says sold "slower than expected".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-embracer-group-financials-q2-2024.jpg?itok=1SUBCpaB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-embracer-group-financials-q2-2024.jpg?itok=NPXY4TOl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed&nbsp;</em>hasn't done very well for Embracer, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>Embracer also says that the releases of&nbsp;<em>Remnant 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em>in the same period last quarter makes the year-on-year comparison "tough". It's worth noting here too that&nbsp;<em>Payday 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-studios-ceo-steps-down" rel="nofollow">hasn't exactly done too well</a> since launch, so it's not really providing a constant revenue stream for Embracer.</p>

<p>Along with its financial results, Embracer has also announced the sale of casual gaming giant Easybrain, the company that owns the Sudoku.com domain.</p>

<p>It's been sold to fellow casual gaming purveyors Miniclip for an eye-watering $1.2 billion, which, along with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/raid-shadow-legends-developer-bought-620m" rel="nofollow">recent sale of&nbsp;<em>Raid: Shadow Legends&nbsp;</em>developer Plarium for over $600 million</a>, just demonstrates how strong the mobile and casual markets are.</p>

<p>In general, it's a bit of a gloomy forecast for Embracer; not a single one of the business' divisions has reported increased sales either this quarter or across the April-September period.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024-easybrain.jpg?itok=JaDa76aP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/embracer-group-financials-q2-2024-easybrain.jpg?itok=FIgHLC_v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Easybrain is now under the Miniclip company umbrella.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the Embracer statement, the company also expects its overall yearly earnings to be lower due to "the delay of a number of notable H2 releases".</p>

<p>The company's lineup for the second half of the fiscal year includes&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-release-date-delay" rel="nofollow"><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tomb-raider-4-6-remastered-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>Tomb Raider 4-6 Remastered</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hyper-light-breaker-trailer-shows-pulse-pounding-action-reveals-release-window" rel="nofollow"><em>Hyper Light Breaker</em></a>, with releases like&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gothic-1-remake-collectors-edition" rel="nofollow">Gothic 1 Remake</a>&nbsp;</em>also apparently set to arrive sometime in the next year or so.</p>

<p>We're also currently awaiting the splitting of Embracer into three separate companies, as was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies" rel="nofollow">revealed back in April</a>. Embracer says that Asmodee, in particular, which will handle the company's tabletop properties, is poised to "build on its successful track record" and "[unlock] shareholder value".</p>
