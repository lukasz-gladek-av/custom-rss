            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-roadmap-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has revealed the&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds&nbsp;</em>roadmap for 2025, and while no new map is on the way this year, you can expect lots of major world updates, as well as destructible terrain being introduced to more maps, new gameplay features, and more.</p>

<p>As revealed in a news post on the&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>website, the 2025 roadmap revolves around three pillars: "exciting new content", "enhancing the live service", and "long-term sustainability".</p>

<p>With regards to new content for&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>, "major world updates" will be introduced at the end of the year. Krafton says no new map will be introduced, but that the "old beloved maps" will be transformed with "completely new ways to experience them".</p>

<p>Additionally, Krafton is promising that 2025 will bring further improvements to&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>'s "player actions, vehicles, and items", and the team is also "working on diversifying and polishing player actions".</p>

<p>The developer also promises more collaborations and "co-development with external studios", announcing that the planned&nbsp;<em>Payday&nbsp;</em>crossover, which will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/payday-pubg-crossover-starbreeze-krafton" rel="nofollow">co-developed with Starbreeze Studios</a>, is scheduled for "the first half of next year".</p>

<p>As for this year,&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>is getting collaborations with two "top-tier automotive brands", as well as new artist collabs and more "player-driven collaborative content". There's tons on the way for&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>this year, and you can check out the full 30-minute roadmap video right here.</p>




<p>There's also tons of information in the aforementioned post about how Krafton intends to improve&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>'s live service elements, the game's transition to current-gen consoles later this year, and more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-borderline-justice-warbond<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Arrowhead Game Studios have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond by the name of Borderline Justice, and it's ready to dispense some of the titular frontier violence later this week.</p>

<p>Landing on March 30th (that's Thursday),&nbsp;Borderline Justice follows on from recent&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbonds like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond" rel="nofollow">Servants of Freedom</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-truth-enforcers-warbond" rel="nofollow">Truth Enforcers</a>, and it's packing a new primary and secondary weapon, a new explosive, and more.</p>

<p>First up, picking up this Warbond will grant you the chance to use the R-6 Deadeye, a lever-action hunting rifle that will carry a lower rate of fire but a deadly kick. It's perfect for single targets, but it might not serve you quite as well for crowds.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-borderline-justice-warbond-revolver.jpg?itok=BzW_0kn1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-borderline-justice-warbond-revolver.jpg?itok=QvvtDEMF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s new Warbond gives you the chance to be an intergalactic cowboy.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the rifle, you'll also get access to the LAS-58 Talon, which is about as close to a revolver as you're going to get in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s futuristic universe. It may not have a revolving chamber, but it sure does pack a punch.</p>

<p>The new TED-63 Dynamite explosive is also part of the Borderline Justice Warbond, and you can use it either to make yourself feel like an old-timey prospector or just to blow up a horde of bugs. It's up to you.</p>

<p>Of course, like all good cowboys, you can also utilize the LIFT-860 jetpack to put you above the action. Hey, it can't all be Wild West-themed, now can it? You can also look forward to two new sets of armor, both of which have the Gunslinger passive to give you better reload speed and reduced recoil on your secondary weapon.</p>




<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>news, back in January, the game's creative lead Johan Pilestedt announced that he would be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical" rel="nofollow">taking an extended break from work</a>. When Pilestedt returns, he says he'll be working on the new Arrowhead game.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s Borderline Justice Warbond arrives on March 20th. The game is available right now for PC and PlayStation 5, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/helldivers-2-review-fighting-for-managed-democracy" rel="nofollow">check out our review here</a>.</p>
