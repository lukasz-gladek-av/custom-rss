            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco is continuing their string of re-releases with the launch of <em>Tales of Berseria Remastered</em>. Originally out for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PC, this year marks ten years since the game was first available.</p><p>While <em>Tales of Berseria</em> isn’t necessarily old enough to warrant a full overhaul, the <em>Remastered</em> version includes many of the same quality of life updates found in the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tales-of-graces-f-remastered-review-spirited-journey" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em></a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/tales-of-xillia-remastered-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Tales of Xillia Remastered</em></a>. These include things like access to the Grade Shop right away, which lets players boost the gameplay experience.</p><p>They’re nice additions to have and make one of the more standout entries in the series even better.</p><picture>

  </picture><p><br><em>Tales of Berseria</em> tells the story of a woman named Velvet who, in a series of tragic situations, loses her family. Left with her ailing younger brother, the pair live in a quiet village with her brother-in-law Artorius.&nbsp;</p><p>As time passes, the calamity that killed her family returns. Known as the Scarlet Night, daemons are brought to their village once again – and this time it’s Velvet’s brother Laphicet who gets tangled up in a sacrificial ritual.&nbsp;</p><p>It turns out Artorius has bigger plans, and Velvet gets tangled up in them too, resulting in an element called Daemonblight infecting her arm and turning her into a Daemon known as a Therion – a being that can eat and absorb other daemons.</p><p>Tossed into prison with revenge on her mind, Velvet’s story picks up three years later when she’s freed along with fellow prisoners who form an unlikely band of bad guys to get back at Artorius for his role in the state of the world.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p><br>Along the way, Velvet meets up with the likes of other daemons, witches, and spiritual beings known as malakhim. Together, they’re tasked with defeating the Exorcists with the greater goal of eventually stopping Artorius.</p><p>There’s a lot of drama along the way, and <em>Tales of Berseria</em> doesn’t shy away from darker themes – there’s nothing heroic here. But that works to its advantage, and one of my favorite things about the story is peeling back the layers of these characters and seeing them as more than just villains.</p><p>It’s really, really ambitious, and the payoff is certainly worth the nearly 50 hours it takes to reach the conclusion.&nbsp;</p><p>In between all that, <em>Tales of Berseria</em> has a more action-specific battle system. That is, it’s approached more like a hack and slash game in terms of pushing buttons for combos, and a lot of this can be customized in the Artes menu depending on how you prefer to play.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p><br>Known as the Liberation-Linear Motion Battle System, each character can use a number of physical or magic attacks, with the player controlling Velvet and the other party members operating through the CPU. Skills are assigned to each button and can be chained through pressing them in succession, like a typical combo.</p><p>Each character also uses what’s called a Soul Gauge, which can stack up to five souls and deplete when Artes get used and then recharge as the battle continues. It's definitely a more involved battle system, but getting the hang of each skill and building up those skills is plenty satisfying.</p><p>While <em>Tales of Berseria</em> sticks to the four character party in battle, additional characters can be swapped in or out with the press of the d-pad. Characters can also be given stock commands, such as going all out or putting up more defense.</p><p>Outside of battle, there are various other things to keep you busy, like gear customization, cooking, ship exploration, monster hunts, card-based minigames, and some sidequests that populate near the end of the game. There’s not a huge variety, but it’s at least something in addition to the main quest.</p><picture>

  </picture><p><br>On the visual side of things, <em>Tales of Berseria</em> is about what you’d expect from a game that already existed on PS4 and PC ten years ago. That is to say, there’s not much in the way of visual upgrade other than making it run on PS5, and I did notice some glitches here and there. Specifically, some low-resolution textures, blinking lighting, and it seems like the element that makes up the save point isn’t scaled properly, and that really stood out to me.</p><p>That said, everything else seems to be more or less intact. The voice acting is stellar, the game runs smoothly during gameplay, and most of the visual art style holds up. And again, it’s only been ten years since release, so it hasn’t had time to really age out of style.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, if you haven’t played <em>Tales of Berseria</em> on PC or PS4, now’s a good time as any to check it out. The game acts as a prequel to <em>Tales of Zestiria</em>, which will no doubt see a re-release down the line, as Bandai Namco seems keen to keep the series fresh in people’s minds as they prepare an all-new entry.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Tales of Berseria Remastered</em> does its job in the meantime, and while there are some minor issues with textures and lighting, the core of the game remains as delightful as ever.</p><hr><p><em>TechRaptor reviewed <strong>Tales of Berseria Remastered</strong> on PlayStation 5 with a code provided by the publisher.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Legends of Avantris have announced a new Kickstarter campaign for a new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> book. The campaign is for Neon Odyssey, a sci-fi space opera setting inspired by retro games, pop culture, and synthwave.</p><h2>The <em>Neon Odyssey</em> Kickstarter Announcement</h2><p>According to a press release, <em>Neon Odyssey</em> is a fantasy-forward sci-fi setting. It prioritizes optimism, adventure, and stylish presentation over hard sci-fi rules or attempts at real world physics. The focus is more on fun and atmosphere than simulation. The book will feature character-driven adventures with big tone, big style, and table-ready momentum.</p><picture>

  </picture><p><em>Neon Odyssey</em> is set in Legends of Avantris' own <em>Stardust Rhapsody</em> setting. Players will explore various planets and space stations as bounty hunters. These jobs involve targeting people, robots, data and more. Those jobs will earn credits, which can be used in upgrading ships and gear, and may pull players into deepening conflict with larger factions at play.</p><p><em>Neon Odyssey</em> differs greatly from Avantris' last project, the spooky adventure <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/crooked-moon-review-incredibly-spooky-adventure-that-dms-will-love" rel="nofollow"><em>Crooked Moon</em></a>. This book is not a single scripted adventure, but a setting book packed with modular content and plug-and-play missions. Meaning it can support everything from one-shots to major years-long campaigns. Its influences include 80s and 90s anime, synthwave edge, and pop culture nostalgia.</p><p>The Kickstarter will produce three books. The <em>Outrunner's Handbook</em> contains re-imagined, sci-fi versions of classic D&amp;D classes, subclasses, species, backgrounds, spells, and more. The Cosmic Codex contains worldbuilding material on the setting, including 13 factions, over 30 alien worlds, 6 interdimensional realms, over 250, monsters, 40 missions, and more than 120 items.&nbsp;</p><p>The third book is the <em>Overdrive Expansio</em>n, which contains more of everything. This includes optional and advanced systems like Professions, Racing, Stress &amp; Entertainment, and ship upgrading. Combined, all three of these books will proved 1,400 pages of new material for your gaming table.</p><p>The Kickstarter campaign for Neon Odyssey will go live on May 5, 2026.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
