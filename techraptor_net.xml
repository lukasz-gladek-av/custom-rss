            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-first-edition-artist-proof-set-on-sale-for-2-million<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dedicated <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> collectors have gotten a golden opportunity recently. A new listing on eBay promotes the sale of a complete <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> First Edition Artist Proof set. That is over 300 cards signed by dozens of contributing artists. As for the price, you may need to take out some serious loans.</p>



<p>The official <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/386107788022" rel="nofollow">eBay listing</a> of the complete <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>First Edition Artist Proof set was posted by user thelotusvale.</p>

<p>That listing includes a comprehensive number of screenshots showcasing every single card from the first edition of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. Each card is signed by the artist. Among these cards is the one of the most sought-after, The Black Lotus, in PSA Certified mint condition.</p>

These are single-sided white cards with the artist's sketch of the initial card artwork. They are meant for esteemed collectors and diehard fans of the respective artists.</p>

<p>So, about that price. According to the listing, the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> First Edition Artist Proof set will be available for as little as $2.2 million. If you live in Richmond, Virginia, the set is available for local pick up on purchase. Otherwise, shipping to the US will cost you $54.67.</p>

<p>Finally, if you buy this set, no refunds. That is, unless the set isn't as advertised, which would make it fall under eBay's Money Back guarantee policy.</p>

<p>It's not an unheard of price for <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> history. Last April, a pristine copy of the Black Lotus was sold for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mtg-black-lotus-shatters-records-in-staggering-3m-sale" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">$3 million</a>. Furthermore, rap artist Post Malone purchased the one-of-a-kind <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/post-malone-buys-magic-gathering-one-ring" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The One Ring</em></a> card from the Lord of the Rings set, a card speculated at $2 million in value, for an undisclosed amount.</p>

<p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> First Edition was released to the world in 1993. This was the start of the iconic card game and the start of collectible card games within the tabletop space, inspiring competitors like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pokemon TCG</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-lorcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Disney Lorcana</em></a>. It is a game packed with 30 years of history and a deeply passionate playerbase still drafting decks to this day.</p>
