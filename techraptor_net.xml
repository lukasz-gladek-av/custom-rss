            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steamforged Games has a new set of Epic Encounters boxes for pre-order. The new <em>Epic Encounters</em> Steelborn sets provide a prebuilt, ready-to-play <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> encounter themed around steel constructs and clockwork automata for sci-fi inclined DMs.</p>

<h2>The <em>Epic Encounters Steelborn</em> Set Pre-Order Announcement</h2>

<p>According to its official <a href="https://steamforged.com/products/epic-encounters-sanctuary-of-the-steelborn" rel="nofollow">store page</a>, the <em>Epic Encounters Steelborn</em> set comprises two boxes. The first, <em>Epic Encounters: Sanctuary of the Steelborn</em>, is the minion encounter box. It contains 20 miniatures, an encounter booklet, and a double-sided encounter map designed for thematic, dynamic battles.</p>

It contains a single large boss miniature with a 120 mm base. An encounter booklet providing boss behaviors and abilities, several difficulty tiers, a set of tokens to represent minions, and a double-sided battle map as well.</p>

<p>The introduction of the Steelborn to <em>Epic Encounters</em> may be contentious on the surface. The central idea of Steamforged's product line is to provide challenging, exciting, fantasy battles based around iconic monster archetypes. Their line has ranged from undead skeletons to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-camp-of-bandit-twins-and-cave-of-manticore-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">bandits</a> to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-island-of-crab-archon-and-cove-of-dragon-turtle-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">crab monsters</a>, to dragons, to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-palace-of-drow-queen-and-lair-of-drider-review-new-shade-of" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">drow and driders</a>.</p>

<p>At first glance, the <em>Epic Encounters</em> Steelborn sets appear to be at odds with high fantasy. But, for more seasoned members of the community, their inclusion is natural. Metal golems have been staples in various fantasy settings like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Elder Scrolls</em></a>. Critical Role's Exandria setting features sophisticated automata. An entire <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> setting, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-eberron-forge-of-artificer-delayed-due-to-production-issues" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eberron</a>, is built around magic artificers and warforged.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Epic Encounters</em> is but one product line in Steamforged Games' catalog. The tabletop developer is known for high-quality bespoke licensed board games based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/runescape-kingdoms-shadow-of-elvarg-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Runescape</em></a>, <em>Resident Evil</em>, and <em>Sea of Thieves,&nbsp;</em>and ongoing support of the miniature game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warmachine-frozen-and-forgotten-starter-set-brings-icy-vengeance" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warmachine</em></a>. They even launched an Epic Encounter spin-off line, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/epic-encounters-local-legends-review-legendary-bar-stories" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Local Legends</em></a>, which focuses more on engaging taverns and venues for players to enjoy.</p>

<p>Both boxes in the <em>Epic Encounters</em> Steelborn set are available for pre-order now at an MSRP of $54.99 each. These pre-orders will be available until October 7.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fans of the Soulslike action RPG&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>are flocking to Steam to leave negative reviews owing to what appears to be an attempt at censoring some of the game's content in its latest update.</p>

<p>As noted by none other than Soulslike aficionado and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloodborne-60fps-patch-dmca" rel="nofollow"><em>Bloodborne&nbsp;</em>modder</a> Lance McDonald on <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1955675217680105798" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">social media</a>&nbsp;(via <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/wuchang-fallen-feathers-is-broken-by-a-push-to-censorship" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Windows Central</a>), Update 1.5, which was released recently, changes the game so that it's impossible to "kill any historically significant bosses or NPCs".</p>

<p>Instead, according to McDonald, these enemies and bosses simply "get 'exhausted' and relax after the fight and talk to you". It also seems as though a Pray emote, taught to the player by a Portuguese Christian missionary during the course of the game, has been removed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wuchang-fallen-feathers-update-censorship-boss.jpg?itok=ZQO3C6gh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wuchang-fallen-feathers-update-censorship-boss.jpg?itok=pUjKBB7J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>update is provoking ire amongst the game's community.</figcaption></figure><p>According to McDonald,&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>' fourth chapter is now "insanely easy" because half of the chapter's enemies will no longer attack you, and you also can't attack them, so a vast portion of that chapter's challenge has been removed.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the game's protagonist now also apparently pledges to "continue [the] legacy" of bosses she defeats, which, as McDonald notes, "literally ruin[s] the entire point of the game's plot about impermanence".</p>

<p>There are many more examples of these kinds of changes throughout McDonald's social media thread, and I'd recommend reading it if you want to know what's different after the update.</p>

<p>The official patch notes themselves don't really make reference to these changes, either; there's a brief note about adding "dialogs for some NPCs to complete some plots" and "further optimiz[ing] the exhaustion animations in the future to improve the plot performance", but nothing concrete.</p>




<p>Needless to say, these changes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">haven't exactly thrilled</a> Steam users, with many leaving negative reviews decrying&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>' <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198322527246/recommended/2277560/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"sudden"</a> plot changes, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/saint-in-chief/recommended/2277560/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"censorship"</a>, and attempts to appease <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198030735475/recommended/2277560/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"whiny Chinese nationalists"</a>.</p>

<p>Ironically, those complaints now appear to have overtaken the very "nationalist" ire the update was seemingly intended to address. Whether or not Leenzee will make further changes remains to be seen, but it does seem as though&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers&nbsp;</em>has been significantly changed through Update 1.5.</p>

<p>At any rate, if you'd like to check out the game, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2277560/WUCHANG_Fallen_Feathers/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/games/store/wuchang-fallen-feathers/9NPRHD8GQKQS" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and it's also available as a Game Pass title.
