            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/astro-bot-sales-sony-financials<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has revealed its financial results for the second quarter of the 2024-25 fiscal year, and they contain some rather reassuring news about&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>sales, especially if you're a 3D platforming fan.</p>

<p>According to a report summarizing the company's financial performance this quarter,&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>has sold 1.5 million copies in the nine weeks since it was released, which Sony says qualifies the game as "a hit".</p>

<p>The report says that 37% of users who bought&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>hadn't picked up a first-party Sony title in the last two years, and that the percentage of younger gamers and families who bought the game was "much higher than other titles", contributing to a "widening of [Sony's] user base".</p>

<p>Of the former, Sony says it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-financials-helldivers-2-sales">was a "huge hit"</a>, although the company does rather conspicuously omit the controversy surrounding the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-account-link">need for a PSN account</a> to play the game on PC (which was later <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack">rescinded after a widespread backlash</a>).</p>

<p><em>Concord</em>, meanwhile, "ended up being shut down", as Sony says, although that's rather understating the catastrophe the game turned out to be; it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds">shut down just two weeks after its launch</a>, and last month, Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-shuts-down-two-studios-including-concord-creator">closed down the game's developer Firewalk</a>.</p>

<p>In numbers terms, Sony's gaming sales increased by 12% on a year-on-year basis, driven mainly by "third-party software sales", including "a new sports title" (likely&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-sales-data-july-circana"><em>EA Sports College Football</em></a>)&nbsp;and "an action RPG title from China" (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-expansion-sales-18m">probably&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em></a>).</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-developer-reveals-patents-nintendo-says-its-infringed-plus-lawsuit-demands.1030824/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>studio Pocketpair has outlined the terms of Nintendo's patent infringement lawsuit against its game, and it looks like there are three patents Nintendo is basing its attack on.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/20241108" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on the official Pocketpair website</a>, Nintendo is seeking "an injunction against&nbsp;<em>Palworld"</em>, as well as five million yen payments to both The Pokemon Company and Nintendo itself, in addition to "late payment damages".</p>

<p>The patents Nintendo is accusing Pocketpair of infringing were all apparently filed (or at least published) after&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>was released, and they're all <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/PU/JP-2024-032983/10/ja" rel="noopener" target="_blank">related</a> to various <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/PU/JP-2024-123560/10/ja" rel="noopener" target="_blank">functions</a> within <a href="https://www.j-platpat.inpit.go.jp/c1801/PU/JP-2024-026645/10/ja" rel="noopener" target="_blank">videogames</a>, including one that pertains to a method of throwing an object in order to capture a creature.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-airborne-pal.jpg?itok=afVM1Yi7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-airborne-pal.jpg?itok=QWIFySw6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We now know which patents Nintendo is going after&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair for.</figcaption></figure><p>The injunction Nintendo is seeking against&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>would presumably involve the game no longer being available to buy in Japan, although since this is a Japanese lawsuit, it's not likely Nintendo could block Pocketpair from selling the game elsewhere.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not familiar with this&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>lawsuit, it was filed against Pocketpair <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit">back in September</a>, with Nintendo alleging that the Japanese studio had infringed on its patents.</p>

<p>Initially, it seemed like the lawsuit might block the release of the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-ps5-release">on PS5 in Japan</a>, but Pocketpair went ahead and launched&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>on PS5 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-ps5-release-japan">in early October</a>, just in time for several <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spooky-palworld-halloween-skins">new Halloween skins</a> to arrive.</p>

<p>Since the patents in question were approved after the launch of&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, Nintendo's legal action seems a touch opportunistic to me, but then Nintendo has a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-loses-appeal-in-nintendo-eshop-lawsuit-in-germany">pretty rich history</a> of aggressively <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-dmcas-zelda-pitch-documentary">pursuing legal claims</a> (especially where its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-missing-link-dmcad-by-nintendo">IP is concerned</a>), so perhaps I shouldn't be surprised.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-warsect.jpg?itok=jn3lp-En 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-warsect.jpg?itok=ZQBUilkD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is far from Nintendo's first legal target.</figcaption></figure><p>As for&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>itself, it's an open-world creature-collecting survival game that blends the gotta-catch-'em-all aspect of&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>with the gameplay of games like&nbsp;<em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em>.</p>

<p>You'll fend for yourself in a hostile world filled with Pals, creatures you can befriend (or enslave) as you see fit, and you'll need to build bases, fend off attacks from aggressive Pals, and generally carve out a life for yourself.</p>

<p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/palworld/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. A <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton">mobile adaptation of the game</a> is also apparently in development at&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>studio Krafton. We'll bring you more as soon as we get it.</p>
