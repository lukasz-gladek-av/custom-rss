            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Fallout: Wasteland Warfare</em> Second Edition is coming. Publisher Modiphius has announced a streamlined version of the officially licensed, narrative-focused miniature skirmish game, incorporating changes to the rules based on player feedback.</p>

<h2>The <em>Fallout: Wasteland Warfare </em>Second Edition Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Fallout: Wasteland Warfare</em> Second Edition is scheduled to arrive in the first half of 2026. This new edition will launch with box sets containing new plastic miniatures for the game. If you already own some Wasteland Warfare miniatures from <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/modiphius-announces-fallout-wasteland-warfare-expansions" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the Commonwealth</a> or from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fallout-tv-show-miniatures-announced-by-modiphius-entertainment" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fallout</em> TV</a> series, they will be compatible with this new edition.</p>

You play as a customizable hero from one of <em>Fallout's</em> many factions. From there, you can recruit a warband and explore a procedurally generated apocalyptic wasteland, surviving attacks from creatures, mutants, and humans.</p>

<p>Thankfully, this new edition will retain some multiplayer. These include a co-op mode where multiple players can join a single warband and explore a campaign map together. Alternatively, there is a battle mode where players can duke it out with their custom warbands.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We’re doubling down on all the best bits of the Wasteland Warfare experience, inspired by elements of the Into the Wasteland, Homestead, and solo rules from the first edition, to give players a more refined and streamlined version of the solo campaign that’s so popular. The game really nails the feeling of Fallout: exploring the wasteland around you, being jumped by irradiated creatures, coming across other camps of survivors, raiders, or super mutants, and scavenging what you need for your warband to survive. War never changes!”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Upon release, <em>Fallout: Wasteland Warfare</em> Second Edition will support fifteen different factions taken from the history of the franchise. These include staples like the Brotherhood of Steel, NCR, Super Mutants, Raiders, and Survivors, as well as more recent groups like the Minutemen, the Institute, and the Cult of the Mothman. These factions will receive further support in supplements down the line.</p>
