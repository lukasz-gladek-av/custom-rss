            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-western-release-atlus-tease<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks like free-to-play mobile game&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X&nbsp;</em>is about to break free of its China-exclusive moorings and make its way West, if a new teaser image is anything to go by.</p>

<p>Over on social media platform X, Atlus <a href="https://x.com/Atlus_West/status/1922064435763438012" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">posted</a> a single image of artwork for&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em>&nbsp;earlier today, together with the captions "Think you dropped this..." and "Stay tuned!".</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the announcement wasn't accompanied by any kind of release window, nor do we know exactly when we can expect more news about the Western release of the game. Still, it looks like the mobile RPG is definitely making its way to Western shores, at the very least.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em>, it's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-announced-for-mobile-platforms-in-china" rel="nofollow">free-to-play mobile-focused RPG</a> that follows a new group of characters who find themselves able to use Personas.</p>

<p>Like mainline&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>games, <i>The Phantom X&nbsp;</i>is split between <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-5-phantom-x-looks-too-good-to-be-confined-to-mobile-in-new-trailer" rel="nofollow">dungeon-crawling and social simulation gameplay</a>, but since this is a free-to-play mobile game, it uses energy-style mechanics to regulate timing for the social sim side rather than a standard calendar system.</p>

<p>It's one of a number of&nbsp;<em>Persona 5&nbsp;</em>spinoffs, alongside tactical RPG&nbsp;<em>Persona 5 Tactica</em>, dancing game&nbsp;<em>Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight</em>, and the more action-heavy&nbsp;<em>Persona 5 Strikers</em>.</p>
