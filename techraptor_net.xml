            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crashlands-2-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Butterscotch Shenanigans has announced the&nbsp;<em>Crashlands 2&nbsp;</em>release date, with the hotly-anticipated crafting RPG sequel (crash) landing on PC and mobiles in a couple of months.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Crashlands 2&nbsp;</em>arrives on April 10th. It'll serve as the sequel to 2016's much-loved&nbsp;<em>Crashlands</em>, which Butterscotch Shenanigans says has amassed "more than 1.8 million downloads" since being released back in 2016.</p>

<p><em>Crashlands 2&nbsp;</em>will once again take you to the planet of Woanope, and you'll once more play the role of "intergalactic trucker and disgruntled corporate employee" Flux Dabes, so this sequel will feel like a real homecoming if you enjoyed the original.</p>

Before the vacation starts, however, a "mysterious blast" from Woanope's surface sends Dabes crashing to its surface once more.</p>

<p>From there, you must venture into what Butterscotch Shenanigans calls "a beautiful living wilderness" complete with its own alien ecosystem. You'll need to learn how that ecosystem works and exploit it to your advantage in order to survive.</p>

<p>While&nbsp;<em>Crashlands 2&nbsp;</em>carries the same sense of intrepid exploration as its predecessor, it's also an altogether more cozy affair. You'll be able to build your very own comfy quarters on the surface of Woanope, filling it with "all the pets, friends, and trophies you collect along the way".</p>

<p>That's not to say there isn't a story to discover. Butterscotch Shenanigans says that "something's not quite right" on the planet of Woanope, so together with new friends and allies, you must unite the planet's factions to restore balance.</p>




<p>Butterscotch Shenanigans CEO Adam Coster says it knows the original&nbsp;<em>Crashlands&nbsp;</em>was "an important part" of many players' childhoods (way to make me feel old, Adam). As such,&nbsp;<em>Crashlands 2&nbsp;</em>has "grown up as much as they have".</p>

<p><em>Crashlands 2</em>, er, lands on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1401730/Crashlands_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and mobile devices on April 10th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/promise-mascot-agency-voice-actors<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Paradise Killer&nbsp;</em>developer Promise Mascot Agency has announced some of the voice actors it's managed to score for new game&nbsp;<em>Promise Mascot Agency</em>, and the list of names is pretty crazy already.</p>

<p>In a Steam news <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2585830/view/514072769031307363" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, the studio reveals five of the actors that will be playing characters in the open-ended narrative adventure, and you'll almost certainly recognize some of the names on the list.</p>

<p>First up is Takaya Kuroda, who's best known for voicing&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon</em>'s Kazuma Kiryu. Kaizen says Kuroda "just turned up to the audition" and that the studio "didn't even dream to ask for him", but he's voicing player character Michi, which feels appropriate given Michi is a "stoic" ex-yakuza.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/promise-mascot-agency-voice-actors-dialogue.jpg?itok=pk0ldjki 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/promise-mascot-agency-voice-actors-dialogue.jpg?itok=EzgPv3n0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ex-yakuza Michi will be voiced by Takaya Kuroda, best known for voicing ex-yakuza Kazuma Kiryu.</figcaption></figure><p>The next big name on the list is&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>'s Ayano Shibuya, who voices Purah in both that game and its sequel&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. She's voicing assistant manager and "chaos goblin"&nbsp;Pinky in&nbsp;<em>Promise Mascot Agency</em>.</p>

<p>Bizarrely, industry legend Shuhei Yoshida, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-playstation" rel="nofollow">recently left PlayStation</a> after 31 years with the company, will be voicing "resident veteran gamer and arcade owner" MonouGe. Yoshida did say he didn't want to vanish from the industry, but this was not on my bingo card.</p>

<p><em>Chainsaw Man</em>'s Eri Saito, who Kaizen says also voiced a member of&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em>'s Beauty and the Beast Unit, will join the cast as Matriarch Shimazu.</p>

<p>Rounding off the voice cast announcements for today is none other than&nbsp;<em>Deadly Premonition&nbsp;</em>auteur SWERY, whose real name is Hidetaka Suehiro. He'll be playing "reformed ex-biker-gang-member priest" Kannushi-kun.</p>




<p><em>Promise Mascot Agency&nbsp;</em>is the next game from<i>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/paradise-killer" rel="nofollow">Paradise Killer</a>&nbsp;</i>developer Kaizen Game Works. Described by the developer as an "open-world narrative adventure", it sees disgraced ex-yakuza Michi running a mascot agency while trying to solve the mystery of his exile.</p>

<p>The game is set for release on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2585830/Promise_Mascot_Agency/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008195" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/promise-mascot-agency/9p6gcj303k9b" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and Nintendo Switch sometime this year. Stay tuned for more.</p>
