            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paramount has announced that it's working on a live-action&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>movie, and the studio is promising to deliver what it calls "the hallmarks of what fans love about the iconic series".</p>

<p>In a press release, Paramount confirms its intention to make the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>movie, pledging to honor "the brand's rich narrative and distinctive style" and to provide "an authentic and exciting experience for longtime fans and newcomers alike".</p>

<p>Unfortunately, we don't really have many more details than that; Paramount says the movie will be an "unforgettable cinematic event", and we know it'll be live-action, but beyond that, the studio, along with the franchise's publisher Activision, are remaining tight-lipped for now.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-movie-casino.jpg?itok=DSDJRxOP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-movie-casino.jpg?itok=g7qXN4QO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>is getting its first movie.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't know, for example, whether Paramount's movie will adapt any of the existing&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>games, or whether it'll be an all-new experience. There are also a range of time periods in which&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>games are set, so we don't know whether the movie will be a period piece or a more contemporary one.</p>

<p>We can, however, make an educated guess as to why the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>movie exists. Back in October last year, Activision revealed that the series as a whole had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch" rel="nofollow">crossed 500 million units sold</a>, and that most recent release&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>enjoyed the franchise's biggest launch to date.</p>

<p><em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>games are, however, also very expensive to make. In January, a report emerged which revealed that 2020's&nbsp;<em>Black Ops Cold War&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ballooning-call-of-duty-budgets" rel="nofollow">cost an eye-watering $700 million</a>, which includes its initial release and subsequent live-service content additions.</p>

<p>It's worth bearing in mind that since&nbsp;<em>Black Ops Cold War&nbsp;</em>is five years old, budgets are likely to be even higher now, and so making a movie with Paramount makes sense as a way for Activision to bolster its coffers for future development.</p>




<p>Following on from last year's&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, the next installment in the series,&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em>, is due to launch this November. Unlike&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>, it'll be set in the near future, and will also feature co-op play for its campaign.</p>
