            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-sbmm-method-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Enterprising&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>players have figured out a way to discover their SBMM (skill-based matchmaking) rating within the game, a value that's supposed to be hidden from players' view.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-players-are-getting-activision-to-send-them-their-personal-information-so-they-can-find-out-their-hidden-sbmm-rating" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>, this method comes via YouTuber TheXclusiveAce, and it works for every&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>multiplayer game you've played since 2021's&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Vanguard</em>. That's a heck of a lot of data.</p>

<p>As IGN points out, however, it's a method that takes a little while, and you'll have to put in a bit of effort to reap the rewards. You'll have to submit a personal information access request via the <a href="https://support.activision.com/privacy" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Activision privacy page</a>, and it can take a couple of days for the data to arrive, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-sbmm-method-gunfight.jpg?itok=2Vil6up- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-sbmm-method-gunfight.jpg?itok=u5uyfZJv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Want to find out your&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>SBMM rating? You can do so via a newly-discovered method.</figcaption></figure><p>Once you do get the info (for which you'll also need to log into an Activision account), you'll be granted access to a vast amount of data that, according to IGN and TheXclusiveAce, includes every Multiplayer match you've played on record.</p>

<p>You can see info like the modes and maps you've played with, as well as number of hits, damage numbers, and even the amount of time you've spent moving in each game. Activision really is collecting a staggering amount of player data from&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>, it seems.</p>

<p>If you don't know what SBMM is, it's a rather hot topic within the multiplayer gaming world. SBMM, or skill-based matchmaking, refers to a method by which players are grouped together in multiplayer games according to their skill level.</p>

<p>Some players have decried SBMM, suggesting it makes games too hard to enjoy as "sweaty" players dominate higher-end lobbies. However, <a href="https://www.activision.com/cdn/research/CallofDuty_Matchmaking_Series_2.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">extensive experiments released by Activision last year</a> seem to contradict this, suggesting that players do appreciate SBMM when it's present, even if they don't realize it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-sbmm-method-posing.jpg?itok=iNWu2iF7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-sbmm-method-posing.jpg?itok=F7UF2pJy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Call of Duty</em>'s SBMM process is perhaps more popular than players would like to believe.</figcaption></figure><p>The data TheXclusiveAce uncovered isn't necessarily helpful in a vacuum, as it doesn't contain comparison to other players, nor does it show the skill rating of lobbies in which you participated in multiplayer&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>games.</p>

<p>However, if the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>community comes together to compare data, then a more comprehensive picture of the way SBMM works within the games could be created.</p>

<p>It's well worth watching his video on the subject if you want to learn more about how to access your own data, as well as what it could tell you about your own&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>performance. You can see it here.</p>




<h2>What else is going on in the world of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>?</h2>

<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>land, the games'&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>collaboration, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-squid-game-crossover" rel="nofollow">first teased back in early December</a>, has now officially landed.</p>

<p>Per the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>blog, the&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>crossover gives you the chance to earn goodies like a new Front Man Operator, as well as new Skins for existing Operators that sport the iconic green tracksuit from the show.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-squid-game-crossover.jpg?itok=kr42B8YL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-squid-game-crossover.jpg?itok=e798STID 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>has officially come to the world of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The crossover also sees a number of limited-time events appearing in&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>'s Multiplayer and Zombies modes, as well as&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em>.</p>

<p>Recently, it was revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>series has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch" rel="nofollow">officially surpassed 500 million sales</a>, and that&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>enjoyed the series' biggest launch to date, no doubt buoyed by its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-on-game-pass-day-1" rel="nofollow">inclusion as part of Xbox Game Pass</a> on day one.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rust-steam-player-count-new-record</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rust-player-count-reaches-new-all-time-high-almost-seven-years-after-release.1073271/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rust-steam-player-count-new-record<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>Rust&nbsp;</em>has managed to hit a new all-time player count record on Steam, despite the fact that the game is nearing its seventh anniversary (and it's been out for even longer if you count Early Access).</p>

<p>According to the ever-reliable <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/252490/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>,&nbsp;<em>Rust&nbsp;</em>managed to hit 262,284 players within the last 24 hours, which is also the game's all-time peak. Even at time of writing, it's sitting at 200,694 players, so it's not like that spike was a fluke.</p>

<p>Of course, these numbers probably won't come as a surprise if you're a&nbsp;<em>Rust&nbsp;</em>player or if you've been following the game. After all,&nbsp;<em>Rust</em>'s player count has been <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/252490/charts/#max" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">slowly climbing</a> since its 2013 release, although the 262,284 jump is impressive even within that context.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rust-player-count-record-fortress.jpg?itok=QHXBbycJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rust-player-count-record-fortress.jpg?itok=4Ezc9Q0T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Rust&nbsp;</em>has hit a new all-time player record on Steam.</figcaption></figure><p>So, what's driving this player count increase? It's likely that the Steam Winter Sale, during which&nbsp;<em>Rust&nbsp;</em>was available at a 50% discount, contributed hugely to the game's surge in popularity.</p>

<p>We're also just moving out of the holiday season, during which many players will have had more time to play games. Both of these are likely contributing factors to&nbsp;<em>Rust</em>'s newfound (extra) success, although content creators on platforms like YouTube and Twitch likely also shouldn't be discounted.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Rust</em>, it's an open-world survival-crafting game in which "the only aim" is to survive.&nbsp;<em>Rust</em>'s world is also unapologetically hostile; it's one in which "everything wants you to die", according to developer and publisher Facepunch.</p>

<p>Since release,&nbsp;<em>Rust&nbsp;</em>has received a number of updates bringing new features to the game, including the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rust-update-adds-military-bases-to-raid-for-goodies" rel="nofollow">military bases</a> to raid for goodies, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rust-above-ground-trains-update-rolls-out-today" rel="nofollow">above-ground trains</a> to ride, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rust-september-2021-update-improves-underwater-labs" rel="nofollow">improvements to existing features</a>, among other things.</p>




<p>Sadly, you're a little late to check out&nbsp;<em>Rust&nbsp;</em>as part of the Steam Winter Sale, but you can still grab it right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/252490/Rust/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP4415-CUSA14296_00-D11PROJECTRUST01" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/rust-console-edition/BRPVTJKWHBR7" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a> (and current-gen machines via backwards compatibility).</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/selaco-sales-100k</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indie-fps-selaco-hits-100k-sales-four-times-its-original-goal.1073259/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/selaco-sales-100k<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Altered Orbit Studios has announced that ambitious FPS&nbsp;<em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>has already crossed a major sales milestone that represents a fourfold increase on the studio's original goal for the game.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/SelacoGame/status/1874873018637603201" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on social media platform X</a>, Altered Orbit reveals that&nbsp;<em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>has sold 100,000 copies, a figure the studio says it "never expected to reach", especially during the Early Access period (which began back in May this year).</p>

<p>Altered Orbit <a href="https://x.com/SelacoGame/status/1874873021556736150" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">follows up</a> by saying that its original intention was to sell 25,000 copies of&nbsp;<em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>in the game's first twelve months on release, but that "somehow", this figure was quadrupled in "just half the time".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/selaco-sales-100k.jpg?itok=2Inn0I7B 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/selaco-sales-100k.jpg?itok=-37znJFg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Selaco</em>'s mixture of retro nostalgia and ambitious thinking has resulted in a very respectable sales milestone within its first six months or so on sale.</figcaption></figure><p>The developer says that it decided to go publisher-free and place all its faith "in the game itself", as well as "the community to help spread the word", and it looks like those strategies worked.</p>

<p>Still, Altered Orbit <a href="https://x.com/SelacoGame/status/1874873023557480935" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">does acknowledge</a> that others played a role in&nbsp;<em>Selaco</em>'s success too. Specifically, the studio thanks New Blood's Dave Oshry for doing "more for us than I could fit in an entire Twitter thread", as well as "other developers" who are "always ready to offer help and see their peers succeed". Aww.</p>

<p>Amusingly, Altered Orbit closes its thank-you statements by <a href="https://x.com/SelacoGame/status/1874873025470107948" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">suggesting</a> that players only bought&nbsp;<em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>to play its "Burger Flipper" minigame. If that minigame isn't significantly expanded in the full release, I expect boycotts.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Selaco</em>, it's a throwback first-person shooter that promises to offer "thrilling action set pieces, destructibility, smart enemies, and a fleshed-out story" within what Altered Orbit calls an "immersive game world".</p>




<p>The game owes a debt to the likes of&nbsp;<em>Duke Nukem 3D</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/genre-advancing-shooters-half-life" rel="nofollow">genre-advancing classics like <i>Half-Life</i></a>, and more recent titles like&nbsp;<em>F.E.A.R.&nbsp;</em>for its action set pieces. That's a pretty heavy cross of influences to bear.</p>

<p>If you're interested, you can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>, and if you're still not convinced, perhaps our very own Austin's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/selaco-sets-new-standard-for-fps-genre" rel="nofollow">glowing preview</a> will do the trick.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Indie Platformer Antonblast Is Already Profitable, Developer Says]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/antonblast-already-profitable</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indie-platformer-antonblast-is-already-profitable-developer-says.1073244/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/antonblast-already-profitable<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>developer Summitsphere has announced that the game has already recouped all of its costs related to development, marketing, and production, officially making it a profitable endeavor less than a month after release.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tonycomputerentertainment.com/post/3lesqbhu4ys2y" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post on social media platform Bluesky</a>, Summitsphere's Tony Grayson reveals the happy news and says it "looks like Summitsphere is going to be making a lot more games for a lot longer", thanking&nbsp;<em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>players for their support.</p>

<p>Just in case you aren't familiar with&nbsp;<em>Antonblast</em>, it's a 2D "explosive action platformer" with a visual style that owes a heavy debt to&nbsp;<em>Wario Land</em>. You can think of it as a cousin to&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2231450/Pizza_Tower/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pizza Tower</em></a>, although the two are developed by different studios.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/antonblast-profitable-boss.jpg?itok=M1d8LByN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/antonblast-profitable-boss.jpg?itok=KTiKLFyv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Antonblast</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Wario</em>-style shenanigans are already profitable, developer Summitsphere says.</figcaption></figure><p>Playing as either the titular Anton or his "cranked-out coworker Annie", you must do battle with Satan in order to retrieve Anton's prized collection of spirits.</p>

<p>Along the way, you'll explore "bizarre worlds", battle "screen-filling bosses", and experiment with what Summitsphere calls a "totally dynamic playstyle" that allows you either to rush through stages at speed or explore them at your leisure.</p>

<p>All of this is wrapped up in what the developer calls an "urban graffiti-inspired art style", which is certainly true, although it's also quite clearly a&nbsp;<em>Wario Land</em>-inspired art style as well (no shade; I love that art style).</p>

<p>Screenshots don't quite do&nbsp;<em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>justice, so check out the trailer below to see what the game looks like in motion.</p>




<p>A game like&nbsp;<em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>achieving profitability in just under a month is no mean feat. It's not quite&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>becoming profitable <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k" rel="nofollow">just a few days after its launch</a>, but hey, maybe Summitsphere's next game will achieve that lofty goal.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Antonblast&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1887400/ANTONBLAST/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/antonblast-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. There's no word yet on whether the game is coming to other consoles, but given that it's already profitable, I wouldn't be surprised if it did.</p>
