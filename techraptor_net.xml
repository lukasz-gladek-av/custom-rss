Here's everything that was announced during the show!</p>

<hr><h2><em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>release date revealed</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-release-date-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=fxeDrWTh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-release-date-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=KLBxjrb1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>arrives this October.</figcaption></figure><p>The show kicked off with a release date for&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, as well as a new look at the setting of Obsidian's new action RPG. It all looks very wacky and very satirical, just like the first game. This one's launching on October 29th.</p>

<h2><em>High on Life 2&nbsp;</em>has more crazy talking weapons and colorful action</h2>

<p>Next up, Squanch Games announced&nbsp;<em>High on Life 2</em>, a sequel to the 2022 shooter that looks to offer much of the same colorful, fast-paced action (and plenty of talking weapons, of course). It's coming this winter, and you'll be able to play it on day one with Game Pass.</p>

<h2><em>Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy&nbsp;</em>looks very odd indeed</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resonance-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=PBK85eCz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resonance-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=wh23j_R9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Believe it or not, this is a&nbsp;<em>Plague Tale&nbsp;</em>game.</figcaption></figure><p>From Asobo Studio and Focus Entertainment comes&nbsp;<em>Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy</em>, which is presumably some kind of&nbsp;<em>Plague Tale&nbsp;</em>spinoff. We didn't get too much on this one; just a cinematic trailer, a 2026 release window, and a lot of questions. Day one on Game Pass again!</p>

<h2>A special Xbox ROG Ally is coming this holiday season</h2>

<p>Oh, Xbox, you cheeky monkeys. Next up is an announcement for a special ROG Xbox Ally handheld, with an X variant also available with superior specs. Both consoles prominently show&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>being played on them, because of course.</p>

<h2><em>The Blood of Dawnwalker&nbsp;</em>gets a spooky new trailer</h2>

<p>Next, Rebel Wolves and Bandai Namco showed off&nbsp;<em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>, their upcoming vampiric action RPG. We got to see some suitably dark combat and traversal gameplay, but we didn't get a release date; just a 2026 release window.</p>

<h2>Meat Boy returns in a 3D platforming extravaganza</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/meat-boy-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=PSxQlTFx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/meat-boy-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=It14mbQ3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Super Meat Boy 3D&nbsp;</em>is pretty self-explanatory.</figcaption></figure><p>Iconic platforming blob Meat Boy made a return in the next trailer, which eschews his usual hyper-masocore 2D trappings in favor of a 3D environment. It is, as you might expect, called&nbsp;<em>Super Meat Boy 3D</em>, and it's coming early next year.</p>

<h2><em>Ninja Gaiden 4&nbsp;</em>gets a release date and an ultra-fast-paced trailer</h2>




<p>If you were worried&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4&nbsp;</em>wouldn't offer the same ridiculously fast-paced action for which the series is known, today's trailer should have put your fears to rest. It's coming on October 21st.</p>

<h2><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;</em>is getting story DLC</h2>

<p>A brand new story expansion for&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;</em>is on its way, and I for one am glad, because I can't get enough of that Troy Baker voice.&nbsp;<em>The Order of Giants&nbsp;</em>arrives on September 4th.</p>

<h2>Game Freak reveals&nbsp;<em>Beast of Reincarnation</em></h2>

<p><em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>studio Game Freak making a&nbsp;<em>Nier Automata</em>-style action RPG wasn't on my bingo card, but there it is.&nbsp;<em>Beast of Reincarnation&nbsp;</em>is coming sometime next year.</p>

<h2><em>Clockwork Revolution&nbsp;</em>is another intriguing-looking action RPG</h2>




<p>Next, inXile showed off its upcoming steampunk action RPG&nbsp;<em>Clockwork Revolution</em>, which looks like it'll combine the likes of&nbsp;<em>Dishonored</em>,&nbsp;<em>BioShock</em>, and Obsidian's own&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds</em>. You can play this one "in due time", so no release date, unfortunately.</p>

<h2>Obsidian announces&nbsp;<em>Grounded 2</em></h2>

<p>Miniaturized survival game&nbsp;<em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>is getting a followup, Obsidian revealed during today's show. It's a very vibrant-looking survival game that's coming to Game Preview on July 29th, which ain't too far off at all.</p>

<h2>Bloober Team's&nbsp;<em>Cronos: The New Dawn&nbsp;</em>scares up a storm this fall</h2>

<p>If, like anyone else with taste, you were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/callisto-protocol-review" rel="nofollow">disappointed by&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/callisto-protocol-review" rel="nofollow">The Callisto Protocol</a>&nbsp;</em>(sorry, fans), then&nbsp;<em>Cronos: The New Dawn&nbsp;</em>might be the antidote you've been waiting for. This Bloober Team survival horror game launches in fall.</p>

<h2><em>Aphelion&nbsp;</em>is a cinematic-looking adventure game from Don't Nod</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dont-nod-aphelion-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=d5uaPz5R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dont-nod-aphelion-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=1x9_VOZB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Aphelion&nbsp;</em>almost feels like a throwback to games like&nbsp;<em>Uncharted</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Our next reveal was&nbsp;<em>Aphelion</em>, an adventure game from Don't Nod that looks like it owes more than a small debt to the likes of&nbsp;<em>Uncharted&nbsp;</em>and the newer&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>games. It's being made in collaboration with the European Space Agency, and it launches next year.</p>

<h2><em>No Ghosts at the Grand&nbsp;</em>is almost certainly lying to you</h2>




<p>Next, it's a frankly bizarre-looking game (and I say that as a compliment) that appears to be one part renovation sim to one part spooky horror game and another part...er, reggae musical? It's definitely not a no from me.&nbsp;<em>No Ghosts at the Grand&nbsp;</em>launches next year as a day one Game Pass title.</p>

<h2><em>Age of Mythology: Retold&nbsp;</em>is getting Japanese gods in fall</h2>

<p>More gods are on their way to&nbsp;<em>Age of Mythology: Retold&nbsp;</em>thanks to the&nbsp;<em>Heavenly Spear&nbsp;</em>DLC, which brings the ancient Japanese pantheon in fall. We got a glimpse of some iconic Japanese gods, like Yamata-no-Orochi, in the trailer.</p>

<h2><em>Mudang: Two Hearts&nbsp;</em>tackles a twisty-turny Korean story</h2>




<p>Next up, we got a look at a brand new game by the name of&nbsp;<em>Mudang: Two Hearts</em>, and it looks like a pretty original prospect. Gameplay looks to be split between open-ended stealthy shooting and setpieces, but we'll get to find out when it launches in 2026.</p>

<h2>Thunderful announces&nbsp;<em>Planet of Lana 2: Children of the Leaf</em></h2>

<p><em>Planet of Lana 2: Children of the Leaf&nbsp;</em>is a followup to the 2023 cinematic platformer, and it'll return to the story of Lana and Mui, utilizing a very similar-looking visual and gameplay style to the original. It's coming next year, because of course it is.</p>

<h2><em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</em>brings the anime to life this year (and next)</h2>

<p>Next, we got to see some suitably anime-looking gameplay for the action RPG&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive</em>, which comes to PC this year and to Xbox next year. It adapts the popular anime, so if you're a fan, it's safe to start getting excited.</p>

<h2><em>Aniimo&nbsp;</em>has very strong&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>vibes, but without the guns</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aniimo-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=CunMeAA6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aniimo-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=27gE1gsL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Aniimo&nbsp;</em>feels like a more peaceful&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you thought&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>was perhaps a touch too edgy for your tastes (as I did), then&nbsp;<em>Aniimo&nbsp;</em>looks like it might be the game for you. It's got similar open-world&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>-style vibes, but without the guns and forced labor. It's coming in 2026.</p>

<h2><em>Spiritfarer&nbsp;</em>studio Thunder Lotus announces&nbsp;<em>Fate's End</em></h2>

<p><em>Fate's End&nbsp;</em>is a brand new sidescroller from&nbsp;<em>Spiritfarer&nbsp;</em>studio Thunder Lotus, and it looks to marry that developer's love of hand-drawn art and storytelling with a more hands-on style reminiscent of&nbsp;<em>Jotunn</em>. This one launches...yup, you guessed it. Next year.</p>

<h2><em>Persona 4&nbsp;</em>is absolutely getting that remake we all knew about</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-4-revival-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=UDzywbYe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-4-revival-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=EfyUAK5b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yeah, that&nbsp;<em>Persona 4&nbsp;</em>remake is real. Surprise surprise.</figcaption></figure><p>At this point, all that remained for Atlus was to make its&nbsp;<em>Persona 4&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-4-remake-domain-registration" rel="nofollow">remake</a> official given comments <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-4-remake-yuri-lowenthal" rel="nofollow">made by certain voice actors</a>, and the studio did exactly that in this show. It's called&nbsp;<em>Persona 4 Revival</em>, but we don't have a release date yet.</p>

<h2><em>Invincible VS&nbsp;</em>is a three-on-three tag fighter based on the comics</h2>

<p>Next up, we got to see Skybound Games and Quarter Up's&nbsp;<em>Invincible VS</em>, a fighting game based on the comics (and the popular animated show) coming next year. It looks exactly as bloodily brutal as you'd expect.</p>

<h2><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>XVI&nbsp;</em>are coming to Xbox</h2>

<p>Square Enix revealed that both&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>will make their way to Xbox, with&nbsp;<em>VII Remake&nbsp;</em>coming this winter and&nbsp;<em>XVI&nbsp;</em>coming...well, today! You can pick the latter up right now. I'm <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">not surprised the studio has made this decision</a>.</p>

<h2>Double Fine's next game lets you, er, play as a lighthouse</h2>




<p>Well, I can't say it's ever been done before, at any rate. Double Fine announced its next game during the show, and you get to play as a rather adorable combination of a lighthouse and a scraggly-looking bird.&nbsp;<em>Keeper&nbsp;</em>launches on October 17th.</p>

<h2><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7&nbsp;</em>is coming, and it looks trippy as heck</h2>




<p>The final announcement during today's show was, of course,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, and it concludes with a confrontation between&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 2&nbsp;</em>protagonist David Mason and Raul Menendez, with plenty of trippy-looking architecture and futuristic trappings to boot.</p>
