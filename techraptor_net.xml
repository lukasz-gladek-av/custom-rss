            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Paradox has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings III</em>&nbsp;expansion by the name of&nbsp;<em>All Under Heaven</em>, and it's taking things in an Easterly direction later this month.</p>

<p><em>All Under Heaven&nbsp;</em>is the latest major expansion for&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings III</em>, following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crusader-kings-3-khans-of-the-steppe-expansion" rel="nofollow">April's&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe</em></a>, and it's introducing settings and campaigns that are entirely new to the series, so you're pretty much guaranteed never to have experienced them in a&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings&nbsp;</em>game before.</p>

<p>As the name suggests,&nbsp;<em>All Under Heaven&nbsp;</em>will bring "detailed representations of medieval China, Japan and Southeast Asia", and each new playable nation will bring brand new mechanics for you to grapple with.</p>

<p>Paradox is promising that this expansion will build on&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings III&nbsp;</em>"on a monumental scale", so this isn't just a minor DLC pack; it's a full-throated expansion that should augment your experience with the game significantly.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for the&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings III&nbsp;</em><em>All Under Heaven&nbsp;</em>expansion right here.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings III</em>, it's the third major entry in the&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings&nbsp;</em>series of grand strategy games, and like its predecessors, it tasks you with playing as a dynasty and attempting to survive the slings and arrows of Middle Ages politics.</p>

<p>It's proven pretty popular with players, too, racking up <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/press-releases/press-release/crusader-kings-iii-passes-four-million-sales" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">four million sales</a> at last count despite being available on Game Pass (although that may not be the boon it once was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">thanks to recent changes</a>).</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings III&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1158310/Crusader_Kings_III/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/crusader-kings-iii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/crusader-kings-iii/9n7gg222gtth" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>
