            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-mirage-dlc-report-ubisoft<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the weekend, a report emerged suggesting that Ubisoft had secured funding from the Saudi Public Investment Fund in order to create more&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>DLC. Now, Ubisoft has responded to that report...sort of.</p>

<p>In a statement provided to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-responds-to-report-claiming-its-signed-a-saudi-deal-for-fresh-assassins-creed-mirage-content" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, Ubisoft declined to comment on the matter, pointing fans to the imminent release of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>instead. It's worth noting that declining to comment doesn't constitute a denial.</p>

<p>The statement in full, as Eurogamer relays it, simply reads: "We'll decline to comment. We are focused on finishing&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>and excited for players to get to play it on March 20th."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-funded-dlc-report-fight.jpg?itok=jVENmpim 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-funded-dlc-report-fight.jpg?itok=J2JcAe2H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>DLC might be on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>The original report came on Friday courtesy of French news platform <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/letonnant-deal-dubisoft-avec-larabie-saoudite-2144626" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Les Echos</a>, with YouTuber and strreamer j0nathan subsequently <a href="https://x.com/xj0nathan/status/1882849239434232101" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sharing</a> the story on social media platform X.</p>

<p>In his post (which is in French; we're using machine translation), j0nathan says that Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot reportedly signed a deal with Saudi Arabia's Savvy Games Group to develop extra content for&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>during a meeting last month.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not aware, the Saudi PIF is a national wealth fund backed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. It's been used to buy shares in companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-pif-becomes-nintendos-largest-outside-shareholder" rel="nofollow">Nintendo</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-pif-buys-1-billion-stake-in-embracer-group" rel="nofollow">Embracer Group</a>, as well as to outright buy up a controlling stake in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/saudi-arabian-crown-prince-to-buy-controlling-stake-in-snk" rel="nofollow"><em>King of Fighters</em>&nbsp;developer SNK</a>.</p>

<p>The PIF doesn't currently hold any shares in Ubisoft, but this deal could signify an interest on bin Salman and Saudi Arabia's part to invest in the company, especially at a time when Ubisoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter" rel="nofollow">current shareholders seem unhappy</a> with the direction it's taking.</p>

<p>Ubisoft no doubt has a lot riding on&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>' success; its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-h1-2024-25-fiscal-results" rel="nofollow">latest financials</a> were very gloomy indeed, with high-profile games like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">first-person shooter&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xdefiant-shutting-down-ubisoft-studios-closing" rel="nofollow">XDefiant</a>&nbsp;</em>proving to be expensive flops for the studio.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether more&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Mirage&nbsp;</em>DLC is indeed planned for the future. In the meantime, you can grab the game now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035570/Assassins_Creed_Mirage/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/assassins-creed-mirage/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/assassins-creed-mirage/9N4096HX1WWQ" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/assassins-creed-mirage-review-it-feels-so-good-to-be-back" rel="nofollow">read our review of it here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[JDM: Japanese Drift Master Release Date Revs Up for March]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jdm-japanese-drift-master-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jdm-japanese-drift-master-release-date-revs-up-for-march.1092675/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jdm-japanese-drift-master-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Gaming Factory has announced the&nbsp;<em>JDM: Japanese Drift Master&nbsp;</em>release date, and the Japan-set "simcade" racer is coming to PC across various storefronts in March.</p>

<p>The game - which is "the most wishlisted racing game on Steam", according to Gaming Factory - launches for Valve's storefront, as well as the Epic Games Store and GOG, on March 26th.</p>

<p>It promises "winding mountain roads, scenic rural streets, and city highways" for you to race along, all of which will be located within the fictional Japanese prefecture of Guntama, an open-world expanse that "spans over 250km in main roads".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/jdm-japanese-drift-master-release-date-racing.jpg?itok=FDw3BrjM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/jdm-japanese-drift-master-release-date-racing.jpg?itok=T2ip4Es4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>JDM: Japanese Drift Master&nbsp;</em>hits the streets in March.</figcaption></figure><p>Rather curiously, despite being a fictional prefecture, Guntama will boast "the most famous tourist landmarks". These will include a recreation of the world-famous Himeji Castle, which is in&nbsp;Hyōgo Prefecture in the real world, and the Daikoku Parking Area, which you can find in Yokohama.</p>

<p>Unlike many other racing games,&nbsp;<em>JDM: Japanese Drift Master&nbsp;</em>also has a story. You'll play as Polish driver Touma, who wants to prove himself on the local Guntama street racing circuit.</p>

<p>As he tries to do so, he'll make friends among the locals, but he'll also make enemies, leading to "drama, action, and even love". It's fairly unusual for a racing game to emphasize its narrative these days, but it's nice to see nonetheless.</p>

<p>Intriguingly, the story in&nbsp;<em>JDM: Japanese Drift Master&nbsp;</em>will be told "through in-game events and a manga" drawn by Gaming Factory's art team.</p>




<p>Of course, it wouldn't be much of a racer without cars, and&nbsp;<em>JDM: Japanese Drift Master&nbsp;</em>has plenty, packing in licensed brands like Nissan, Mazda, and Subaru.</p>

<p>The game will also offer the opportunity to tweak and upgrade your car to your heart's content, and Game Factory says it's "constantly adding presets for driving wheels and the plethora of simdriving hardware available on the market" as well.</p>

<p><em>JDM: Japanese Drift Racer&nbsp;</em>launches for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1153410/JDM_Japanese_Drift_Master/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/japanese-drift-master-b4fd48" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic</a>, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/japanese_drift_master" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a> on March 27th.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rise-of-the-ronin-pc-release-confirmed-for-march.1092624/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rise-of-ronin-pc-release-march<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Koei Tecmo and developer Team Ninja have announced a&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>PC release, and it's less than two months away.</p>

<p>Per an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1340990/view/510696338398118902" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the game's brand new Steam page,&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>will launch on PC on March 11th, making it the latest in a string of PS5 exclusives to come to PC after their console release (with the most recent being&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a>).</p>

<p>As you'd probably expect from a PC release,&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin</em>'s graphical options will be greatly expanded on PC compared to its PS5 version. New features include support for 8K resolution and 120fps, as well as ultrawide compatibility and support for ray tracing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rise-of-the-ronin-pc-fight.jpg?itok=5lgPHVBC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rise-of-the-ronin-pc-fight.jpg?itok=-PzLC0p_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja's&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>is coming to PC.</figcaption></figure><p>Other PC-specific features include customizable mouse and keyboard controls, as well as support for Nvidia DLSS and AMD Fidelity FX Super Resolution, which should make the game a little less demanding for older machines.</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo's desire to get&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>out of its PS5 exclusivity cage makes a lot of sense, especially in the light of Square Enix claiming its PS5 exclusives&nbsp;<em>Rebirth&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">didn't meet the company's expectations</a>.</p>

<p>Last we heard, Koei Tecmo seemed pleased with&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin</em>'s sales, claiming the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rise-of-ronin-sales-koei-tecmo-financials" rel="nofollow">outpacing the&nbsp;<em>Nioh&nbsp;</em>series</a> in terms of its launch sales.</p>

<p>Still, more sales are always better for publishers, and so putting the game on PC and exposing it to a wider audience can only be a sensible move. You can check out the PC reveal trailer for&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin&nbsp;</em>here. It's in Japanese, but the game is getting an English-language PC release too.</p>




<p>If you missed out on&nbsp;<em>Rise of the Ronin</em>, it's an open-world action RPG set in the Bakumatsu era of Japanese history, during which Japan's rapid modernization and increasing connection to the West caused conflict within the country's borders.</p>

<p>You can check the game out right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/rise-of-the-ronin/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and it's coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1340990/Rise_of_the_Ronin/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> on March 11th.
