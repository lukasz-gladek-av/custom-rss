            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has announced that its online superhero shooter&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>has already crossed a major player count milestone just a few days after its initial release.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1865909229070016851" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>X account, the game has crossed the 10 million player mark already, which is particularly impressive given that the announcement was made almost exactly 72 hours after&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' launch on Friday.</p>

<p>In the post, NetEase thanks "each and every one" of the people who have checked out&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>so far and shares a special piece of artwork depicting some of the game's interpretations of classic Marvel characters like Wolverine, Hawkeye, and, uh, Squirrel Girl.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-player-count-10-million-artwork.jpg?itok=1oOjPhrX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-player-count-10-million-artwork.jpg?itok=UlZJaAp8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>seems to have proven pretty popular among players.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting this player count doesn't necessarily translate to revenue for NetEase;&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is free-to-play, after all, and all of its heroes are unlocked for all players at the start of the game, although a battle pass is up for sale if you do want to shell out some real-world cash.</p>

<p>Still, a quick look at <i>Marvel Rivals</i>' <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2767030/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB page</a> shows that the game still appears to be going pretty strong. Its 24-hour player count peak sits at 480,990 at time of writing, with 296,557 players currently playing the third-person hero shooter.</p>

<p>That's without taking into account player numbers on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S as well. Naturally, many of those 10 million players will have jumped in to check the game out and will have no intention of sticking around, but it's still safe to call&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>a success, I think.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is, it's a third-person multiplayer hero shooter created by NetEase Games.</p>

<p>Bearing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-announced" rel="nofollow">more than a passing resemblance</a> to Blizzard's&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>,&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>sees teams of Marvel heroes and villains competing against one another to complete objectives like holding territory or escorting a moving object to its destination.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itchio-offline-funko-phishing-brandshield<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie storefront Itch.io was taken offline for several hours earlier today owing to what the site's owner describes as a "bogus phishing report" for a fanmade page based on the Funko toy property.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/itchio/status/1866017758040993829" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message on social media platform X</a>, Itch.io says its site was "taken down by Funko" due to "trash 'AI Powered' brand protection software called BrandShield", which flagged a page on the site as fraud, leading to domain registrar IWantMyName to "ignore" Itch.io's response, "just disabl[ing] the domain".</p>

<p>Over on YCombinator's <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=42364033" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Hacker News portal</a>, Itch.io owner Leaf Corcoran provides some additional context. He says that someone "made a fan page" for Funko video game&nbsp;<em>Funko Fusion</em>, and that page contained "links to the official site and screenshots of the game".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/itch.io-offline-funko-phishing-funko-fusion.jpg?itok=6hgGTbKA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/itch.io-offline-funko-phishing-funko-fusion.jpg?itok=MFg27tw3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A fan-made&nbsp;<em>Funko Fusion&nbsp;</em>Itch.io page is apparently what led to the site being shut down for several hours.</figcaption></figure><p>Corcoran speculates that the aforementioned BrandShield software is "probably instructed to eradicate all 'unauthorized' use of [Funko's] trademark", and so the software sent phishing and fraud reports to Itch.io's domain registrar.</p>

<p>He goes on to say that he first received reports of the alerts from IWantMyName and host Linode "about 5 or 6 days ago", and that he had removed the offending page and disabled the associated account. The matter was settled with Linode fairly swiftly, while IWantMyName "never responded" to Corcoran's actions.</p>

<p>The Itch.io site owner says he's "assuming no-one on [IWantMyName's] end 'closed' the ticket, so it went into an automatic system to disable the domain after some number of days".</p>

<p>The whole debacle rather sounds like a series of automated systems being set off for circumstances they should probably never even have raised an eyebrow at, but at any rate, Itch.io is now back up, so there's that, at least.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/brandshield-itch.io-down-phishing-claim-funko.jpg?itok=nAKf0auw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/brandshield-itch.io-down-phishing-claim-funko.jpg?itok=wwMs9_5I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Itch.io owner Leaf Corcoran lays the blame for the site's outage squarely at "brand protection" suite BrandShield's door.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, several developers and industry figures have <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/djlink.bsky.social/post/3lcuf4dlf2s2w" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">responded</a> to Itch.io's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alienmelon.bsky.social/post/3lcuiisohfs2e" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">outage</a> with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brandon.insertcredit.com/post/3lcuf5bqfwc2m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">disappointment</a> at Funko and BrandShield, which isn't hard to understand given that the outage meant many indie devs couldn't sell their products for a number of hours.</p>

<p>Given that Itch.io routinely raises quite a lot of money <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itchio-ukraine-bundle-raises-63-million" rel="nofollow">for charity</a> -&nbsp; as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/itchio-black-friday-sale-gives-creators-all-revenue" rel="nofollow">developers themselves</a> - with its bundles and fundraising efforts, it's probably in Funko and BrandShield's best interests to make sure this doesn't happen again, assuming they are the ones at fault.</p>
