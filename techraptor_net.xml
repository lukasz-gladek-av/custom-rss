            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crusader-kings-3-khans-of-the-steppe-expansion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox has announced a new&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings 3&nbsp;</em>expansion in the form of&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe</em>, and it's the first part of the game's fourth "chapter".</p>

<p>In a news <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1158310/view/535470580526219410" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Steam, Paradox reveals that&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>will launch on April 28th, and that it'll begin "the next stage in <em>Crusader Kings 3</em>'s development". As with previous&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-major-crusader-kings-3-expansion-highlights-royal-court" rel="nofollow">expansions</a>,&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>will add a number of new gameplay mechanics and features.</p>

<p>Since the expansion is based around the Mongols, it probably won't come as a surprise to learn that the first major feature is a nomadic government system. You'll be tasked with exploiting the resources in your current location, then moving on to a new place with more resources to reap.</p>

<p>The new Dominance system will also measure your power and influence within the steppe, and Paradox says that if you manage to raise your Dominance high enough, you "might even claim the mantle of Genghis Khan; the Universal Ruler".</p>

<p>You can also look forward to "changing climate and weather patterns" affecting your life in the steppe; you may, for instance, have to contend with sudden snows "decimating fertility and putting pressure on you to find greener pastures".</p>




<p><em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>may be&nbsp;<em>Crusader Kings 3</em>'s first Chapter 4 expansion, but it's not the main event; that honor goes to&nbsp;<em>All Under Heaven</em>, which will, as the name suggests, expand the game's map to encompass Asia.</p>

<p>You can look forward to new cultures, faiths, and more in this expansion, as well as a new Dynastic Cycle system that will have you attempting to maintain the Mandate of Heaven to prove you can "navigate the empire through treacherous waters".</p>

<p>There's no release date for&nbsp;<em>All Under Heaven&nbsp;</em>yet, but the first dev diary is set for May, with regular dev diaries for&nbsp;<em>Khans of the Steppe&nbsp;</em>also due to air throughout April until the expansion's release.</p>
