            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-ps5-rumor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new leak has emerged which suggests that&nbsp;the venerated&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>series, previously exclusive to Xbox consoles and PCs, could be on its way to the PS5 at some point in the near future.</p>

<p>As spotted by leaker <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1932240994939834370" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">eXtas1s</a>, trusted&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>source <a href="https://x.com/gruntdotapi/status/1932217175885938726" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">grunt.api</a> spotted a reference to a&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>game for PS5 within the series' API, an information repository that provides info for developers.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the API listing doesn't show which game in the&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>series is coming to PS5, although they do say that since the listing has a <a href="https://x.com/gruntdotapi/status/1932218210528739642" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">"new ID"</a>, it probably won't be the <i>Master Chief Collection</i>, <a href="https://x.com/gruntdotapi/status/1932405680742580324" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">nor will it be</a>&nbsp;<em>Halo Infinite</em>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, of course, it's possible the API listing could be for a rebrand or a remastered version of an existing game, so we could well be getting an&nbsp;<em>Infinite&nbsp;</em>port for PS5.</p>

<p>If I was launching a long-running series like <i>Halo&nbsp;</i>for the first time on a new ecosystem, then I'd probably release a remake or remaster of the very first game in the series to introduce new fans, but hey; I'm not Microsoft, nor am I Sony.</p>

<p>I guess we'll just have to wait and see what the&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>PS5 listing turns out to be, assuming that it's legit in the first place, of course. None of this has been confirmed by any of the major parties involved, so take that with a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>The franchise was also subject to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/huge-halo-leak-digsite" rel="nofollow">massive leak back in December</a>, with around 90GB of data being leaked from 343 Industries. That data included in-development game builds, documents, and tools relating to the&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>series, plus lots of other tidbits.</p>
