            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolcen-devs-project-pantheon-live-service<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem&nbsp;</em>developer Wolcen Studio has announced&nbsp;<em>Project Pantheon</em>, a game the studio describes as a "first-of-its-kind" experiment set in a world inspired by mythology.</p>

<p>In a press release, Wolcen Studio describes&nbsp;<em>Project Pantheon&nbsp;</em>as an "ExtrAction RPG" offering "intense" hack-and-slash gameplay in an extraction-style framework. Think&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>crossed with&nbsp;<em>Diablo IV&nbsp;</em>and it seems like you'll be most of the way there.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why you'd want to add yet another live service game to your slate in the year of our lord 2025, Wolcen Studio's answer lies with that unique blend of gameplay styles, which director Andrei Chirculete describes as a "fusion of different, exciting gameplays".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wolcen-developer-project-pantheon-combat.jpg?itok=ztnRgCOC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wolcen-developer-project-pantheon-combat.jpg?itok=SXt9d-QP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Project Pantheon&nbsp;</em>is the next game from Wolcen Studio, and yes, it's live service.</figcaption></figure><p>Lest you doubt that this is the direction&nbsp;<em>Project Pantheon&nbsp;</em>is taking, the press release describes the game as a "free-to-play live service game", so this will very much represent a break from the one-and-done payment model of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wolcen-lords-of-mayhem" rel="nofollow"><em>Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem</em></a>.</p>

<p>Wolcen Studio is promising "dynamic PvPvE combat" across a range of "diverse maps". You'll explore these maps, gather loot, and contend with both enemies and opposing players before attempting to extract with the loot you've gathered.</p>

<p>If you do so successfully, you'll be able to keep what you collected, but failure might result in "losing [your] gear for good". In other words, it's a fairly typical extraction-style gameplay loop, but with a&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>face.</p>

<p>You'll also have access to a hidden base where you can customize your loadout, experiment with gear, and engage with&nbsp;<em>Project Pantheon</em>'s upgrade systems. The game will feature a "player-driven economy" too; let's hope it pans out better than <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-trading-disabled-another-economy-breaking-bug" rel="nofollow">some other online games' marketplaces</a> have.</p>




<p>If you want to give this one a try, a closed alpha test is being held for European players on the weekend of January 26th, with a North American alpha test coming the following weekend. You can also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3086590/Project_Pantheon/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam here</a> if you want to.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blood-of-dawnwalker-ex-witcher-devs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publiosher Bandai Namco and developer Rebel Wolves have unveiled&nbsp;<em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>, a narrative-focused dark fantasy action RPG set to arrive on PC and current-gen consoles at some point in the future.</p>

<p>If you feel like you've heard Rebel Wolves' name before, that's probably because it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-3-game-director-starts-rebel-wolves" rel="nofollow">the studio set up</a> by&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&nbsp;</em>director&nbsp;Konrad Tomaszkiewicz back in 2022. Back then, the studio said it was working on an action RPG in Unreal Engine 5, and&nbsp;<em>The Blood of Dawnwalker&nbsp;</em>is that very RPG.</p>

<p>Set in an alternate-history 14th-century Europe, the game will revolve around Coen, a man transformed into one of the titular Dawnwalkers. You've got 30 days and nights "to save your family or swear revenge on your sire and destroy everyone standing in your way".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-announcement-landscape.jpg?itok=PvC23Oie 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-announcement-landscape.jpg?itok=GTHsShdT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Blood of Dawnwalker&nbsp;</em>casts you as not-quite-a-vampire Coen.</figcaption></figure><p>Tomaszkiewicz says his game is inspired by "classic RPGs" and that he wants players to "feel the sense of urgency in an open-world game".</p>

<p>According to&nbsp;Tomaszkiewicz,&nbsp;<em>The Blood of Dawnwalker&nbsp;</em>will offer "multiple approaches to saving Coen's family", and there will be "no clear division" between the main story and sidequests. You can, he says, "decide on how you spend the time".</p>

<p>He goes on to say that you won't be able to complete all of&nbsp;<em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>'s "stories and arcs" before the 30 days and nights have elapsed, so each playthrough will be unique. That sounds like an impressive boast.</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer below if you want to get a sense of what&nbsp;<em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>'s atmosphere will be like. Technically, there's also a little gameplay footage, although it's real blink-and-you'll-miss-it stuff.</p>




<p><em>The Blood of Dawnwalker&nbsp;</em>is set to launch for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. It doesn't have a release date yet, so stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

Even better, the sheer variety in genre, style, and intention of music can be hugely different in just one game. From standalone tracks that would live anywhere, to those that enhance their games to great effect, here's our best soundtracks of 2024.</p>

<p>Here are the nominees for TechRaptor's 2024 Best Soundtrack Award for outstanding overall score.</p>

<ul><li>Astro Bot</li>
	<li>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</li>
	<li>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</li>
	<li>Metaphor: ReFantazio</li>
	<li>Star Wars Outlaws</li>

<hr><h2>Third Place -&nbsp;Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h2>



<p>Developer: MachineGames | Release Date: December 9th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p>

<p>There's something so magical about a John Williams score. His style is what made things like the <em>Indiana Jones</em> and<em> Star Wars</em> theme so memorable to this day. I was so excited to hear that theme when loading up <em>Indiana Jones</em>, but what was even more impressive was the way composer Gordy Haab was able to capture that epicness throughout the whole score.</p>

<p>It wasn't just the loud moments, filled with the sounds of horns and strings as Indy ran from traps or fought Nazis, but also the soft chimes of solving a puzzle. The music constantly enhanced the experience while keeping the player grounded in the world as Indiana Jones.</p>

<h2>Second Place - Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</h2>



<p>Developer: Square Enix | Release Date: February 29th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Austin Suther</p>

<p>Within the past few years I started a collection of some of my favorite video game soundtracks. After playing<em> Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, I knew what my next addition to the collection would be. With dozens upon dozens of tracks, there’s a unique song to accompany almost every occasion in <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>.</p>

<p>The expansive overworld has its own themes outside of combat, and once you initiate combat, a more “amped up” version of that song plays. Mini-games have their own music, characters have their own themes too, and so much more. Quantity does not always equal quality, but in <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>’s case, every song is a banger.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Winner - Metaphor: ReFantazio</h2>



<p>Developer: Atlus | Release Date: October 11th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p>

<p>As expected with veteran composer Shoji Meguro, the music in <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> works overtime to claim your attention. The biggest, and most notable, earworm is of course <em>Warriors in Valour</em>, the main battle theme.</p>

<p>Because of the game's structure, you're less likely to get fatigued over it because battles won't happen as often, thanks to the overworld mechanics. But when they do happen? You've got the most energetic monk in your corner, chanting for your victory.</p>

<p>You've surely noticed it if you played the game—it's a triumphant mood shift from a decent battle theme to a rousing cheer toward triumph. To call it "epic" doesn't begin to describe how it gets the blood pumping.</p>

<p>Another song worth shouting out is the final boss theme. Without spoiling anything of course, it masterfully blends themes that you've heard throughout the the long, 80+ hour journey. While taking down the final boss, the music reflects back on every step you've taken to get to there.</p>

<p>When the music tells its own story on top of the main narrative, it absolutely earns your attention--and our praise.</p>
