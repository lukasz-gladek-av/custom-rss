            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-physical-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The physical version of celebrated action RPG&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>finally has a release date, so mark your calendar if you've been waiting to check this one out on disc.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/PMStudiosUSA/status/1854901792414241099" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> by physical game company PM Studios, the physical version of&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>arrives on PS5 on December 12th. Naturally, the PC version's not getting a physical edition; after all, when was the last time your PC had an honest-to-goodness disc drive?</p>

<p>If you're worried that the physical version of the game will just be one of those empty-box-with-no-actual-disc-inside deals, you needn't be. PM Studios <a href="https://x.com/PMStudiosUSA/status/1854909999048458693" rel="noopener" target="_blank">has confirmed</a> that the box will, in fact, contain a proper disc, and not just a code.</p>

You can claim this equipment from the Keeper's Shrine menu.</p>

<p>If&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>'s physical launch is anything like as successful <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/black-myth-wukong-expansion-sales-18m">as the digital version was</a>, then we can likely expect this release to break a couple more sales milestones, which will no doubt make developer GameScience happy.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, it's an action RPG developed by Chinese studio GameScience and based loosely on the classical novel&nbsp;<em>Journey to the West</em>.</p>

<p>Rather than Wukong himself, you control the Destined One, a distinctly simian warrior whose destiny is to follow in the footsteps of the legendary trickster god. Along the way, you'll meet plenty of colorful characters and visit lots of beautiful locations inspired by classical Chinese mythology.</p>




<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>is a Soulslike, so you can expect tough boss fights and plenty of semi-linear exploration, although the game goes a little easier on the difficulty than the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/elden-ring"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/black-myth-wukong/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. The physical version of the PS5 release is due to arrive on December 12th.
