            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-rpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom and Tencent subsidiary TiMi Studio Group have announced&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders</em>, an open-world action RPG set to be released for mobile devices.</p>

<p>The two studios describe&nbsp;<em>Outlanders&nbsp;</em>as an "open-world survival game set in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>universe", and you'll be able to do all of the things you'd expect from a&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game, including discovering ecosystems, crafting gear, and hunting alongside your friends.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders&nbsp;</em>yet, but TiMi and Capcom say they will be conducting "several play tests in advance", although those don't have dates yet either, unfortunately. The goal with the game is to create a mobile experience you can enjoy "with friends, anytime and anywhere".</p>

Expect open-ended areas to explore, monsters to take down, and lots of elaborate, ostentatious armor and weapons to build from monsters' remains.</p>

<p>The two studios are promising "natural environments [and] ecosystems" to discover, so like classic&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>, you'll probably be able to observe monsters as they go about their daily lives before you start your hunt.</p>

<p>If you're interested in&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders</em>, you can sign up for email announcements via the <a href="https://monsterhunteroutlanders.com/en/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">newly-created official website</a>, which also displays some rather evocative concept art.</p>




<p>The reveal of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders&nbsp;</em>comes as Capcom gets ready to release&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, the next mainline entry in the franchise, which is scheduled to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">arrive across PC and consoles in February</a>.</p>

<p>It's shaping up to be a pretty big success already; an open beta was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta" rel="nofollow">held earlier this month</a>, and the beta alone <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">broke the series' Steam player count record</a> despite not being a full game.</p>

<p>We don't yet have an official release date or window for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Outlanders</em>, so watch this space for more info as and when we get it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gylt-and-rime-developer-tequila-works-files-for-insolvency.1034556/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-insolvency<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Gylt&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Sexy Brutale&nbsp;</em>developer Tequila Works has filed for insolvency, with newly-appointed general manager&nbsp;Térence Mosca citing "prolonged market conditions" as the reason for the studio's predicament.</p>

<p>According to a GamesIndustry.biz <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/rime-developer-tequila-works-files-for-insolvency" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, Mosca says he's proud of what his team "has accomplished together", but that the aforementioned market conditions gave his studio no choice other than filing for insolvency.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Tequila Works <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-rime-sexy-brutale-layoffs" rel="nofollow">canceled an unannounced project</a> and laid off an unspecified number of staff back in October, calling the current moment in the gaming industry an "incredibly difficult time". Evidently, those layoffs and that cancellation weren't enough to save the studio.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tequila-works-insolvency-rime.jpg?itok=9k1Rc0Q0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tequila-works-insolvency-rime.jpg?itok=LjOf2zZz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Tequila Works is responsible for games like&nbsp;<em>Rime</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that insolvency isn't necessarily the same thing as a studio shutdown; essentially, insolvency means an entity isn't able to pay the debts it's incurred, which means Tequila is functionally out of money but not necessarily defunct yet.</p>

<p>As such, the studio could undergo a reorganization under Mosca, although it looks like it might take a pretty mighty reorganization effort in order to save a studio that seems to have been struggling for quite some time.</p>

<p>In the statement provided by GI.biz, Mosca says that the studio is doing everything it can to "provide support and guidance to our teams", an assurance that was also made when the studio laid off staff and canceled its project last month.</p>

<p>The statement notably doesn't say that Tequila has canceled its remaining project or laid off the remainder of its staff, so it's possible we may see Tequila rising from the ashes at some point in the future.</p>

That game was followed by titles like&nbsp;<em>The Sexy Brutale</em>,&nbsp;<em>Rime</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Gylt</em>, as well as last year's&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>spinoff&nbsp;<em>Song of Nunu</em>.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what lies in Tequila Works' future, but don't be surprised if we don't hear from the studio for some time. Stay tuned for more.</p>
