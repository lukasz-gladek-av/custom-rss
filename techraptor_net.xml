<blockquote>
<p>“One of our key goals for second edition was to make the game accessible to new players, not just of <em>Star Trek Adventures</em> but of RPGs in general. I challenged the Starter Set campaign writers to think about what new gamemasters and new players might need to know as they play the game, and we wrote as much of that advice as possible into the campaign booklet. I hope you’ll be able to pick up the box, open it up, hand out characters, and then jump right into the first adventure and cooperatively tell a fun, evocative Star Trek story together. This one’s got it all–a dramatic rescue of citizens in peril, alien life-forms to investigate, and a science-fiction mystery to dig into and solve."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The starter sets are available for pre-order right now on Modiphius' store page. Pre-ordered sets are expected to ship in December. The sets will appear at retail stories in January.</p>
