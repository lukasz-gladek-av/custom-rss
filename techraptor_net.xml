            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-release-date-dlc-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>on Nintendo Switch 2, and the game's major second DLC pack,&nbsp;<em>A Pirate's Fortune</em>, has also been revealed.</p>

<p>As revealed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-release-date-revealed-at-star-wars-celebration" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">during a livestream</a>,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>will land on Nintendo's console on September 4th. The console itself is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">due for launch on June 5th</a>, so you won't have to wait too long between buying your Switch 2 and picking up Ubisoft's open-world&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>adventure.</p>

<p>If you already own&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>and you're waiting for news of the next DLC adventure, Ubisoft has you covered on that front as well.&nbsp;<em>A Pirate's Fortune&nbsp;</em>is the name of the game's second story pack, and it's coming in May.</p>

<p>In true pirate fashion, you'll also be raiding a tomb; the Khepi Tomb will offer "secrets and hidden treasures" for you to discover. What's more, a whole new faction, the Miyuki Trade League, will offer up new Trailblazer rewards, and all you have to do in return is smuggle dangerous goods across the galaxy. What's new, right?</p>

<p>Along with the paid DLC,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>will also be getting some free&nbsp;<em>Skeleton Crew</em>-inspired cosmetics on May 15th, including an outfit for Nix. Be sure to check that out if you want to dress up your cute little friend.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, it's an open-world action-adventure game developed by Ubisoft. Taking place between&nbsp;<em>The Empire Strikes Back&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Return of the Jedi</em>, the game follows scoundrel Kay Vess as she tries to pull off the heist of a lifetime.</p>

<p>Originally released last year, the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">underperformed compared to Ubisoft's expectations</a>, becoming one of the cornerstones of a change in strategy that involves day-one Steam releases and the adoption of an altered season pass model.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-outlaws-review" rel="nofollow">Erren liked it</a>, though, and if you want to find out whether you do, there's a free demo for the game you can check out across all platforms.</p>

<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2842040/Star_Wars_Outlaws/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/star-wars-outlaws/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/star-wars-outlaws/9P87S3NP6SR2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. The Switch 2 version launches on September 4th.</p>
