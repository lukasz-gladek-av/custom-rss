            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/koei-tecmo-financials-profits<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dynasty Warriors&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>studio Koei Tecmo has released its financial results for the 2024-25 fiscal year, and the studio has reported rising profits, largely informed by new releases.</p>

<p>Per the latest Koei Tecmo financial <a href="https://www.koeitecmo.co.jp/e/ir/docs/ir3_20250501_e.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the studio's operating profit has risen by around 12% over last year, and it's also about 7% higher than the studio's forecast for the twelve-month period.</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo says the increase in its profit is largely down to "our new title release", although the studio does also say that "download sales of back catalog titles have grown". Cost reductions have also contributed to increased profits, according to the report.</p>

<p>Koei Tecmo hasn't revealed any information about the sales performance of&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 2: Black</em>, but given that the game was released simultaneously on Game Pass, it's unlikely it's done quite as well as the two aforementioned titles. Still, if&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-500k" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>can do it</a>, so can&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, I suppose.</p>

<p>In terms of future games, Koei Tecmo is currently gearing up to release a new game in the&nbsp;<em>Atelier&nbsp;</em>series,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atelier-resleriana-red-alchemist-and-white-guardian" rel="nofollow"><em>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist and the White Guardian</em></a>, which is set to launch sometime this year, although we don't have a release date for it yet.</p>




<p>The studio is also looking ahead to the launch of&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, which is a co-development project between Team Ninja and&nbsp;<em>Bayonetta&nbsp;</em>studio PlatinumGames. That's due to arrive sometime this year as well, although again, we don't have a concrete release date.</p>
