            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week we were <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/official-spider-man-secret-lair-swings-by-providing-six-sensational-drops" rel="nofollow">treated to news</a> that the next Secret Lair would be <em>Spider-Man</em> themed and we got to check out the<em> Daily Bugle Breaking News</em> drop. At the time, we were teased with six total drops coming but just shown the one. Now we can reveal them all. They all release September 22nd.</p>

<p>Heroes and villains are at the core of any superhero story, and that is exactly where these drops take us. First, let's take a look at some heroes.</p>

<h2>Secret Lair x Marvel's Spider-Man: Heroic Deeds</h2>

<p>A big theme with the overall set of <em>Spider-Man</em>, the art in this drop absolutely pops. All of the artists have backgrounds working as artists for Marvel, like Todd Nauck, Elena Casagrtande, Lucas Wernack, and Swayart.</p>

<p>Here's the list of cards in <em>Heroic Deeds</em>:</p>

<ul><li>Command Tower</li>
	<li>Ephemerate</li>
	<li>Lightning Greaves</li>
	<li>Sol Ring</li>
	<li>Three Visits</li>
</ul><p>All of these should be familiar and are classic cards that see a lot of play. Now they just get the <em>Spider-Man</em> hero treatment.</p>

<p>The non-foil version is $29.99 and the rainbow foil is $39.99.</p>

<h2>Secret Lair x Marvel's Spider-Man: Villainous Plots</h2>

<p>You may see some of the same cards here as in <em>Heroic Deeds</em>, as this drop is meant to complement the <em>Heroic Deeds</em> drop. They both share Command Tower, Lightning Greaves, and Sol Ring. There's a couple of new ones though, and all feature classic <em>Spider-Man</em> villains.</p>

<p>As before, they all feature art from Marvel artists like Todd Nauck, Terry Dodson, Roberta Ingranata, and Kael Ngu.</p>

<p>Here is a list of the cards in <em>Villainous Plots</em>:</p>

<ul><li>Command Tower</li>
	<li>Deadly Dispute</li>
	<li>Go for the Throat</li>
	<li>Lightning Greaves</li>
	<li>Sol Ring</li>
</ul><p>As mentioned, three we've seen before with two new classic cards.</p>

<p>The non-foil version is $29.99 and the rainbow foil is $39.99.</p>

<h2>Secret Lair x Marvel's Spider-Man: Venom Unleashed (Colors)</h2>

<p>You were probably thinking, how the heck was Venom not with the villain drop? Well, Venom is such a big and popular villain that he will feature in not just this drop, but the final three.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This drop features art from Mark Bagley, the artist behind one of the most popular runs of <em>Spider-Man</em> of all time, <em>Ultimate Spider-Man</em>. Obviously, he's no stranger to Spider-Man or Venom, and may just be the perfect choice for this drop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is a list of the cards in <em>Venom Unleashed (Colors)</em>:</p>

<ul><li>Damnation</li>
	<li>Dark Ritual</li>
	<li>Peer Into the Abyss</li>
	<li>Surgical Extraction</li>
	<li>Tendrils of Agony</li>
</ul><p>This list of cards include some of the most iconic black cards of all-time with some of the coolest art they've ever been in as well.</p>

<p>The non-foil version is $29.99 and the rainbow foil is $39.99.</p>

<h2>Secret Lair x Marvel's Spider-Man: Venom Unleashed (Inks)</h2>

<p>This drop features the exact same cards and art as the previous drop but is just the inks, not colored in. Here you can see the crisp linework of Mark Bagley before the colors are added.</p>

<p>As a reminder, the cards for <em>Venom Unleashed (Inks)</em>:</p>

<ul><li>Damnation</li>
	<li>Dark Ritual</li>
	<li>Peer Into the Abyss</li>
	<li>Surgical Extraction</li>
	<li>Tendrils of Agony</li>
</ul><p>The non-foil version is $29.99 and the rainbow foil is $39.99.</p>

<h2>Secret Lair x Marvel's Spider-Man: Mana Symbiote</h2>

<p>Finally, Venom has taken over some basic lands that feature mana symbol for the various lands.</p>

<p>Now, these cards I have seen and held in-person. The photos above do not do them justice. When we were shown them, the Secret Lair team mentioned the treatments on these cards are some of the most complicated they've done to create a unique effect. Parts of the card are raised black symbiote tendrils are shiny, popping out amazingly. They are extremely visually striking.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here is what you get in<em> Mana Symbiote:</em></p>

<ul><li>2x Forest</li>
	<li>2x Island</li>
	<li>2x Mountain</li>
	<li>2x Plains</li>
	<li>2x Swamp</li>
</ul><p>The set includes two of each basic land. They are only available in the raised foil version and cost $59.99.</p>

<hr><p>With that, those are all of the drops for the Spider-Man Secret Lair. Will you be trying to pick any of them up?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Digimon Story Time Stranger Final Preview - I'm a Believer Now]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/digimon-story-time-stranger-final-preview-im-believer-now</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/digimon-story-time-stranger-final-preview-im-a-believer-now.1291521/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A couple months ago, my colleague and our Senior Content Manager Andrew Stretch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/digimon-story-time-stranger-shows-off-vibrant-digital-world-and-quality-of-life" rel="nofollow">played <em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em> at Summer Game Fest</a> and enjoyed it. He's a longtime cheerleader of the <em>Digimon Story</em> franchise, but I never believed him enough to try it for myself.</p>

<p>After three hours with <em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em> at PAX West, I'm a believer now. It pretty quickly shot up to near the top of my October wishlist.</p>

<p>This demo session started off with what was essentially the beginning of the game, and I got a bit of setup for the overall plot and an easy onramp for the gameplay. Then, we transitioned to a later point in the story with level 20 Digimon.</p>



<h2>Digivolving to a Better Quality of Life</h2>

<p>The first major aspects I noticed with <em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em> is just how many quality-of-life features there are. While I haven't played previous ones in the series, I know my way around a classic JRPG, and this one had a lot of lovely shortcuts.</p>

<p>We previously reported on some of them, like how you can auto-defeat wild encounters if your average level is stronger and still earn XP—even for 'mons in your storage. Combat animations can also be sped up by up to five-times speed.</p>

<p>I noticed a few new ones in my hands-on time at PAX, too. You can stand still in the overworld to automatically regenerate health and stamina. Your storage for all your Digimon can also be accessed anywhere in the overworld, making it easy to swap your 'mons out as needed.</p>

<p>"We don't need to do all the wasteful movements that people in past Digimon story titles had to go through," Producer Ryosuke Hara told me through a translator. "And trust me, we know there are people that have spent hundreds, if not thousands of hours in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-review-digimon-are-champions" rel="nofollow"><em>Cyber Sleuth</em></a> and whatnot."</p>



<p>Battles are often determined by your understanding of type effectiveness, as you'd expect from a monster-taming game. I'm largely new to the franchise though, so learning the different attributes and elements felt like a lot to wrap my head around initially.</p>

<p>However, the combat UI makes it super easy to understand what's super effective and how strong (or weak) the multiplier will be. After all, this is a big monster-hunting turn-based RPG with hundreds of thousands of matchups to consider.</p>



<p>Overall, these quality-of-life improvements go a long way to making the game more convenient and streamlined, according Hara-san. He and the team iterated to find that perfect balance of ease without making it too easy. There's one big anchor that they used to balance this convenience against.</p>

<p>"In the end, we tried to balance it with the boss battles. We tried to make the boss battles more fun. We tried not to shake it up too much," Hara-san said through a translator. "Every boss battle is going to be appropriately hard for where you are in the story. That acts as the balancing in the game."</p>

<p>He assured us that while the boss battles ultimately serve as the skill checks, you likely will never be stuck in an impossible scenario. If your team isn't matching up well, you can always De-Digivolve and re-Digivolve your team to find new ways in.</p>



<h2>Digimon Gets Personal</h2>

<p>With the newly introduced Personality system, these conveniences feel like they'll go a long way to making <em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em> a good time. Depending on which Personality a Digimon has, their stats will grow a certain way.</p>

<p>This system works on two levels, I've noticed. On the surface, you can really shape a Digimon's character and feel more of an attachment to them. If you feel like your Agumon is the brave, heroic type, you can foster that by interacting with him and answering questions with brave responses. It helps you develop more of a personal bond.</p>

<p>On a deeper level, understanding their Personality type will help you optimize their stats, allowing you to amplify their strengths and cover up their weaknesses. This creates a deeper endgame for players who really want to go that extra mile and make a team of absolutely perfect Digimon--or hell, even make a perfect version of all 450+ Digimon in the game.</p>



<h2>So What's the Digimon Story?</h2>

<p>In this universe, there's a Digital World that coexists with reality, and there's an ongoing war between Digimon that could lead to a cataclysmic apocalypse in both. You're part of ADAMAS, an investigation team that's trying to stop the calamity.</p>

<p>The protagonist is a Tamer that collects and controls Digimon to fight rogue Digimon and other threats. In the second part of my play session, a character mentioned something called the "Shinjuku Inferno," which sounds related to (or could be) whatever bad thing we're trying to prevent.</p>

<p>The game doesn't really waste time getting conflicts into motion; the opening hour or so throws you into the thick of a protest that goes wrong, and it ultimately leads what feels like a major inciting incident.</p>



<p>With a 40–50 hour campaign, there will be a lot to sink our teeth into when <em>Digimon Story Time Stranger</em> releases on Oct. 3. Personally, between the strong turn-based combat, quality-of-life upgrades, and intriguing apocalyptic story, I'm convinced I should've been a <em>Digimon Story</em> fan a long time ago.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Former Xbox VP Says Game Pass Creates "Weird Inner Tensions" Among Devs]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-shannon-loftis-comments</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another former Xbox staffer has added their voice to criticisms surrounding Xbox Game Pass and other gaming subscription services, and this time, it's ex-Xbox VP Shannon Loftis' turn to cast a critical eye over the service.</p>

<p>Speaking on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7369880832481660928?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7369880832481660928%2C7369898365943218176%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287369898365943218176%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7369880832481660928%29" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, Loftis first admits that Game Pass "can claim a few victories with games that otherwise would have sunk beneath the waves", citing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/human-fall-flat-review-drunk-puzzling" rel="nofollow">breakout platformer&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/human-fall-flat-review-drunk-puzzling" rel="nofollow">Human: Fall Flat</a>&nbsp;</em>as an example of this process in action.</p>

<p>However, Loftis goes on to say that "the majority of game adoption" on Xbox Game Pass "comes at the expense of retail revenue", with the exception of games that are "engineered from the ground up for post-release monetization".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/human-fall-flat-xbox-game-pass.jpg?itok=vkFBFQPw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/human-fall-flat-xbox-game-pass.jpg?itok=ADOraKxo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Not every Game Pass game can be&nbsp;<em>Human: Fall Flat</em>, says ex-Xbox VP Shannon Loftis.</figcaption></figure><p>Loftis concludes by saying that she "could (and may someday) write pages on the weird inner tensions this creates" among developers whose games will be appearing on Game Pass.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that Loftis isn't the first former Xbox staffer to offer a colorful opinion on the Game Pass subscription service this month.</p>

<p>Her comments follow those of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-bethesda-exec-says-gaming-subscription-services-worth-jack-s-without-proper-support-for-game-developers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ex-Bethesda exec Pete Hines</a>, who said last week that subscription services are "worth jack shit" without companies "figur[ing] out how to balance the needs of the service...with the people who are providing the content".</p>

<p>Indeed, Loftis' comment was posted in response to former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/shawn-layden_former-bethesda-exec-says-gaming-subscription-activity-7369880832481660928-HhnQ/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reposting Hines' comments</a> himself, adding that the question should not be whether subscription services are profitable for their owners, but whether they are "healthy and helpful" for devs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-game-pass.jpg?itok=MDF4q3v2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-game-pass.jpg?itok=R8iBpTLK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some games, like&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, almost certainly won't be hurt by launching on Game Pass on day one.</figcaption></figure><p>Launching on Game Pass on day one doesn't necessarily preclude a game from achieving financial success. Games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-3-3m-33-days" rel="nofollow">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remastered-sales-circana-april-2025" rel="nofollow">recent&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster</a> debuted on Game Pass, but still seemingly managed to rack up very respectable sales for themselves.</p>

<p>Still, these execs' comments on Game Pass and other subscription services should give us pause for thought, especially when it comes to smaller indie devs (and even major first-party studios). Stay tuned for more on this.</p>
