            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-financials-2024-25<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has released its financial statement for the fiscal year ending in March 2025, and revenue and profit are both up for the&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>publisher.</p>

<p>Per the company's latest presentation, revenue across all sectors jumped by 17% this year, while operating profit rose by 27%. In the "Digital Entertainment" sector (which covers Konami's video game business), revenue was up by 22.5%, while profit grew by 24.7%.</p>

<p>In an accompanying <a href="https://img.konami.com/ir/en/ir-data/statements/2025/en0508_28h9rg.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">document</a>, Konami attributed its success this year to the successful release of Bloober Team's&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake, which had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">sold two million copies</a> at last count. The two studios are currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-konami-new-game-ip" rel="nofollow">working together on another new game</a> based on a Konami IP, although it's unclear whether that IP is&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>.</p>

Early Days Collection</em></a>, which features 14 "nostalgic classic digital titles", as Konami says.</p>

<p>Sadly, Konami doesn't reveal any sales figures for these collections, so we don't know how well they're doing. We do, however, know that a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-star-leap-announced" rel="nofollow">brand new&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>game is in development</a>, albeit a mobile RPG that will almost certainly feature gacha mechanics.</p>

<p>As regards the future, it's looking like a pretty packed year by Konami's standards. In the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">next few months</a>, the studio will release&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, an Unreal Engine 5 remake of the 2004 stealth-action classic with a new visual makeover and some hefty gameplay improvements.</p>

<p>Konami also says it's "committed to the development" of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-officially-revealed-konami" rel="nofollow">upcoming survival horror title&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em></a>, although the studio stops short of revealing a release date or even a release window for the game.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bandai-namco-sales-2024-25</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bandai-namco-sales-up-this-year-as-profits-nearly-double.1184454/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bandai-namco-sales-2024-25<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has released its financial summary for the 2024-25 fiscal year, and things are looking up for the Japanese publisher when compared to last year.</p>

<p>In its statement, Bandai Namco reveals that its net sales have risen by 18% this year, and that operating profits are up by nearly 100%, having risen from 90 billion yen in the 2023-24 period to 180 billion this year.</p>

<p>The company's success comes after a couple of big hitters performed very well indeed. Fighting game&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, for instance, hit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-5m" rel="nofollow">five million sales</a>&nbsp;within around four months, while&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>DLC expansion&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales" rel="nofollow">reached the same milestone in under a week</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-giant-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=ZWv0V6jQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-giant-bandai-namco.jpg?itok=wwjY4CwV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC contributed to a good year for Bandai Namco.</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">passed the 30 million sales mark</a> recently, and while this was revealed too late to be part of the 2024-25 fiscal year, it still indicates that the base game has been selling steadily over the past twelve months or so.</p>

<p>These figures have helped to compensate for what was a pretty egregious failure on Bandai Namco's part in the form of&nbsp;<em>Unknown 9: Awakening</em>, which sold poorly on release last year, causing developer Reflector Entertainment (which is a Bandai Namco subsidiary) to be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/unknown-9-awakening-layoffs-cancellation-reflector" rel="nofollow">hit by layoffs</a>.</p>

<p>In terms of what lies in Bandai Namco's future, the company has reason to be optimistic about the next twelve months as well. Later this month, the studio will release&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>alongside FromSoftware, and if the base game's sales figures are anything to go by, Bandai Namco could well have another hit on its hands.</p>

<p>A third game in the&nbsp;<em>Little Nightmares&nbsp;</em>series is also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/little-nightmares-3-delayed" rel="nofollow">due to be released this year</a>, and it'll be the first title in the series not to be developed by Tarsier Studios, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/tarsier-studios-reanimal-introduces-tense-and-terrifying-journey" rel="nofollow">working on its own horror game</a>.</p>
