            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This past weekend at New York Comic Con saw the announcement of a <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> board game localization. Yen Press has announced that the tabletop adaptation of Ryuko Kui's fantasy manga will be getting an official English-language release.</p>

<h2>The <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> Board Game Localization Announcement</h2>

<p>At a panel at New York Comic Con, Yen Press announced it had secured the rights for an English-language version of the <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> board game. This announcement came alongside the company's purchase of the licenses of several manga and graphic novels.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/delicious-in-dungeon-board-game-game-set-up.jpg?itok=izf_k_tf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/delicious-in-dungeon-board-game-game-set-up.jpg?itok=b1DidOCU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The board game is an adaptation of the fantasy manga by Ryoko Kui. The manga follows a group of adventurers as they delve deep into a dungeon on a mission to rescue a friend. This standard fantasy trope is elevated by the dungeon being a fully fleshed-out ecosystem, complete with individual monsters having unique anatomy. Which means, if you know what to do, the monsters can be turned into delicious meals.</p>

<p>The original Japanese release, according to a report by <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/delicious-in-dungeon-board-game/announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Wargamer</a>, was published in 2022 and features original artwork by Kui. This is notable because it is two years before the debut of the&nbsp;<em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> anime, which catapulted the series into mainstream popularity. The game is a rough adaptation of Ginichiro Suzuki's 1998 board game, <em>Monster Maker</em>, with some dungeon crawl elements.</p>

While, according to an interview <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/comics/delicious-in-dungeon-manga-creator-known-for-immaculate-dandd-vibes-says-shes-actually-never-played-dandd-but-loves-rpgs-like-baldurs-gate-3/" rel="nofollow">by GamesRadar</a>, she hasn't played the most popular of fantasy TTRPGs, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, Kui has put plenty of time into the officially licensed critical masterpiece, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/baldurs-gate-3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Baldur's Gate 3</em></a>.</p>

<p>The English release of the <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> board game will be available May 2026.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-shatterpoint-fall-2025-expansions-the-force-is-strong.1324756/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Picture this: you're in the middle of a heated fight with your opponent. One wrong move could cost you the game. Who would you rather have by your side? A highly trained squad of Clone Troopers, scary fish men, Rogue One, or even Vader and Ashoka? All of this is made possible thanks to Star Wars: Shatterpoint's September 2025 expansion. Asmodee USA sent me review copies of the new line, so let's take a quick look!</p>

<h2>I Am No Jedi Duel Pack</h2>

<p>This set comes with Ashoka Tano, Fulcrum, and Darth Vader, Fallen Master. But let's focus on the first before jumping into Vader. Ashoka is a primary unit with a four-force cost, and it can only be paired up with other characters from the Age of Rebellion. Her kit is built around inflicting as much damage as possible to her opponents. This is further reflected in her abilities, which she can perform.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_164243555.portrait.jpg?itok=3tDXI7EU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_164243555.portrait.jpg?itok=VhP8Sp1J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>She is no Jedi</figcaption></figure><p>Ahsoka has two reactives, one of which allows you to damage an opponent if they land misses during a melee attack, and the other lets her unit make a combat action as long as they're within the character's line of sight.&nbsp; That's all, without mentioning her Identity move, because whenever a unit is wounded, you'll automatically receive one force (if spent) and jump. In addition, if the attacking enemy is a primary or secondary unit, you'll also be able to make a five-dice melee attack with one character.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_164508213.portrait.jpg?itok=2z1VJQGx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_164508213.portrait.jpg?itok=LB9G7FjF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>She can pack a punch</figcaption></figure><p>So if you're looking for someone to dive headfirst into the heat of battle to offset an objective, Ahsoka is a perfect fit for your strike force. Even though we didn't dive too much into it, her defensive stance can max out at 5-8 damage, while her defensive stance maxes out at 6-7. Vader is a really interesting character for a couple of different reasons. He's classified as a secondary unit and can not be paired with Anakin Skywalker on the same strike team. But he can be used in the Reign of the Empire and Age of Rebellion era.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_163949145.portrait.jpg?itok=0qjEI8QK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_163949145.portrait.jpg?itok=LxQU2REi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Father of the year over here.</figcaption></figure><p>His kit is a bit different and is mainly meant for tactical uses. He's all about damaging himself or anyone in his unit, and in return, they'll be able to hold objectives, move up the board faster, or get the jump on their enemies. Being paired with Darth Vader, Fallen Master will give the unit the Protection, Steadfast, and Impact keywords. What's nice about Vader's attack tree is that it's only one-sided, but you can go about it in a couple of different ways thanks to its branching trees. If you really wanted to, you could do 8 damage in one swing if you roll well enough.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_164104126.portrait.jpg?itok=-nyIwSt0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_164104126.portrait.jpg?itok=OleqRBH5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The more you know!</figcaption></figure><p>What's nice about this box is that the keywords for both Vader and Ahsoka don't handicap one another. If anything, they work extremely well in a team, so if you're looking to match up this iconic duo again, you can easily do it and get decent results in return.</p>

<h2>Delta Squad, Form Up</h2>

<p>Star Wars: Republic Commando was one of my all-time favorite games growing up. So, needless to say, I was beyond excited when this set was announced. Thankfully, Delta squad plays on the table similarly to how they did in the game. By this, I mean fast and swift.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_165055492.portrait.jpg?itok=nwU_xFL9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_165055492.portrait.jpg?itok=T54YWQcY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Delta Squad!</figcaption></figure><p>&gt;Many of the abilities built around Delta Squad encourage you to play aggressively. What's nice is that Boss will get stronger after taking a couple of hits, and his tactic ability allows you to add an extra attack die to his role, and if someone in your team is wounded, you'll refresh two force points.&nbsp; At the start of his turn, if there are any Delta Squad members within range four of him, they can dash for free. What's nice about Boss, too, is that both of his stances can inflict significant damage regardless of the one you pick.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_165128405.portrait.jpg?itok=iP9cDJX8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_165128405.portrait.jpg?itok=xAsyExPl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Boss man!</figcaption></figure><p>Fixer plays a bit differently but similarly in a lot of ways, too. His tactical ability allows him to pick another allied Clone Trooper, and once selected, they'll be able to recover and dash. With this, you don't have to worry too much about leaving any characters exposed as long as he's on the board.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_165646646.portrait.jpg?itok=gPxcJfuX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_165646646.portrait.jpg?itok=ia89G-pv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Can he fix it?</figcaption></figure><p>Meanwhile, his two reactives are built around buffing any Clone Troopers you may have in your army. Perhaps the deadliest thing about him is his Innate ability, which lets him control the objective if there's a tie. This ability alone has saved me in a few fights I would have lost, so don't be afraid to push up with him. His attack stats have two trees and have a max of 4-7 damage in one go. Last but not least, we have Sev and Scorch. These, too, are fairly straightforward; get them into a fight and have them back up whoever is on the objective. Many of their abilities are tied to pushing up towards enemies and buffing anyone with the Galactic Republic keyword. Their attack tree has two branches and can do 5-6 damage.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_165855019.portrait.jpg?itok=wQ81K7aw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_165855019.portrait.jpg?itok=T7c4K6ue 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Look at my boys!</figcaption></figure><p>This team is great because they're a high-damage team, and they encourage you to push the frontline. What's nice, too, is that they mainly work well with other Clone Troopers. So if you're looking to max out what they can do, stick them with fellow clones. Terror From Below The Terror From Below pack is a great way to spice up any Separatist strike team you may be building. Most of the team has a lot of keywords that work well with anyone in the Separatist Alliance. Let's look at Riff Tamson first, aka the primary unit of this team. He has two force points and can be paired up with anyone in the Fall of the Jedi era.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_170509662.portrait.jpg?itok=afXKTeNT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_170509662.portrait.jpg?itok=q2_VfobI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Shark Wars?</figcaption></figure><p>Many of his abilities are built around moving across the board as quickly as possible and doing as much damage in one go. Even though his model doesn't show it, he has melee and range options for attack. His melee focus stance can inflict 8 damage, while his ranged stance can do 7-9 damage. But if we're being honest with ourselves, you'll want to ignore his range stance because many of his abilities are tied to melee combat. Even though Nossor Ri is a secondary unit, he takes on the role of a support one in many ways. Many of his abilities are tied to buffing those around him, and getting them up the board a lot quicker if they're part of the Separatist Alliance. He has a ranged and melee attack; in one go, he can max out anywhere between 4 and 6 damage.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_170758750.portrait-1_1.jpg?itok=kEvn9isW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_170758750.portrait-1_1.jpg?itok=SOiOQ1Br 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Squid Wars?</figcaption></figure><p>To finish things off, we have the Aqua Droids. If you're a fan of the Clone Wars era, it should be no surprise that these robots are all about damage. For starters, their activation ability allows them to dash and take a focus action right after, which alone makes them dangerous in any fight. In addition to that, they have the Impact 1 and Protection keywords. If you roll well enough, you can max out 5-6 damage. The only downside about this team is that they only work well with other Separatist Alliance characters. You won't get a lot of bang for your buck if they're paired up with another faction. The Miniatures &gt;Building the minis was pretty straightforward for most. Unfortunately, I faced a lot of issues when it came to the Terror From Below pack. A lot of the major headaches came from the Aqua Droids. The legs weren't fitting into place, and I had to get a bit creative when sticking them together. But if it wasn't for some super glue I had lying around, those legs would have never stuck together for both models.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pxl_20251014_170844585.portrait.jpg?itok=u2WnEPCp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pxl_20251014_170844585.portrait.jpg?itok=R-hHM2Ic 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Building these robots took a while...</figcaption></figure><p>I wish that's where my issues ended. Because shortly after Nossor Ri was built, his trident broke off. It's worth pointing out that I've assembled my fair share of minis, so I know how to properly take care of them. But the second I glued them together, it fell off, and putting it back together was impossible. So when you're assembling this box in particular, be on the lookout for those issues. The Bottom Line This set of expansions is excellent because it caters \ to a lot of different fans. It doesn't necessarily trap you in one era or the other because of the range of strike teams that came out with this release. A lot of the keywords do work well with their respective faction. If you want to venture into one specific army, these boxes may be the ideal set to get you on your way.</p>
