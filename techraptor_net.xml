            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-season-2-emma-frost-ultron<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>season 2 will begin next week, and the developer has also confirmed two new playable characters for the game.</p>

<p>As revealed in a new trailer, Emma Frost and Ultron will be joining the ranks of the Marvel-themed hero shooter when its second season begins on April 11th. It's not yet clear what role either character will play in terms of mechanics.</p>

<p>The debut trailer welcomes players to the Hellfire Gala, which is hosted on the mutant-led island of Krakoa. However, during the opening ceremony of the gala, Ultron interferes and essentially declares war on the gathered heroes. Exciting stuff!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-season-2-ultron.jpg?itok=srW0X84m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-season-2-ultron.jpg?itok=iwbT0xYm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ultron joins the cast of&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>in season 2, along with Emma Frost.</figcaption></figure><p>We also seemingly see a new range of skins that will be available for many of&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' existing characters, with heroes like Wolverine, Cloak and Dagger, and Captain America decked out in their finest formal wear.</p>

<p>NetEase hasn't yet revealed what else lies in wait for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>players when season 2 arrives, but if <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-clampdown" rel="nofollow">season 1</a> is anything to go by, you can expect new events, a new battle pass, and perhaps even some more playable characters arriving later in the season.</p>

<p>Several heroes coming to the game have already <a href="https://www.si.com/esports/news/x-men-heroes-leak-for-marvel-rivals" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reportedly been leaked</a>, including the likes of Cyclops, Gambit, and Rogue, as well as a number of other X-Men-related characters (and, of course, Deadpool).</p>

<p>It is, of course, worth noting that we're simply assuming Emma Frost and Ultron will be playable; it's possible only one of them will be, or maybe even neither of them, unlikely as that may be. Nevertheless, you can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>season 2 right here.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, it's an<em>&nbsp;Overwatch</em>-style hero shooter that lets you play as some of your favorite Marvel heroes (and villains!) across a series of objective-based gameplay modes.</p>

<p>The game managed to reach <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">40 million players</a> within its first few months on release, but despite that success, NetEase still elected to shut down the Seattle studio responsible for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' creation <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">back in February</a>.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is available to play for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/marvel-rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-dlss-ray-tracing</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/switch-2-uses-dlss-and-supports-ray-tracing-nintendo-confirms.1154190/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-dlss-ray-tracing<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed that the Switch 2 uses some form of Nvidia's DLSS upscaling technology, and that the console will also support ray tracing, although the Japanese gaming giant is being a little cagey with details.</p>

<p>IGN got the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-uses-dlss-and-ray-tracing-but-is-being-super-vague-about-the-details" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">chance</a> to talk to Nintendo reps about the Switch 2 during a roundtable yesterday, and in that discussion, Nintendo exec Takuhiro Dota said the Switch 2 "use[s] DLSS upscaling technology", which he describes as "something that we need to use as we develop games".</p>

<p>Apparently, it'll be up to individual developers how the Switch 2's DLSS capabilities are used; Dohta said that "the software developer can choose" whether a game outputs in 4K natively or whether upscaling is used.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-dlss-ray-tracing-tabletop.jpg?itok=fR5sy10m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-dlss-ray-tracing-tabletop.jpg?itok=HNoS0d7p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Nintendo Switch 2 will support DLSS and ray tracing, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>Dohta went on to say that the Switch 2's GPU "does support ray tracing", and that like DLSS, it'll be up to developers whether or not to implement it in games.</p>

<p>As for the GPU's specs, tech exec Tetsuya Sasaki says Nintendo "doesn't share too much on the hardware spec" and that the company prefers to focus on "the value that we can provide to our consumers".</p>

<p>He did, however, say that Nvidia, which is providing the Switch 2's graphics tech, "will be sharing some information", so we may well get to know more about the specifics of the Switch 2's capabilities soon.</p>

<p>If you missed yesterday's Direct, it was revealed during the show that the Switch 2's handheld screen <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed" rel="nofollow">will be a 1080p LCD with HDR support</a> and that the console's dock will be able to support up to 4K resolution. The console will also feature 120fps support in certain games.</p>




<p>We also got a first glimpse of the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">launch lineup</a>, which will include the likes of first-party game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, as well as a number of third-party ports and new releases.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 launches <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">on June 5th for $449.99</a> (up to $499.99 if you want the console bundled with&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>). Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sultans-game-100k-sales-48-hours<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Double Cross Studio and publisher 2P Games have announced that card-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Sultan's Game&nbsp;</em>has crossed a pretty big sales milestone within its first couple of days on release.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Sultan's Game&nbsp;</em>crossed 100,000 sales within 48 hours, which puts it on par with the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/soulmask-sales-100k" rel="nofollow">survival-crafter&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/soulmask-sales-100k" rel="nofollow">Soulmask</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-sales-reach-100k-in-two-days" rel="nofollow">underground indie explore-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em></a>.</p>

<p>By way of a celebration for the sales milestone, Double Cross has revealed some of its plans for&nbsp;<em>Sultan's Game&nbsp;</em>in the next couple of months, which include a new epilogue, extra story stuff, and support for Steam Workshop to allow players to create their own mods.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sultans-game-sales-100k-cards.jpg?itok=bnh9wIP1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sultans-game-sales-100k-cards.jpg?itok=4d1wPHbB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Card-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Sultan's Game&nbsp;</em>has hit 100,000 sales in just 48 hours.</figcaption></figure><p>Other upcoming improvements include a new Quick Execution system, which will allow you to manage your estate and sit through court sessions more quickly. You don't have to switch this on if you prefer to sit these events through, though.</p>

<p>You'll also soon be able to assign card categories to certain hand slots, and you'll be able to set hotkeys to automatically organize your card collection too, which should make it a little easier to sift through your deck.</p>

<p>In addition, Double Cross says it's looking to "fine-tune disruptive sound effects and musical transitions", and a new sensitive content warning toggle will be added to allow you to decide whether you want to be warned about "sensitive storylines" or not.</p>

<p>As well as all of this, a manual save-load system is coming, along with controller and Steam Deck optimization, a new gallery mode for cards and endings, and lots more. Suffice it to say Double Cross and 2P are in it for the long haul when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Sultan's Game</em>.</p>




<p>If you've yet to check out&nbsp;<em>Sultan's Game</em>, you can pick it up right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3117820/Sultans_Game/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, where it'll currently set you back $22.49 (although it's usually $24.99).</p>
