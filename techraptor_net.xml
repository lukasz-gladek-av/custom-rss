            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The original <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/high-on-life-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3e46423c-496a-4cd0-b4f9-f8b468a6aa1d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>High on Life</em></a> was a decent enough title, but one that I’d never consider overly memorable. Its humor often missed the mark, with basic gunplay leaving each encounter feeling overly samey. <em>High On Life 2</em> wants to change this, but has it gone far enough?</p><h2>A Familiar Tale</h2><p><em>High On Life 2 </em>takes place years after the Bounty Hunter’s successful journey to stop humanity from being enslaved and smoked by aliens. After a whirlwind victory tour, they find themselves in a rut, going through the motions each day. They even start off in their old home, which has since been converted into a museum exhibit.</p><p>Things go south when their sister Lizzie - now a freedom fighter - gets a bounty on their head. Heading out to save them, it starts another adventure with the lives of humanity on the line.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>You'll meet a bunch of weird and wonderful characters, though most aren't present for very long.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The basic premise is very similar to that of the first game. Take out bad guys, collect new weapons, save humanity. In fact, I’d go as far as to say that it’s basically just a weaker retread when it comes to the serious side of the story.</p><p>At least <em>High On Life 2</em>’s humorous side is a slight improvement, cutting down on some of the forced chatter that plagued the original. There’s still plenty of it, mind you, with lots of jokes that just boil down to a simple bit that’s dragged on for far too long.</p><p>Many of the stronger jokes are ones that make use of this being a game rather than a TV show. Messing with the UI, having you draw your own face (that you’ll never see due to the game being in first person), and letting you find plenty of optional scenes if you walk off the beaten path.</p><p>I wouldn’t say that I find <em>High On Life 2</em> to be laugh-out-loud funny most of the time, but it’s at least bearable even at its lowest. At the same time, the focus on attempting to be funny does mean that any time things are made to be more serious, it falls completely flat.</p><h2>So-So Gunplay, Now With A Skateboard</h2><p>General gunplay is something that I was hoping <em>High On Life 2</em> would massively improve upon. The first game’s combat had little real impact and got incredibly stale by the end. Unfortunately, it’s generally the same in the sequel.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Returning Gatlians play the same, for better or worse.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While your Gatlians - sentient talking guns - take the place of regular weaponry, they don’t actually feel that different from other sci-fi shooters. You have SMG, a shotgun, and burst rifle equivalents to name a few, and they act generally as you’d expect. Each has access to extra abilities such as time stopping bubbles or electric spikes, but I didn’t use them much outside of platforming and puzzles.</p><p>The main issue is that you’re rarely required to switch guns on the fly during a shootout. Enemies don’t require specific strategies (not even boss fights) and all Gatlians have infinite ammo.</p><p><em>High On Life 2</em> tries to shake things up instead with the skateboard, “borrowed” from another bounty hunter early on. While you can sprint around, you’ll usually instead skate from location to location. It moves at a decent speed, and areas feature lots of jumps and ramps to make use of your new mobility.</p><p>While far from a realistic take on skateboarding, it does add a unique dynamic to movement. It serves as a speed boost, wall ride, and even an additional attack during firefights by launching it at your enemies. Outside of fights, you can also make use of it in skateparks and races for some extra cash and collectables.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The skateboard is the biggest improvement over the original High on Life.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It can be finicky at times, such as killing your momentum after slightly clipping a rock, but it’s overall <em>High On Life 2</em>’s best addition over the original. Add in the air dashes you unlock later, and it becomes a fun way to get around both in and out of fights.</p><h2>A Buggy Launch, Again</h2><p>The first game’s launch was pretty rough, bringing with it a lot of performance issues and bugs. <em>High On Life 2</em> repeats this once again, with a framerate that goes all over the place and plenty of softlocks.</p><p>Playing on a relatively high end system with an RTX 5070 Ti, it would still struggle to hit a stable 60fps in some areas at 1440p high settings. Frame generation obviously helps, but even then, there’s still noticeable stuttering. Many textures also take a long time to load in, staying partially (or fully) low resolution until a good 10 seconds later.</p><figure role="group">

<p>The review build also broke on me plenty of times, something that has only gotten slightly better since launch. Crashes are still present, along with other problems like the UI breaking or enemies not spawning in.</p><p>Some of this could be chalked down to the usual issues with <a href="https://techraptor.net/topic/unreal-engine" data-entity-type="taxonomy_term" data-entity-uuid="a875d7da-96c8-4f88-bce3-b2a21ac015b5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Unreal Engine 5</a>, especially the stuttering. However, the current state of <em>High On Life 2 </em>on PC (and likely consoles) is far worse than normal.</p><h2><em>High on Life 2 </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p><em>High on Life 2</em> is a slight improvement over its predecessor in some ways, but it’s hard to recommend right now in its current state. Bad performance and bugs that might never be fully fixed get in the way of what would otherwise be an inoffensive experience.</p><hr><p><em><strong>High on Life 2</strong> was reviewed on PC using a code provided by the publisher over the course of 20 hours - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>
