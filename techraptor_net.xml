            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced a brand new Nintendo Direct show for this month, and it's set to deliver a significant amount of info about upcoming Switch 2 and Switch games.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1965762503821935034" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a message</a> on social media, Nintendo says the Direct, which is scheduled for this Friday at 9am Eastern, will feature "roughly 60 minutes of information" on games coming to both machines, and this one isn't a Nindies show or a third-party showcase; it's a true blue Direct presentation.</p>

<p>Of course, that doesn't mean it won't feature indies or third-party efforts, but it does hopefully mean we can expect to see what Nintendo itself is cooking up for both Switch consoles for the next year or so.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-direct-september-2025-donkey-kong-bananza.jpg?itok=Fgz1lE3l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-direct-september-2025-donkey-kong-bananza.jpg?itok=DocM9Ngv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We'll hopefully find out what Nintendo is up to in the next Nintendo Direct.</figcaption></figure><p>This will mark Nintendo's third major Direct of the year; the first was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-march-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">back in March</a>, just prior to the announcement of the Switch 2, and it was followed by a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">partner show in August</a>&nbsp;and an indie presentation <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-indie-world-august-2025-show" rel="nofollow">just a few days after that</a>.</p>

<p>This Direct feels particularly significant, however; it's the first opportunity we'll have had since the Switch 2 to see what Nintendo's plans for the future look like, including whether any major releases for the studio's big franchises like&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>are in the works.</p>

<p>It's also likely, assuming the game hasn't been delayed, that we'll be getting a release date for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025" rel="nofollow">the long-awaited&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025" rel="nofollow">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>&nbsp;</em>during this Direct. The game is still scheduled for a 2025 release, but no specific date has been announced by Nintendo thus far.</p>

<p>Whatever's on the cards, this Direct will be longer than the Japanese gaming giant's shows often are, so we'll hopefully get a good chance to go in-depth on the upcoming Switch 2 and Switch slates.</p>

Yes, you read that right.</p>

<p>As a reminder, Nintendo is currently suing Pocketpair, the studio behind&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, for patent infringement, which has already caused the studio to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mechanics-changing-nintendo-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">change the game's mechanics</a> at least once.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallen-tear-the-ascension-preview-%E2%80%93-move-over-silksong.1293552/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a good year for sidescrolling action games. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/shinobi-art-of-vengeance-review-cutting-edge" rel="nofollow"><em>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</em></a> was wonderful surprise from SEGA, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-razor-sharp-retro-platformer" rel="nofollow"><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em></a> could be the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/pax-west-2025-x-games-you-should-add-to-your-wishlist" rel="nofollow">first of two great <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> games this year</a>. I'm sure I don't even need to mention <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> either.</p>

<p>At PAX West, I found what could be the next sidescrolling metroidvania to keep the party going early next year, and that's <em>Fallen Tear: The Ascension</em>.</p>

<p>Developed by a small but mighty team in the Philippines, this game has a nice pace of combat, a charming art style, and a solid foundation for what could be a fun adventure.</p>



<h2>Classic High-Speed Action</h2>

<p>Honestly, my first note I wrote in my notepad for this game was, "That's that good shit." The combat is silky smooth here, reminiscent of games like <i>Dead Cells</i>&nbsp;and <em>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</em>.</p>

<p>From the jump in the demo, I had access to a robust move set that kept me mobile and engaged. Thre's a double jump, dash, air dash, and a backwards dodge just like Alucard's. There's a basic multi-hit combo attack that you can dodge out of almost whenever you'd like.</p>



<p>The biggest rule-of-cool move here is this warping spear that I unlocked partway through the demo. When it connects with an enemy, you appear slightly above and behind them, ready to rain down a quick combo. Equal parts mobility and offense, it was something I spammed whenever I had the chance.</p>

<p>It opened up a fun way of thinking as well, where I'd sometimes leave enemies alive but with low health. If I was in a corner, one well-aimed spear zipped me away to relative safety.</p>



<p>In general, I found myself always wanting to be on the move because it just felt good to move. And you'll want to stay mobile, with the number of enemies and attacks that the <em>Fallen Tear</em> throws at you.</p>

<p>I thought the healing mechanic was nifty, too, as it rewards aggression. Pressing down on the D-pad spends some meter to heal, though it's pretty minimal. Some enemies drop red orbs when they die, and as long as they're on screen, Hira, the protagonist, will suck them in to heal more substantially.</p>



<h2>The Power of Friendship</h2>

<p>Fallen Tear: The Ascension also borrows some inspiration from JRPGs, featuring a party of people you can recruit and swap in and out. You meet them along your journey, but they won't necessarily be out and about, wreaking havoc by your side.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Instead, you sort of "equip" them. You can have up to three at a time, and each one will provide a passive buff. Additionally, they'll each have an active ability that's mapped to when you hold a shoulder button and press a face button.</p>



<p>When three are equipped, you can build up a meter and expend it to do a big group attack using your entire party, which is a great way to unload big damage on a boss.</p>

<p>These characters are more than just combat buffs, though. According to the Steam page for <em>Fallen Tear: The Ascension</em>, you can bond with these party members throughout the story, which is giving <em>Persona </em>social links to me.</p>

<p>Additionally, there's supposed to be a larger focus on these bonds in relation to the story, per its inspiration from JRPGs. I'm all for the power of friendship being a core part of the story, and I hope to see more of it as it comes out next year.</p>



<h2><em>Fallen Tear: The Ascension</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>With its charming, hand-drawn art style, <em>Fallen Tear: The Ascension</em> is a treat to look at, especially in motion. When it pulls you in, it keeps you there with its engaging combat and fluid movement. I can only hope that feeling stays for the long-term as the story unfolds in the full game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asmodee has announced a new Asmodee Kids brand of board games. The <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-rebrands-for-30th-anniversary-with-inspired-by-players-label" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recently renamed</a> tabletop giant's new board game line is dedicated to making shorter, more approachable games for kids. Those games include reworked versions of their most popular titles.</p>

<h2>The Asmodee Kids Brand Announcement</h2>

<p>In a recent report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/09/09/asmodee-to-adapt-its-most-iconic-games-into-shorter-child-friendly-versions-with-launch-of-kids-focused-brand/" rel="nofollow">BoardGameWire</a>, Asmodee plans to launch three board games under the Asmodee Kids brand. As mentioned above, these games will be shorter and simpler redesigns of titles from the company's esteemed catalog.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/asmodee-kids-splendor-kids-box-promo.jpg?itok=L4F-Eyyx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/asmodee-kids-splendor-kids-box-promo.jpg?itok=rNLqZwx6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first of these games is <em>My First Unlock</em>, a simplified version of the escape room-inspired, cooperative card game, <em>Unlock!.&nbsp;</em>This version will be available sometime later this month.</p>

<p>The second title is <em>Splendor Kids</em>, a more accessible version of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/splendor-game-review-splendid" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Splendor</em></a>, the resource management card game, which is set to launch in October. Third is <em>Dixit Kids</em>, a streamlined version of the creative storytelling card game coming next January.</p>

<p>All games launched under Asmodee Kids are designed for a maximum of thirty minutes of play. Furthermore, according to Asmodee, these reworked games were designed in collaboration with child development specialists and have been tested in both schools and community settings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Asmodee CEO Thomas Koegler said the following regarding the announcement of Asmodee Kids:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Board games are more than just entertainment. And while we are keeping the fun at the core of the experience, because that’s what kids are seeking, they also get to develop focus, adaptability, and emotional skills. Asmodee Kids means that children and parents can enjoy our most iconic games together.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Releasing kid-friendly board games is not unheard of for Asmodee. They have launched similar games in their Catan and Ticket to Ride series, but those were sporadic compared to this more dedicated branded product line.</p>

<p>Curiously, at time of writing, only one of the Asmodee Kids board games are available for pre-order. Splendor Kids is available now at an MSRP of $29.99, which is ten dollars cheaper. The other games' prices haven't been listed.</p>
