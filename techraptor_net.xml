            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A recent third-party <em>Daggerheart</em> crowdfunding campaign has reached its funding goal. The new supplement, <em>Hope Springs Eternal</em>, is a modest addition to Darrington Press' fantasy TTRPG, introducing new campaign frames to the game.</p><h2>The <em>Hope Springs Eternal</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2><p>According to its <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ericlazure/hope-springs-eternal?ref=rascal.news" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, the <em>Hope Springs Eternal</em> Kickstarter campaign is a 120-page supplement that brings five original campaign frames to <em>Daggerheart</em>. Each frame is complemented by a location that is usable in any campaign. The campaign joins a small group of other third-party material for the game, including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-of-drakkenheim-daggerheart-triumphs-on-kickstarter-hitting-funding-goal-in" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em></a> conversion.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The first campaign frame is the Ever Rime. As the name implies, the setting is set in a frozen land. The last remaining patches of society survive by living on landmasses attached to gigantic, magic-consuming beasts. Players can play as Shepherds, who guide the beasts to sites of natural magic to keep them alive, or Shamans who commune with the Primordial Fire for guidance. Or...they can chart their own path through the ice.</p><p>The second frame in <em>Hope Springs Eternal</em> is The Eternal Song. This is set in the land of Fermata where the fabled Eternal Song has ceased. As for why The Conductor has stopped the song, it is because the notes have become too old and too worn. The players are tasked with finding new notes for the Eternal Song, all while exploring the role culture plays in society, both large and small.</p><p>Frame number three is Gutterpunk Rhapsody. This gritty, dystopian setting is in a gigantic tower where the players, a group of punks, take matters into their own hands to fight back. It is a setting full of alchemical enhancement and unbound greed. Essentially a fantasy spin on cyberpunk dystopia.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The fourth campaign frame, The Last Curtain, is a more contemplative frame designed for caregivers. Players will join a legendary hero on their final journey, their body and mind slowly decaying over the years. It is a frame that explores themes of trauma and reconciliation.</p><p>Last but not least, <em>Hope Springs Eternal</em> has the Poisoned Roots campaign frame. This frame is an intense land where both beauty and rot coexist, one where the focus is less on combat and more on difficult decisions, ones where the greater good may come at the cost of lives your characters hold dear.&nbsp;</p><p>The design team for this supplement includes Eric Lazure, who has written supplements for the Nordic TTRPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/vaesen-lost-mountain-saga-brings-nordic-horror-this-halloween" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Vaesen</em></a>. The book will also include artwork by Hector Rodriguez, Kalin Kadlev, and Galen Pejeau (<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dusk" rel="nofollow"><em>DUSK</em></a>).</p><p>The different pledge tiers for Hope Springs Eternal are as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Digital Backer for $20:</strong> A PDF of the book</li><li><strong>The Book Lover for $36:</strong> A softcover physical copy of the book</li></ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Hope Springs Eternal</em> Kickstarter campaign has raised $5,725, well past its initial funding goal of $5,000. If you want some extra campaign frames in your <em>Daggerheart</em> games, or want something extra with the recently announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/darrington-press-announces-daggerheart-hope-fear-its-first-official-expansion" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Hope &amp; Fear</em></a> expansion, you have until January 6, 2026, to back the campaign.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher IO Interactive has announced that upcoming spy adventure <em>007 First Light </em>has been delayed beyond its originally-announced release date.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/007GameIOI/status/2003511022141817016" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">message</a> on social media, the studio reveals that <em>007 First Light </em>will now be released on May 27th next year, which represents a delay of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/007-first-light-release-date" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2642ca01-5e15-44ba-9ed9-26d9d752f67a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">roughly two months</a>. IO says the game is its "most ambitious project to date", and that the delay will allow the devs to ensure the project is up to snuff when it's released.</p><p>Despite the delay, it sounds like development on <em>007 First Light </em>is going smoothly; IO Interactive says the game is "fully playable from beginning to end", so all that needs to be done now is work to "further polish and refine the experience".</p><figure role="group">

<p>If you're awaiting more information about <em>007 First Light</em>, IO Interactive says it'll share more about the project early next year, so you won't have to wait too long. Hopefully, that'll take the sting out of the tail of this delay.</p><p>If you're unfamiliar, <em>007 First Light </em>is an upcoming stealth-action game from IO Interactive, the creator of the <em>Hitman </em>franchise.&nbsp;</p><p>Revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/io-interactive-007-first-light" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f80f45ac-0336-4e81-901a-6eb99e901f21" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">earlier this year</a>, the game will seemingly operate along similar lines to the studio's flagship series, placing protagonist James Bond in a series of exotic locales as he sneaks and bluffs his way past the locals in an attempt to "expose a deep conspiracy".</p><p><em>007 First Light </em>takes place towards the beginning of Bond's career; despite the game's name, Bond hasn't yet earned his "00" license to kill, so you'll witness how he does so over the course of <em>First Light</em>'s narrative.</p>
<p><em>007 First Light </em>is now slated for release on May 27th next year. When it arrives, you'll be able to pick it up on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3768760/007_First_Light/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/007-first-light/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/007-first-light/9PJ34M93ZV7Z" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/007-First-Light-2792136.html" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Mike Klubnika and publisher Critical Reflex have revealed that unsettling indie horror game <em>Buckshot Roulette </em>has managed to pass another huge sales milestone, and they've provided an update on the game's console ports as well.</p><p>As revealed <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2835570/view/509600244355303413" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">on Steam</a>, <em>Buckshot Roulette </em>has reached a staggering eight million copies sold since launching back in 2023. Given that it's currently only available via Steam or Itch.io, that's a very impressive milestone indeed, putting the game ahead of heavy hitters like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-5m-update" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a11aa258-e2c1-48df-ac44-95f3a37e9c4a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a>, not to mention <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/octopath-traveler-series-sales-6m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ee685a54-e9eb-48df-87dd-8c1a309e1116" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the entire <em>Octopath </em>series</a>.</p><p>Klubnika and Critical Reflex describe the new milestone as "insane", emphasizing that there are "whole countries with fewer citizens" than the total count of <em>Buckshot Roulette </em>players. Again, it's worth remembering that the game isn't available on any kind of subscription service and never has been, so this really is sales rather than just players.</p><figure role="group">

<p>In the Steam post, Klubnika and Critical Reflex also provide an update on the console versions of <em>Buckshot Roulette</em>, which were originally due to arrive this year. However, due to "some technical difficulties, mostly because of the engine", the game will be arriving on consoles next year.</p><p>Additionally, over the course of the next year or so, you can look forward to new <em>Buckshot Roulette </em>merchandise hitting the shelves, as well as a physical release for the game's soundtrack in case you want to relive your days trying not to shoot yourself in the face in a grimy basement.</p><p>In case you're unfamiliar, <em>Buckshot Roulette </em>is an indie horror game that combines <em>Inscryption</em>-style atmosphere with Russian roulette gameplay mechanics. As you've probably surmised from the title, the idea is to "play Russian roulette with a 12-gauge", and whether you walk away with your life or not is up to fate.</p>
<p><em>Buckshot Roulette </em>is just one of the unnerving horror games available as part of publisher Critical Reflex's slate; it joins the likes of <em>Mouthwashing </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-im-not-a-human-500k-sales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d5684c77-487f-4888-bbf9-847c5d9828ec" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>No, I'm Not a Human</em></a>, along with experimental fare like <em>How Fish Is Made </em>and <em>Carimara</em>.</p><p>You can check out <em>Buckshot Roulette </em>right now on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2835570/Buckshot_Roulette/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> and <a href="https://mikeklubnika.itch.io/buckshot-roulette" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Itch.io</a>, and it's slated to come to consoles next year as well.
