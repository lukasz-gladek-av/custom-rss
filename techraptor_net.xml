            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher GSC Game World has revealed that its post-apocalyptic RPG shooter&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is coming to PlayStation 5 later this year.</p>

<p>The announcement of the game's PS5 port was made via a rather amusing new trailer, which features a familiar character from&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>. I won't spoil its surprises, but you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qFxNZksiSw" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">check it out here</a> if you'd like to watch it.</p>

<p>According to GSC Game World, the PS5 version of&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>will utilize the DualSense's haptic feedback and adaptive trigger features for "deeper player immersion", so presumably, that'll manifest in the form of trigger resistance for guns and various other fun little features.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stalker-2-ps5-vista-pc.jpg?itok=9VWh0-ID 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stalker-2-ps5-vista-pc.jpg?itok=zJcgxK19 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is hitting PS5 soon.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition, the PS5 version of&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>will feature a number of enhancements for the PS5 Pro, so you can add the shooter to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/full-ps5-pro-enhanced-list-launch" rel="nofollow">list of games with extra features</a> for the souped-up version of Sony's hardware.</p>

<p>Other than that, though, it sounds like this will very much be the same&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>with which you may already be familiar. It doesn't sound like GSC Game World will be adding any extra content for the PS5 release, so you won't be missing out if you don't pick it up on Sony's platform.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>, it's the long-awaited sequel to 2007's&nbsp;<em>Stalker: Shadow of Chornobyl&nbsp;</em>(not counting prequel <i>Clear Sky&nbsp;</i>or standalone sequel&nbsp;<em>Call of Pripyat</em>, although the latter does take place after&nbsp;<em>Shadow of Chernobyl</em>).</p>

<p>The game follows new protagonist Skif, who must explore the Exclusion Zone in search of ways to make money to replace his destroyed home (at least, that's how the game opens; it takes some interesting turns after that which I won't spoil).</p>




<p><em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/stalker-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. It's coming to PS5 in "late 2025", according to GSC Game World.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/solar-gardens-review-light-and-bright-victory-point-game-for-casual-crowd</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/solar-gardens-review-a-light-and-bright-victory-point-game-for-a-casual-crowd.1239252/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For board games with a futuristic setting it can be fun to be in the depths of space, or in a Blade Runner-esc future of grit and steel, but it can also be just as refreshing for a game to be in a utopic future of glass buildings, sunny skies, and gardens all around you. That last one is the exact setting of Darrington Press and Designer, Alex Cutler's, new Victory Point game <em>Solar Gardens.</em></p>

<p>The premise of <em>Solar Gardens</em> is quite simple: spend each turn adding tiles to your garden — a 4x4 grid set on the top of a skyscraper — and position them in a way that will help you earn Victory Points and win the game.</p>

<h2>What's In The <em>Solar Gardens</em> Box?</h2>

<p>Within the <em>Solar Gardens</em> box, you'll find the following:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">Rulebook</li>
	<li aria-level="1">Score Sheets</li>
	<li aria-level="1">5x Identical Game Boards</li>
	<li aria-level="1">5x Scoring Reference Cards</li>
	<li aria-level="1">1x Starting Player Token</li>
	<li aria-level="1">90x Garden Tiles</li>
</ul><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/solar-gardens-box-contents.jpg?itok=NrECdwKE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/solar-gardens-box-contents.jpg?itok=0XZm0ahU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Getting set up is as easy as handing each player one of the identical game boards (give the player with the starting board the Starting Player Token) and shuffling and placing each of the Garden Tiles facedown.</p>

<p>Each player can additionally be handed a scoring reference, especially useful if you're a new player and want to get a better idea of what your aim should be. Starting new Victory Point games, I often find that the hardest part is keeping track of what you're trying to score, or at least if it's all only present in the rulebook, it's a lot of people asking to see it. These Scoring References are high quality, clear, and easy to share.</p>

<p><em>Solar Gardens</em> wasn't just an easy game to set up, but to teach it took less than five minutes. I wouldn't say that it's specifically targeted at a younger age group, but maybe a better target would be to say those who want to play a quick board game and want a lesser amount of antagonism from other players. <em>Solar Gardens</em> is a light-hearted and fun experience for the whole family.</p>

<p>The only complaint I might have is that the inside of the box is just empty space for you to dump 90 Garden Tiles into between games. Some wooden grooves to hold the pieces in place would assist in starting the game a bit faster, and not needing to re-flip all tiles to the correct side.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/solar-gardens-mid-game-board.jpg?itok=ampsqlzX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/solar-gardens-mid-game-board.jpg?itok=XsY8VyhZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Only four tiles in you can already see I have three Wind Farms in my top row, one more and I'd earn 4 points</figcaption></figure><h2>Taking Turns To Build Your Garden</h2>

<p>Each turn, the Starting Player will draw a number of Garden Tiles equal to one more than players and flip over the one on top. From there, they can decide if they want to add that Tile to their garden or pass it on to the next player clockwise in rotation.. This tile is passed down the line until it is claimed.</p>

<p>As you've drawn one additional Garden Tile there is one tile that you can discard a round if it fits no one's board, but after that what tile you're left with is what you get.</p>

<p>After a turn has concluded, the Starting Player will shift clockwise, and the process will repeat again.</p>

<p>I really liked the idea of it not just being a game of blind drawing, but a game of chance. If you have a tile in your hand that might contribute two points, do you want to settle with that, or do you think another token in the stack might yield you better results?</p>

<h2>Advanced Strategy With Familiarity</h2>

<p>During my games, it was already a fun enough time just to work on my own board, but I can also see a lot of strategy for more experienced players who aren't just looking at their own board, but the boards of their friends/opponents.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/solar-gardens-completed-board.jpg?itok=0vMlrpcR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/solar-gardens-completed-board.jpg?itok=iCU49WEB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of these were definitely a mistake to select...</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike other Victory Point games like Ticket to Ride there isn't a central place that players are playing, getting in one another's way. If you're looking at a token that might only get you one point… but could lead to the player to the left earning four points then it might just be worth you taking that to deprive them.</p>

<h2>Scoring Is Simple Enough</h2>

<p>While the Scoring References are a great aid in the scoring process itself, for <em>Solar Gardens</em> is incredibly easy to keep track of. The Rows and Columns want you to get four wind farms or four solar panels, respectively, to earn 1-4 points; your longest path is 1 point per path, connected animal habitats are three points (or 5 if you have all), and enclosed gardens with watering facilities earn additional points. There are also just statues that earn points based on their number of loops.</p>

<p>Each Garden Tile you place has the potential to have a number of different features. One might have two Solar Panels and a Wind Farm, another might have a hen house, an apiary, and a solar panel, and a third could just have a habitat and a three-point statue.</p>

<p>I found that even if a tile I drew didn't have exactly what I was looking for, there was normally some benefit in placing the tile.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/solar-gardens-finished-game.jpg?itok=kz-OCQwN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/solar-gardens-finished-game.jpg?itok=DJEcGB-z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>A few Victory Point games I've played in the past have either felt like there was one single objective that was just too good to be true and all players chased that down, or if you went for one objective at the beginning and got poor luck, you were essentially out of the race.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In <em>Solar Gardens</em>, the feeling of always progressing towards multiple goals did a great jobof&nbsp; keeping everyone not only engaged but in closer standing.</p>

<h2><em>Solar Gardens</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Solar Gardens</em> is a great representation of a game not needing the deepest mechanics or the longest runtime to be a fun game. For casual board gamers or a younger audience, this is a great way to get into a Victory Point game that might only take 20-30 minutes of your time.</p>

<p>As you play it more, you'll start to see patterns, and while there's definitely some skill to develop — focusing not only on your own board but on your friend's boards — <em>Solar Gardens</em> serves as a great launching point into some of those harder or antagonistic Victory Point games.</p>

<p>I can see <em>Solar Gardens</em> becoming a well-loved part of anyone's collection for that game to bring out when you just want to play a light board game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[RetroAchievements GB Operator Collab Lets You Earn Achievements in Classic Game Boy Games]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-boy-achievements-retroachievements-epilogue</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/retroachievements-gb-operator-collab-lets-you-earn-achievements-in-classic-game-boy-games.1239249/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>RetroAchievements has announced a collaboration with Playback, allowing you to earn achievements for your old-school Game Boy and Game Boy Advance games.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Playback, it's <a href="https://support.epilogue.co/hc/en-us/articles/4402823733266-How-does-the-Playback-software-integrate-emulators" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">software</a>&nbsp;that uses the libretro API to integrate multiple emulator cores and let you play retro games. It's also software that comes with the GB Operator, a device that lets you emulate your existing cartridges on a PC, and that's where this collab comes in.</p>

<p>Essentially, if you pick up a GB Operator, you'll now find a new Achievements setting within Playback's Settings menu, which will enable you to turn on achievements for your Game Boy carts. You will need the physical device and a real cart, though; achievements won't work with simple ROM files, as far as I can tell.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-game-boy-advance-gb-operator-playback.jpg?itok=rQvoBmDC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-game-boy-advance-gb-operator-playback.jpg?itok=HoleHVK3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Playback now has RetroAchievements integration through GB Operator. Hooray!</figcaption></figure><p>Though RetroAchievements community manager Nebiki doesn't list which games are supported in this crossover, but I'd imagine the collaboration will stretch to all Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games currently supported by the site, as long as you've got the real cartridges.</p>

<p>The new achievements window in Playback comes complete with a dedicated overlay that will show you various categories, including whether achievements are earned, yet to be earned, or even missable. You'll even get notifications when you unlock an achievement, which is neat.</p>

<p>Obviously, the original Nintendo handheld cartridges don't have built-in achievements, so it's neat that Epilogue and RetroAchievements have built in a system to help those games feel that much more modern. Again, though, it's worth bearing in mind that these achievements won't work without the real cartridges.</p>

<p>That's likely because although Playback uses the mGBA emulator for Game Boy Advance games, it's extracting the ROM file from the real cart to avoid legal issues.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/game-boy-advance-nintendo-switch-online-wario-land.jpg?itok=4dFoLczo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/game-boy-advance-nintendo-switch-online-wario-land.jpg?itok=ZSW8QsWf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo's Game Boy and Game Boy Advance re-releases don't come with achievements, sadly.</figcaption></figure><p>Many Game Boy and Game Boy Advance titles are available to play on Switch and Switch 2 via Nintendo Switch Online, of course, but these re-releases don't come with achievements, so if you want to feel that sense of accomplishment that comes with the little achievement "ping", you're better off with GB Operator and Playback, I reckon.</p>

<p>You can pick up a GB Operator right now via the <a href="https://www.epilogue.co/product/gb-operator" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official Epilogue website</a>, and you can <a href="https://www.epilogue.co/downloads" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">download Playback</a> from the same place as well.</p>
