            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has announced a new Developer Direct presentation for later this month, and it will include information on several upcoming games, one of which I'll be particularly interested in learning about.</p><p>As revealed on the official Xbox <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/08/xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">website</a>, the first Developer Direct of this year will air on January 22nd and will focus on three titles, namely <em>Fable</em>, <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>, and Game Freak's <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em>.</p><p>I'll be watching the progress Playground Games has made on <em>Fable </em>with interest; the game, which was delayed to 2026 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fable-reboot-delayed-2026" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="48a951d3-c822-4051-88a7-e27a8ee10808" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">back in February last year</a>, is still a bit of an unknown quantity, and Xbox is promising "a first extended look" at it, so we'll hopefully get to learn exactly what it is during the show.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As well as <em>Fable</em>, the Developer Direct will also be checking in with another Playground Games title in the form of <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>, which will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-horizon-6-revealed-ps5" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7ede297d-3bdf-4de5-b00a-3479b4a33aab" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">launching sometime this year</a> on PC and Xbox (and on PS5 later after that).</p><p>We already know the racer will be moving its open-world simcade action to Japan this time around, but Xbox is promising we'll get to see gameplay during the Developer Direct. I'm willing to bet you'll be racing cars; in fact, I'd put good money on it.</p><p>Finally, the Xbox Developer Direct will be taking a look at <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em>, the action RPG being worked on by <em>Pokemon </em>developer Game Freak that was revealed during Xbox's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4fbf63a2-36dd-4f58-96b0-c33fd1eb85da" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">summer showcase last year</a>.</p><p><em>Beast of Reincarnation </em>is the only game the show will focus on that isn't being published by Xbox Game Studios, but this isn't exclusively a first-party presentation, after all, so why not, I say.</p>
<p>Xbox hasn't promised any new reveals for the show, so it's possible these will be the only three games we get to see. We'll find out on January 22nd, when the next Xbox Developer Direct airs. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
