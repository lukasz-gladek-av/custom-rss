            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/worlds-untold-netease-pause-shutdown<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Worlds Untold, the studio founded by&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Anthem&nbsp;</em>veteran Mac Walters under the auspices of Chinese gaming giant NetEase, has seemingly announced that it's effectively shutting down.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/worlds-untold_its-hard-to-find-the-right-words-for-this-activity-7267282640670482433-OJta/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on LinkedIn</a>, Worlds Untold says it's made the "very difficult decision to pause operations" while it searches for a "new partner to help bring [its] vision to life", which makes it sound as though NetEase might not be part of the picture anymore.</p>

<p>Though the studio insists that "this isn't goodbye" and that "there's more to come", it does say that Worlds Untold staff will be "exploring new opportunities" while the search goes on, so it sounds like Worlds Untold expects to be out of commission for quite some time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/worlds-untold-mac-walters-pause-shutdown-prototype.jpg?itok=EpDwZzMi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/worlds-untold-mac-walters-pause-shutdown-prototype.jpg?itok=cdy72NU5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We don't know exactly what Worlds Untold is or was working on, but it looks like this, apparently.</figcaption></figure><p>Walters announced the formation of Worlds Untold <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mac-walters-worlds-untold-netease" rel="nofollow">back in late 2023</a>, at which point he also said his new studio would focus on "AAA action-adventure games with an emphasis on narrative and worldbuilding".</p>

<p>Worlds Untold's first game would, according to Walters, be a "near-future action-adventure game in a breathtaking world filled with mystery and exploration", although he didn't offer any further information.</p>

<p>Believe it or not, Walters isn't the first BioWare veteran to face the closure of his studio this week. Just yesterday,&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>director Casey Hudson's studio Humanoid Origin <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/casey-hudson-humanoid-origin-closed-down" rel="nofollow">announced its closure</a>, pointing to "an unexpected shortfall of funding" as its reason.</p>

<p>Of course, Walters' studio's situation is a little different. After all, it boasts - or boasted - funding from Chinese gaming titan NetEase, so its closure is perhaps a more worrying sign for other NetEase proponents than that of Humanoid Origin.</p>

<p>They, as well as others who've thrown their lot in with NetEase, may be looking at the closure of Worlds Untold with some consternation, although it's possible that Walters' studio is an isolated incident. We'll bring you more on this as soon as we get it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-playstation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>PlayStation icon and industry legend Shuhei Yoshida is to leave the company after 31 years, he's revealed in a new interview, although it looks like this won't be the last we'll see of him.</p>

<p>In a new PlayStation Podcast episode, for which highlights are available <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/26/all-good-things-a-look-back-at-shuhei-yoshidas-31-years-with-playstation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via the PlayStation Blog</a>, Yoshida says he'll be leaving Sony Interactive Entertainment on January 15th, which means his total time with the company will fall just short of 32 years.</p>

<p>As Yoshida points out in the interview, he was a key part of the original PlayStation project, and since then, he's been instrumental to the brand, serving as a producer on several major PlayStation games as well as a major corporate executive within Sony itself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-playstation-e3-2018.jpg?itok=jip_y7tf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-playstation-e3-2018.jpg?itok=MOdiE3xF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Shuhei Yoshida has served as a major figure for the PlayStation brand for over three decades.</figcaption></figure><p>Yoshida joined the PlayStation team in February 1993; in the PlayStation Podcast interview, he says he was the "first non-technical person" to join lead engineer Ken Kutaragi's team for the project.</p>

<p>According to Yoshida, when Sony Computer Entertainment was first formed in 1993, it was small enough for everyone to be "in one room at the hotel" that served as the venue for the launch party. Yoshida remembers "about 80 people total" being part of the PlayStation team at that time.</p>

<p>Since then, Yoshida has been involved with several major PlayStation projects, including serving as a producer on games like&nbsp;<em>Jak and Daxter</em>,&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo</em>, and&nbsp;<em>The Last Guardian</em>,&nbsp;as well as essentially becoming the public face of the PS4 console launch in 2013.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-playstation-bloodborne-underground.jpg?itok=eLNuJotJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-playstation-bloodborne-underground.jpg?itok=hR_mePTY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You almost certainly saw Shuhei Yoshida a lot if you were around for the PS4's launch.</figcaption></figure><p>Although he's at the very respectable age of 60, Yoshida doesn't appear to have any plans to retire from the industry as a whole anytime soon.</p>

<p>Responding on social media platform X to a user who's concerned Yoshida will be disappearing from gaming altogether, the gaming icon says he'd "like to stay in the industry", so we'll likely see him again before long.</p>

<p>Will he pop up fronting a NetEase studio like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netease-launches-new-studio-pincool-led-by-former-dragon-quest-producer-will-work-on" rel="nofollow">some of</a> his fellow <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-netease-studio-bad-brain" rel="nofollow">industry luminaries</a>? We'll have to wait and see.</p>
