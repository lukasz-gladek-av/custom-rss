            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-13-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>Version 1.3, and it'll bring two new S-level characters to add to your team, plus new areas to explore and more.</p>

<p>Version 1.3 arrives on November 6th, and just like in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-version-12-release-date">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>updates, you can look forward to an expansion of the game's main story. This time around, you'll be working alongside the Hollow Investigative Association to respond to a new threat.</p>

<p>Two major S-level characters will be added to the game in this update as well. The first, Yanagi, is an Electric-Anomaly fighter who can boost Disorder damage for the team and "rapidly deal massive amounts of damage to enemies" with her Ex Special Attack.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-1.3-lighter.jpg?itok=_HtZT77y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-version-1.3-lighter.jpg?itok=HiD-Oqne 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lighter is one of two fighters being added to&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>in Version 1.3.</figcaption></figure><p>Your other fighter this update is Lighter, a Fire-Stun agent who can buff himself by building up his Morale as well as lowering enemies' resistances to the Ice and Fire elements. Two new A-level Bangboos, Baddieboo and Knightboo, are also coming in Version 1.3.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to two brand new gameplay modes. The first, The Mystery of Arpeggio Fault, is a roguelike mode that offers the chance to battle through "random environments with random Resonia and resources".</p>

<p>The Simulated Battle Trial, meanwhile, is pretty much what you think it is based on the name; it lets you practise your combat skills as you hack through increasingly tough enemies, and you can earn Polychromes and Badges by reaching certain levels in said trial.</p>




<p>In case you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is, it's the latest action RPG from&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a>&nbsp;</em>studio HoYoverse. Unlike those games,&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>takes place in an urban fantasy world that's not a million miles away from the likes of&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise, however,&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>takes its cues from games like&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry</em>; it revolves around dealing quick damage, dodging enemy attacks, and racking up combos, although it does still feature HoYoverse's signature gacha mechanics.</p>

<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now for free on <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-ceo-scores-eye-watering-payrise-despite-huge-layoffs.1019259/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella will see his salary increase by an eye-watering amount this fiscal year, despite the fact that Microsoft has laid off thousands of employees over the past twelve months or so.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://microsoft.gcs-web.com/node/33151/html#toc858775_24" rel="noopener" target="_blank">regulatory filing</a> by Microsoft, Nadella's pay will increase to $79.1 million this year, which is a 63% increase on his 2023 pay.</p>

<p>Most of that amount will be awarded in shares, but some of it is also a cash incentive, although Nadella <a href="https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-gets-791-mln-pay-2024-63" rel="noopener" target="_blank">did request a reduction</a> in said cash incentive in order to "reflect his personal accountability for the focus and speed required for the changes that today’s cybersecurity threat landscape showed were necessary".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/satya-nadella-microsoft-ceo-payrise.jpg?itok=kUVxtx2p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/satya-nadella-microsoft-ceo-payrise.jpg?itok=r6EV8KSF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella will earn a staggering amount of money this fiscal year.</figcaption></figure><p>News of Nadella's payrise was accompanied by the release of Microsoft's <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar24/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2024 annual fiscal report</a>, which revealed that Xbox revenue is up 50%, "driven by 44 points of net impact from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized">Activision Blizzard acquisition</a>".</p>

<p>The report states that this increase mainly reflects "the change of Activision Blizzard content from third-party to first-party", so it's essentially Microsoft incorporating Activision Blizzard's revenue into its own figures.</p>

<p>Additionally, the figure includes not only sales, but also Game Pass subscriptions, Cloud Gaming, and advertising, as well as other miscellaneous services.</p>

<p>Nadella's payrise and Microsoft's relative success this fiscal year come after thousands of layoffs at the company. Back in January, Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">let almost 2,000 employees go</a> from its gaming divisions, and those layoffs were followed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-september">hundreds more back in September</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/microsoft-ceo-payrise-world-of-warcraft.jpg?itok=dSDc10yx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/microsoft-ceo-payrise-world-of-warcraft.jpg?itok=TrnrPxIi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Microsoft is now incorporating Activision Blizzard's revenue into its own figures.</figcaption></figure><p>This year also saw Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">closing down three of its studios</a>:&nbsp;<em>Mighty Doom&nbsp;</em>developer Alpha Dog,&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>outfit Arkane Austin, and&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>studio Tango Gameworks, although the latter was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion">subsequently snapped up by&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton</a>, along with the&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>IP.</p>

<p>Nadella isn't the only corporate CEO thriving amidst a very <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th">uncertain time for the gaming industry</a>. In June, it was revealed that EA CEO Andrew Wilson <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs">made over $25 million last year</a> despite that company also suffering <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games">hundreds of layoffs</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/shadows-of-damned-hella-remastered-review-seventh-gen-all-stars</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-seventh-gen-all-stars.1019217/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/shadows-of-damned-hella-remastered-review-seventh-gen-all-stars<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The original&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>has an impressive credits screen if nothing else.</p>

<p>It boasts the involvement of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/classic-adventure-thriller-killer7-makes-its-way-to-steam"><em>Killer7</em></a>&nbsp;creator Suda51,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/resident-evil-4">Resident Evil 4</a>&nbsp;</em>mastermind Shinji Mikami, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/akira-yamaoka-would-love-to-return-to-silent-hill"><em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>composer Akira Yamaoka</a>, as well as legendary cult manga artist Q Hayashida, and that's a pretty darn big sell.</p>

<p>Released in 2011,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>didn't do much sales-wise, but it did garner a cult following in the years after its arrival, so here's Suda's company Grasshopper Manufacture, along with new owner NetEase, to give demon hunter Garcia Hotspur's journey through hell <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shadows-of-damned-remaster-announced-by-grasshopper-manufacture-grasshopper-direct">a new coat of paint</a>.</p>

<p>Lo and behold,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>(very funny, Suda) is exactly what you think it is: a lovable, flawed relic of the seventh console generation. This is the kind of remaster that preserves all of the original's warts and selling points; it's just as fun, just as janky, and just as unfinished as it ever was.</p>

<h2><em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>Is Good Old-Fashioned Fun</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-boss.jpg?itok=hi4GmvRu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-boss.jpg?itok=Lq2aVBgb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you like the simple, no-frills fun offered by old-school seventh-gen gaming, you're in for a treat here.</figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly given Mikami's involvement,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>plays like a sort of grungy heavy metal-inflected&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>, complete with over-the-shoulder third-person shooting and a slightly insane smorgasbord of gameplay styles thrown into the mix.</p>

<p>Over the course of&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered</em>'s eight-hour running time, you'll explore&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>-style villages, solve what could generously be described as "puzzles", and even take part in side-scrolling shooter stages apropos of nothing.</p>

<p>All of this adds up to create a package that feels pleasingly old-school.&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>feels concerned not with wringing every last drop of dopamine out of your exhausted brain, but with showing you all of its many toys and letting you play with each one for just enough time that it never feels boring.</p>

<p>Unlike many of its contemporaries,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>is split into stages rather than being one continuous journey.</p>

<p>Each stage has something unique and interesting about it, whether that's a gameplay style switch-up, a new puzzle mechanic, or a boss fight that asks you to demonstrate some of the tools you've been amassing over the past few levels.</p>

<p>Blessedly for our bloated modern age,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>doesn't outstay its welcome, either. As soon as it runs out of ideas (and some may say sooner than that), it makes its exit, so you won't have time to grow restless or bored while you're experiencing this Suda51 trip.</p>

<p>The core combat feels great in&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned</em>, too. Each weapon has a pleasing kick to it, and the upgrades you receive over the course of Garcia's journey feel meaningful, making slaughtering demons a consistent delight throughout.</p>


<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-big-boner.jpg?itok=tCC4ia3R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-big-boner.jpg?itok=ZwxPUWSA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is very much still the same&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>it was back in 2011.</figcaption></figure><p>If you feel like I've only talked about the original&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>so far in this&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>review, there's a very good reason for that.</p>

<p>NetEase and Grasshopper Manufacture haven't exactly gone above and beyond to show&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>how much they love it. This is very much a barebones remaster; it's a resolution increase, a few extra costumes, and a slightly half-hearted New Game Plus mode, and that's it.</p>

<p>You won't find a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-release-date-and-gameplay-info-revealed"><em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em></a>-esque visual overhaul here, nor will you see the kind of attention to detail that Aspyr has shown its&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tomb-raider-1-3-remastered"><em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>remasters</a>.</p>

<p>In essence,&nbsp;<em>Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>is a "hella" lot like playing the original&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned</em>, and the visual upgrade isn't particularly great at hiding some of the original's ugly Xbox 360-style sharp edges, curves, and low-quality texture work.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong. I'm not a graphics fiend; I honestly don't care how good something looks as long as it plays well, and so I'm willing to give&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>a pass on this front.</p>

<p>Just be aware that if you passed on the original when it launched back in 2011 and you're hoping that this remaster will somehow transform the core experience for you, that's very much not the goal here.</p>

<p>That also means that some of the original&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned</em>'s more questionable moments make it in unchanged, too. If the original put you off with its casual objectification and borderline xenophobic stereotypes, you might want to apply elsewhere.</p>

<p>On the plus side, the fact that&nbsp;<em>Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>is effectively still a seventh-gen game means it works great on Steam Deck (at least in my testing, anyway), so it's not all awkward moments and leftover jank.</p>

<h2>All of&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned</em>'s Jank Is Still in <i>Hella Remastered</i></h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-sidescroller.jpg?itok=6Ni9FWYH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-sidescroller.jpg?itok=M9RotXkv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sometimes,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>is flat-out weird, and not in the ways it wants to be.</figcaption></figure><p>Yes, that's right: for all its superstar names,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>often felt like a fairly uneven and janky game, and&nbsp;hey,&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>still feels like a fairly uneven and janky game.</p>

<p>On the whole, the difficulty here is pretty low. I died once or twice during some of the hairier moments, but I managed to breeze through most of the game on normal difficulty without trouble. You might say that's my fault for not bumping it up to hard, but normal does not provide a particularly balanced challenge.</p>

<p><em>Shadows of the Damned</em>'s inconsistent enemy design makes up for some of that lack of challenge, although not quite in the way that I would like.</p>

<p>Some enemies (I'm looking at you, psycho-Paula) can kill Garcia in a single hit, and others feel infuriatingly annoying to pin down and deal damage to, making some engagements frustratingly drawn out with the promise of disproportionate punishment for failure.</p>

<p>It's also worth mentioning that&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>felt unfinished in places (the side-scrolling shooter stages and abrupt ending spring to mind) and that hasn't changed in this remaster.</p>

<p>Happily, there were times when the original&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned</em>'s jank worked in its favor, and that's the case here, too. Although&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>feels a touch creaky, that's often the price you pay for the level of variation you'll find here.</p>

<p>This is also still a charmingly, gleefully stupid experience. Any game in which the main character can fire a giant-barreled gun from between his legs while screaming "taste my big boner" legally cannot be bad. It's in the Constitution, I think.</p>

<h2><em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-sewer.jpg?itok=SYqIaAPG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadows-of-the-damned-hella-remastered-review-sewer.jpg?itok=zW2Vqm9F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It isn't really more than the sum of its parts, but&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>is a good time anyway.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Shadows of the Damned&nbsp;</em>is a fascinating relic of the seventh console generation. Despite Suda51's presence as a writer and Akira Yamaoka's score, this feels like a Shinji Mikami production through and through (although he didn't serve as a director on the project).</p>

<p>If you can imagine a jankier, grungier&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</em>- perhaps one birthed from the B-movie-loving brain of Robert Rodriguez - then you're not a million miles away from what&nbsp;<em>Shadows of the Damned: Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>can offer you.</p>

<p>You won't find a dramatic overhaul here, but&nbsp;<em>Hella Remastered&nbsp;</em>offers just enough nostalgic thrills to overcome its almost lovably abundant jank.</p>
