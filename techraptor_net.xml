</figure>
<h2>Fly Like a Blood Eagle</h2><p>One of the major selling points of <em>Cloudheim</em> is its fast-paced, high-flying combat. You begin the game with a triple jump by default; that alone should give you an idea of the tone being set here.</p><p>Combat mainly involves fighting a dozen small enemies and a couple of larger (usually armored) enemies and scoring dozens or hundreds of hits in a single battle. You have a few abilities that you can use situationally, and damage can be avoided by dodging on the ground or in the air.</p><p>That's not to say that you can bounce around the battlefield forever. Every ability — including your dodge — has a certain number of charges. Use up those charges, and casting that ability again will cause "mana burn" to build up.</p><p>If you fill up the mana burn meter, you both slow down and lose the ability to cast any of your abilities. In principle, the idea is to use combos and abilities carefully to take down enemies without building up too much mana burn.</p><p>Unfortunately, the current state of combat feels a little bland. I successfully button-mashed my way through 50 or so hours of gameplay with few problems; as long as I dodged the more serious enemy attacks, I was fine. Another layer of complexity is needed here for the combat system to truly feel engaging.</p><figure role="group">

<h2>Restoring After Ragnarok</h2><p>Exploring <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/cloudheim-map-guide-treasure-chest-locations" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4c2bed03-8d60-44b9-824d-17c8852eb58e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">the world</a> and its dungeons (along with the quests you encounter along the way) is the meat of <em>Cloudheim's</em> gameplay, but it's not the only part — there is also an element of base building, town management, and shop management.</p><p>Your main base of operations is a flying turtle called Odin's Shell. The back of this turtle serves as a safe haven where you can build crafting devices, specialized structures, and decorations.</p><blockquote><p>The shop you run on Odin's Shell is critical for progressing the building system and unlocking more support structures.</p></blockquote><p>You're not alone on this island, either. Adorable little creatures called "Blins" inhabit this place with you, and they can be assigned to certain <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/cloudheim-building-guide-how-to-get-blins" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="de5d4611-4621-4a93-b9c8-33c18678a2e4" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">buildings</a> to work for you. You could, for example, assign a Blin to a prospecting site. When you next return to Odin's Shell, you'll find that it is filled with crafting materials for you to mine.</p><p>Perhaps the strangest inclusion of all is a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/cloudheim-shop-guide-how-to-sell-items" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="314316d3-dc01-4826-a864-237ed4ac24e4" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">shop</a>. Though it only occupies a small part of the game's description, the shop you run on Odin's Shell is critical for progressing the building system and unlocking more support structures.</p><p>Alternating between exploring the world, advancing quests, and selling items in your shop forms the core gameplay loop of <em>Cloudheim</em>. It can be fairly engaging and entertaining (combat shallowness aside) — at least when it comes to the systems that are actually implemented.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<h2>Missing Mechanics</h2><p>A casual scroll through the building options or the in-game archive makes it seem like <em>Cloudheim</em> has a lot to offer. My actual experience with the pre-launch version of the game, however, painted a somewhat different picture.</p><p>Important systems like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/cloudheim-forge-guide-purify-and-smelt-ore" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="496c455c-6646-4c23-ac60-1f9c6601e4e2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">smelting and forging weapons</a> are implemented, and they work well enough. In the early game, it doesn't really feel like anything is missing. This changes as you advance deeper into the game and the building system.</p><p>Take Alchemy, for example. You can find and grow plants that can then be converted into potions. However, the potions you get are entirely random, and they have no gameplay effect whatsoever; currently, potions are only used as stock for the shop.</p><p>This also applies to cooking. Menus allude to cooked food, and you can find bits of food (such as cheese wheels) as random loot, but you can't actually do anything with food other than sell it.</p><p>The lack of practical cooking and alchemy applications also renders the fishing system somewhat useless. I'm sure the alchemy, cooking, and fishing systems will get fleshed out some more in future updates. For now, there isn't much there.</p><p>I also encountered one major chunk of missing content at the end of the second island. Although the map implies that you can visit four major regions, the final dungeon at the end of the second island simply doesn't open. Progression tends to drag toward this point, making it much more difficult to move on to the third and fourth islands.</p><figure role="group">

<h2><em>Cloudheim</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2><p>Like many games of this style, <em>Cloudheim</em> has a lot of potential. The first island of content is solid, and the second island has a good chunk of content on it. You can probably expect a solid 20 or so hours of gameplay from what's there.</p><p>That said, there are still plenty of rough edges that need to be ironed out. If you're fine with trying a game that is very Early Access in a lot of ways right now, you should consider checking out <em>Cloudheim</em> and enjoying a somewhat different take on the whole Viking thing.</p><hr><p><em>Cloudheim</em> was previewed over approximately 50 hours of gameplay on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2070270/Cloudheim/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> with a key provided by the publisher.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>'Tis the season to be all warm and cozy, and what better way to celebrate the Festive season than creating your holiday retreat in <em>Log Away</em>. From developer The-Mark Entertainment, this indie cozy sandbox‑building game will transport players to the most tranquil and gorgeous locations, where the main objective is to design and build their dream getaway home.</p><p>As such, they will have plenty of tools and customization options at their disposal to make their perfect getaway retreat worthy of gracing the pages of Architectural Digest and House &amp; Garden. So, to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/petit-planet-preview-hoyoverses-foray-into-life-sims" rel="nofollow">budding cozy gamers</a>, maybe wondering if Log Away is the ultimate destination sandbox building game to hit the shelves, or maybe the best holiday destination is right at home?</p><h2>Bags Packed And Ready To Go</h2><p><em>Log Away</em> is the indie cozy sandbox‑building game developer The-Mark Entertainment, where the main goal is to design, build, and decorate their dream cabin retreats. Set against the backdrop of some of the most awe-inspiring, picturesque locations that can be described as locations that would be found on National Geographic, no two cabin homes will be the same, as players have access to unique construction tools and customization options to decorate their exterior and interior spaces to their hearts' content.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As one who thoroughly enjoys cozy games with robust building components in their gameplay, one was pleasantly surprised by how much content players will have access to in helping them create some gorgeously designed spaces. Whether it's a warm and cozy retreat perfect for finishing that novel along the snow-capped mountains, a mostly soundproof home to record that next radio smash hit, or a beach house to welcome family and friends for the holidays, there's plenty of design and decorating elements for players to explore and have fun with.</p><p>Sure, not everything featured in <em>Log Away</em> is perfect, and there are a few missed windows of opportunity that could've been capitalized on, aside from some technical issues experienced; this indie cozy sandbox‑building game makes for the ideal game to escape the toils and troubles of the world. And to celebrate the game's release, players can adorn their home in time for Christmas with themed seasonal items as part of a free DLC available until December 11th, 2025.</p><h2>Synergized Hearts And Spaces</h2><p>Jumping into <em>Log Away</em> comes with some hand-holding before players can truly let their creativity run freely, as a tutorial will guide players in learning gameplay and control basics. Additionally, they'll have access to plenty of building and decorating components and items to lay the foundations of the dream vacation home, from minimalist, rustic pieces to modern chic and beach-themed items, and, of course, seasonal Christmas items available through the themed DLC.</p><p>While the primary goal is to design and build their home away from home, they also have a Coziness System, which is fronted by the Cozy Heart. This unique mechanic, akin to a "thermometer" is an in-game meter that gradually gets filled up based on how cozy your living spaces are, or as the developer states, "a reflection of coziness" and this can be achieved by the number of items placed on the plot, where they're placed and more importantly, if these placed items match similar items to develop a synergy (think a table and chairs).</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Carefully place similar furnishing and decor items together in a space to gain synergy and increase the home's coziness. (Picture: The-Mark Entertainment / Ashleigh Klein)</em></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One will admit they didn't pay much attention to these synergies at first, as they were stumped when they realized the Cozy Heart meter wasn't gradually building up as one wanted; it was after rereading the tutorial that one realized that placing similar items together increased one's coziness meter. Additionally, it could be said that items from the same destination, pick, or interest may help increase a home's coziness; however, this was challenging to track and confirm.</p><p>Regardless, by default, we were placing similar objects together, for example: items attributed to the Writing interest or from a seaside/beach landscape can help increase the coziness if placed together in the same area. This may help and guide players into designing and decorating their indoor and outdoor spaces more thematically, and once maxxed out, they'll earn mementos called Keepsakes, each of which has an associated backstory and memory, and can be placed within their spaces to showcase them proudly.</p><p>These Keepsakes are specific to the interests players selected for their retreat, as there are 24 Keepsakes per interest to discover and obtain, but they cannot be acquired in a single retreat, so multiple retreat builds are likely needed for all Keepsakes to be unlocked. Nevertheless, players will be able to enjoy what Log Away has to offer without time constraints or pressure from them, and instead can be best enjoyed in their own time.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>To make the most of their in-game cozy experiences while designing and building their dream retreat, there are a few additional features to enjoy, including a photo mode with unique filters and options to capture their beautiful homes (which can make for great postcards). The game also features soundtracks to serve as the main playlist while building their homes, as players can change up the soundtrack, but also toggle day and night time, and seasons to find the perfect weather conditions to warm up to in their beautifully decorated homes.</p><h2>Not Quite A Warm Welcome</h2><p>As mentioned before, not everything included or offered in <em>Log Away</em> is picture-perfect, and we had our fair share of issues we've encountered during the review process. Gameplay-wise, the biggest gripe during the review process is the lack of real estate when building our holiday cabin, as players will only have a 7x7 plot to work with.</p><p>As someone who's spent hours in <em>Tiny Glade</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/palia-starter-guide" rel="nofollow"><em>Palia</em></a>, both games which provide massive plot for players to build and decorate their homes, this small-sized plot is quite restrictive and at times, quite challenging to work with, especially towards maxxing out the Cozy Heart meter. Switching gears to game optimization and performance, when loading a saved game file or starting a new retreat, the graphics appeared distorted or grainy/grain-like, which, coupled with slow loading times, was a slight annoyance to be confronted with.</p><p>While the game controls are simple and easy to understand, toggling between building, furnishing, and decorating (or BFD stamps) can be clunky at times; the camera movement is what quickly became a slight nuisance. Whether it was to zoom in to place an object carefully or remove flowers or pathing, or zoom out to get the full view of our progress on the project, the camera movement and speed are extremely clunky and laggy, which makes using Photo Mode quite frustrating.</p><h2><em>Log Away</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2><figure role="group">

<p><em>Log Away</em> provided the ideal form of escapism, transporting players to tranquil destinations where they could build and decorate their dream vacation home. With plenty of building tools, furnishings, and decor items available for players to access on top of the thematical items and the Christmas DLC, players will be well occupied in designing, building, and decorating their spaces.</p><p>The game's coziness system is at the very heart of creating the ideal ambiance for their perfect getaway home by maximizing what space they have with the pieces they've selected to increase the coziness and, by doing so, unlocking Keepsakes. However, there are a few issues with optimization and performance due to buggy camera movement that hampered our experience in building, furnishing, or decorating mode.</p><p>This can also be transferred onto the Photo Mode, which made taking snaps of our completed projects or projects in progress a challenging process, as zooming and panning over the property gets laggy. Alongside these issues, the decision to lock players to a 7x7 building space on a massive plot is an interesting choice, as one hopes the plot size increases to give us more room to create more beautiful spaces and unlock more treasured memories to own as Keepsakes.</p><p>After all, we'll still be here for the cozy vibes and the profound memories from those treasured Keepsakes.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Log Away&nbsp;</strong>was reviewed on PC via Steam, with a copy provided by the publisher over the course of 20 hours&nbsp;- all screenshots were taken during the review.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

<p>Thunderful Publishing will no doubt be hoping that <em>Replaced </em>is a hit; recently, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/coatsink-layoffs-half-workforce" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dcff6b51-8929-4c5a-be4c-7c30472c88e2" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">laid off half of the workforce</a> at subsidiary Coatsink, and it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-development" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bf6695fa-ab97-46be-9d58-8cb656c8713e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">hasn't exactly had</a> the most <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-closes-studio-financials" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fd190875-f6e6-478f-9ed2-35e6192ff578" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">secure eighteen months or so</a> either.</p><p>In any case, <em>Replaced </em>will arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663850/REPLACED/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/replaced/9mz1c8d26b7h" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a> on March 12th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Spry Fox, the studio behind cozy games like <em>Cozy Grove </em>(the clue's in the name, I suppose) and <em>Spirit Crossing</em>, has been sold back to its original owners by now-former parent company Netflix.</p><p>According to a report by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/netflix-sells-game-studio-spry-fox" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Game File</a>, the sale of Spry Fox is part of an ongoing effort on Netflix's part to reconfigure and reassess its gaming division, an operation that has already seen <em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/boss-fight-entertainment-netflix-shutdown" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9711bede-314c-4ee1-8135-fe8d85504170" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Boss Fight Entertainment closed down</a>, along with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-team-blue-shut-down-report" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c5effee2-78cf-4130-87e2-24dccd22c939" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">star-studded internal studio full of industry veterans</a>.</p><p>Unlike Boss Fight and the mooted Team Blue, however, Spry Fox hasn't been closed; rather, it's been sold back to Daniel Cook and David Edery, and will remain operational as an independent studio, according to Game File's report.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Edery told Game File that his studio is "grateful" for its time under the auspices of Netflix, which will still publish <em>Spirit Crossing </em>on mobile. The studio will, however, be free to ask other publishers to take the game on for other platforms, which Edery says is "truly the best thing" for the project.</p><p>Netflix isn't the only streaming giant to be taking a long, hard look at its role in the gaming industry. Back in October, Amazon <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-luna-rework-later-this-year" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a4199f9c-3f78-478b-b2f3-b566d7133e1b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">announced a major overhaul</a> to its Luna streaming service, which involved a refocusing on party games and smartphone-based play.</p><p>The retail giant also revealed that it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-development-ending-amazon-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="96fc63cd-c591-42ec-8af0-59f8445fa07b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">end development on MMORPG <em>New World</em></a>, with several staffers in Amazon's gaming division also losing their jobs as a result of that decision.</p>
<p>Spry Fox's split from Netflix doesn't seem to have affected the studio's plans in the near term; <em>Spirit Crossing </em>is still in development, and <em>Cozy Grove </em>remains available <a href="https://cozygrovegame.com/" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">across PC and consoles</a>, with versions of <em>Spirit Crossing </em>for those platforms also seemingly in the works. Stay tuned for more on this.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
