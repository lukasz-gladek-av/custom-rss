            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Keen Software House (not to be confused with&nbsp;<em>Enshrouded&nbsp;</em>developer Keen Games) has revealed&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2</em>, a sequel to the popular space sandbox building sim&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers</em>.</p>

<p>The game was revealed in a rather nondescript-sounding video simply titled "Concordia Research Facility for Modular Engineering", which, if you're a&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers&nbsp;</em>fan, is exactly the kind of thing you'd expect a sequel announcement to appear in.</p>

<p>Said teaser shows off a number of features you can expect from&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2</em>, including new creative tools, the ability to partially copy certain elements of a construction, and "instant undoing of mistakes", as well as the ability to redo anything you've accidentally undone.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-engineers-2-announcement-window.jpg?itok=dm1w2ngN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-engineers-2-announcement-window.jpg?itok=4x7qCSE8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>promises all-new tools to play with.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the complexity of these new tools, the voiceover in the new trailer reassures players that said tools have been made "intuitive enough for anyone to grasp", even though they're "sophisticated enough to build wonders".</p>

<p>The trailer concludes by bidding players to "prepare for an experience unlike anything before", so if you're a&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers&nbsp;</em>fan, it sounds like this is exactly the kind of sequel you'd want for the first game.</p>

<p>A livestream will be held on December 19th at 6pm UTC (that's around 1pm Eastern) with more&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>info, including an extended gameplay showcase and a reveal for the game's Early Access release date as well.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with the original&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers</em>, its developers describe it as a "sandbox game about engineering, construction, exploration, and survival in space and on planets".</p>

<p>Released in February 2019 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-release-date-set-for-february-with-major-overhaul-to-survival" rel="nofollow">after five years of Early Access development</a>, the game allows you to build ships, space stations, outposts, and various other structures, using what you've built to carve out a life for yourself in the harsh wilderness of space.</p>

<p><em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but we'll learn when you'll get to play it on December 19th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/talos-principle-reawakened-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-talos-principle-reawakened-coming-next-year-and-its-more-than-a-remaster.1056792/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/talos-principle-reawakened-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Devolver Digital and developer Croteam have announced&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened</em>, a reworked version of the philosophical 2014 puzzler that the two studios promise is "more than a remaster".</p>

<p>Described as the "definitive edition" of the game,&nbsp;<em>Reawakened&nbsp;</em>includes the full original experience, as well as the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/expansion-announced-talos-principle" rel="nofollow"><em>Road to Gehenna&nbsp;</em>expansion</a> and a brand new chapter titled&nbsp;<em>In the Beginning</em>. This new chapter "explores the origins of the Simulation and the challenges of its first test".</p>

<p><em>The Talos Principle&nbsp;</em>has also been rebuilt with Unreal Engine 5 in the new version of the game, resulting in what Devolver and Croteam call a "more immersive and detailed" world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-talos-principle-reawakened-puzzle.jpg?itok=TzrhZyrG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-talos-principle-reawakened-puzzle.jpg?itok=YzkwsE7q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The original&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle&nbsp;</em>is getting a fancy remaster next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with the visual overhaul,&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle: Reawakened&nbsp;</em>is also promising "modernized quality-of-life updates that maintain the vision of the original classic", although Devolver and Croteam don't go into detail regarding exactly what those updates are.</p>

<p>Rather excitingly, if you're playing on PC, you can also look forward to a new level editor that lets you craft your very own&nbsp;<em>Talos Principle&nbsp;</em>challenges. I'd imagine there will be puzzles several degrees more fiendish than the original game's offerings online in hours after this one launches.</p>

<p>This new version of the game is set to debut sometime early next year for PC and current-gen consoles, so it looks like you're out of luck if you were hoping to check it out on your PS4 or your Xbox One, sadly. Still, there's always the original!</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with the original&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle</em>, it's a first-person puzzler with a heavy emphasis on philosophical theming and narrative.</p>

<p>The game sees you tasked with solving puzzles by a mysterious "creator" figure, all while contemplating what your purpose might be in a beautiful but strangely empty world.</p>

<p>You can check out the original&nbsp;<em>The Talos Principle&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/257510/The_Talos_Principle/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/the-talos-principle/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-talos-principle/C1TJ5KT8LT9J" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-talos-principle-deluxe-edition-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. There's no word yet on whether owners of the original will get any kind of discount on the new version, which is due to land on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2025.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Path of Exile 2 Devs Address User Feedback and Promise Big Changes]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/path-of-exile-2-devs-address-user-feedback-and-promise-big-changes.1056789/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-devs-feedback-early-access<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>developer Grinding Gear Games has outlined some of the changes coming to the game in the near future as a result of Early Access player feedback.</p>

<p>The action RPG was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-release-delayed" rel="nofollow">released last week</a>&nbsp;and despite Grinding Gear's fears that the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-early-access-server-issues-warning" rel="nofollow">servers may not hold up</a>, it's garnered a Very Positive rating in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2694490/Path_of_Exile_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam review stakes</a>, with over 32,000 players weighing in with their opinions.</p>

<p>Of course, though the majority of those reviews express positive sentiments, many players are noting areas in which they think&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>could improve, and it's those areas that Grinding Gear Games is addressing in <a href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3611705" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a new blog post</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/path-of-exile-2-early-access-xyclucian.jpg?itok=_Np3dB-u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/path-of-exile-2-early-access-xyclucian.jpg?itok=74ju7gR7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>has met with a positive reception, but players are identifying some areas of improvement as well.</figcaption></figure><p>In the post, Grinding Gear says that there are a number of features raised by user feedback that the studio feels need to be "urgently addressed".</p>

<p>First up, dodge rolling is being changed so that players are "trapped less often", although Grinding Gear notes that it does want players to run the risk of becoming trapped by enemies if they don't use their dodge rolls smartly.</p>

<p>Other changes include the checkpoint system, which is being expanded to reduce the "tedious" nature of retreading maps to return to objectives, as well as changes to items to make&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>more "rewarding".</p>

<p>Various other areas of improvement are in Grinding Gear's crosshairs too, including currency, map mods, and endgame maps. If you don't spot your issue here, Grinding Gear assures players that there are "lots more things coming" as well.</p>




<p><em>Path of Exile 2&nbsp;</em>is, as you can probably guess, the sequel to 2013's free-to-play action RPG&nbsp;<em>Path of Exile</em>. It adds various new gameplay features and mechanics, as well as new weapons, visual improvements, and more.</p>
