            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/jade-raymond-leaves-haven-studios<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Industry veteran Jade Raymond has departed Haven Studios, the studio she co-founded back in 2021. The studio is ostensibly currently hard at work on live-service heist shooter&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$</em>.</p>

<p>According to a (paywalled) Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-15/playstation-executive-jade-raymond-leaves-studio-she-founded" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">article</a>, Sony didn't give a reason for Raymond's departure to Haven staffers, but Bloomberg, citing "people with knowledge of the matter", says her departure comes after an external test of&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$&nbsp;</em>about which Haven developers were "concerned".</p>

<p>Specifically, Haven's workers are said to have been worried about&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$</em>' development progress, as well as its reception during the external test. It sounds like another one of Sony's live-service gambles might be in trouble.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fairgame-heist-jade-raymond.jpg?itok=FAVNdBo- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fairgame-heist-jade-raymond.jpg?itok=0EfyB301 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Jade Raymond has departed&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$&nbsp;</em>developer Haven.</figcaption></figure><p>In a statement given to Bloomberg, Sony describes Raymond as "an incredible partner and visionary force" for Haven. The studio says it wishes Raymond "all the best in her next chapter", and that it is "committed" to supporting Haven and its new co-leads Marie-Eve Danis and Pierre-Francois Sapinski.</p>

<p>No update is provided on the progress of&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$</em>, which was initially <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-showcase-here-are-all-trailers-announcements" rel="nofollow">revealed all the way back in 2023</a>. That means it's been almost two years since Haven or PlayStation provided any kind of information about the project.</p>

<p>According to Bloomberg,&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$&nbsp;</em>was originally slated to launch in fall 2025, but the publication's sources say that the game has been delayed to spring next year. No official release window has been revealed by Sony yet.</p>

<p>If&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$&nbsp;</em>has indeed been delayed, it'll be another setback for Sony's live-service slate, which has so far arguably failed to produce a compelling result beyond <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-financials-helldivers-2-sales" rel="nofollow">last year's&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em></a>, although it has managed to produce one catastrophic failure <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">in the form of hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord</em></a>.</p>




<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$</em>, Sony's upcoming live-service slate includes Bungie's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marathon-release-date-gameplay-revealed" rel="nofollow">extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em></a>&nbsp;and an as-yet-untitled <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/teamlfg-playstation-studios-ex-bungie" rel="nofollow">project from teamLFG</a>, a studio made up of ex-Bungie staffers.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen whether these two projects - or, indeed,&nbsp;<em>Fairgame$</em>&nbsp;- can provide the live-service hit Sony so badly wants. In the meantime, though, the studio will just have to fall back on its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-sales-pass-548-milion-units-marvels-spider-man-2-has-sold-10-million-copies" rel="nofollow">slate</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-forbidden-west-sales" rel="nofollow">ludicrously successful</a> single-player <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-sold-11-million-copies" rel="nofollow">titles</a>. There are worse fates.</p>

      <div><p>Nintendo has released a list of the original Switch games that will be getting free Switch 2 upgrades when the console launches next month.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 is due to arrive on June 5th, and a range of games for the original Switch will be getting boosts to visuals and performance on the day of the new machine's release, free of charge.</p>

<p>These upgrades are separate from the Switch 2 Edition range, which will give a number of original Switch games more drastic visual and performance makeovers and which will cost extra on top of the original titles. A number of Switch 2 Edition games will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-launch-lineup" rel="nofollow">also be available at launch</a>, though.</p>

<ul><li><i>ARMS</i>: optimized handheld and docked visuals, optimized&nbsp;framerate, HDR support</li>
	<li><em>Big Brain Academy: Brain vs. Brain</em>: GameShare support for up to four people in Party Mode, plus GameChat support</li>
	<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/captain-toad-treasure-tracker" rel="nofollow"><em>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</em></a>: optimized handheld and docked visuals, HDR support, GameShare support for two players</li>
	<li><em>Clubhouse Games: 51 Worldwide Classics</em>: GameShare support for up to four players, local and online GameChat sharing</li>
	<li><em>Game Builder Garage</em>: optimized handheld and docked visuals, Joy-Con 2 mouse controls</li>
	<li><em>New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe</em>: optimized handheld and docked visuals</li>
	<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet</em></a>: optimized handheld and docked visuals, optimized framerate</li>
	<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury" rel="nofollow"><em>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</em></a>: optimized handheld and docked visuals, optimized frame rate, HDR support, GameChat and GameShare support</li>
	<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/super-mario-odyssey" rel="nofollow"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a>: optimized handheld and docked visuals, HDR support, GameShare and GameChat support</li>
	<li><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>: optimized handheld and docked visuals, HDR support</li>
	<li><em>The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</em>: optimized handheld and docked visuals, HDR support</li>
</ul><p>It's not clear whether games like&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>or the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games will be getting full 60fps support or simply stabilized framerates, but given that the two&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>games run at what appears to be an uncapped framerate anyway, I'd expect smoother performance in both.</p>
