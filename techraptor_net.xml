            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Splatoon 3 </em>is getting a major update later this week, and if you thought Update 11.0.0 would just be bringing insubstantial quality-of-life improvements, think again, because some pretty major gameplay changes are coming.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/News/2026/January/What-s-new-in-the-Splatoon-3-Version-11-0-0-update-3011546.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">news post</a> on the official Nintendo website, the company reveals that <em>Splatoon 3 </em>Update 11.0.0, which is set to arrive on January 29th (that's this Thursday at time of writing), will introduce "new mechanics and other changes to freshen things up in the Splatlands".</p><p>First up, the update will add a new system called Flow Aura, which is essentially a killstreak system. Racking up splats in quick succession will put you in the Flow Aura state, which will increase your speed and defense, and you can keep this state going by scoring more splats or assists.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Splatoon 3</em>'s new update has some fresh mechanics for you to check out.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To help you work out how close you might be to a KO in <em>Splatoon 3</em>, the new update will also make enemy health bars visible, although the bar will only show when an enemy has just been hit. You won't be able to see it if they're in cover or if they've jumped into their ink (short of certain specials).</p><p><em>Splatoon 3</em>'s hitboxes are also being adjusted to compensate for players' increased expertise with motion controls; landing a shot on an opponent in swim form will be harder, but attacks are easier to land on enemies in kid form with certain weapons.</p><p>If you'd like to see exactly what's changing, you can check out the full patch notes for <em>Splatoon 3 </em>Update 11.0.0 <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Game-Updates/How-to-Update-Splatoon-3-2266003.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">right here</a>. The list has some fairly straightforward quality-of-life tweaks alongside the flashier stuff.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-siege-breakers-warbond</link>
            <guid>1417426</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Arrowhead have announced Siege Breakers, the latest Warbond for <em>Helldivers 2</em>, and this one's all about big, loud explosions, which are, as I'm sure we can all agree, the ideal way to spread democracy throughout the galaxy.</p><p>In many ways, Siege Breakers provides the perfect counterpoint to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-redacted-regiment-warbond" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="460a9d06-01c8-4dde-8dcd-17b098a9a0f5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Redacted Regiment</a>, the Warbond from a couple of weeks ago, because that one focused on stealth and this one...absolutely does not.</p><p>The first major addition to <em>Helldivers 2 </em>in Siege Breakers is the LAS-16 Trident, an updated version of the beloved weapon from the original arsenal. This one fires six beams instead of three, and when it comes to annihilating enemies, that's definitely a marked improvement.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Siege Breakers brings new weapons like this laser-focused bad boy.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you prefer to get up close and personal (well, even more up close and personal), then the new CQC-20 Breaching Hammer stratagem will allow you to do just that. It's a massive sledgehammer that can optionally also explode. I say "optionally", but that sounds pretty mandatory to me.</p><p>Joining the new hammer is the GL-28 Belt-Fed Grenade Launcher, which, as the name suggests, is an explosive weapon that lets you continuously fire grenades. It should be perfect for those pesky Terminid hives.</p><p>Should you prefer to make one very loud noise rather than a series of slightly less loud noises, you may want to check out the EAT-411 Leveller, a single-shot missile launcher with a serious kick.</p><p>Lastly, if all of this ordnance isn't working for you and you need to protect yourself, the G/SH-39 Shield should help you do just that by providing a barrier that should stop more than a few Automaton shots.</p>
<p>All of this is, of course, coming in addition to new armors, capes, and other accouterments to help your Helldiver stand out and look snazzy on the battlefield.</p><p><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s Siege Breakers Warbond launches across all platforms on February 3rd. The game is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/helldivers-2" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/helldivers-2-review-fighting-for-managed-democracy" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5a16fadb-7c1f-45fc-a180-c4fd53fd4ea1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">read our review here</a>.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has released its Q3 financial results for this fiscal year, and when it comes to consolidated results for the nine-month period as a whole, the studio is doing pretty well, as are some of its core franchises.</p><p>In its latest <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/3rd/explanation_2025_3rd_01.pdf" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">financial presentation</a>, Capcom reveals that its sales, operating profit, and ordinary profit are all up by varying degrees when compared to March-December 2024, and the studio is on track for a better 2025-26 fiscal year as a whole, too.</p><p>When it comes to specific games, Capcom says the <em>Resident Evil </em>series, along with <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, "continued to grow" in sales terms, and that <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>managed to surpass the 11 million sales mark within the March-December period as well.</p><figure role="group">

Both games had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-village-11m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="649d13dc-948c-45a4-b39b-fbab7260a9b1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">crossed the ten million sales barrier</a> at last count.</p><p>With regards to Capcom's future, the company has a pretty packed slate. The aforementioned <em>Resident Evil Requiem </em>leads the pack, but there's also <em>Monster Hunter Stories 3 </em>and <em>Mega Man Star Force Legacy Collection </em>to look forward to in March.</p><p>In total, Capcom sold 34.64 million game units between March and December 2025, which is around four million units higher than the previous year's total.
