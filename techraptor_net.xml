            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced a price hike for PlayStation 5 hardware in the US, with all three major models of the PS5 getting price increases starting from tomorrow.</p>

<p>In a PlayStation Blog <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a>, Sony says that due to a "challenging economic environment" (which the company says that "many global businesses" are also navigating), the recommended retail price for PS5 hardware will be increasing from August 21st.</p>

<p>The base PlayStation 5 model will be going up to $549.99, the PS5 Digital Edition (which, as a reminder, doesn't come with a disc drive) will cost you $499.99, and the PS5 Pro will jump to a fairly eye-watering $749.99. Again, as a reminder, the Pro doesn't come with a disc drive either.</p>

<p>This move is in line with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-prices-raised-hardware-software" rel="nofollow">similar decision made by Microsoft</a> back in May, with the tech giant blaming "market conditions" for putting up the prices of its Xbox Series X|S consoles, as well as certain games in the holiday season.</p>

<p>However, Microsoft subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-outer-worlds-2-70-dollars-xbox" rel="nofollow">walked back its decision</a> to charge $80 for certain major releases (including&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>), although there's every chance prices will rise in future.</p>

<p>For what it's worth, Sony hasn't committed to charging $80 for its games either, with holiday releases like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-release-date" rel="nofollow">the upcoming&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-release-date" rel="nofollow">Ghost of Yōtei</a>&nbsp;</em>costing $70 as usual. Other publishers, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-no-80-pricing" rel="nofollow">like EA</a>, also won't be raising their game prices for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>It's likely said market conditions are referring to the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg7jjkvzmkxo" rel="nofollow">tariffs</a> imposed on many countries around the world by President Donald Trump, with components and manufacturing processes becoming exponentially more expensive for many hardware manufacturers as a result.</p>
