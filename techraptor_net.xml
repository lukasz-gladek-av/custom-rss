            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sales analysis firm Circana has released its US gaming industry sales data for June, and it looks like FromSoftware and Bandai Namco can continue their celebrations from last month.</p>

<p>In May, multiplayer spinoff experiment&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/may-gaming-sales-data-elden-ring-nightreign" rel="nofollow">topped the charts</a>, and despite the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">release of the Nintendo Switch 2 in June</a>, it hit the number one spot on the all-format chart for last month as well, according to the ever-reliable <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37lnhg22k" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Mat Piscatella</a>.</p>

<p>The Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">flagship launch title&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">Mario Kart World</a>&nbsp;</em>didn't manage to scrape second place, either; that honor went to&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, a particularly impressive achievement given that Hideo Kojima's latest is only available on PS5.&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>did come in third, though.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/death-stranding-2-us-gaming-sales-data-june.jpg?itok=fl97ed_3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/death-stranding-2-us-gaming-sales-data-june.jpg?itok=o153mxfh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;</em>outsold&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>in June.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to the year-to-date best-selling chart, no game has yet to unseat&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which, despite <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recent negative feedback</a> from players, has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">proven a runaway success</a> for developer and publisher Capcom.</p>

<p>Second place still goes to <i>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</i>, and&nbsp;Ubisoft's&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>brings up third, which may come as something of a balm to the studio following its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-creative-houses-q1-financials" rel="nofollow">disappointing Q1 financial results</a>.</p>

<p>In hardware terms, June 2025 set a new record for hardware spending by Circana's reckoning, beating out previous record-holder 2008. Spending hit $978m in June, bolstered by the release of the Switch 2.</p>

<p>The console managed to sell 1.6 million units in June in the US, breaking records for launch month unit sales and shattering the previous record set by Sony's PlayStation 4, which hit 1.1 million units in November 2013.</p>

Standalone digital sales weren't counted as part of Circana's data.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite iOS Return in UK "Uncertain" Thanks to CMA Decisions, Epic Says]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-uk-cma</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-ios-return-in-uk-uncertain-thanks-to-cma-decisions-epic-says.1250982/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic Games has revealed that it doesn't know whether&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>will be returning to the iOS platform in the UK, following the release of two CMA (Competition &amp; Markets Authority) roadmaps regarding Google and Apple's mobile platforms.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/site/en-US/news/the-cma-s-roadmap-doesn-t-open-the-mobile-app-ecosystem-to-competition-in-the-uk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website, Epic says that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s "return to iOS in the UK is now uncertain" thanks to the CMA's decisions, and that it "can't bring the Epic Games Store to iOS in the UK this year (if ever)".</p>

<p>For context, the CMA laid out roadmaps for market status investigations into&nbsp;<a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/687f8ab528f29c99778a7455/Roadmap__Google_.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Google</a> and <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/687f893cf2ecaeb756d0e1e6/Roadmap__Apple_.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Apple</a> respectively today, and in both cases, requiring the two companies to allow developers to point users to other app stores and payment methods falls under measures the authority "will consider from the first half of 2026".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-uk-ios-uncertain-superman.jpg?itok=y8MSz1g- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-uk-ios-uncertain-superman.jpg?itok=znU19HRh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite</em>'s UK iOS return is now "uncertain", according to Epic.</figcaption></figure><p>Epic calls this a "missed opportunity to introduce competition into a currently-monopolized market". It's a decision that's contradictory to one <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-apple-500-million-euro-fine" rel="nofollow">recently made by the European Commission</a>, which saw Apple slapped with a&nbsp;€500 million fine and forced to&nbsp;"inform customers, free of charge, of alternative offers outside the App Store".</p>

<p>According to Epic, Apple and Google must be "completely blocked from imposing fees and discriminating against apps using out-of-app payment" if "years of malicious compliance...and no genuine restoration of market competition" are to be avoided.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that if you've been hoping to play&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>on your iPhone or iPad in the UK, then it looks like you're going to have a long while to wait; the earliest you can likely expect to play the game on your device is 2026, but it could take even longer than that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-uk-ios-future-uncertain-squid-game.jpg?itok=-iSH76Ef 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-uk-ios-future-uncertain-squid-game.jpg?itok=LorB1MCg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Epic has some strong words for the UK's CMA today.</figcaption></figure><p>For years now, Epic has been embroiled in legal battles with both Apple and Google over allowing alternate payment systems and storefronts on the two companies' Android and iOS operating systems.</p>

<p>The fight began back in 2020, when Epic <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-slashes-up-to-20-off-purchases-on-all-platforms" rel="nofollow">launched a sale</a>&nbsp;that promised discounts if players used the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>studio's proprietary payment system.&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>was removed from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/epic-sues-google-over-fortnites-removal-from-play-store" rel="nofollow">Android</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-apple-store-version-removed-for-violating-app-store-guidelines" rel="nofollow">iOS</a> as a result, and Epic sued both companies, kicking off the ongoing legal struggle.</p>

<p>Of course, if you're not in the UK, your iOS&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>prospects might be a bit rosier; in May, the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-ios-app-store-returns" rel="nofollow">restored to the US App Store</a>, and of course, <em>Fortnite</em> is also available on Android via the Epic Games Store. If you're in the UK, though, you'll just have to wait for more on this.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Gran Turismo 7 Update Brings Ridiculously Rare Car and More]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-161</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gran-turismo-7-update-brings-ridiculously-rare-car-and-more.1250979/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Polyphony Digital have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>update, and this one's giving you the chance to drive a ridiculously rare car, plus two other gorgeous vehicles.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://www.gran-turismo.com/gb/news/00_5317833.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo&nbsp;</em>website, update 1.61 will either land today or tomorrow depending on where you are. It's set to arrive tonight at 10pm Pacific, so that's 1am Eastern or 6am GMT tomorrow.</p>

<p>Just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-157" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-156" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, the game's latest patch will be bringing three cars for you to drive, but there's a special addition in update 1.61 in the form of the '05 NISMO R34 GT-R Z-tune. If you're a rare car aficionado, you'll probably know what that means.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gran-turismo-update-1.61-z-tune.jpg?itok=SjBHE0wW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gran-turismo-update-1.61-z-tune.jpg?itok=BdAsE9FZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Gran Turismo 7</em>'s latest update adds a legendary car.</figcaption></figure><p>The story behind this one is pretty special. You can see a full breakdown in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/23/gran-turismo-7-update-1-61-available-today/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this PlayStation Blog post</a>, but essentially, only 19 Z-tunes were made, and they're all constructed from stripped-down used cars with high-spec part replacements.</p>

<p>As well as the Z-tune, you can also expect to drive the '22 Honda N-ONE RS, a kei passenger car with front-wheel drive and a 6-speed manual transmission. It's a light, breezy vehicle with plenty of modern accouterments to keep you happy.</p>

<p>Finally in this update, the '22 Nissan Qashqai Tekna 190 2wd e-Power is a hybrid machine that features a revolutionary (no pun intended) electric-generating engine. The aim was to improve on previous models' emissions, a goal Nissan clearly reckons it's achieved.</p>

<p>You can see these cars in action right here in the&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.61 trailer. It's not very long, but it does give a sense of what these beasts are like on the track.</p>




<p><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.61 is due to land today at 10pm Pacific, or tomorrow at 1am Eastern/6am GMT. You can grab&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/gran-turismo-7/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5 and PS4</a>.</p>
