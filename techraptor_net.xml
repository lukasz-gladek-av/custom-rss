Each participant will receive a Japanese borderless promo card from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/final-fantasy-magic-gathering-crossover-brings-classic-art-and-new-mechanics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy</em> set</a>. The top 128 players will receive traditional foil copies of that promo card. As for the top players, they will win their share of a $50,000 prize pool.</p>

<p>All competitive <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> players who placed in the top 8 of the Pro Tour Edge of Eternities tournament at MagicCon Atlanta will be receiving invitations to the <em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> Spotlight event.</p>

<p>The event is free to all who wish to enter, but is subject to a maximum capacity of the venue. For those who wish to compete for the prize, a ticket will need to be purchased when registration opens. The registration site will go live April 16. This means if you can make the travel plans and haven't been spoiled by <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/magic-gathering-final-fantasy-leak-tells-us-plenty-about-set" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recent leaks</a>, you can get a glimpse of this crossover set for yourself.</p>

<p>The <em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> Spotlight is the first time the event has been hosted in Japan. This is no doubt due to the cultural pull of the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series, an imaginative franchise that has been around for almost thirty years. A series packed with iconic characters, locations, and creatures waiting to be represented in Wizards of the Coast's enduring fantasy card game.</p>
