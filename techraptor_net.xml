            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-battle-pass-xp-simplified<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has announced changes to the way&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s battle pass progression will work, and if you like to play different&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>experiences outside of the standard battle royale mode, you'll like this one.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/coming-soon-progress-your-fortnite-passes-by-playing-any-experience" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a news post</a> on the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>website, Epic says that by December 1st, all battle passes in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>will progress simultaneously, and you won't need to earn different kinds of XP to make progress along their tracks.</p>

<p>Right now, for instance, to make progress in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival</em>'s battle pass, you'd have to earn Festival Points, while to move along&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>'s battle pass, you'd need Studs. Starting from December, however, that will no longer be the case.</p>

<p>Of course, you will still need to purchase the battle passes in question; Epic hasn't lost its mind, after all. Still, it's nice to know that you can be playing any&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>mode and not miss out on valuable XP elsewhere.</p>

<p>The first pass to get this treatment will be the Music Pass, which will be released as part of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival</em>'s sixth season on November 2nd. After that, on December 1st, the "Brick or Treat"&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>pass will adopt the new system, and all passes from that point on will use the new method.</p>

<p>Additionally, as part of this change, passes in&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Festival&nbsp;</em>will change to a single track with free and premium rewards, which is the same way the battle royale pass currently works.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hasbro-board-games-fortnite-clue">board games of Hasbro</a> are also making their way to&nbsp;Epic's game<em>&nbsp;</em>in the form of custom maps. The first one's based around <em>Clue</em>-slash-<em>Cluedo</em>, and others will follow in the coming weeks.</p>
