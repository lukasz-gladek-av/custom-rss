            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-season-3-confirmed-season-2-december<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Amazon has announced that its&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>streaming show has been renewed for a third season, and we now know roughly when the second season will be airing as well.</p>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/fallout-season-2-season-3-prime-video" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Amazon says that&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>season two will air in December, although the streaming giant stops short of announcing exactly when we can expect the show to land during that month.</p>

<p>As Amazon itself points out,&nbsp;confirmation of&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>season three "comes well in advance of the show's second season", so it's clear that the company is putting a lot of eggs into its&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>basket. Still, given the show's popularity, that isn't too surprising.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-season-3-confirmed-brotherhood.jpg?itok=nlX1ZVAo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-season-3-confirmed-brotherhood.jpg?itok=Y6wav9A3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>show will be returning for a third season, Amazon has confirmed.</figcaption></figure><p>The first season of the&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>series <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-amazon-prime-tv-show-premiere-date-officially-revealed-it-will-be-canon" rel="nofollow">began airing in April last year</a>, and it quickly found an audience, becoming Amazon Prime Video's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-prime-video-100-million-viewers" rel="nofollow">second show to hit 100 million viewers</a>. In case you're wondering what the first show was, that honor obviously goes to&nbsp;<em>The Rings of Power</em>.</p>

<p>The show follows former Vault 33 resident Lucy, who leaves her home in search of her father. As she wanders the wasteland, she meets the likes of Walton Goggins' gunslinger The Ghoul, New California Republic commander Lee Moldaver, and Brotherhood of Steel squire Maximus.</p>

<p>While the first season takes place in Los Angeles and its surroundings, the second will take Lucy to New Vegas, following on from the first season's finale (which I won't be discussing here for fear of spoilers).</p>

<p>Amazon hasn't revealed too much about the story for the second season and whether we can expect it to mirror its video game namesake, but we'll likely get more info about&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>season two in the coming months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-season-3-confirmed-new-vegas.jpg?itok=UGao1R4i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-season-3-confirmed-new-vegas.jpg?itok=dWDGu8Kf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fallout</em>'s second season will take viewers to New Vegas.</figcaption></figure><p>It's also not clear where&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>'s third season will take place, although it'll likely be a while before we learn that given that the second season won't air for another seven months or so.</p>

<p>In any case, the second season of&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>airs this December. There's still no word yet on whether Bethesda will be developing a new game in the series anytime soon, but if I was Todd Howard, I'd be thinking about capitalizing on the show's success. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-profits-and-sales-break-records-for-eighth-year-in-a-row.1187952/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-financials-2024-25<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has released its financial report for the 2024-25 fiscal year, and the company is doing very well indeed, bolstered by the major success of the latest entry in one of its biggest franchises.</p>

<p>Last year, Capcom celebrated its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-financials-2024-record-profits" rel="nofollow">seventh straight year of record profits</a>, and according to the studio's latest results <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250513b.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">summary</a>, it can now roll that figure over to eight, as both profits and net sales hit record highs this year.</p>

<p>According to Capcom, net sales jumped by 11.3% compared to last year, while operating income is up by 15.2%. As you'd probably expect if you've been following Capcom's progress this year, it's mainly&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>the studio has to thank for that success.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/capcom-monster-hunter-wilds-mizutsune.jpg?itok=9SNbtu18 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/capcom-monster-hunter-wilds-mizutsune.jpg?itok=qv1tz4S- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>has given Capcom its eighth straight year of record profits.</figcaption></figure><p>Released in February,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-player-record" rel="nofollow">broke Steam player records</a> for Capcom at launch, hitting 1.2 million players within just a few hours of its release. The game went on to sell <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">eight million copies</a>&nbsp;within three days, hitting the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-10m" rel="nofollow">ten million mark</a> by the end of March.</p>

<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Wilds</em>, Capcom says its performance this year was also helped by "strong catalog title sales" in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series across the board, suggesting that <em>Wilds</em><em>&nbsp;</em>also bolstered the sales for past entries like&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World</em>.</p>

<p>Although Capcom doesn't specifically mention it in the report, it's also important not to forget&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>; latest entry <i>Resident Evil 4&nbsp;</i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-4-sales-10m-village-11m" rel="nofollow">broke the ten million sales mark last month</a>, and other entries in the franchise aren't doing too badly for Capcom either.</p>

<p>The company also credits its booming pachislo business, including units based on&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em>, with this aspect of the Japanese studio's operations enjoying "increasing unit sales volume".</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-update-brings-new-enemies-weapon-customization-and-more.1187883/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-update-illuminate-weapon-customization<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrowhead Game Studios and Sony have released a brand new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>update, and it's bringing new Illuminate for you and your squad to take on, plus new weapon customization systems and more.</p>

<p>First up, you can expect "larger, more powerful enemies" joining the Illuminate armies, including the Stingray jetfighter, which targets your squad to line up "devastating strafing runs".</p>

<p>These airborne menaces are joined by the Crescent Overseer, which "has the ability to lay barrages on Helldivers in cover", and the Fleshmob, a "terrifying" new enemy that serves as a "brute battlefield force" constructed of Voteless parts.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-update-weapon-customization.jpg?itok=zoDiYmz7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-update-weapon-customization.jpg?itok=q5IoabLj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>now lets you customize your weapons.</figcaption></figure><p>Arrowhead also says there are "sightings of other, even larger ships", although it doesn't go into detail regarding what those ships are or what they can do. Suffice it to say you'd better watch out for more than just what's been revealed in this update briefing.</p>

<p>As well as new Illuminate enemies, the latest&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>update also brings with it a new weapon customization system, which allows you to unlock new weapon attachments and patterns to make your armaments truly your own.</p>

<p>You can complete missions in order to level up "most" primary weapons, and doing so will allow you to spend Requisition on new attachments. It sounds like a good way to spend a resource that has a tendency to pile up once you've bought all the good stratagems.</p>

<p>Other additions include new patterns for the FRV based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond" rel="nofollow">several</a> of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-freedoms-flame-warbond" rel="nofollow">existing</a> <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-truth-enforcers-warbond" rel="nofollow">Warbonds</a>, which will unlock at the same time the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond" rel="nofollow">Masters of Ceremony Warbond</a> is made available (that's May 15th).</p>




<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>news, a board game adaptation based on the popular shooter was <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound" rel="nofollow">recently fully crowdfunded in just 12 minutes</a>, demonstrating there's still a clear appetite for bringing managed democracy to Super Earth's enemies.</p>

<p>Despite that, the game's creative director Johan Pilestedt <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical" rel="nofollow">revealed back in January</a>&nbsp;that he's taking an extended break from working on&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, and that when he returns, he'll be devoting his attention to Arrowhead's next game.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>. The game's latest update is out now.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Stellar Blade PC Release Seemingly Leaked for June]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-pc-release-june-leak</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-pc-release-seemingly-leaked-for-june.1187880/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-pc-release-june-leak<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks like that mooted&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>PC release is about to be announced, if a recent trailer uploaded to the PlayStation YouTube channel is anything to go by.</p>

<p>As spotted by Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stellarblade/comments/1kkza3w/someone_made_an_oopsie_pc_trailer_june_11th/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alekstra</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/stellar-blade-for-pc-launches-june-11-alongside-complete-edition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>), a trailer was uploaded, then hastily deleted, to the official YouTube channel for PlayStation. The trailer confirms that&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>is set to hit PC on June 11th.</p>

<p>According to said trailer, when&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>does arrive on PC, it'll bring a lot of the features you'd expect from a release on the platform, including support for DLSS 4 and FSR 3 (but not FSR 4, unfortunately), an unlocked frame rate, and ultrawide display support.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/stellar-blade-pc-release-leak-june.jpg?itok=oOLEr5F6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/stellar-blade-pc-release-leak-june.jpg?itok=rWycVjeP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Cheer up, Eve. It looks like you'll be coming to PC soon after all.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as new technical features, the PC version will also add an extra boss fight against Sentinel leader Mann, plus 25 new outfits to try on. Hey, at least Shift Up knows its audience, I suppose.</p>

<p>Of course, the game will also be compatible with the DualSense controller on PC, and the PC version will support haptic feedback and trigger effects too. You won't have to use a DualSense, though.</p>

<p>There's no word on whether these extra features will be added to the PS5 version of&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>as well, but I think it's a pretty safe bet that they will be, so you should be able to enjoy the new outfits and boss fight even if you're still on PS5.</p>

<p>Technically, this hasn't been announced officially yet, but given that the trailer was uploaded to the PlayStation YouTube channel before being removed, it's fairly safe to assume the June 11th release date is legit.</p>




<p>A PC version of&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>has been talked about for some time now. Back <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stellar-blade-sales-one-million" rel="nofollow">in June last year</a>, developer Shift Up said it was actively considering releasing the game on PC, and it made comments to the same effect in its <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;code=ir_eng&amp;idx=203&amp;category=" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Q3 2024 financial report</a> as well.</p>

<p>It's likely the&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade&nbsp;</em>PC port will be officially revealed soon. For now, though, you can check the game out on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/stellar-blade/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and you can read our Austin's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/stellar-blade-review-mother-sphere-knows-best" rel="nofollow">review of it here</a>.</p>
