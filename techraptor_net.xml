            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/our-5-favorite-pieces-from-gravitrax-action-set-death-star<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Way back in 2021, we reviewed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/gravitrax-interactive-track-system-review" rel="nofollow"><em>GraviTrax</em> Starter Set Vertical</a>, the fast-paced build-your-own marble rolling system, so when we were offered the chance to cover the new&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax </em>Action-Set Death Star, I jumped at the chance. The <em>GraviTrax</em> system allows you to build mazes that literally fire marbles, or gravity spheres as they're known, around a track, racing and interacting with other gravity spheres as they go. We're not going to review the&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax</em> Action-Set Death Star, as we've already reviewed the system, but in this article, I'm going to look at my 5 favorite pieces that the Death Star set adds to your&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax</em> tracks.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax</em> Action-Set Death Star is a full starter set for&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax</em>, so if it's your first time picking it up, it contains everything you need to build and play. The set includes 190 pieces of track, including corners, runners, special pieces, and the base it all fits into, which is the Death Star at the lower level, and an Imperial Destroyer and Millennium Falcon at the upper levels. The set also includes 6 exclusive marbles, with unique etchings on them for Luke Skywalker, Darth Vader, Han Solo, and 3 Tie Fighters, along with X-Wing and Tie Fighter pieces that sit above the corners to add further immersion in the setting.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>GraviTrax</em>&nbsp;system allows you to add this set to existing sets or add further sets to this one once you've mastered it. The instruction booklet takes you through building the pieces and then increasing the complexity of tracks before you set off to explore builds on your own.</p>

<p>The<em> GraviTrax</em> Action-Set Death Star includes 4 X-Wing and 4 Tie Fighter miniatures that sit above the track corners on stands and add immersion to the tracks. The X-Wing is my first favorite piece from the set. They don't interact with the track itself, but they do help with the <em>Star Wars</em> feel, especially when viewed alongside the Death Star board.</p>

<p>My second favorite piece is the pole steps (name not official). The little cups on the top of the poles catch the gravity sphere, and momentum pushes the pole towards the next pole, where it drops it into the next cup, and so on. You do need to make sure there's some speed going into the first cup, otherwise, it doesn't move and the track ends there for that particular sphere, but hit it right, and it's quite satisfying to see them pass over each step and then continue along the track.</p>

<p>The catapult is pretty special which is why it features as my third favorite <em>GraviTrax</em> Action-Set Death Star piece. The speed at which it enters the holder at the bottom coverts into how fast it whips over the top, carried by the two counterweights. Then it either continues on its journey, or like in the image above from one of the set builds, it goes straight into a slide, which did arrest some of its momentum here, but whip it onto a straight track and it can really get some speed up.</p>

<p>The Gravity Well, our fourth favorite piece, is a drop into a slide, that can be rotated within the tile to face any direction you want. The slide itself does arrest the speed of the gravity sphere, so it won't plunge straight in and out, but once it exits the slide, it will already have a decent amount of momentum to keep it going. The piece in the image above fits into the Millennium Falcon level (and also the Death Star level piece), which looks great once set up, and feels really immersive as it drops the marble down and onwards.</p>

<p>By far my favorite piece is the Magnetic Cannon. This piece appears like a stop, with a solid magnet blocking the track, but when a gravity sphere strikes it, a gravity sphere on the other side of the magnet is fired back onto the track. These offer a range of options like reversing the direction of a gravity sphere, adding full momentum on the bottom level to fire round with a new lease of life, or making pieces strike together when they meet at central tiles. This piece feels the most Star Wars, like punching a hyperspace drive.</p>

The acclaimed tabletop developer has announced they will localize this retro-inspired board game from its original Brazilian Portuguese version.</p>

<h2><em>Video Game Champion</em> English Launch</h2>

<p>According to an official press release. <em>Video Game Champion</em> is a family-friendly competitive board game for 2-5 players. It puts players in the shoes of a child in the 1990s, a world full of pizza bagels, video game cartridges, and rental stores. The goal is to get the most impressive collection of video games and be the coolest kid in the neighborhood.</p>

You'll navigate earning an allowance, convincing your parents to buy you games, and doing chores to save up for the latest cutting-edge 16-bit game releases. Those resources include money chips, button chips, and "I owe you" chips.</p>

<p>These decisions are taken via an Action Grid, which includes studying, reading gaming magazines, or completing household tasks. In addition, you will need to raid store shelves to find the best "fictional releases." After all, you don't want to just buy these games; you want to make time to play them too.</p>

<p>The titles in <em>Video Game Champion</em> aren't official releases, but they invoke the spirit of the era courtesy of 16-bit inspired box art and titles like "<em>Dragon Scales</em>" or "<em>Neow Racing</em>".</p>

This is a line of bespoke, critically acclaimed board game products hand-selected by board game reviewer Tom Vasel. This line includes the acclaimed Japanese board game <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ito-card-game-getting-western-localization" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Ito</a>.</em></p>

<p>Furthermore, this is an English localized version of the Brazilian Portuguese version, <em>O Born Do Videogame</em>, designed by Patrick Matheus and André Luiz Silva Negrão. This is notable since the game was released in 2023 in Dutch, French, and German.</p>

<p><em>Video Game Champion</em> is available now at both online and physical retail outlets. It is currently being sold at an MSRP of $59.99.</p>
