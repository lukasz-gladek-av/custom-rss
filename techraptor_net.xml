<p>Twisted Pixel and Sanzaru's shutdown are likely part of plans Meta apparently has to cut roughly 10% of the employees in its Reality Labs business, which works primarily on VR and AR content, as reported by the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/12/technology/meta-layoffs-reality-labs.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">New York Times</a>.</p><p>That would include both studios; Twisted Pixel's last game was <em>Marvel's Deadpool VR</em>, released last year, while Sanzaru's most recent titles are both in the <em>Asgard's Wrath </em>series, which was created for VR headsets.</p><p>According to the New York Times' report, these cuts are part of a general shift in terms of Meta's direction, with the company now planning to focus more of its resources into the development of AI systems.</p><p>Generative AI has proven to be a controversial subject in the gaming industry, with some major companies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="746600ea-ef36-4d95-b141-ab37281d9e3e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">embracing the technology</a> while others <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hooded-horse-no-gen-ai-contracts" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4bf049e2-a4f8-41a0-b834-8030bfbcc977" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">excoriate it</a> for its environmental impact and the (perceived) poor quality of the assets it generates.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Unfortunately, Sanzaru and Twisted Pixel aren't the only studios to lose employees or be shut down recently. They join the likes of Ubisoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-halifax-shutdown" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5c381dd9-8d80-4d19-ac2f-5c64bbb6ef55" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Halifax division</a>, <em>Squid Game: Unleashed </em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/boss-fight-entertainment-netflix-shutdown" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9711bede-314c-4ee1-8135-fe8d85504170" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Boss Fight</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-hellsinger-the-outsiders-shut-down-funcom" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7586356a-08b1-450a-a88c-9b10c217225a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Metal: Hellsinger </em>studio The Outsiders</a>, to name but a few.</p><p>Neither Sanzaru nor Twisted Pixel's shutdown have been officially confirmed by studio management, and Meta hasn't provided an official comment either.
