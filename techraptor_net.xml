            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Naughty Dog has released a new update for&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered&nbsp;</em>that allows you to experience the game's harrowing story of revenge in a completely new way.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/08/introducing-the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-chronological-experience-out-today/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>, the rather appropriately-named Chronological Experience lets you play through&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</em>'s narrative in chronological order, rather than in the non-linear fashion in which it's originally presented.</p>

<p>The studio says that while the original structure is "very intentional and core to how [Naughty Dog] wanted&nbsp;<em>Part II</em>'s themes and narrative beats to impact players", the new Chronological mode will grant players "even deeper insight into&nbsp;<em>Part II</em>'s narrative".</p>

<p>The studio does stress that it still recommends newcomers play through&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part II&nbsp;</em>"as was originally developed", but that the new story mode is a "fascinating new way to enjoy this chapter".</p>

<p>It's not just the new mode, either. If you complete a Chronological playthrough, you'll be rewarded with&nbsp;<em>Uncharted</em>-themed skins for Joel and Tommy in the game's No Return mode. There's a Nathan Drake skin for Joel, as well as a skin based on Drake's brother Sam for Tommy.</p>

<p>The Chronological update is available now for&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part II&nbsp;</em>on both PC and PS5, and you'll also find "a host of additional bug fixes and performance improvements" contained in the update.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>news, co-creator Neil Druckmann recently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/neil-druckmann-steps-down-hbo-the-last-of-us" rel="nofollow">vacated his creative role</a> on the successful HBO show in order to spend more time with Naughty Dog. Hopefully, that means we'll be getting&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet" rel="nofollow">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>&nbsp;</em>that little bit sooner.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us Part II Remastered&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2531310/The_Last_of_Us_Part_II_Remastered/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.
