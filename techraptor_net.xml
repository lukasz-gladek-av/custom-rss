            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skullgirls-hidden-variable-autumn-games-legal-dispute<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>developer Hidden Variable has announced it will cease all work on the franchise owing to an ongoing legal dispute with publisher Autumn Games.</p>

<p>In a post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hiddenvariable.com/post/3ljotvjtpnk2o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a> (spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/hidden-variable-ceases-development-on-skullgirls-ip-payment-dispute-publisher-autumn-games-seemingly-owes-1-2-million-to-hidden-variable.1126731/#post-136658811" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">dgamemaster</a>), Hidden Variable says it is "no longer involved" in developing any&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>game, including&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls 2nd Encore</em>,&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls Mobile</em>, and "other&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>IP-related efforts".</p>

<p>The studio says it's in the middle of a dispute with Autumn Games which has been escalated to "litigation filed in the Los Angeles County Superior Court", and that it won't be providing further comment on the matter until said issue is resolved.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skullgirls-2nd-encore-hidden-variable.jpg?itok=ipJVsscE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skullgirls-2nd-encore-hidden-variable.jpg?itok=l5GLWkQ9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>studio Hidden Variable is embroiled in a legal dispute with publisher Autumn Games.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Hidden Variable says it won't be commenting on the matter, dgamemaster sought out the <a href="https://trellis.law/doc/240911937/complaint" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">legal document</a> filed by the studio, and it looks as though the dispute comes down to missed payments.</p>

<p>Specifically, Hidden Variable appears to be alleging that Autumn Games failed to pay it a number of times between November and now, with payments amounting to $1.23m due to Hidden Variable on Autumn Games' behalf.</p>

<p>The developer says Autumn's actions were intentional, and that the publisher was intending to find a new developer for the&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>games after it "unsuccessfully sought to sell its business".&nbsp;Ouch.</p>

<p>According to dgamemaster's post, Autumn Games has said that it intends to continue updating&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>despite the dispute, but it hasn't specified which of the games it will be updating, nor when new updates will be made available.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skullgirls-2nd-encore-hidden-variable-beowulf-painwheel.jpg?itok=r2hSSRn3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skullgirls-2nd-encore-hidden-variable-beowulf-painwheel.jpg?itok=XiFBQ8T7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>might still get updates, although we don't know when.</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>has run into a spot of bother. Back in 2020, Autumn Games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/skullgirls-publisher-kicks-lab-zero-games-off-project" rel="nofollow">kicked original developer Lab Zero off the IP</a>&nbsp;following <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/More-Victimized-Employees-Leave-Lab-Zero-Mike-Z" rel="nofollow">allegations made against that studio's head Mike Zaimont</a>.</p>

<p>Following those allegations, Zaimont subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mike-z-lays-off-all-remaining-lab-zero-games-employees" rel="nofollow">laid off all remaining Lab Zero employees</a>, with former staff going on to create a new studio by the name of Future Club. That studio would then work on&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/former-lab-zero-devs-partner-with-hidden-variable-for-skullgirls-content" rel="nofollow">DLC</a>, thus completing the cycle.</p>

<p>The future of the&nbsp;<em>Skullgirls&nbsp;</em>franchise is currently unclear, although it sounds like Autumn Games intends to continue working on at least one of the games in the series. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-update-clone-rumble<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase has released a new&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>update, and it's bringing a chaotic new game mode along with it, as well as a new Galacta-themed event and plenty of balance changes.</p>

<p>The update was released earlier today, but two of its biggest additions won't be going live until tomorrow: the Galacta's Cosmic Adventure event and the Clone Rumble game mode.</p>

<p>First up, Clone Rumble is a new mode that allows you and your teammates all to play as the same hero. If you've ever wondered what six Mr. Fantastics or six Rocket Raccoons could accomplish in a <em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>match, this mode is for you.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-clone-rumble-update-punisher.jpg?itok=Ux31xIdJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-clone-rumble-update-punisher.jpg?itok=V38OQTBO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals</em>' new Clone Rumble update looks set to cause chaos.</figcaption></figure><p>The mode will only be available across three distinct three-day time periods, though. You'll be able to check it out between tomorrow and March 10th, and it'll then be available again from March 14th-March 17th and March 21st-March 24th.</p>

<p>As well as Clone Rumble, you can also check out the new Galacta's Cosmic Adventure event, which launches tomorrow as well. Joining the event will net you an exclusive Black Widow outfit for free, and this event runs until April 11th, so the time period isn't as limited as Clone Rumble.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also expect plenty of optimizations and gameplay tweaks in this update. It's well worth checking out the full&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250304/41548_1215931.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">patch notes</a> for the Clone Rumble update so you can stay up-to-date on what's going on.</p>




<p>It's been a strange few months for&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>. The game launched back in December and reached <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m" rel="nofollow">10 million registered players</a> within just 72 hours, going on to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">break the 40 million barrier</a> by NetEase's last count.</p>

<p>However, that didn't stop the Chinese gaming giant from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-studio-shockingly-closed-by-netease-laying-off-everyone" rel="nofollow">unexpectedly closing down the Seattle studio</a> responsible for developing the game. I guess nobody is really safe from the recent wave of industry cuts and layoffs, unfortunately.</p>

<p><em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010451" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>
