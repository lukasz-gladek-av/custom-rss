The tabletop publisher is working alongside Avalon Hill to bring an <em>Ikusa: Samurai Swords 40th Anniversary</em> board game via a crowdfunding campaign this Fall.</p>



<p>In an official post, Renegade Game Studios stated that both they and Avalon Hill will bring the <em>Ikusa: Samurai Swords 40th Anniversary</em> board game to players around the world by a crowdfunding campaign on <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/gamefound-acquires-indiegogo-greatly-expanding-tabletop-crowdfunding-platform" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gamefound</a>.

If one wishes to gain the title of shogun, they will need to strategically deploy, manage, and command all armies and mercenaries at their command.</p>

<p>The post does confirm that the <em>Ikusa: Samurai Swords 40th Anniversary</em> board game Gamefound campaign will be packed with features and materials for dedicated fans and board game enthusiasts. This will include behind-the-scenes content, sneak peeks at the game's updated components, as well as giveaways.</p>

<p>This edition of the game will only be available via the Gamefound campaign. While a retail reprint isn't out of the question, if you want the most pristine version of this title, you will want to make time.</p>
