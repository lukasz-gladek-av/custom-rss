            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-gravediggers-command-starter-and-battlegroup-box-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>Warmachine</i>, a tabletop wargame that initially came to life to focus on balanced and competitive gameplay, has been around since 2003 under Privateer Press, until last year when Steamforged Games announced that they had <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/steamforged-games-acquires-warmachine-and-whole-iron-kingdom-ip-0" rel="nofollow">bought the IP</a>. <em>Warmachine</em> had recently moved into a new edition of the rules, and SFG has continued to run with that, kicking off a <a href="https://steamforged.com/en-gb/blogs/brands/iron-kingdoms-manifesto-part1?srsltid=AfmBOoqbPX8-yaogfTtpMsWSffAvNYYnSy0vGEqaKdAeX5njSJbqbpHm" rel="nofollow">roadmap</a> of new and exciting releases. These releases started with a brand new 2-player starter set, which we reviewed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">here</a>. In&nbsp;this article,&nbsp;we'll have a detailed look at a brand new force for Cygnar, the Gravediggers, with their first releases, the Gravediggers Command Starter and Battlegroup Box.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-2.jpg?itok=JJvrSvU0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-2.jpg?itok=Wf9h_BqY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>When the Trenchers go to war, they don't hold back.</figcaption></figure><h2>From The Skies!</h2>

<p>The Gravediggers are a new army under the Cygnar faction for Warmachine, and can trace their history back to the early days of Warmachine in 2003. The Gravediggers come from a group known as the Trenchers, who were a theme army in the original Warmachine and grew and developed through the various editions of the game. Now, under Steamforged Games, the Gravediggers bring the Trenchers back with a unique twist: they can airdrop weapons, supplies, and even Warjacks into the battlefield, letting them react to the changing landscape and keep your opponents on their toes.</p>

<p>There's a roadmap of releases planned for them, but they begin with the Gravediggers Command Starter, which features a perfect 30-point army to jump straight into games with them, and follows those starter forces from the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">2-Player Starter Set</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-review-sneaky-villainy" rel="nofollow">Shadows and Scum</a> and provides players with one of each unit type. Releasing alongside the Command Starter is the Gravediggers Battlegroup Box, which features a Warcaster and 2 Warjacks to expand your Command Starter, or start playing at lower model count games. Both of these sets feature crates and items that make use of their Airdrop rules, and we'll go into details of both sets and their rules below.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-3.jpg?itok=1CYBU9rU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-3.jpg?itok=eeKNW4CU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The contents of the <em>Warmachine</em> Gravediggers Command Starter Set.</figcaption></figure><h2>Watch Out For Buck</h2>

<p>The Gravediggers Command Starter Set is a great introduction to how the Gravediggers like to play, which is sneaky and devastating. This box is led by&nbsp;Captain Buck Hasker, who has Prowl, which gives him stealth if he has concealment, protecting him from attacks more than 5 inches away. He also passes this on to his Warjack, which means that every unit in this box has Prowl. Buck likes to leap from concealment and chain attacks with Killing Spree, which lets him make an additional attack if he removes an enemy model in melee. His close combat weapon, Fang, which stops the use of Tough, makes doing that a lot easier. His feat allows him to place 3 mine tokens within his control range, which deal damage and knock down any enemies coming within 3 inches of them. This is great for protecting him while he gets some wet work done, effectively locking him into an area with his target.</p>

<p>Buck's Warjack, Plugger, is an absolute beast of a heavy Warjack. Operating like Buck, moving to engage its target, and if destroyed, making a full advance back into hiding. Plugger comes with Stealth (not Prowl), which means he doesn't have to be in concealment to gain the benefits of Stealth. Plugger comes armed with dual trench rippers and a metal storm cannon to get the job done.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-5.jpg?itok=xeITb1tf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-5.jpg?itok=mQxQWgIa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Buck's Gravediggers prepare for action.</figcaption></figure><p>Buck and Plugger are backed up by Sergeant Brunaugh "Bruno" Ramjaw and the Rowdies, who all have Prowl and Advanced Deployment, to get them closer to the action and harder to target. Ramjaw uses a backpack-fed minigun to knock infantry troops back. The Rowdies give each other overlapping buffs while they're still on the field. Killing Spree, Reposition, and Precision Fire are all granted to each other, and they all come with Smoke Bombs as standard to make them difficult to target, which is helpful as they're all fairly short ranged.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-7.jpg?itok=G_NBBYdS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-7.jpg?itok=755D-BVF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Gravediggers Plugger is an absolute monster in combat, and their airdrops make the whole army super adaptable.</figcaption></figure><p>This box also comes with an Ammo Crate and Medical Crate miniature, which can be taken as command cards and allows you to drop the crate within 1 inch of the activating unit. The Ammo Crate lets a nearby friendly unit gain Magical to its attacks and by dealing 1 damage to the crate, boost the range or power of their ranged attack by 2. The Medical Crate allows nearby friendly units to deal one damage to the crate, to either remove a damage from a model with Tough that is disabled nearby, or remove D3+2 damage from a living model, or return a Grunt to a unit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-4.jpg?itok=B-NYXsbw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-4.jpg?itok=JyKS4YZj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The contents of the <em>Warmachine</em> Gravediggers Battle Box.</figcaption></figure><h2>Like Father, Like Daughter</h2>

<p>The Gravediggers Battle Box works a little differently to the Command Starter in that it includes a Warcaster and 2 Warjacks, and doesn't make a clean 30-point force. It can create a 30-point force, but the Warjacks have a variety of weapon options, so you'll have to do some planning before you build them. The set is great if you want to play a 30-point game with a smaller number of units, or perfect if you want to expand beyond the Command Starter.</p>

<p>The Gravediggers Battle Box includes&nbsp;Captain Cynthia 'Cyn' Rosko, who is the daughter of the famous&nbsp;Allister Caine we covered in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">2-Player Starter Set review</a>. Rosko has inherited her father's affinity to magic and comes armed with the Witch Hammer rocket launcher, which allows her to ignore cloud effects and stealth to strike her target if she aims. Her feat grants all models in her battleground and control range to make an additional ranged or melee attack that turn, which can mean an absolutely insane gunline attack for 1 turn.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-6.jpg?itok=nOAnYbm_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-6.jpg?itok=VwTkrKuL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Gravediggers Rosko can set up an insane gunline with her feat.</figcaption></figure><p>Both of the Warjacks in this set, the Valient (Heavy Warjack) and the Patriot (Light Warjack), come with build options for their heads and weapons. The head options give different abilities, which for the Valiant, means choosing between being faster and able to charge without spending a focus point, moving after being hit with an attack, a free move if it didn't run during the turn, and free move and attack if a friendly unit is taken out nearby. The Patriot also has 4 weapon options for each arm, which vary in point costs and types. Personally I'm a fan of the Volley Gun/Shield and Heavy Mortar loadout to rain down fire on anyone threatening the rest of the Gravediggers as they close the distance on their enemies.</p>

<p>The Patriot also has 4 head options, an arc node that allows casters to channel through it, the ability to move after taking out an enemy, a&nbsp;free move if it didn't run during the turn, or can bodyguard a nearby friendly unit. As with the Valiant, the Patriot comes with 4 weapon options for each arm, and how you want to use your Warjacks will determine how you arm them, including getting the best use of the rest of your force's buffs and your Warcaster's feat. Personally I'm a fan of the Sniper Cannon and Blaster/Shield combo to lay down fire at rage and boost your Warjack's armor.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-8.jpg?itok=XWnFyP9y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-gravediggers-command-and-battlegroup-8.jpg?itok=NDRu67Bk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Gravediggers Rosko loves to set up a gunline, and the heavy weapons crate just reinforces it.</figcaption></figure><p>Also in the Gravediggers Battle Box is a heavy weapons crate which works with the Heavy Airdrop Command Card. This card allows you to drop a Blocker or a Skirmisher Warjack onto the battlefield, or a Heavy Weapons Crate, which the Valiant Warjack can interact with to gain a Heavy Flamethrower, Howitzer, or Rocket Pod. It also gains +1 armor for the rest of the game, and a bonus focus point for the turn it interacts with the crate. This adaptability is one of the Gravedigger's greatest strengths, and your opponent will never be sure if you're about to get another Warjack, or your Valient is about to gain an extra weapon and go to town on their forces.</p>



<p>I'm so glad that the release of the Gravediggers coincided with me getting back into <em>Warmachine,</em> as they feel like a faction perfectly suited to my style of play. I love that they're a hard as nails combat force, but they're also super sneaky and insanely adaptable to the changing battlefield. These 2 boxes offer a dual style of entry. The clean Command Starter, with its fixed armaments and full roster of unit types, or the smaller Battle Box that still shows what the Gravediggers are all about, and has customization options for the Warjacks' loadouts. Their paratrooper/special forces feel sits well with me, and their theme is captured extremely well in their mechanics.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As with previous <em>Warmachine</em> releases, these set are just miniatures, as the rules and stats are all available for free on the <em>Warmachine</em> app and you will have to add a couple of accessories (dice, measuring tool, and tokens) to get playing, but once you have those, getting started with the Gravediggers is easy.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Mario Kart World Gameplay Details Revealed Ahead of June Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-nintendo-direct</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-mario-kart-world-gameplay-details-revealed-ahead-of-june-launch.1166742/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-nintendo-direct<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Nintendo held a new Nintendo Direct presentation in which the Japanese gaming giant showed off more gameplay details for the upcoming racer&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p>

<p>Set to debut <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">alongside the Switch 2 on June 5th</a>,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>represents the first entirely new mainline&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>game since 2014's&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8</em>, and Nintendo has packed in a fair few new features to reflect that. Here's everything covered during today's show!</p>

<hr><h2>New and returning courses in&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></h2>

<p>First, we got a look at some of the courses that will be featured in&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>. As you'd expect, there will be a number of new courses on offer, as well as several returning favorites.</p>

<p>New courses include the canyon-set Mario Bros. Circuit, the urban Crown City, and the spooky movie theater Boo Cinema, while returning courses include the likes of Toad's Factory, Peach Beach, and Wario Shipyard.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-kart-world-direct-mario-bros.-circuit.jpg?itok=Nuyuz6bd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-kart-world-direct-mario-bros.-circuit.jpg?itok=LcFAosad 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>has a number of new courses to offer.</figcaption></figure><p>As revealed at the time of the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">original announcement</a>, these courses will be integrated into a fully-explorable world, and you'll need to drive between them when you're racing in certain modes.</p>

<h2>New and returning racers in&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></h2>

<p>Several new characters will be introduced as part of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>'s lineup. They include the likes of the series' iconic Goomba, as well as a cloudless Lakitu, New Donk City mayor Pauline, and more.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also look forward to certain characters making a return; Mario and Luigi are givens, and Peach, Bowser, and many others will be coming back to race in&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p>

<p>You'll be able to choose which vehicle you want to use while racing, and each vehicle has different stats, as do the characters themselves. It doesn't look like you'll be choosing individual parts for your vehicles this time around, though.</p>

<h2><em>Mario Kart World</em>'s many gameplay modes</h2>

<p>We also got a look at the gameplay modes that will be featured in&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>. As has been previously revealed, the two main modes on offer are Grand Prix and Knockout Tour.</p>

<p>The former works like a classic&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>Grand Prix mode; you'll race across four courses, and the winner is the racer who accrues the most points, although you will also be driving between courses now.</p>

<p>Knockout Tour, meanwhile, tasks you with placing ahead of other racers to avoid being eliminated. Several different sets of courses will be available for both modes. Of course, classic multiplayer staples like VS Race and Battle Mode will also be available.</p>

<p><em>Mario Kart World</em>'s Free Roam mode is exactly what it sounds like; you'll be exploring the game's world, finding hidden switches and panels to take on missions. Nintendo didn't reveal whether the missions will unlock any extra stuff, but they should be a fun way to hone your racing skills.</p>

<h2>New items and gameplay tricks</h2>

<p><em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>will introduce a number of new items you can use to get one over on your racing rivals. They include the Mega Mushroom, which lets you grow to a massive size and stomp your enemies, and the Hammer, which you can throw to create obstacles on the course.</p>

<p>These will, of course, accompany returning items like Bullet Bill and the Lightning powerup, although I don't think I spotted the iconic Blue Shell during the Direct. Hopefully, it'll be making some kind of return; a&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>game with no Blue Shell is no&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>game at all.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-kart-world-direct-mega-mushroom.jpg?itok=BiE6FsY- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-kart-world-direct-mega-mushroom.jpg?itok=EDY9_yO7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>has plenty of new powerups for you to try.</figcaption></figure><p>These items will be accompanied by plenty of new gameplay tricks, including wall-riding, grinding on rails, and Charge Jumping, which lets you hold the Drift button while racing straight to charge up a jump. You can then use that jump to dodge projectiles and other hazards.</p>

<p>We also got a look at&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>'s drive-thru Yoshi's, which will let you collect food items in order to unlock new outfits. You can then select these outfits on the character selection screen.</p>

<p>Several support features will be available, too, including smart steering and auto-acceleration, which you can use to level the playing field if you're experiencing&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>alongside franchise newbies.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most intriguing of these is the Rewind feature, which lets you rewind yourself to a point before making a mistake. It only works on the racer using it, though, so be aware of that if you're using it tactically.</p>

<hr><p>That's everything we got to see during today's&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>Direct show! The game is due to launch <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/mario-kart-world/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2</a> on June 5th.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-royal-writ-permadeath-deckbuilder</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-royal-writ-is-a-permadeath-deckbuilder-from-yogscast-games.1166691/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-royal-writ-permadeath-deckbuilder<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yogscast Games and developer Save Sloth Studios have announced&nbsp;<em>The Royal Writ</em>, a lane-based deckbuilder with an extra sting in its tail for those who like their difficulty a little higher.</p>

<p>The game sees you marching your troops across a series of procedurally-generated maps in order to defeat the final boss and emerge from your run victorious. So far, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-train-2-announced-demo-now" rel="nofollow">so deckbuilder</a>, but there's a twist to this one.</p>

<p>If your cards arrive at their destination and the enemy base still has health remaining, then those cards will be permanently deleted from your deck for that run, so you'll have to make clever decisions about which cards to send and which ones to reserve.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-royal-writ-announcement-cards.jpg?itok=03QgPM-N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-royal-writ-announcement-cards.jpg?itok=KaiRZV30 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Royal Writ&nbsp;</em>has an extra sting in its tail thanks to card permadeath.</figcaption></figure><p>Save Sloth and Yogscast say the permadeath mechanic in&nbsp;<em>The Royal Writ&nbsp;</em>is all part of the point; the system is designed to create "the ultimate jeopardy", leading to "emergent sub-stories" and "memorable" individual runs.</p>

<p>The studios say the point is either to "achieve victory through strategic planning or game-breaking synergies", or to "fail miserably because your soldier got stuck in a bog and you forgot he can't fly". We've all been there.</p>

<p>All of this is wrapped up in "cute picture-book visuals" that emphasize the "grotesque and absurd humor of a medieval world engulfed in constant war and deceit".</p>

<p>Development on&nbsp;<em>The Royal Writ&nbsp;</em>began as part of game jam competition Ludum Dare 55, and following "hugely positive feedback", the game moved into full development. You can check out&nbsp;<em>The Royal Writ</em>'s debut trailer here.</p>




<p>Unfortunately,&nbsp;<em>The Royal Writ&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but if you'd like to give the game a go, a playable demo will be available "soon", according to Yogscast and Save Sloth.</p>

<p><em>The Royal Writ&nbsp;</em>is set for release in 2025 for PC via Steam. There's no word on console ports for the game yet.</p>
