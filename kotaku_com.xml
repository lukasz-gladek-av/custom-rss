On July 22, every member of its roster said they were either going independent or taking a break from streaming for a while. Some of the VTubers said they hadn’t been paid in months. It remains unclear how much money VShojo owes them and whether that money&nbsp;will ever be paid. </p><p>While the agency is now shutting down, and the $515,000 it was supposed to pay to the Immune Deficiency Foundation may never materialize, a fresh fundraiser Ironmouse recently announced has already <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ironmouse/status/1948360664956784828&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ironmouse/status/1948360664956784828" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">raised over $1 million more for the organization</a></span>.

For some, it’s easy to forget his in-ring accomplishments and focus solely on his bad behavior.

Most content creators are trying to get viral soundbites in their interviews, but streamer and YouTuber Loserfruit had a much better idea and asked Pedro Pascal, Vanessa Kirby, Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Joseph Quinn to try out their respective heroes in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span>. So if you’ve ever wanted to see Pascal use Mister Fantastic’s stretchy limbs to help claim an objective, you can finally do that now.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Loserfruit sat down with the <em>First Steps </em>cast and had each of them jump into <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’s practice range to try out their heroes. Pascal played as Mister Fantastic, Kirby controlled Invisible Woman, Moss-Bachrach did some clobbering as the Thing, and Quinn ignited the skies as Human Torch. Before they get started, Kirby says she loves playing games, and Pascal mentions she’s big on <em>The Sims</em>. The rest of the crew says they have pretty limited gaming experience. Quinn played <em>FIFA</em> as a kid and Pascal says he never played anything past the original NES. So by and large, it sounds like the actors are about to enter uncharted territory playing NetEase’s hero shooter.</p><p>Loserfruit shows the cast some of the cosmetics in the game, including Invisible Woman’s wildly popular Malice skin depicting her villainous alter ego, which was a real crowd-pleaser. It seems like a missed opportunity to not have the actors play with the skins <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fantastic-4-first-steps-pedro-pascal-mr-fantastic-reed-1851786015&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fantastic-4-first-steps-pedro-pascal-mr-fantastic-reed-1851786015">based on their movie appearances</a></span>, but those unfortunately aren’t live until tomorrow, July 25, so the default skins will have to do.</p><p>The actors all face a bit of a learning curve, and Pascal even jokes about needing “console classes” to learn how to play. After some time in the practice range, the group entered a real online game, but Loserfruit asked the other players to “pls be nice” to the actors in chat. The cast passed the controller around during a match, and it wasn’t until Pascal played that any of them managed to get a kill on the enemy Venom. Well, an assist, but let’s not get technical.</p><p>Check out the full video below:</p><p>All four actors are pretty busy right now, so it’s not like they have time to become pro gamers in the midst of promoting <em>First Steps </em>and shooting their upcoming MCU appearances in <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em>.
