              <p>Last month, <a href="https://kotaku.com/war-of-the-worlds-amazon-ad-drone-scene-horrible-bad-review-2000614752">Amazon quietly released a new film version of H.G. Wells’ <em>The </em><em>War of the Worlds.</em></a> The movie, in which everything we see is happening on computer screens, stars Ice Cube and was a huge flop with critics. It featured a scene where the world is saved thanks to an Amazon drone driver. Seriously. Now, a month later, the rapper and actor has explained how the internet’s favorite bad movie of 2025 came to be.</p> <p>During a recent livestream marathon hosted by popular creator <a href="https://kotaku.com/kai-cenat-ptsd-30-day-stream-no-break-hot-ones-twitch-1851786038">Kai Cenat</a>, Ice Cube dropped by to talk about his career, his future projects, and just shoot the shit with Cenat and his friends. <a href="https://youtu.be/4sVR6klSZyM?t=827">At one point during the stream</a>, Cenat asked Ice Cube about Amazon’s <em>War of the Worlds.</em> And while Cenat didn’t call it a terrible movie, it was clear that Ice Cube wasn’t particularly happy about the finished product, which apparently was shot half a decade ago in about two weeks.</p>  <p>“[<em>War of the Worlds</em> is a movie] I did in 2020 during the pandemic, five years ago,” Ice Cube told Cenat during the marathon stream. “We shot it in 15 days, and it was during the pandemic. So, the director wasn’t in there. None of the actors was in there. This was the only way we could really shoot the movie. [It was] pandemic time.”</p>

 <p>Ice Cube added that this is the reason <a href="https://gizmodo.com/amazons-new-war-of-the-worlds-features-a-head-scratching-twist-2000636929"><em>War of the Worlds</em></a> is presented entirely as a series of computer screens. He then added: “But really, if shit went down, everybody would only have their screen to look at.”</p> <p>As for why the movie took five years to release, Ice Cube provided an odd answer, telling <a href="https://kotaku.com/kai-cenat-streamer-university-tylil-james-twitch-1851783206">Kai Cenat</a> that after Universal sold the movie to Amazon Prime, it “took a minute to finish” the film because of “how it was shot.”</p> <p>“The movie is shot, the actors are shot, but all the footage is from real surveillance cameras around the world,” claimed Ice Cube. “And they had to build all that shit. So yeah, it took a minute.”</p> <p>As someone who has watched the movie and flipped through it a few times, I think a lot of the footage featured in it is actually stock footage or content licensed cheaply from some asset library.&nbsp; But hey, maybe they really did fly around the world collecting original security camera footage for this straight-to-digital low-budget adaptation of a classic novel. That’s possible, too, I guess…?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-everything-pre-order-dlc-release-date-time-ps5-switch-2-crossplay-2000624090"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> launched last week to big numbers and mostly positive reviews on Steam. But there’s been a lot of chatter and debate online about the looter shooter’s performance. Some players aren’t happy that <em>Borderlands 4</em> seemingly requires DLSS and frame generation to run decently, even on the highest-end hardware. Meanwhile, Gearbox co-founder and <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-real-fan-post-1851782855">CEO Randy Pitchford</a> has defended the game’s performance, calling it “<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424828975255865">pretty damn optimal</a>,” and suggested people need to use the “tools” provided by the studio and accept some trade-offs.</p> <p>On PC, many games can utilize real-time upscaling tech, like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Learning_Super_Sampling">Nvidia’s DLSS</a> and AMD’s FSR. Nvidia and others have also created tools that allow your GPU to fill in the gaps between real frames rendered by the game with frames generated using deep learning tech. When this kind of tech was first introduced about six years ago or so, players complained that DLSS and other tools made games look blurry, even if it led to some performance boosts. As DLSS and similar tech have improved, the images produced looked have better and better. Today, DLSS 4.0 can produce some truly sharp-looking frames and provide some big performance gains, assuming you have a powerful enough video card.</p> <p>But some, myself included, have started to grow concerned that studios are building games around DLSS and other similar tech, and aren’t optimizing them in the way devs did in the past. When DLSS was introduced, it felt like a great tool for gamers who had a slightly older card but still wanted to play a newer game. It would let them squeeze out a bit more performance without shelling out for a pricey upgrade. Now it seems like newer games running on more advanced engines require users to turn on DLSS and frame gen to play. And so enters <em>Borderlands 4,</em> a game that has found itself at the center of this heated debate.</p>

 <p>Shortly after <em>Borderlands 4</em> launched, players on PC began to complain that the game didn’t run very well. Gearbox responded with some updates that, at least in my experience with the game on PC, helped a bit. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1285190?emclan=103582791474679148&amp;emgid=679602429802577921">The company also released a guide from Nvidia</a> for how to optimize the game based on your GPU and settings. And while that helped some reach better performance on PC, many others, myself included, were struggling to get the game to run well on powerful hardware. I’m rocking a 5080, and even playing the game at 1080p on medium settings led to tons of FPS drops, even while trying to play at 60FPS. That all changed when I did as Gearbox and Nvidia suggest and turned on DLSS and frame gen. Now, I can run <em>Borderlands 4</em> at a mostly locked 120 with most settings set to high and medium. It looks nice and plays fine, but many aren’t okay with a game in 2025 being unable to run on high-end hardware without some upscaling assistance.</p> <p>Not helping matters is the fact that Randy Pitchford posted, <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424826697781446">as part of a recent and lengthy thread on Twitter</a>, that people should use DLSS because it’s “great” and added: <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424849653236055">“The game was built to take advantage of it.”</a> That, and a different part of the thread claiming it was acceptable for devs to focus on “default settings” reaching only 30FPS, didn’t go over well with a lot of PC gamers who specifically buy new parts and upgrade their rigs to achieve high framerates at high resolutions. For many, Pitchford’s claim that <em>Borderlands 4</em> was developed to “take advantage” of DLSS was him confirming that it was built with the assumption that most users would use DLSS. And that, to some, sounds a lot like the game wasn’t properly optimized to run without help from DLSS and frame generation.</p>

 <p>While I do agree that newer DLSS and frame gen tools are powerful and impressive, it feels weird that<em> Borderlands 4,</em> along with other games like <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, demand that even users with the highest-end hardware lean on upscaling tech to play at decent settings and historically popular framerates like 120. In a recent video, the tech experts over at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tech-experts-say-borderlands-4-on-pc-runs-worse-than-usual-for-an-unreal-engine-5-game-advise-against-badass-setting"><em>Digital Foundry</em> weren’t impressed with <em>Borderlands 4</em></a> on PC, with one even saying: “[<em>Borderlands 4</em>] does seem to be running worse than usual for an Unreal Engine 5 game. It is below where it seems like it should be given how other games using this engine perform.”</p> <p>Pitchford has promised on Twitter that more updates are coming, including some more improvements to how the game runs on PC. He’s also been spending a lot of time online <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967351908613665255">helping people improve how <em>Borderlands 4</em> runs</a> and <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967344224728400187">claiming that performance issues are not as widespread</a> as some might make you believe. Personally, I just miss when games could run on a high-end computer packed with powerful hardware without needing four different upscaling tools. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2246340/discussions/0/597391905481847754/?l=portuguese&amp;ctp=6">And it seems I’m not alone</a>.</p>
