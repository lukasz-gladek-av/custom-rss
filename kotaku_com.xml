And that’s cool I guess, but why did they include a very overused  sound effect of kids laughing? And why does it pop up not just once, but <em>twice </em>in the 15-second clip? </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-fantastic-four-cast-pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-mcu-1851256106&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-fantastic-four-cast-pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-mcu-1851256106">As announced last February</a></span>, Marvel’s upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/chris-evans-avengers-doomsday-mcu-robert-downey-jr-1851717766&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/chris-evans-avengers-doomsday-mcu-robert-downey-jr-1851717766">MCU</a></span> reboot of the Fantastic Four is set to hit theaters this July.

Since that announcement last year, we’ve not seen much else of <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>. But that changed today with a small teaser that also contains a really annoying sound effect. </p><p>On February 3, Marvel teased a trailer because it’s 2025 and that’s just a normal thing we have to deal with now. In the short teaser we see some kids running and laughing as they try to cram themselves in front of an array of TVs in the display window of a 1960's store. The televisions are preparing to show a rocket launch involving Marvel’s famous family. I hope nothing bad happens! We’ll see more in the full trailer tomorrow. </p><p>But instead of enjoying this little teaser for the new <em>Fantastic Four </em>movie, I was distracted immediately by a sound effect I’ve heard oh so many times before. You’ve undoubtedly heard this sound effect, too. It’s a group of kids laughing in a weird, somewhat unnatural way and it’s popped up in games, movies, TV shows, commercials, trailers, and songs. </p><p>This sound effect is known as “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://soundeffects.fandom.com/wiki/Hollywoodedge,_Small_Group_Kids_Laug_PE143601&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://soundeffects.fandom.com/wiki/Hollywoodedge,_Small_Group_Kids_Laug_PE143601" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Small Group Kids Laug PE143601</a></span>" and was found on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://soundeffects.fandom.com/wiki/The_Premiere_Edition_Volume_1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://soundeffects.fandom.com/wiki/The_Premiere_Edition_Volume_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Premiere Edition Volume 1</a></span> sound effects library produced by Hollywood Edge in 1990. This sound effect, which was originally recorded in 1983 for <em>Indiana Jones and the</em> <em>Temple of Doom</em>, has appeared in a very long list of movies, TV shows, and more since it was added to that sound effect library in the ‘90s. And weirdly, it keeps getting used decades later. Here’s a clip from the Netflix animated show <em>Wonderoos</em> that contains the laughing kids: </p><p>Apparently, this effect (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wilhelm-scream-star-wars-video-games-movies-sound-1850321598&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wilhelm-scream-star-wars-video-games-movies-sound-1850321598">like the Wilhelm Scream</a></span>) has just become a standard option for sound engineers and designers in Hollywood. As someone who instantly recognizes this sound effect the moment it pops up in a movie or game, its continued use in 2025 is annoying. </p><p>And to bring this back to the <em>Fantastic Four</em> teaser, I’m honestly shocked and perplexed that the marketing folks behind it decided to include the effect twice in such a short clip. I’d bet money that in the full movie this sound effect won’t be used twice in such a short timespan (it might not even appear at all) as it’s really distracting and noticeable when it plays back to back like that. </p><p>Anyway, I guess I’ll listen out for this annoying sound effect when<em> Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> arrives in theaters on July 25, 2025. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And diehard <em>Severance</em> fans (should “severed heads” be the fanbase name?) will quickly notice a connection between this book and the current season.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Throughout the eight chapters, Hale waxes poetic about poisonous words in our bodies and the quality of nonexistence. However, there are a few tidbits that offer some illumination of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ben-stiller-apple-severance-season-1-finale-news-1851741591&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ben-stiller-apple-severance-season-1-finale-news-1851741591"><em>Severance</em> world</a></span>. Hale hilariously explains how he was “the first child sired exclusively for theatrical performances” after revealing he was both conceived and born in a theater as part of a nine-month performance art piece his parents created called “Smells Like Afterbirth, Fucker.” That gives creepy new meaning to the term “theater kid.” </p><p>The most interesting aspect of the book is its connection to events of Season 2. The book’s introduction reads: “As you know, the book was meant to release nationwide this week, and I was deeply eager to share its splendors with you. Unfortunately, events beyond my control have led to a brief delay as I liaise with several corporate parties as to precisely where and in what form the book should be released.”</p><p>This appears to be directly connected to Season 2's third episode, in which we learn that Lumon PR rep Natalie (Sydney Cole Alexander) has visited Hale to commission him to make a Lumon-approved version of his book. Remember, his book found its way onto the Severed Floor and became a huge hit among the severed employees. With Lumon desperately trying to rein in any and all outside influences on its employees, the book’s introduction points to Lumon’s attempt to control the information contained in the book. This is why he later says he negotiated to have the first eight chapters—those that make up the ebook— released. </p><p><em>Severance</em> had its actors do a mock workday in a glass encasement in the middle of Grand Central Terminal in New York City, and now the show is teaching people how to better themselves, the Lumon way. We really might be close to Apple going all of the way and promoting the show by having people voluntarily get a chip in their brains that plays <em>Severance </em>episodes on repeat when we sleep. Or, they just might send viewers goat-styled slippers. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
