              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">Despite the performance issues, annoying jokes, and bugs</a>, I’m still playing and enjoying <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a>. I’m currently working on my second full playthrough with my wife, who is also a big <em>Borderlands</em> fan, and we’re having a great time. Mostly. Everything is going fine right up until we encounter another damn loot capsule. These things are the worst part of the game and are so bad that they truly baffle me.</p> <p>As you explore the open world of<a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-steam-reviews-gearbox-randy-pitchford-2000634014"><em> Borderlands 4,</em></a> you’ll find side activities and quests to complete. Some of these are elaborate, but other stuff is as simple as killing a specific target or activating a safehouse. One of these supposedly simple and fun little side activities involves Loot Capsules. These are small pods that you can stumble upon and then have to carry back to the nearest safehouse to unlock. Doing so opens the capsule, and you get some loot. Sounds fine, right? Wrong!</p>

 <p>In <em>Borderlands 4,</em> Gearbox created a new mechanic that lets you pick up objects while fighting. This is used in various ways in the looter shooter, and most of the time, it is a nice way to spice up a combat encounter or make solving a puzzle just a bit more interesting. But when you hold something in <em>Borderlands 4</em>, you can’t mantle or climb up a ladder, drive your hover bike, aim down your sights, throw grenades, or fast travel with that object. It greatly limits your toolbox, and that’s fine when it’s used sparingly as a momentary wrinkle you have to contend with.</p> <p>Yet that isn’t the case with Loot Capsules, which sometimes require you to walk a very long distance back to the “closest” HQ to get your reward. And you have to walk it. You can’t use your cool bike. You just run back on foot, unable to take most shortcuts because you can’t even use your sick grapple hook when holding an item. It is so fucking tedious. If you get attacked by enemies and have to fight your way out, you’d better hope that nothing happens that dislodges that capsule from your hand, or you could be searching around desperately for it in a moment. Has this happened to me? Yes, why do you think I’m writing this blog? And when you finally get to your HQ, you might have to solve some platforming puzzle that even involves tossing the damn loot pod across gaps. If it lands in an area you can’t enter, like a bottomless gorge that kills you, then it respawns back where you found it. Congratulations, you get to do it all over again.</p>

 <figure><figcaption>©Gearbox | <em>Go to hell, Claptrap</em></figcaption></figure> <p>Oh, and every time you pick it up, Claptrap starts talking. Every. Single. Time. Sometimes, he’ll talk over himself. And there are only so many lines. And they go on and on. I don’t even hate <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/borderlands-claptraps-new-robot-revolution">Claptrap</a> like a lot of people do, but I quickly reached my breaking point after just a few capsules.</p>

 <p>These damn capsules annoy me so much, and I deal with them so often that I’ve started to overthink how they even work. In a sci-fi universe that lets me digitize dozens of guns and store them on my person easily, why the fuck can’t I just store the capsule, too? Why must I lug it back? Why can’t I collect it like all the various shields, guns, and other loot I stuff into my digital trousers with no issue? Who thought this was fun? I’d love to chat with them because I’m genuinely curious how this was left in the game. Truly, it baffles me.</p> <p>Here’s the funniest part about all of this: I’d be fine with the bullshit and the capsules if the reward was worth it. In my experience, this is never the case. I’ve opened close to two dozen of these things or more while playing alone and with friends. I’ve never gotten a single legendary weapon. Never. It’s usually the same crappy loot you often find in random chests, which don’t require a tenth of the effort to open. I’ve talked to friends about it and they’ve reported the same thing: Worthless loot that you trash the second you see it.</p>

 <p>At this point, I’ve started to ignore them when playing <em>Borderlands 4</em> alone. And when I do pick one up, I just gnash my teeth the whole time as I hear the same damn Claptrap line again. At least I enjoy the rest of the game. Mostly.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[How A Headline Gets Written At Kotaku: Battlefield 6 Edition]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/how-a-headline-gets-written-at-kotaku-battlefield-6-edition-2000661912</link>
            <guid>1412422</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Consider this the first in a new series of sporadic posts attempting to demystify what goes on at <em>Kotaku</em>, a website about games but also lots of other stuff. We publish many stories here, sometimes well over a dozen throughout the course of a day. Maybe even a hundred by the end of any given week. Likely the first thing you see on any one of those stories is the headline. How do we come up with those?</p> <p>Well, in the case of a recent news post about <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-announce-classic-big-map-returning-season-two-details-2000661857">new content coming to <em>Battlefield 6</em></a>, it went something like this. Staff writer Zack Zwiezen, our resident anti-Pax Armata expert, filed an article summarizing new details on what’s coming to the shooter in season 2 and beyond. It had the working headline “<i data-stringify-type="italic">Battlefield 6</i> Devs Announce A Classic, Big Map Is Returning And Share Season Two Details.” Accurate, informative, helpful.</p>

 <p>But I spilled my soup during lunch and was feeling a bit cranky. The gaming press, myself included, has a tendency to overuse boring phrases like “announces,” reveals,” and “shows off” to convey that a new thing has happened. I pushed for something that sounded different and offered a couple of alternatives. Here’s the conversation in our work Slack that followed:</p> <blockquote><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong><em> Battlefield 6</em> Is Giving Fans A Classic Big Map And More In Season 2<br> <em>Battlefield 6</em> Hears You And Reveals A Classic, Big Map For Season 2.<br> wondering if there’s something more interesting than announces<br> just say what you want to say about what you think about this</p> <p><strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong>: <em>Battlefield 6</em> Bringing Back Another Classic Map And Its A Big One</p> <p><strong>Ethan Gach</strong>: <em>Battlefield 6</em> Season 2 Brings Back A Classic Map But Will It Be Big Enough?</p> <p><strong> Zack Zwiezen</strong>: Well that’s the catch. It won’t be in season 2<br> they have other maps for season 2<br> this is likely 3</p> <p><strong>Ethan Gach</strong>: lol why aren’t they revealing season 2 maps?<br> that seems like a bad sign for big maps in season 2</p> <p><strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong>: They revealed a season 2 map and teased this OTHER one</p> <p><strong>Ethan Gach</strong>: is it big?</p> <p><strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong>: Bigish<br> lol<br> hence why I think they are teasing this OTHER map</p> <p><strong>Ethan Gach</strong>: that seems more the story</p> <p><strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong>: It’s something I talk about in the post, yeah<br> can try to build a hed around it</p> <p><strong>Ethan Gach</strong>: wait so the map is confirmed not for season 2?<br> or they just won’t say</p> <p><strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong>: It will be in a future season</p> <p><strong>Carolyn Petit</strong>: yeah they want to appease the people pounding the tables and chanting BIG MAP! BIG MAP! by saying “we’ve got a big map coming soon, we promise!”</p> <p><strong>Ethan Gach</strong>: <em>Battlefield 6</em> Will Bring Back A Classic Big Map But Not For Season 2</p> <p><strong> Zack Zwiezen</strong>: That works<br> <em>Battlefield 6</em> Really Wants You All To Know Big Maps Are Coming, Okay? lol</p> <p><strong>Ethan Gach</strong>: As long as it’s still accurate that seems like the story to me</p> <p><strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong>: Yeah your hed is accurate</p> <p><strong>Ethan Gach</strong>: <em>Battlefield 6</em> To Concerned Nation: Big Maps Are Coming…Eventually</p> <p><strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong>: <em>Battlefield 6</em> Dev Spreads Out Arms Real Wide On Stage And Receives 20 Minutes Of Standing Applause<br> anyway, posting with your hed</p></blockquote> <p>So there you have it. A perfect headline? No. Better than “<i data-stringify-type="italic">Battlefield 6</i> Devs Announce A Classic, Big Map Is Returning And Share Season Two Details?” Maybe! On the site currently? Yes. And that’s how it got there.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/every-battlefield-6-map-ranked-from-worst-to-best-2000647370"><em>Battlefield 6′</em></a>s delayed season two arrives in February, and we finally know more about what to expect in the upcoming season. But EA also teased more of what’s to come beyond season two in a new update on <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s future.</p> <p>On January 21, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/2014005415114310024">EA and Battlefield Studios shared a new and lengthy update</a> confirming some key details about season two. The biggest news is that EA confirmed season two will include at least two new maps, and it shared a few more details about one of those battlegrounds. Contaminated is one of the new maps arriving sometime in season two, and EA will soon be letting some players hop into the map early via a new round of Battlefield Labs playtesting. Interestingly, EA says it wants to test how the map’s “unique gameplay mechanics function” in a live match. As for how big Contaminated is, EA says its total size lands somewhere between <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-new-map-review-good-eastwood-big-large-ps5-pc-2000645547">Eastwood and Mirak Valley</a>&nbsp;and says it is comparable in size to classic maps such as Arras from <em>Battlefield V.</em></p>

 <p>While that sounds like a decent-sized map, I suspect EA knew some fans wouldn’t be satisfied with that announcement, which probably explains the publisher teasing the return of a massive classic map in Wednesday’s post. Golmud Railway, a map first seen in <em>Battlefield 4,</em> will be added to <em>BF6</em> in a “future season.”</p> <p>“Golmud Railway is being rebuilt for today’s <em>Battlefield</em>, not simply ported forward,” explained the devs. “Our goal is to preserve what made the map so memorable in <em>Battlefield 4</em>, particularly its combined arms gameplay, while improving how it plays and supports<em> Battlefield 6</em> systems. Golmud Railway is planned to be the largest <em>Battlefield 6</em> map to date, giving us the opportunity to expand gameplay on a larger scale.”</p>

 <p>Since before <em>Battlefield 6</em> launched, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-data-confirms-smallest-maps-franchise-ea-fps-bf1-2000640803">fans have been asking for bigger maps</a> or <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-big-large-conquest-map-battle-royale-redsec-golf-course-2000641083">even creating their own using <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s battle royale map and in-game creation tools</a>. So it’s great to hear that EA and Battlefield Studios are working on a map that will be bigger than any of the current battlegrounds. Hopefully, fans won’t have to wait too long to get to play it. Maybe season three? We’ll have to wait and find out.</p>

 <h2><em>Redsec</em> solo mode update</h2> <p>Meanwhile, <em>Battlefield 6</em> devs confirmed that the Little Bird heli, which was featured in past <em>BF</em> games, will be added in season two. The devs also confirmed they are continuing to work on a solo queue for <em>Redsec</em>, <em>BF6</em>‘s battle royale mode. No release date was shared, and it seems like it could end up never happening if testing doesn’t work out. But for now, it seems like the studios involved in making <em>BF6</em> and <em>Redsec</em> are still working on the fan-requested feature.</p> <p>Here’s the dev’s full update:</p> <blockquote><p>We’re also continuing internal and exploratory testing around Battle Royale Solo play, as we evaluate how different player configurations impact pacing, balance, and the overall Battle Royale experience.</p> <p>This work is focused on understanding where Solo play can best fit within the broader Battle Royale roster, including how it affects match flow, survivability, and long-term engagement when featured alongside other Battle Royale experiences. These tests are part of our ongoing effort to make informed decisions about how Battle Royale is structured and presented over time, rather than committing to a single permanent configuration.</p></blockquote> <p><em>Battlefield 6′</em>s second free season arrives on all platforms on February 17, bringing new maps and, like season one, likely adding more content like new weapons, modes, cosmetics, and more.</p>
