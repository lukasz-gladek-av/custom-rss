              <p>Amazon is making it easier than ever to upgrade your laptop without blowing your budget. In fact, you don’t even need to spend more than $500 on a reliable device that’s ready to take on everyday tasks, multitasking, and even some light gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5021/">Right now, the 15.6-inch HP laptop is down to $499, after a steep 71% off its original price of nearly $1,700.</a> You’re saving an unbelievable $1,200, and this model is only $100 more than the entry-level version with 16GB RAM and 256GB storage. It’s also the lowest we’ve seen it drop to in 30 days. Act fast to grab yours, as the discount might wrap up anytime now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5021/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Responsive, Fast Performance for Work and Entertainment</h2>
<p>Looks-wise, it’s a classic HP laptop. You’re getting that sleek silver finish in a slim, portable frame. It’s lightweight enough to carry around all day without feeling like it’s dragging your shoulder down. Power-wise, though, it’s a whole different story.</p>
<p>The laptop is powered by an Intel N100 processor (quad-core, up to 3.4GHz) for responsive performance for all your tasks. It’s not built for heavy creative workloads, but it’ll handle most regular workdays without slowing you down. With the processor, you’ve got 32GB of RAM for efficient multitasking, plus a 1TB PCIe SSD that offers a huge space to store all that you own. It also runs on Windows 11 Pro, meaning you’ll get to work on one of the most user-friendly, efficient systems out there.</p>



<p>The 15.6-inch Full HD anti-glare display pushes detailed visuals that are easier on the eyes. Whether you’re working on presentations or watching a movie, picture quality stays vibrant and sharp. Battery life is just as impressive. Most of it will depend on how you use it, of course, but you can expect to get through a few hours without worrying about plugging it in.</p>
<p>You’re also getting a full set of modern connectivity options that include Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, USB-C, two USB-A ports, HDMI, a headphone/mic combo jack, and a smart AC power pin. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5021/">Considering how you’d normally pay over $1,000 for a device with all these features, grabbing the laptop for under $500 feels like a steal</a>. It’s got impressive visuals, a reliable processor, sufficient space, and much more at a discount. Again, we don’t expect the offer to last long, which is why it’s best to grab it sooner rather than later.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Report: Next Xbox Could Be The First Console To Kill The Multiplayer Paywall]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/next-gen-xbox-paid-multiplayer-game-pass-2000639263</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For over two decades, Microsoft has been charging Xbox owners anywhere from $4 to $10 a month for access to online multiplayer. The full suite of features was bundled as Xbox Live Gold and has since morphed into being part of Game Pass. The company is now reportedly exploring doing away with that fee for <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-pc-windows-rog-ally-2000638181">its next-gen console</a>, bringing it more in-line with PC gaming where the perk is provided by companies for free.</p> <p>According to a new report <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsofts-ambitious-new-xbox-your-entire-console-library-the-full-power-of-windows-pc-gaming-and-more">by<em> Windows Central</em></a>, the “current plan” is for the next Xbox to have no paywall for multiplayer. The outlet adds that “it remains to be seen if that plan actually plays out into reality,” but it sounds like there is at least serious consideration within Microsoft for abandoning the last remnants of its Xbox Live legacy with the arrival of the new system or systems which are currently <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-next-gen-xbox-price-specs-leak-release-date-2000635303">rumored to be releasing near the end of 2027</a>.</p>

 <p>It would be another seismic shift for the company’s gaming division which has long collected this multiplayer tax in exchange for the ability to play annual hits like <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Madden</em>, and <em>NBA2K </em>online. While it’s become standard to allow players on console to access free-to-play games without making them pay for platform memberships, forcing players to pay for online gameplay in premium titles like <em>Diablo 4</em>, <em>Mario Kart World</em>, and <em>Helldivers 2</em> has generated massive amounts of what feels like effectively passive income for the respective console makers.</p>

 <p>It’s unclear how many of Game Pass’ millions of subscribers are currently enrolled simply to play with friends online, but that benefit alone is responsible for a huge portion of the cost of the most expensive tier of the program. While Game Pass Ultimate for console users <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">was recently raised to $3</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">0</a>, the service is still just $16.50 on PC where <em>Sea of Thieves</em> and other live-service hits can all be played online for free. Ditching the multiplayer paywall on a more Windows PC-like next-gen Xbox would also require overhauling those pricing schemes.</p> <p>If the plan does go through, there will be two immediate questions: Why did Microsoft spend all of those previous years charging Xbox users for multiplayer? And how will Sony and Nintendo continue to justify charging for multiplayer on the upcoming PlayStation 6 and current Switch 2? Competition between platforms is good, and Microsoft providing valuable and meaningful alternatives in the future would be one way to help pressure both Sony and Nintendo into doing the same.</p>

              <p>The right speaker can bring life to any party, and even make those weekend solo sessions way more enjoyable. But you don’t have to spend big to get quality, room-filling sound paired with a solid battery life. If you’re in the market for a good Bluetooth speaker that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5022/">The Anker Soundcore 2 portable Bluetooth speaker is now down to just $28 on Amazon, after a massive 38% discount.</a> This deal only applies to the Black color, but some other options are discounted as well. Just note that the discount is a limited-time one, so we recommend acting fast to grab it. The retailer might be pushing the price back up sooner than you think!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5022/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Richer Sound, Both Indoor and Outdoor</h2>
<p>The build is truly portable and comes with a basic, no-fuss design. You’ll find all the controls at the top, so getting the party started is fairly simple. You’re getting dual 6W neodymium drivers that blast rich sound that captures all the highs and lows well. The BassUp technology offers more depth at all volume levels. You can crank it all the way up or keep it low-key for a self-care night. Either way, you’ll get clear sound without distortion.</p>
<p>The Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity offers a stable 66-foot range, which translates into clearer sound even when you’re not super close to the speaker. Prefer keeping things wired? There’s a built-in AUX port for plugging your devices. The battery life is just as solid; you’re looking at about 24 hours of playtime on a single charge. For reference, that’s going roughly 500 songs without worrying about plugging it in. Everyone’s favorite playlists get a chance!</p>



<p>The speaker is also rated for IPX7 waterproof, so it can handle a few splashes and light rain easily. You can take it to the beach, hang by the pool, or even bring it into the bathroom for a private shower concert. It also supports wireless stereo pairing, meaning you can pair two of these for bigger, wider sound if you’re planning to host larger gatherings.</p>
<p>All things considered, this is a great speaker for anyone looking to boost sound on a budget. It’s compact and easy to carry, plus it offers superior sound. Anker has made it outdoor-friendly, so it can handle dust and water quite well. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5022/">It’s down to just $28 right now, and definitely worth grabbing while the deal’s still live.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-m4-macbook-pro-is-being-pushed-onto-the-sales-rack-go-grab-one-now-2000639133</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-quietly-clears-out-the-m4-macbook-pro-with-hundreds-off-after-the-m5-launch.1335784/</guid>

              <p>Apple’s new-product drops are huge events, and understandably so. The debut of a new Apple device like the M5 laptop sends thousands and perhaps millions of people to stores to be the first to have it. But the more economical reaction is to start watching the price of the device it’s replacing: in this case, the M4 line of laptops. Sure enough, those prices are coming down — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5023/">Amazon is now selling the 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro for just $1,600</a>.</p>
<p>It’s not like the M4 MacBook Pro is some kind of dated or outmoded device — it debuted exactly one year ago, with all the bells, whistles, and accompanying hype we’re now seeing for the M5 models. And that hype has been totally justified — the average Amazon review of the M4 MacBook Pro is a stellar 4.8 out of 5 stars.</p>

<h2>A Thing of Beauty</h2>
<p>Apple products in general and MacBooks in particular have made their bones for years thanks in no small part to their exceptional design. Frankly, they’re just really good-looking machines. That of course would wear off quickly if they didn’t have anything going for them under the hood, but that’s never been the case with the MacBooks.</p>
<p>The display is where the true beauty lies with the M4 MacBook Pro, because it’s a 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR screen with up to 1600 nits of peak brightness that is simply stunning. Creative work like photo and video editing will never look better, nor will your streaming or video calls. There’s also never any worry about lag or glitching out, because the M4 chip and its integrated graphics driver are designed to deliver peak visuals.</p>



<h2>(Almost) the Latest</h2>
<p>Everything else in and about the M4 MacBook Pro is either Apple’s very latest tech and features, or close enough to it to still be about the best laptops on the market. First and foremost is Apple Intelligence, the advanced artificial intelligence assistant that is the perfect combination of power, speed, and security — not even Apple can see your searches or search history. When you start exploring Apple Intelligence, you won’t want to stop, and with the M4 MacBook Pro’s battery life extending almost 24 hours on a single charge, you won’t have to.</p>
<p>There’s no shame in your game if you’re a one-generation-ago shopper, especially when that previous-gen tech is only a year old and possessing nearly all of the features of its successor model. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5023/">That’s the deal that presents itself with the M4 MacBook Pro, because it’s worth every penny of its newly reduced $1,600 Amazon price.&nbsp;</a></p>
