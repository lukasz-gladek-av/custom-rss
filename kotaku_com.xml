As a result, most of the world is far behind the Chinese audience on story and character updates. Rather than letting most players lag behind, Atlus and developer Black Wings Game Studio have announced they’re speeding up the story rollout for other territories. This is a good thing for those who are worried about spoilers, but some players are concerned that an accelerated rollout might impact the broader gacha mechanics and meta.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196411,196394" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On July 9, Atlus held <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/live/CaXpbgEgWB4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/CaXpbgEgWB4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a livestream</a></span> to break down <em>The Phantom X</em>’s 1.1 update. The showcase covered some broad strokes like upcoming story content, new characters, and additional environments coming to the game.
