            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I haven’t seen the full </span><i><span>Wicked </span></i><span>stage play, but I was already well aware of the twists and turns we’d see in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wicked-2-for-good-trailer-elphaba-glinda-boq-tin-man-2000628205"><i><span>Wicked: For Good</span></i><span>.</span></a><span> The musical sequel covers the events of the play’s second act, and it includes several direct ties to the original </span><i><span>Wizard of Oz</span></i><span> story. As such, I was braced for it to reveal the brainless Scarecrow, but I was not prepared for how the guy would actually look when on screen, and neither were most people, it seems, as the reveal has caught fans off guard.</span></p>  <p><span>In the </span><i><span>Wicked </span></i><span>continuity, Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jonathan-bailey-sexiest-man-alive-people-final-fantasy-2000641145"><i><span>People</span></i><span>’s Sexiest Man Alive</span></a><span>), the carefree prince who starts growing a conscious after he meets Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), becomes the Scarecrow. He starts off as a dashing, charismatic narcissist, but as Fiyero grows to care for Elphaba and her battle for animal rights, he turns against the Wizard’s fascist regime and becomes a fugitive with the Wicked Witch.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Later in the film, he is captured by the Wizard’s guards and tortured. Elphaba, desperate to save her lover, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTv_FrdBQ6A&amp;pp=ygUTd2lja2VkIG5vIGdvb2QgZGVlZA%3D%3D"><span>casts a spell to keep him from dying or feeling any pain</span></a><span>. We don’t see Fiyero’s face for almost the entirety of the second half of the movie because </span><i><span>For Good </span></i><span>goes out of its way to obscure it and hide his identity, but we unknowingly see the back of his head a few times. That’s because Elphaba’s spell turned him into the Scarecrow who accompanies Dorothy in </span><i><span>The Wizard of Oz</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>We don’t actually see Fiyero as the Scarecrow until the final moments of </span><i><span>For Good</span></i><span>, and while an eagle-eyed </span><i><span>Wizard of Oz </span></i><span>fan may have caught onto this twist when he was strung up on a cross in a cornfield during Elphaba’s spell, plenty of first-time viewers were genuinely shocked by this reveal, not only because of Fiyero’s dark fate, but because Bailey straight up looks like a patched together version of Ryan Reynolds in his Scarecrow look.</span></p>       <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">My entire theater burst out laughing when they saw the Scarecrow's design</p> <p>— 5 DAYS UNTIL DON CHEADLE'S BIRTHDAY (@Schaffrillas) <a href="https://twitter.com/Schaffrillas/status/1991721384129777945?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">out mogged the wicked for good scarecrow <a href="https://t.co/CHKems9MTo">pic.twitter.com/CHKems9MTo</a></p> <p>— 👹 (@tummyhxrts) <a href="https://twitter.com/tummyhxrts/status/1992245081273991321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>    <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">also happy to report fiyero looks chopped asf as the scarecrow like even tin man boq is out mugging him <a href="https://t.co/lrDdCGEHAQ">pic.twitter.com/lrDdCGEHAQ</a></p> <p>— gelphie conquers all (@aIicentinchains) <a href="https://twitter.com/aIicentinchains/status/1990796884131426684?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>While some might be unsettled by Fiyero’s new face, others aren’t going to let some straw and burlap keep them from </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHed_tTvyhI"><span>recreating that one scene from </span><i><span>Pearl</span></i></a><span>.

Nevertheless, thirst finds a way.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-extract-rat-elevator-revive-defib-2000646958</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Extraction shooters are eager to take everything away from you. And though <i>Arc Raiders</i> has proven to be a more friendly approach with its multiple paths of progression, dying at the end of a successful run still sucks. Getting pushed 99 percent of the way to failure and then surviving, however, is a feeling like no other.</p> <p>As more folks pour into <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ servers to hopefully extract and craft their way to glory, they’re capturing epic victories snatched from the jaws of defeat and sharing them as reminders that even when you think you’re about to lose everything, luck (or a guardian angel) can always intervene.</p>

 <p>Last night, I came across one such clip from a few days ago of what would seem to be an unfortunate PvP instance during a Night Raid (usually a preem opportunity to score some great loot if you know where to look) suddenly turned on its head:</p>

   <p>Gunned down by a rando, Reddit user Over_here_vibin prepares to get sent back home with nothing to show for it. Then his assailant gets sniped in the head literally out of nowhere. Turns out, some folks must’ve been watching nearby and were quick to put down the threat while also escorting Over_here_vibin to extraction.</p>

 <p>Fun fact learned from this video? If you don’t have a defib to revive a stranger, you can use bandages to temporarily stabilize them, which is often enough to see someone successfully get out.</p> <p>Humans aren’t your only potential allies, though. As <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-karma-doesnt-get-any-sweeter-than-this-extract-camper-gets-a-spoonful-of-justice-from-bots-accidentally-saves-his-would-be-victim-and-misses-his-own-extraction/">spotted by <i>Games Radar</i></a>, another fantastic clip sees someone gunned down literally as they’re standing in the elevator. If you’ve played any amount of <i>Arc Raiders</i>, then you know getting shot in the elevator is literally one of the worst feelings (especially as it often happens right as the doors are closing, meaning your assailant doesn’t even have time to loot your body and just offed you seemingly just for the fun of it).</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is Beautiful ❤️ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ArcRaiders?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ArcRaiders</a> <br>🎥RedRiser <a href="https://t.co/RkAYVow0rL">pic.twitter.com/RkAYVow0rL</a></p> <p>— ARC Now (@ArcRaidersNow) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcRaidersNow/status/1991792146995986490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>As luck would have it, a Rocketeer (one of the most menacing of airborne threats in the game thus far) not only interrupts the execution animation, but knocks the assailant out of the elevator with a rocket, downing them in the process. While it is possible the assailant might’ve been able to crawl over and call in a new elevator, it’s likely their decision to shoot someone in the back led to their loss.</p> <p>My feeds are full of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RescueRaiders/comments/1ovl0bh/got_rescued_today_was_this_one_of_you/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">situations like this</a>. It just goes to show that, until the game literally sends you back to Speranza, don’t give up. A friendly human, or Arc, might just save the day.</p>   <p>Oh, and if you run solos, please carry defibs for your fellow Raiders!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-kicks-off-black-friday-week-with-an-all-time-low-price-on-the-m5-ipad-pro-2000646585</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-goes-margin-blind-with-the-m5-ipad-pro-as-black-friday-brings-an-unprecedented-drop-for-its-newly-released-tablet.1363039/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Picking up the M5 iPad Pro for the first time should come with a wary bystander asking, “are you sure you can handle this thing,” as if you were sliding into the driver’s seat of an F1 race car. The amount of power under the hood of the newest iPad Pro is&nbsp;<em>that</em> significant, and with Black Friday week kicking off, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5870/">Amazon is handing you the keys to the 13-inch version with a first-ever $100 price drop to $1,195.</a></p>
<p>Fortunately, learning how to harness all of the crazy amount of power and features of the M5 iPad Pro won’t end with you pancaked into a wall. If anything, you won’t be able to put it down once you see just what the upgrade to the M5 chip — the very same one found in the newest MacBooks — has done for the iPad Pro. Everything from editing 4K video, precision art creation, and heavy-duty gaming is now firmly on the table.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5870/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>More Than Enough</h2>
<p>The best reviews on iPads or any tablets has always been that they’re “good enough” to take on visually challenging or work-intensive tasks normally done by laptops or desktops. The M5 iPad Pro isn’t merely “good enough” to be your primary device for streaming, photo editing, content creation, number-crunching, or anything else — it handles them all as easily as virtually any laptop.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the M5 iPad Pro falls in line with pretty much every iPad ever made by having an industry-best display. The 13-inch screen is a Liquid Retina XDR thing of beauty, and it’s not going to lag or glitch out on you while you stream or edit videos or play an action game, thanks to the GPU built into the M5 chip.</p>
<p>Take a deeper dive into the Apple ecosystem by adding the Apple Pencil Pro and Magic Keyboard folio (both sold separately) and you have a truly formidable touchscreen laptop, but one that runs the clean, silky-smooth iPadOS 26, updated with Liquid Glass design, helpful widgets and improved interaction with the Apple Pencil.</p>



<h2>Best iPad Ever?</h2>
<p>Need more power? Take Apple Intelligence out for a spin to help you create and execute pro-level workflows, and the iPad Pro’s Neural Accelerators will have them up and running in no time. Browsing or streaming speed? This iPad Pro can run Wi-Fi 7 with Apple’s brand-new N1 chip to deliver stunning online speed. The landscape 12MP front camera and 12MP rear camera are top notch, and when you combine them with the elite-level built-in mics and speakers, your FaceTime calls and videoconferencing will be the best ever delivered by any iPad. There’s also a USB-C port that lets you connect to an external Thunderbolt or USB 4 monitor.</p>
<p>Call it a race car, a thoroughbred, a rocket, or any other analogy you want, and the M5 iPad Pro lives up to it. Simply put, it’s Apple’s best and by&nbsp;<em>far</em> most powerful tablet yet, and it should be at the very top of the Black Friday list for anyone who wants it all when it comes to portable smart-device power. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5870/">Hit Amazon now and grab the 13-inch M5 iPad Pro while it’s at an all-time low price of $1,195.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Players, Please Capture Control Points]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-players-please-capture-control-points-2000646929</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-players-please-capture-control-points.1363036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Later this week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-free-week-star-wars-fan-film-exodus-leaks-bf6-2000646871#:~:text=Battlefield%206%E2%80%B2,royale%20spin%2Doff."><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s conquest mode and some of its maps</a> will be free to play across all platforms. That means an influx of new players. So now seems like a good time to ask everyone, even the people already playing EA’s blockbuster online FPS, to please capture control points in Conquest. Please. I’m begging you.</p>

 <p>I’ve been playing a lot of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em> since it launched in October</a>. And I’ve had a great time with it. The FPS is easily my favorite <em>Battlefield</em> in a few years and will likely be a game I return to a lot in 2026. But whenever I play Conquest, <a href="https://battlefield.fandom.com/wiki/Conquest">the franchise’s iconic mode</a> that’s been around since the OG <em>Battlefield 1942</em>, I get frustrated by how many players seem not to understand the point of the mode. That point being: Capture control points, hold and defend them, and if needed, take them back from the enemy. Hold more points, and your team will win faster. Let them control the battlefield, and you’ll lose just as quickly.</p>

 <p>Sounds simple enough, yet I’ve lost a Conquest match and skimmed the scoreboard afterward countless times, just to spot half or more of my team with zero captures.</p>  <p>Now, I understand that some people are sniping and aren’t capping points. Fine. And some are using tanks and aircraft to support the team and won’t have as many captures as some other players or me. I get that, too. My problem is that so many players who aren’t sniping or using tanks seem to just… not take control points.</p>

 <p>I’ve watched players run into the first control point at the start of a match and capture it, then just run around the next one, never going in to cap it or help their team hold it. These aren’t snipers either, but support or assault players. Other times, I see people run to an enemy base, help fight and clear it, and then leave when it’s neutralized but not fully capped. Or some players will cap a base and then never leave it.</p> <p>I don’t care if you only get three kills. I don’t care if you a dozen times. As long as you are helping our team cap points, push forward when it makes sense, and fall back when needed to defend, I’ll be happy. And you’ll likely get more XP and be higher up on the scoreboard, too, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-new-map-review-good-eastwood-big-large-ps5-pc-2000645547"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> greatly rewards teamplay and objective support over kills. So help your team win, get to the top of the leaderboard, and have a fun time by capturing control points in <em>Battlefield 6</em>, okay? Please.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-decided-money-doesnt-matter-q10-s5-robot-vacuum-drops-50-off-with-10000pa-suction-2000646915</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-decided-money-doesn%E2%80%99t-matter-q10-s5-robot-vacuum-drops-50-off-with-10-000pa-suction.1363030/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock has become the premium brand in robot vacuums with their latest flagships such as <em>Qrevo CurvX</em>&nbsp;and <em>Saros 10R</em>&nbsp;crossing the $1,000 threshold even with Black Friday discounts. But here’s the thing: t<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/">he Roborock Q5 S10+ is currently sitting at an all-time low of $259 on Amazon, down from its original $549 price tag</a>, and it’s flying off the shelves. This model packs serious technology into a mid-range package – think <strong>10,000Pa suction power, a self-emptying station that holds 70 days worth of debris, and a sonic mopping system that scrubs 3,000 times per minute</strong>. The kind of deal that makes you wonder if someone in Roborock’s pricing department made a mistake.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best in Class Vacuum Cleaner</h2>
<p>First of all, the 10,000Pa suction power puts this vacuum in the <strong>same league as models costing twice as much</strong>. That level of suction pulls embedded pet hair out of carpet fibers, grabs crumbs from hardwood floor crevices, and handles the kind of everyday mess that accumulates a lot quicker than you’d like to admit. The HyperForce technology behind this suction isn’t just a marketing term: it’s the difference between a robot that pushes debris around and one that actually removes it.</p>
<p>The self-emptying station completely changes the way you interact with the vacuum. You are looking at a 2.7L dust bag, able to hold up to 70 days of dirt and debris, which essentially means that you can forget about emptying for over two months. This is where pet owners will appreciate it more than anyone because pet hair fills up the standard robot vacuum bins in a matter of days. The <strong>station will automatically empty the robot after each cleaning session</strong>&nbsp;so you’ll never need to deal with those pesky clouds of dust or tangled hair when manually emptying a bin.</p>



<p>The <strong>VibraRise 2.0 mopping system</strong> is where this vacuum starts to feel like a premium product. Dual-zone sonic vibration scrubs floors up to 3,000 times per minute, which is enough force to handle dried spills and stuck-on messes that regular robot mops just smear around. The mopping module automatically lifts 8mm when it detects carpet, so you’re not dealing with wet carpets or having to manually remove mop pads before running a cleaning cycle. You can adjust mopping intensity through the app depending on how dirty your floors are, giving you control without requiring manual intervention.</p>
<p>The smart carpet detection uses ultrasonic technology to identify when the vacuum moves onto carpet from hard floors. Detecting carpet, it lifts the mopping modules and automatically increases suction power for a deeper cleaning. This dual response ensures that the carpets get the aggressive cleaning they require while protecting them from water damage. It’s reliable enough that you can run cleaning cycles while away from home with no fear of returning to soaked rugs.</p>



<p>Navigation on this vacuum relies on PreciSense LiDAR technology which scans 360° to create detailed maps of your home. The system supports multi-level mapping, meaning if you have a two-story house, the vacuum remembers the layout of both floors and can plan efficient cleaning routes for each level. With ReactiveTech obstacle avoidance, structured light technology is used to detect objects in real time and navigate around them, meaning fewer situations where it gets stuck and more complete cleaning coverage without needing to pre-clean before the robot vacuum cleans.</p>
<p>At $259, this vacuum delivers technology that was reserved for $500+ models just a couple of years ago. Roborock’s reputation for build quality means you’re not sacrificing reliability to hit this price point, and the fact that it’s selling in huge volumes on Amazon suggests plenty of people have figured out this is an unusually good value.</p>
