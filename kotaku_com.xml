            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Spending $250 on AirPods Pro makes sense for some people, but plenty of situations call for something more affordable and practical. Anker earns enough trust from Apple to sell its products directly in Apple Stores which speaks volumes about build quality and reliability from a brand that consistently delivers excellent audio gear at prices that seem almost too good.</p>
<p>The <strong>Soundcore V20i open-ear headphones</strong> normally retail at $49 (already reasonable compared to premium alternatives) <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5182/">but Amazon just slashed the price to $23 for early Black Friday</a>. This represents <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5182/">an all-time low and a 53% discount</a> on earbuds that solve a specific problem: giving you audio without blocking out the world around you.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5182/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The open-ear design <strong>positions the 16mm drivers just outside your ear canal</strong> rather than sealing inside it, and creates a fundamentally different listening experience that<strong> prioritizes environmental awareness over total immersion</strong>. This matters immensely during activities like running, cycling, or walking in urban environments where hearing approaching vehicles, other pedestrians, or important announcements keeps you safe.</p>
<p>The titanium-coated diaphragms in those 16mm drivers deliver surprisingly robust bass response through Soundcore’s BassUp technology which analyzes your audio in real time and enhances low frequencies without distortion. The adjustable ear hooks rotate through four distinct positions and lets you find the exact angle that balances comfort with secure fit based on your unique ear shape.</p>



<h2>All-Day Comfort</h2>
<p>Traditional earbuds cause pressure points and can be very uncomfortable after a few hours of wear, especially for individuals with small ear canals or sensitivities to in-ear designs. The V20i solves this through its non-intrusive architecture and rests against your ear rather than inserting into it, hence <strong>banishing that plugged-up feeling and letting your ears breathe during extended listening sessions</strong>. The lightweight construction adds minimal weight to your head, making these genuinely comfortable for all-day wear during work, commutes, or marathon study sessions. With <strong>an IP55 certificate</strong>, it provides protection from sweat, light rain, and dust exposure, so you can wear these during workouts or outdoor activities without concern about moisture damage.</p>



<p>When you factor in the charging case, <strong>this goes up to a total of 36 hours of playtime</strong> or about a week of regular daily use until you have to plug in. Bluetooth 5.4 is the latest wireless standard, featuring improved connection stability, lower latency for video and better power efficiency compared to previous versions. The added multipoint connection allows you to <strong>connect these earbuds to two devices at once</strong> so you can seamlessly go from listening to tunes on your laptop to taking calls on your phone without having to manually reconnect.</p>
<p>At $23 down from $49, these Soundcore V20i earbuds cost less than most wired headphones but offer wireless convenience, situational awareness, and real audio quality. Anker’s reputation for durability and the massive customer review count suggest these earbuds will survive daily use far longer than the bargain price implies. That makes this early Black Friday deal one of those rare times where cheap really does mean value, not compromise.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-monster-laptop-64-gb-ram-2-tb-ssd-hits-mid-range-pricing-after-amazons-massive-2300-price-cut-2000640236</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hp-monster-laptop-64-gb-ram-2-tb-ssd-hits-mid-range-pricing-after-amazon%E2%80%99s-massive-2-300-price-cut.1339963/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Laptops rarely drop more than $2000, especially ones packing the kind of specs that make power users drool. The Hp 17 Business Laptop just crashed to $999 on Amazon, down from its typical $3,299 price tag, and this represents an all-time low that catches attention. Hp kicked off its Black Friday deals early on Amazon though the company’s official site hasn’t followed suit yet, and this configuration with 64GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD delivers professional-grade performance at a price that usually buys mid-range machines with half the memory and storage. You’re looking at a laptop that handles heavy multitasking, video editing, and data-intensive work without breaking a sweat or your budget.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5134/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Power Behind Those Numbers Makes Sense</h2>
<p>The hybrid architecture 13th Generation <strong>Intel Core i5-1334U processor handles work intelligently</strong> between two high-performance cores and eight efficient cores. Those <strong>performance cores clock up to 4.6GHz</strong> when you need maximum speed for demanding applications while the efficient cores handle background tasks and lighter workloads to preserve battery life. In essence, this means you can run virtual machines, edit 4K video, compile code and have dozens of browser tabs open at the same time without everything slowing down to a crawl.</p>



<p>That<strong> 64GB of DDR4 RAM at 3200MHz turns this into a multitasking monster</strong> that professionals actually need: video editors scrubbing through multiple 4K timelines without rendering previews, data analysts loading massive datasets into memory for instant querying and developers spinning up multiple Docker containers or virtual machines without the dreaded ‘out of memory’ warnings popping up. The <strong>2TB PCIe SSD provides storage space</strong> that meets real-world needs and fits years of project files, photo libraries and application installs while delivering read speeds of up to 15 times faster than traditional hard drives.</p>
<p>The <strong>17.3-inch Full HD display (1920×1080 resolution)</strong> offers screen real estate that eliminates constant window-switching and provides the opportunity for practical side-by-side document comparison. The narrow bezels maximize the viewing area without making the laptop’s footprint too wide, while an anti-glare coating means you can work near windows without fighting reflections. It’s bright enough at 250 nits to remain readable in most lighting conditions; direct sunlight still presents some challenges but it does on most laptops.</p>



<p>It comes <strong>preinstalled with Windows 11 Pro</strong> and ads business-focused features that the Home editions lack. Remote Desktop functionality lets you access this machine from anywhere with an internet connection, BitLocker encryption protects sensitive data in case the laptop is lost or stolen, and advanced group policy controls are helpful for IT departments managing security settings. Several USB ports-including one USB-C-an HDMI output for external displays, and an SD card reader round out the connectivity options needed daily by business users.</p>
<p>This is the best deal available on a laptop with these specs. If you’re looking for a powerhouse, this is it.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/if-you-own-an-iphone-this-dji-gimbal-stabilizer-costs-pennies-and-films-like-hollywood-2000640317</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/if-you-own-an-iphone-this-dji-gimbal-stabilizer-costs-pennies-and-films-like-hollywood.1339948/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Your iPhone already has optical image stabilization built in but try filming while walking and you’ll quickly notice those micro-jitters and shakes that make your videos look amateurish. The DJI Osmo Mobile 7 solves this problem with <strong>professional-grade 3-axis gimbal stabilization</strong> that counteracts every movement in real time and delivers the kind of smooth footage you see in actual films. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5181/">Originally $89, this gimbal drops to $75 on Amazon right now</a>, which marks an all-time low for early Black Friday shoppers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5181/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>It works via <strong>mechanical stabilization that’s independent of the digital system in your phone</strong>, basically three separate motors that work non-stop to adjust the position of the gimbal to compensate for hand movements, bumps and abrupt directional changes. These create <strong>footage that looks professionally shot</strong>&nbsp;even when you’re running upstairs or downstairs, or tracking a subject moving at high speeds.</p>
<p><strong>Coming in at just 300 grams</strong>, the Osmo Mobile 7 weighs less than most water bottles, has an ergonomic handle with anti-slip grip and remains comfortable even during extended shooting sessions. Meanwhile, an integrated foldable design collapses down to a compact 179x95x39mm size that easily slips into a backpack or large jacket pocket, and a built-in tripod deploys instantly for static shots or time-lapses without needing separate equipment.</p>



<h2>Intelligent Tracking That Works</h2>
<p>ActiveTrack 7.0 is the latest subject-tracking technology from DJI which uses complex algorithms to <strong>recognize and follow people, pets, or objects</strong> even through complex movements and crowded environments. This <em>Dual-Lens</em> enhanced tracking works by simultaneously leveraging both your phone’s main and secondary cameras to create a more accurate depth map so that the gimbal holds focus even on fast, close-up action shots. That means you can film yourself skateboarding, dancing or demo-ing products while the gimbal automatically pans and tilts to keep you centered in the frame without the need for a camera operator.</p>



<p>The DJI Mimo app makes this hardware a fully realized mobile production studio with features like <em>ShotGuides</em>&nbsp;which analyzes your environment and suggests specific camera movements and compositions used in professional cinematography. <em>One-Tap Edit</em> automatically assembles your footage into polished videos with transitions, music, and effects based on the content you capture, shaving hours off editing time and condensing it to minutes. The app provides <strong>manual controls for ISO, shutter speed, and white balance</strong> should you want granular creative control plus specialized modes like Slow Motion, Hyperlapse and Panorama that leverage the gimbal’s precise movement capabilities.</p>



<p>It makes for <strong>up to 10 hours of continuous operation on a single charge</strong>&nbsp;which means you can easily get a full day of content creation or event coverage without needing to stop and recharge. The <strong>USB-C port serves double duty by charging your phone while you film</strong>, and alleviates the problem of intensive video recording completely draining your device’s battery mid-shoot. The magnetic phone clamp attaches and detaches in a matter of seconds, utilizing firm magnets that hold your device secure even as you move around most aggressively but enable you to quickly switch between devices or to go handheld.</p>
<p>At $75 down from $89, this is the lowest price we’ve tracked for the Osmo Mobile 7, and these early Black Friday deals on DJI products have a history of selling out quickly once inventory starts moving.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dell Quietly Offloads 1TB 16-Inch Laptops, Now Nearly Free at 71% Off on Amazon]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/dell-quietly-offloads-1tb-16-inch-laptops-now-nearly-free-at-71-off-on-amazon-2000640311</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell-quietly-offloads-1tb-16-inch-laptops-now-nearly-free-at-71-off-on-amazon.1339942/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are laptops you dream about but never actually buy because they sit in that untouchable price bracket reserved for professionals with corporate budgets. Normally retailing for $3,399, this Dell Inspiron 16″ laptop, 32 GB of DDR5 RAM, and a full terabyte of storage, is just that kind of aspirational machine.</p>
<p>But here’s where things take a very interesting turn for early Black Friday shoppers: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5179/">Amazon just dropped this powerhouse to $999, representing a staggering 71% discount</a> and marking an <strong>all-time low price</strong> for this configuration. This isn’t some refurbished model or a stripped-down version: you’re looking at a full-spec business laptop with Windows 11 Pro, and at this price point, it won’t last long before inventory disappears.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5179/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Dell built this “Inspiron 16” around an Intel Core 7 150U processor which <strong>packs in 10 cores and 12 threads that can smartly scale up to as high as 5.4 GHz</strong> based on your workload. That means this laptop changes its performance dynamically and give you serious processing power for video editing or data crunching while staying efficient for lighter tasks such as browsing or working on documents.</p>
<p>The accompanying <strong>32 GB of DDR5 RAM easily allows multiple demanding applications</strong> to run simultaneously without that frustrating lag in switching between Chrome tabs, Photoshop projects and Excel spreadsheets. That 1 TB PCIe NVMe SSD doesn’t just provide enormous storage capacity but also transfers at blazing speeds and allows your system to boot in just seconds and large files to move in near-instant timing.</p>



<h2>A Display That Improves Your Workday</h2>
<p>The <strong>16-inch FHD+ touchscreen deserves its own spotlight</strong> because Dell has made some smart choices here. The 1920×1200 resolution adopts a 16:10 aspect ratio instead of the traditional 16:9 and translates to more vertical screen real estate while navigating documents and web pages without needing to scroll so much. This display stays clearly visible even in well-lit offices or by the window with a brightness of 300 nits.</p>
<p>Dell has also integrated <em>ComfortView Plus</em> technology which reduces hazardous blue light emission without that weird yellow tint you get with cheaper filters; it makes those long sessions easier on your eyes. The <strong>touchscreen adds another layer of interaction</strong> that becomes surprisingly useful as soon as you get used to it, specifically when doing quick edits or getting through the touch-optimized interface of Windows 11.</p>



<p>The practical features extend to everyday usability, ways that make this much more than just another laptop but a real productivity machine. The full-size backlit keyboard includes a dedicated numeric keypad that anyone who works with numbers regularly will immediately appreciate. That ice blue backlighting isn’t for looks; it makes typing in dim environments or during evening work sessions significantly easier without eye strain. <strong>Windows 11 Pro brings enterprise-grade security features</strong>&nbsp;while the integrated fingerprint reader adds biometric protection that’s much safer and far more convenient than continuously punching in passwords.</p>
<p>Right now, you can essentially get flagship specifications at mid-range pricing since this is a laptop that usually sells for over three grand. Dell clearly priced it to move inventory fast ahead of Black Friday, and those kinds of early deals rarely stick around once word starts getting out.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/garmin-clears-out-forerunner-255-now-selling-for-peanuts-in-early-black-friday-sale-2000640217</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/garmin-clears-out-forerunner-255-now-selling-for-peanuts-in-early-black-friday-sale.1339921/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Running requires commitment and you need a watch that keeps up with your training goals without draining your wallet or dying mid-marathon, and the <strong>Garmin Forerunner 255 delivers</strong> exactly that combo of reliability and performance. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5133/">dropped the price to just $279, down from the usual $349,</a> which makes this one of those rare moments where a premium running watch becomes accessible. The Forerunner 255 brings serious training tools that adapt to your performance, recover alongside you, and guide you through race preparation with the kind of intelligence previously reserved for much pricier models.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5133/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The battery life alone distinguishes this watch from the sea of devices that require charging every other day: You <strong>get 14 days of smartwatch use in between charges</strong>, which means you can spend more time training and less time looking for cables. That goes up to <strong>30 hours of continuous GPS tracking</strong> in GPS mode so ultra-runners and adventurers can take on the longest events without battery anxiety setting in.</p>
<h2>Your Body Knows When It Needs Rest</h2>
<p>Recovery drives performance just as much as hard training does, and the Forerunner 255 tracks that balance through HRV Status monitoring. Heart rate variability measurements happen automatically during sleep, analyzing how your body responds to training stress and daily life. The morning report consolidates everything into one snapshot when you wake up – your sleep quality, recovery status, and a personalized workout suggestion based on where you stand.</p>



<p>The fourth-generation Elevate optical heart rate sensor is more accurate than its predecessors, and reads directly from your wrist with fewer random spikes or dropouts. Multi-band GPS technology uses signals from multiple satellite frequencies to calculate your position with much better precision, particularly in demanding environments such as dense city blocks or forested trails. Tests showed this dual-frequency approach corrects signal bounce issues that plague standard GPS watches, keeping route maps accurate even when buildings or trees surround you. At <strong>49 grams for the 46mm version</strong> (39 grams for the smaller 41mm model), it’s light enough during a run that you tend to forget you’re even wearing it but with enough heft to feel durable.</p>
<p>Training plans change according to your real performance and do not follow a rigid schedule without considering how you feel: The Forerunner 255 offers personalized <strong>daily workout suggestions that adjust after each run</strong> based on your completion times, effort levels and recovery needs. Race predictions estimate your finish time for 5K, 10K, half-marathon and marathon distances by looking at your current fitness level, typical training paces and even weather conditions on race day.</p>



<p>The multisport profiles transform this from a running-only device to a triathlon companion. <strong>Swimming metrics include stroke detection and SWOLF scores for pool sessions</strong> while open water swimming tracks your path across lakes or ocean. Cycling profiles record power data when paired with compatible meters, and the watch automatically detects when you transition between sports during brick workouts or races. Water resistance extends to 5 ATM (50 meters) so showers, pool sessions, and rainy runs pose no threat to the electronics.</p>
<p>This is our favorite early Black Friday deal on a smartwatch, it might run out of stock very soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>People online seem tired of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-crossover-skins-rick-morty-call-of-duty-1851786919">crossover skins and silly cosmetics</a> in games like <em>Call of Duty </em>and <em>Battlefield.</em> And now one of the lead devs behind online shooter <em>Arc Raiders</em> has promised that you won’t see Santa Claus or dinosaur outfits in the newly released live-service game.</p> <p>The latest big hit on Steam is multiplayer extraction shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879"><em>Arc Raiders</em></a>. It launched on October 30 on consoles and PC and <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-steam-ai-server-connection-error-launch-2000640110">quickly racked up over 200k concurrent players on Steam</a>. And being an online game in 2025 means offering up cosmetics for players to earn or purchase. <em>Arc Raiders</em> is no exception, selling players skins if they so desire. But this year has also marked a turning point online in regard to in-game cosmetics. Players seem less willing to put up with silly crossover skins and goofy cosmetics. This has led to a whole ongoing skin saga involving <em>Battlefield 6</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-goofy-skins-call-of-duty-nicki-minaj-2000614447">which has promised not to include those kinds of items</a>, and <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-skins-black-ops-7-blops-6-carry-over-battlefield-6-2000620379">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>,</em> which arguably <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912">started the backlash</a> we are seeing and has backpedaled on allowing silly skins from <em>BLOPS6</em> to move forward into the upcoming FPS. And now the design director for <em>Arc Raiders</em> has weighed in on the topic and claimed the team is “protective” of the shooter’s visual identity.</p>

 <p>“What I believe to be true is that we will maintain the current aesthetic that we have,” <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/skins-cosmetics-interview"><em>Arc Raiders</em> design director Virgil Watkins told <em>PCgamesN</em></a> when asked about silly skins. “[Cosmetics] will fit within our sensibilities of how these things look and fit within the world and inside the fiction.” And while the devs and artists at Embark want to provide players with “as much freedom as possible” to express themselves, there are limits.</p>

 <p>“I think it was said a little while ago in a meeting [that] we would never, say, make a Santa Claus outfit,” explained Watkins.</p> <p>“But we may make something that is of our own tone and our own aesthetic that evokes Santa Claus. That’s not even a statement that we will have a Santa Claus outfit, but I think that’s kind of the line you can draw. We’re pretty protective of making sure that anything that goes into the game fits within the visual identity, fits within the tone, fits within the setting. I think because so much of our game is strong around that element, it would be really unfortunate to upset that by injecting, I don’t know, a T-Rex costume running around suddenly – I don’t think the novelty is worth the trade.”</p>

  <p>Watkins’ answer highlights the problem of trying to walk the line between not disrupting your game’s visual identity while also still offering skins people are willing to buy. This is a problem <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-season-one-small-map-battle-royale-reactions-negative-review-ea-2000639948"><em>Battlefield 6</em> is facing right now as it enters its first season.</a> While many of the skins added to the game in the recent update look pretty realistic to me, many other players online are furious about all the colors. One skin even had its neon green toned down after players complained enough. While that might be seen as a victory for some, it leads to a strange situation where other players might not want to buy the game’s battle pass or spend money on new skins because they’re too boring or plain.</p> <p>Threading that needle is proving tricky for EA, will likely be challenging for <em>Black Ops 7</em>, and I suspect it will be a problem for<em> Arc Raiders,</em> too. <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-battlefield-6-skin-is-causing-community-meltdown-grounded-ea-2000638294">All it takes is one skin to be a bit too silly</a> or colorful, and suddenly, the community might turn on you and use your own words against you. Good luck to all devs working on live-service games in 2025. It sounds like a nightmare.</p>
