              <p>A gremlin in Bungie’s backend was briefly trying to <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-runner-shells-trailer-abilities-bungie-2000660170">upsell <em>Marathon</em> players</a> on copies of<em> Destiny 2</em>. Players who tried to pre-order the upcoming extraction shooter ended up with <em>Destiny 2</em> sneaking onto their hard drives as well in what is one of the weirder digital installation bugs I’ve ever heard of.</p> <p>We know this was happening because Bungie publicly addressed it on X. “We’ve resolved an issue where<em> Destiny 2</em> would begin installing after pre-ordering <em>Marathon</em> on Steam,” the studio <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/2013752445231305147">wrote</a>. “We have also resolved an issue where Collector’s Edition owners would receive an error when attempting to activate their game code on Steam.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We've resolved an issue where Destiny 2 would begin installing after pre-ordering Marathon on Steam. We have also resolved an issue where Collector's Edition owners would receive an error when attempting to activate their game code on Steam.</p> <p>— Marathon Development Team (@MarathonDevTeam) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/2013752445231305147?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But that hasn’t stopped players from having a field day with the mere idea that Bungie wanted so desperately to enroll new players in its sci-fi loot shooter that it was forcibly installing <em>Destiny 2</em> on people’s computers like a cracked rom site virus.&nbsp;“<em>Marathon</em> used so many <em>Destiny 2</em> assets that it automatically downloaded the game when people pre-ordered <em>Marathon</em>,” joked one person. “<em>Marathon</em> comes with malware,” joked another.</p> <p>While Bungie didn’t explain why this happened, it probably has something to do with the pre-order bonuses. Buying <em>Marathon</em> ahead of <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-trailer-leak-bungie-2000660975">its March 5 launch date</a> gives players free cosmetics for <em>Destiny 2</em>. Maybe a bug in the files was making it so the loot shooter would auto-download in order to register those rewards. Whatever the reason, it’s fixed now. <em>Destiny 2</em>, on the other hand, still not great.</p>

              <p>Ready to cut the cord and enjoy a hands-free, convenient viewing experience? A good streaming media player can help. Amazon’s Fire series features some of the best out there for users of all needs and budgets, and the retail giant is currently making the upgrade easy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/">You can now pick the latest Fire TV Cube at a rare 21% discount at Amazon. This brings its price down to just $110.</a> If you have an older model lying around, you can trade it in for an additional 20% discount. Your purchase will also come with a one-month trial to the Xbox GamePass if you’re a new user, which sweetens the offer even more. The discount is selling out fast, though. If you’ve been looking for an easy way of streaming better, now is your chance to upgrade for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easier Navigation</h2>
<p>Featuring the new octa-core 2.0 GHz processor, the Fire TV Cube packs impressive performance in a compact build. It’s twice as powerful as the high-rated and widely loved Fire TV Stick 4K Max, letting you search for stuff and navigate around a lot more easily. There’s Wi-Fi 6E support for smoother 4K streaming with less interference from other household devices, which translates into better speeds and lower latency. It also supports Dolby Vision, HDR, and Dolby Atmos audio. These come together to offer an immersive viewing experience for all your favorite shows and movies. Expect lifelike visuals for both all-time classics and latest releases, plus clearer audio and better dialogue.</p>
<p>Speaking of content, you’ll never be out of stuff to watch. The cube lets you stream more than 1.8 million movies and TV episodes, including favorites from Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Peacock, and more. You can even use it as a speaker by listening to music on Spotify and other similar apps. Smart search capabilities with voice control take the experience even further. You can use your voice to command Alexa, plus find movies by actor, plot, and even iconic quotes. For instance, if you’re feeling like watching a good crime thriller, just say something like, “Alexa, show me the latest thrillers with a major plot twist”. Want to relax with a lighthearted comedy show? Try saying “Alexa, show me the best comedy TV shows of all times”, and the job will be done within seconds without you having to press any buttons or get up from the couch.</p>



<p>Alexa compatibility also lets you control your TV, soundbar, and other smart devices around the house easily. You can hop on video calls, check your schedule, and get a live view of your security camera in no time. Getting started with using the Fire TV Cube couldn’t be easier. All you need to do is connect the cube to your TV’s HDMI port and then the home internet. Make sure it’s placed at least one to two feet away from the speakers for ideal functionality. Once it’s connected to the internet, follow the instructions on your TV screen to complete the process.</p>
<p>You’ll also appreciate how the device takes privacy seriously with privacy protections and controls built right in. There’s an off button on the cube that lets you disconnect the microphones when it’s not in use, for added peace of mind.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4111/">Note that Amazon is also offering a free upgrade to its smartest AI assistant – the Alexa+ – with this offer.</a> The early access is expected to last through the end of January, so there’s still time to try it out without paying anything extra.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Restocks Its 15.6″ Portable Gaming Monitor at an All-Time Low and Already Close to Selling Out Again]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-restocks-its-15-6-portable-gaming-monitor-at-an-all-time-low-and-already-close-to-selling-out-again-2000661448</link>

              <p>A multi-monitor setup can significantly boost your productivity, whether you’re working on a creative task, a work deadline, or a passion project. While most secondary monitors are often bulky, there are quite a few portable options around that let you hit all your goals on the go.</p>
<p>One such option is the 15.6-inch KYY portable monitor, which is designed to work with a range of devices, from laptops to PC, MacBooks, phones, and even consoles. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4216/">It usually goes for around $100 at Amazon, but it’s currently available in grey for just $66 at the retailer. That’s after a limited time, 34% discount</a>. Grab it before the offer expires or the stock runs out for good.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4216/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Viewing Modes</h2>
<p>What’s the picture your mind paints when you think of a dual-monitor workstation? It likely involves big screens taking over your entire desk. This portable monitor does the opposite by offering you extra screen space without the usual clutter. You’re getting a high-quality 15.6-inch advanced IPS screen that delivers a stunning 1920 x 1080 resolution for clear, bright visuals. HDR support offers exceptional color accuracy, while blue light reduction technology keeps the screen easy on your eyes, especially during those long work sessions.</p>
<p>You’ll appreciate the 178-degree viewing angle that keeps the visuals consistent from nearly every position. This means you don’t exactly have to sit right in front of the screen to see what’s going on, which makes the monitor great for sharing with multiple people at the same time. As for the screen size, it’s almost similar to what most standard laptops offer these days. You will be able to stream, work, and play comfortably without feeling cramped. Additionally, the monitor can be used in both landscape and portrait modes. The former is ideal for browsing, watching videos, and gaming, while the latter can be used for reading long documents and even going through social media feeds. Viewing modes include duplicating and extending your main screen.</p>



<p>The KYY portable monitor comes equipped with two fully-functional Type-C ports and a mini HDMI port. It’s made to work with a range of devices (tablets, laptops, consoles, PC), as long as they support Thunderbolt 3 or 3.1 USB-Type-C. There are two built-in speakers, plus a 3.5mm headphone jack for audio as well, so you won’t need to rely on external options with this one.</p>
<p>Durability comes from the attached scratch-proof smart cover that’s made of strong PU leather exterior. It doubles as a stand, so you can use it to prop the monitor anywhere you like. The two grooves in the cover let you adjust the viewing angle, too. Maybe use it upright when you’re working on an important task on your desk, and then tilt it back into a more relaxed position for streaming later at night!</p>
<p>At just 1.7lbs and 0.3 inches slim, the monitor is easy to carry on the go. It can easily slip into your laptop bag and won’t add unnecessary bulk to it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4216/">To wrap it up, this portable monitor is great for anyone looking to enjoy additional screen space and be more productive. It’s now down to just $66, which is nothing considering the convenience it offers.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[ASUS Crashes Its CPU Liquid Cooler to Its Lowest Price Yet, Matching Black Friday Pricing]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-crashes-its-cpu-liquid-cooler-to-its-lowest-price-yet-matching-black-friday-pricing-2000661442</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Asus ProArt LC 360 AIO is a liquid-cooling solution that combines a 360 mm radiator with 3 Matte Black Fans and a ProArt aesthetic for systems that require style and thermal management. It’s designed as a fully-integrated liquid-cooling system for use with either an Intel LGA 1700, 1200, or 115X socketed system, or an AMD AM4 or AM5 socketed system, giving you the flexibility to easily move the cooling system from one socketed system to another. On the pump housing is an illuminated Status Meter that provides a quick view of the current system load, temperature, and fan speed.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6804/">You can purchase the Asus ProArt LC 360 AIO CPU Liquid Cooling System for $230 at Amazon, saving $60 and 21% off its regular retail price of $290.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6804/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An efficient and aesthetically pleasing way to cool your PC</h2>
<p>With the 360mm radiator on the Asus ProArt LC 360 AIO CPU Liquid Cooling System, you have a much larger heat-dissipation area under high-load conditions. The radiator is approximately 15.5″ long and has a narrow profile to accommodate many mid-tower and larger cases that can accept a triple-fan radiator. In addition to the radiator, the overall design of the cooler is intended to provide a clean build experience, with the hardware taking center stage and not overwhelming the build with light effects.</p>
<p>The included AlphaCool Apex Stealth Metal Power fans are matte-black, capable of both airflow and pressure, which is important for pushing air through densely packed radiator fins. These fans can operate up to 3000 RPM, and your motherboard may control the fan speed to optimize performance versus noise level to meet your needs. The fans are daisy-chained together to simplify cable routing, allowing you to connect multiple fans and run a single set of cables to them; this can help declutter the interior of your case after everything is wired.</p>



<p>The pump uses a 3-phase electric motor that delivers adequate coolant flow while operating more quietly than simpler designs. When combined with the 450mm of tubing provided, you can route the tubes to the top or front of supported cases without stressing the fittings. The tubes themselves utilize a braided mesh sleeve to improve durability and create a more finished appearance. Together, these features aim to provide smooth coolant flow to your processor, even during heavy workloads.</p>
<p>The primary goal of the ProArt LC 360 AIO is to provide a balanced build experience, pairing a subtle ProArt aesthetic with higher-end cooling hardware. In addition to the 360mm radiator, the system includes metal-bodied fans, an illuminated status meter, and supports a wide array of socket types. If you’re building a PC that requires a clean build, quiet operation, and no flashing lights, the Asus ProArt LC 360 AIO CPU Liquid Cooling System could be an excellent choice. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6804/">At $230 on sale, down from its typical $290, you receive premium-quality components at a lower cost than you would if you invested in a more elaborate custom loop.</a></p>
