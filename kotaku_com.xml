Everywhere you look the genre is growing, evolving, and dominating. From Japanese-style RPGs to Western-style ones, retro remakes to open-world sequels, there’s never been more to dig into for fans of exploration, branching dialogue, or just making the numbers go up.</p><p>This year saw the release of ambitious blockbuster RPGs iterating on tried-and-true formulas as well as bold mashups borrowing from the genres’ best to create something new and equally satisfying. The games were also long, from nearly 15 hours to over 65. Finishing every game on this list by focusing on the critical paths alone would take you roughly 513.5 hours, or about three months of treating them like full-time jobs. But of course the real delight of most RPGs is taking your time, exploring every last NPC conversation and dead-end path in a leisurely fashion until you’ve seen everything the game has to offer. And the following games offered a lot. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6aaf323f78be36f4e2ee287738a57a2f" data-recommend-id="image://6aaf323f78be36f4e2ee287738a57a2f" data-format="png" data-width="1849" data-height="1040" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pixel art sprites walk along a sunset.

I was utterly dazzled by their visuals but, in my estimation at least, they failed to actually capture the spirit of the games to which they were so reverently paying homage. But finally, Square Enix has nailed it by thoughtfully applying the HD-2D aesthetic to one of the actual masterpieces of the pixel art era, <em>Dragon Quest III</em>. The result is one of the best JRPGs of all time, given extraordinary new life through a visual treatment that respects the look and world design of the original game but makes that world newly wondrous to behold, popping with depth, tactility, light and shadow. It’s one of many RPG remakes this year that preserves what makes the original so terrific, enhancing visuals or other elements in such a way that newcomers and longtime fans alike can experience (or re-experience) these exceptional games in a way that feels fresh, contemporary, and alive. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="55c9856e7416822f99c2e438042a40a0" data-recommend-id="image://55c9856e7416822f99c2e438042a40a0" data-format="png" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A tourist looks out at beautiful mountains.

It mixes a contemporary setting with magic and monsters to create an oddly cozy action RPG that is hard to put down thanks to how it constantly builds on itself. The way <em>Hinterberg</em> is structured also helps as it forces you to interact with all of its systems, including the ability to develop friendships with other characters and explore its large maps filled with goblins, treasure, loot, and dungeons. By the end of <em>Hinterberg</em>, I was sad to be finished with it, but happy that I got to experience one of the best RPGs of 2024. — Zack Zwiezen </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="538dc3eadf3f8337b5193512b188759f" data-recommend-id="image://538dc3eadf3f8337b5193512b188759f" data-format="png" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A lion man slays a dragon.

Its high-friction open world is risky but rewarding, full of unique emergent stories that belong solely to the person who experienced them. As Cole Kronman <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-review-ps5-1851349573&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragons-dogma-2-review-ps5-1851349573">wrote in our review</a></span>, “<em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em> is a game unburdened by any influence save that of its own predecessor; it is, on every level, a supremely confident melding of ideas; it contains at least a little bit of everything I’ve ever loved about video games.” — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f6dd3f7fc56cffa6d66ca510b513b049" data-recommend-id="image://f6dd3f7fc56cffa6d66ca510b513b049" data-format="jpg" data-width="900" data-height="506" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A warrior stands in a village square looking out at an airship.

The game is split up into discrete missions designed to be endlessly replayed as you chase better scores, rewards, and end-game resources, and I can’t say the story left a very deep impression on me beyond the broad strokes of its heroic saga about fighting the evil empire and the powerful magic forces maneuvering beneath its surface. And that’s all fine. It nails the vibes and has a grand sense of  scale, all while not getting in the way of the main attraction: big boss fights with slick and rewarding real-time action combat complete with MMO-like party synergies. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1b8cc9ecdea1ee59db03fb27a7c05202" data-recommend-id="image://1b8cc9ecdea1ee59db03fb27a7c05202" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Adventurers head into a magical forest.

I’ve been waiting for a sequel to live up to the series’ SNES-era hype ever since. <em>Visions of Mana</em> is not a top-three <em>Mana</em> game, but it’s still a surprisingly good one. Solid combat and a vibrant if somewhat empty open world are propelled to the next level by wonderful music, old-school dungeons, and a great class-based progression system. <em>Visions of Mana</em>’s uniquely whimsical world was a breath of fresh air that reminded me how much more there can be to modern RPGs than grim sci-fi dystopias, modern schoolyard grinds, and classic medieval dragon slaying. It’s a shame the team behind it, NetEase’s Ouka Studio, was shut down as soon as the game shipped, but I’m hopeful it’s not the last we’ll see of this new era of <em>Mana</em> after the game’s director, Ryosuke Yoshida, joined Square Enix this month. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6c2a8e38c71469c37918a7f4a2453cc7" data-recommend-id="image://6c2a8e38c71469c37918a7f4a2453cc7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mario and a bunch of Yoshis fight on stage.

Not all games stand the test of time, but this year’s Switch remake proves that <em>TTYD</em>’s excellence really is timeless—if anything, the game has only grown in my estimation in the two decades since I first played it. It just goes to show you that characters this endearing, aesthetics this appealing, and gameplay mechanics this lively and approachable never go out of style.—Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c331602ab89a3b7997c7b233236c8d70" data-recommend-id="image://c331602ab89a3b7997c7b233236c8d70" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Catherina talks about class warfare.

Its complex battle system and overtly political story make it a standout for a studio that’s no stranger to acclaim. Atlus has found a new pillar in its stable of franchises, and I’m looking forward to whatever the future looks like for this exciting new series. — Kenneth Shepard </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fbd5d138b23afa2f4c0b6163efd82acc" data-recommend-id="image://fbd5d138b23afa2f4c0b6163efd82acc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="High school students fight demons alongside a dog.

The from-the-ground-up remake maintains all the important parts of the 2006 classic while modernizing a lot of the dated mechanics and story elements that make the original a harder sell in 2024. It’s good to have such a readily accessible version of <em>Persona 3 </em>and its DLC to remind us that even though <em>Persona 5 </em>was what pulled the series into the mainstream, <em>P3</em> is still the most consistent entry in the modern trilogy. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0c63f398f61e5bb065020add3709e960" data-recommend-id="image://0c63f398f61e5bb065020add3709e960" data-format="png" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An overhead map shows a battlefield with units and numbers.

Like a modern auto chess reimagining of <em>Ogre Battle</em>, <em>Unicorn Overlord</em> takes Vanillaware’s flashy art style and applies it to a dense medieval political epic that plays out across slick 2D battles and top-down real-time strategy maps. It’s like a big bowl of slow-cooked oatmeal: long and repetitive yet rich and filling. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="eda7d45abe4f68b42ba8ba600c3ed6a7" data-recommend-id="image://eda7d45abe4f68b42ba8ba600c3ed6a7" data-format="png" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook and co. prepare to fight the gods.

With it, BioWare is making a concerted effort to wrap up over a decade of worldbuilding and potentially make space for what  comes next.

It eschews the fantasy settings that dominated the genre then (and the sci-fi ones, too—I didn’t forget about you, <em>Phantasy Star</em>) for its own distinctive world, one with archetypes and imagery rooted in Westerns but with some horror-adjacent elements as well. Of course, there are the monsters and demons running rampant in the world, but there’s also the fact that the world’s currency is teeth, a detail which continually unnerved me across my ~15 hours with the game.</p><p>I’ve seen people complain that <em>Grimstone </em>is “poorly designed,” they feel, because it doesn’t tell you what the different items you find throughout do. That’s a valid argument, I suppose, but part of what I loved about <em>Grimstone</em>—and indeed, about <em>UFO 50 </em>in its entirety—was the way I was encouraged to experiment, to push up against the limitations of games and see what the rules of their different worlds were. It’s a type of discovery that once felt common in games—many people my age, I think, know the feeling of encountering an opaque game on a relative’s computer, or being left alone with grandpa’s Intellivision—but that’s become increasingly rare as more and more games build thorough instructions into the games themselves rather than expecting you to keep a manual on hand. That sense of progress and discovery never flagged during my time with <em>Grimstone</em>—finding each new town where I could rest at the inn was always a huge relief; conquering each new dungeon was always a thrill; scoring cool new weapons and spells was always a great reward for my efforts. And while <em>Grimstone</em>’s storytelling is fairly minimal by today’s standards, discovering the truth about its world was exciting, particularly because that world is so distinct from the worlds of the actual 1980s JRPGs I’ve played. Not unlike my time with <em>Final Fantasy I</em>’s pixel remaster a few years back, playing <em>Grimstone </em>was a terrific reminder that distilling the genre down to its fundamental essence and giving us just enough detail for our imaginations to do most of the work of bringing a world to life can still be a wonderfully captivating approach for a role-playing game. — Carolyn Petit </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="30a5312e1ab3f2f9c623f389e2f48d33" data-recommend-id="image://30a5312e1ab3f2f9c623f389e2f48d33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Warriors take on dragons in Wizardry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Warriors take on dragons in Wizardry." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Eclipse</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="30a5312e1ab3f2f9c623f389e2f48d33" data-recommend-id="image://30a5312e1ab3f2f9c623f389e2f48d33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Warriors take on dragons in Wizardry." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Oh, what a glorious remake. In 1981, <em>Wizardry: Proving Grounds of the Mad Overlord </em>was released and changed gaming forever, with its deadly monsters and devious dungeons helping to establish the template for party-based computer role-playing. Still, important as it was, it was hard to go back to that game today; at the time, players’ eager imaginations would fill in the gaps of its wire-frame dungeons, but nowadays, those primitive visuals and the game’s many other inconveniences stood between most players and the excitement and cultural impact of Sir-Tech’s masterpiece.</p><p>Enter Digital Eclipse, who knew exactly what to enhance and what to leave alone in bringing <em>PGotMO </em>into the modern era. Transparently built right on top of the original game, this remake brings the dungeons and monsters to vibrant life with lush, atmospheric 3D visuals and terrific sound effects, while also implementing a slew of quality-of-life improvements that cut down on needless frustration while preserving the original game’s vision and difficulty. In the 40+ years since <em>Wizardry</em>’s release, storytelling in role-playing games has evolved tremendously, but playing it this year reminded me that there’s still no substitute for the thrill of delving ever-deeper into a deadly dungeon, enduring hardship and defeat on the road to conquering its traps and defeating its monsters, and making up a story in your own head about the party of heroes you’ve created to tackle it all. — Carolyn Petit </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="03a44d406d642f689680c468eafbe108" data-recommend-id="image://03a44d406d642f689680c468eafbe108" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A warrior holds up her hands in front of a statue.

And yet there’s no denying that <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is  way more of one of the best games of 2022 without being <em>just</em> more <em>Elden Ring</em>. “<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is nothing short of magnificent,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505">wrote</a></span> former senior editor Alyssa Mercante. “It is both an expansion to and a distillation of what makes the original game so special, offering you a chance to try out new weapons and builds while learning far more about the Lands Between than you might have expected. It will delight you in one breath and devastate you the next, forcing you to question your approach, to fortify your spirit.” — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9f36bc374b6cc0fb600257f7b967e098" data-recommend-id="image://9f36bc374b6cc0fb600257f7b967e098" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man swimming under water looks at a dolphin.

With a compelling gangster narrative, fantastic characters, and a thoroughly engaging turn-based combat system, <em>Infinite Wealth</em> is easily one of the must-play RPGs of 2024.</p><p>Though having knowledge of previous <em>Yakuza</em> games will certainly give you some great context, <em>Infinite Wealth</em> tells a focused story you can appreciate even if it’s your first foray into the series. With a plot centered on protagonist Ichiban Kasuga’s search to meet his long-lost mother, as well as on co-protagonist Kazuma Kiryu’s last days as he succumbs to cancer, the narratives in <em>Infinite Wealth</em> are grounded and intriguing. And despite covering such serious ground as estranged family relationships and terminal illness, <em>Infinite Wealth</em> is never afraid to dive into hilarious absurdities, such as a pet crawfish’s search for love. The game also features a ton of mini-games that are naturally embedded in the top-level gameplay, including an entire island-resort management game.</p><p><em>Infinite Wealth </em>tells rewarding stories of relatable human experiences with dozens of hours of engaging side-activities that rarely burden you with busywork. If you tire of fantastical settings that feel too detached from reality and instead want to follow the sometimes-goofy trials and tribulations of troubled-yet-endearing characters trying to make the best of their difficult lives, <em>Infinite Wealth </em>needs to be on your list if it isn’t already. — Claire Jackson</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b2819f83de7a026a9db026167e6a88bc" data-recommend-id="image://b2819f83de7a026a9db026167e6a88bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="2946" data-height="1656" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cloud and co. look out at the prison in Corel.

The second chapter in Square Enix’s retelling of its 1997 PS1 hit, it’s way too long and crammed with way too much filler. The endless minigames, distractions, side-shows, and routine overindulgences don’t always hit, but when they do, it makes <em>Rebirth</em> feel like it’s more alive and having more fun than almost any other game other there. Some RPGs are better than the sum of their parts. <em>Rebirth</em> is an epic slog that nevertheless manages to be more interesting, bold, and unforgettable than the average of its many highs and  lows. It’s big-budget gorgeous yet still unabashedly absurd and over-the-top at any opportunity it gets. — Ethan Gach </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
