It’s not that you get better, it’s more like monkeys and typewriters. You just keep doing it, and eventually, one day they’re dead.”</p><p>That wisdom might sound useless for most players struggling with a particular boss fight or frame-perfect dodge-timing, but it’s actually an inspiring message for anyone out there who’s been put off by Soulslikes and their notoriously punishing difficulty curves: keep trying and eventually, through practice or just dumb luck, you’ll succeed. Not everyone has that sort of time, but it’s an outlook that certainly takes the pressure off of actually feeling like you need to get better or show progress for all those failed attempts. Just keep playing and let destiny take the wheel. </p><p>Garland was otherwise tightlipped on his actual plans for the <em>Elden Ring</em> movie. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2025/05/elden-ring-alex-garland-warfare-kit-connor-the-dish-1236412868/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/elden-ring-alex-garland-warfare-kit-connor-the-dish-1236412868/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Deadline </em>reported</a></span> that Kit Connor, who appeared in this year’s <em>Warfare </em>which was co-written and co-directed by Garland, was in the running for the Tarnished role, though everything’s just rumor and speculation at this point. Garland’s intimate experience with the game itself will certainly give him extra credibility with the fans no matter what direction he decides to take the adaptation in. He’s previously espoused his love of FromSoftware’s uniquely esoteric brand of storytelling, likening it to an “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kti9si/alex_garland_on_why_he_loves_the_dark_souls_games/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1kti9si/alex_garland_on_why_he_loves_the_dark_souls_games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">existential dream</a></span>.” We’ll see how that translates to the big screen. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
