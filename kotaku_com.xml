Marking Epic’s entry into the graphics arms race with id Software, the two games were both utterly brilliant shooters in their own rights, but also became the names behind the engines on which a generation of games would be built. <em>Half-Life</em> was based on the <em>Quake </em>engine, while <em>Unreal</em>’s was under the hood of <em>Deus Ex</em>. </p><p>What also made them special is that both Epic and id were developers who grew up with an understanding of the importance of shareware, free software, and putting source code into the public domain. It’s why anyone can use those engines, and many later iterations of them, to create their games, free, without license or restriction. There are many publishers who are so ludicrously obsessed with maintaining a death-grip around their most ancient software that they will sue anyone who dares touch it (cough-Nintendo-cough), and all attempts to preserve games they refuse to support are met with outrageous hostility. Epic, for whatever other faults you may wish to level, is not like this, and while it should be commonplace, instead it’s a rare joy to see something like the 26-year-old <em>Unreal</em> so freely and willingly shared.</p><figure id="" data-id="c451d36bfccf45d942b46ffa424444d3" data-recommend-id="image://c451d36bfccf45d942b46ffa424444d3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1480" data-height="836" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Internet Archive's front page." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Internet Archive's front page." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Internet Archive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c451d36bfccf45d942b46ffa424444d3" data-recommend-id="image://c451d36bfccf45d942b46ffa424444d3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1480" data-height="836" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Internet Archive's front page." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Meanwhile, the backbone of the internet, the wonderful Internet Archive, has been through an awful time of late. In October, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/internet-archive-hacked-data-breach-impacts-31-million-users/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/internet-archive-hacked-data-breach-impacts-31-million-users/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the site was the target of a massive hacking campaign</a></span>, taking it offline for weeks, meaning the world lost access to vital resources like the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://web.archive.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://web.archive.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wayback Machine</a></span>, which stores archived versions of almost every website on the internet (approximately 835 <em>billion</em> pages), and its enormous catalogs of books, software, films, music, and art.</p><p>At the same time, the vast monopolies that control copyrights have started turning their evil eyes toward the project, with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://artreview.com/the-internet-archive-lawsuit-marks-an-ending-opinion-michelle-santiago-cortes/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://artreview.com/the-internet-archive-lawsuit-marks-an-ending-opinion-michelle-santiago-cortes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a gruesome court ruling</a></span> in September rejecting the Archive’s appeal against a decision that would shut down its ability to “lend” books to its users.

In the wake of this savage blow, more will be coming for it, claiming its goals of preserving humanity’s creations are somehow a violation of their “intellectual property.” </p><figure id="" data-id="7383e055787b205807f2fca9cb344f37" data-recommend-id="image://7383e055787b205807f2fca9cb344f37" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Standing in front of a bank of screens at the very start of Unreal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Standing in front of a bank of screens at the very start of Unreal." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7383e055787b205807f2fca9cb344f37" data-recommend-id="image://7383e055787b205807f2fca9cb344f37" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Standing in front of a bank of screens at the very start of Unreal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So, given all this awfulness, it’s really rather wonderful to see the opposite happening. <strong>If you want to play <em>Unreal</em> (and you should!

It promised new booster packs by the end of the year, so likely sometime in December, as well as trading in January 2025. </p><p>How exactly will trading work? We still don’t quite know that part.
