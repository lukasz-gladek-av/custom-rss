              <p>When storms knock out power in the winter, portable power stations are very important because you need backup power for heating, medical devices, or just to stay connected in case of an emergency. The <strong>Anker Solix C1000</strong> (Gen 2) fixes the main problems with older portable power stations by charging much faster and giving off more power.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/">newer model is now $371 on Amazon, down from its regular price of $549</a> and it is close to the lowest price ever, just before Christmas when power outages caused by bad weather become more common. The <strong>32% discount makes it easy to get serious backup power</strong> without having to deal with the hassle and cost of installing whole-home generators.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Charging Speed That Makes All the Difference</h2>
<p>When you plug the HyperFlash technology into a wall outlet, it <strong>recharges the whole 1,024Wh battery in just 49 minutes</strong> and it changes how you use portable power stations during long power outages. Traditional models take 6 to 8 hours to fully charge, which means you have to carefully ration power or risk running out at important times. This unit, on the other hand, lets you charge it up during short power restoration periods: If the power goes out for a short time, you can drain the battery that powers important devices and then fully charge it during a one-hour lunch break.</p>



<p>With a <strong>continuous output of 2,000W and a surge capacity of 3,000W</strong>, it can easily handle most power tools and household appliances. The 1<strong>0 ports include AC outlets, USB-A ports, USB-C ports, and a car outlet</strong> and you can use all of them at the same time to run your refrigerator, space heater, coffee maker, and phone charger. The 3,000W surge rating can handle the spike that motors make when appliances first turn on, so your refrigerator compressor won’t shut down when it starts up or your circular saw won’t stop spinning when it starts up.</p>



<p>The <strong>LiFePO4 battery chemistry can be charged 4,000 times before it drops to 80% capacity</strong> which means that you can use it every day for about 10 years before you notice a big drop in capacity. Lithium iron phosphate batteries work better in extreme temperatures than regular lithium-ion cells. They keep working in hot summer cars and cold winter garages, where other types of batteries have trouble.</p>
<p>When the power goes out,<strong> the under-10ms UPS switchover time keeps sensitive electronics</strong> like CPAP machines, computers, and networking equipment running without a hitch. When the power goes out, traditional power stations take hundreds of milliseconds to find the problem and switch to battery power. This can cause computers to restart or medical devices to sound an alarm.</p>
<p>Getting the Solix C1000 Gen 2 for $371 is a great deal because you get advanced charging technology and a lot of storage space for almost half the regular price. The almost-record discount makes professional-grade backup power affordable for families that couldn’t afford to buy generators before. The timing is perfect because it’s right before winter storm season, so you can get ready before you really need it. This Christmas deal is too good to pass up for anyone who needs backup power or off-grid capabilities.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/larian-baldurs-gate-3-divinity-ai-swen-vincke-reaction-2000653934</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Today, </span><i><span>Bloomberg </span></i><span>posted an interview with Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke in which he explained that the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i></a> <span>and </span><i><span>Divinity</span></i><span> developer has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-studios-gen-ai-divinity-bg3-2000653850"><span>started integrating generative AI into its workflow</span></a><span>. This is being used for PowerPoint presentations, placeholder text, and concept art, and according to Vincke, “everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way [Larian is] using it.” Despite Vincke’s best efforts to contextualize the ways in which the technology is being used and his promise that no genAI would make its way into the finished product, many fans are not happy, and the statements have generated a massive backlash on social media.</span></p> <p><span>In the past few years, Larian has made a name for itself as a staunchly pro-human game developer. </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>won Game of the Year at the Game Awards, and Vincke himself gave an impassioned speech at the 2024 ceremony about how future GOTY winners would be games that didn’t “treat their developers like numbers on a spreadsheet” and would be made by people who “knew that if you put the game and the team first, the revenue will follow.” So, as you can expect, hearing that the studio has started using AI to generate concept art and ideas has felt to some like a mask drop moment for a studio that has been so publicly supportive of human creativity.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvRm4HKK4gQ"><span>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YvRm4HKK4gQ</span></a></p> <p><span>Vincke went on to clarify his comments in a statement to </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>, saying this technology is meant to be “</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-gen-ai-divinity-baldurs-gate-3-rpg-2000653912"><span>additive to a creative team or individual’s workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft.”</span></a><span> He also doubled down on his assertion that Larian will not include generated assets in its upcoming turn-based RPG </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845"><i><span>Divinity</span></i></a><span> when it launches in a few years. But even if Vincke says the final product won’t have anything produced by AI in it, the fact that this technology is being integrated at a studio whose greatest accomplishments have come from human creativity is worrying to many, and has brought some folks’ excitement for </span><i><span>Divinity </span></i><span>to a screeching halt just days after its announcement at last week’s Game Awards.</span></p>
