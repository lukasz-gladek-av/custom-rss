              <p>Black Friday is a great time to stock up on essentials, plus treat yourself to purchases that are a little hard to justify during the rest of the year. We’re spotting hundreds of discounts across almost every single category you could think of, including games. Titles have dropped in prices, and so have the consoles.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to surprise your little ones with something that gets them moving in your living room, we might have just found the best gaming deal of the season. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6060/">Nex Playground — a cube-like console — is currently sitting at $199 on Amazon, after a 20% discount on its close to $250 price tag</a>. You’ll also get $25 back in Amazon credit with your purchase, which brings the total down even further. Note that both discounts are only valid till supplies last, and that might not be long. To avoid any last-minute disappointments, it’s best to get your orders in fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6060/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Interactive Motion Games</h2>
<p>Nex Playground looks quite like a mini projector, but in a fun way. It connects to your TV and lets you play interactive motion games using just your body. There are no controllers needed, as the built-in wide-angle camera uses AI to scan your movements to register them in games on its own.</p>
<p>Multiplayer setup is supported. Up to four people can hop in at the same time to get some workout in. Five games are packed for free, including Fruit Ninja, Starri, Whac-a-Mole, Go Keeper, and Party Fowl; showcase your chopping skills with the fast movement of arms, or put that adrenaline to good use by nailing down as many moles as you can. For a bit more variety, you can purchase a 3-Month or 12-Month Play Pass, both of which cost $49 and $89, respectively. These get you instant access to a full catalog of games, plus enjoy new games each month. Games include Barbie, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, How to Train Your Dragon, Peppa Pig, Care Bears, Elmo, Miraculous Ladybug, Gabby’s Dollhouse, Kung Fu Panda, and more, so there’s going to be something for everyone. It encourages kids to move around, and is perfect for playdates or family game nights. Honestly, we won’t judge if you want to get a solo session in after putting the little ones to sleep. It’s also appropriate for kids of all ages, since it doesn’t support ads or in-app purchases. They can play their favorite games without needing you around!</p>



<p>Getting started couldn’t be simpler. Nex Playground connects to your TV using a single HDMI cable. Plug the power supply cord into the console and then plug the adapter into an outlet. Switch the thing on, and manage it using your TV remote; simple as that.</p>
<p>All things considered, this console offers a fun way to get your family moving together. Your living room is going to turn into a mini playground (or a battlefield) without a console or tons of other accessories. Just connect it to your TV, and get the party started. You’re getting five games included for free, but will need to purchase the Play Pass to unlock more.&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6060/">The current Black Friday deal drops the price down to $199, letting you save a nice $50 on it. Additionally, you can get $25 back in Amazon credit, which brings the price down even further.</a> Just note that the promotional credit is added automatically to your account 30 days after shipment, so you might not be able to access it right away.</p>

              <p data-start="65" data-end="603">This Black Friday,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6058/"> the Microsoft Surface Pro has seen a massive 36% price drop, now available for just $900 (down from its original price of $1,400)</a>.

Doesn’t matter if you’re editing photos, streaming a new TV show, or putting together a presentation, the OLED panel ensures that every detail pops with crisp clarity.

This long-lasting battery is perfect for on-the-go professionals, students, or travelers who don’t want to be tied down to an outlet. It offers fast and flexible charging of 65W. You can charge the Surface Pro over either its Surface Connect port or simply using is USB-C port.</p>

It’s good for bouncing between multiple tabs, editing videos, or working with any other kind of resource-heavy software. This chip along with the 16GB of RAM ensures that your device won’t slow down. This Surface Pro ends up clocking in even faster than the MacBook Air powered by the M3 chip. The device is also equipped with up 256GB of solid-state storage, giving you a decent amount of space to store files.</p>
<p data-start="2497" data-end="2963">As most new products in the last couple years, Microsoft is toting how this combination laptop and tablet is built for the AI era. It comes equipped with Copilot_ which can be used to help with searching through documents, drafting emails, creating images and more. That’s all optional, of course.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Kindle Paperwhite Drops to Record Low, E-Reader Now Cheaper Than Buying a Few Physical Books]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/kindle-paperwhite-drops-to-record-low-e-reader-now-cheaper-than-buying-a-few-physical-books-2000648434</link>
            <guid>1367629</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Kindle e-readers have evolved into reading experiences that rival physical books through <strong>e-ink displays mimicking printed paper and provides instant access to over 15 million titles that would fill entire libraries</strong>. The convenience proves transformative through lightweight portability replacing heavy books in bags, immediate downloads eliminating bookstore trips, and adjustable lighting enabling reading anywhere regardless of ambient conditions.</p>
<p>The newest <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6054/">Kindle Paperwhite with 16GB storage (and ads) costs $124 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $159</a>, and hits a record-low price where Amazon removes profit margins completely on their own hardware. The ad-supported version saves money through occasional lock-screen advertisements, though <strong>spending an extra $20 for the ad-free model proves worthwhile</strong> if promotional content bothers you.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6054/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The fastest page turns that are like real books</h2>
<p>The next-generation processor makes <strong>page turns 25% faster than older Paperwhite models</strong>: This gets rid of the short lag that made earlier e-readers feel slow compared to flipping through real pages. The speed boost is especially noticeable in scenes with a lot of dialogue or action, where quick page turning keeps the story moving instead of making fake pauses that break the immersion.</p>



<p>The <strong>7-inch glare-free screen gives you a lot of reading space</strong> in a small package: It can fit more text on the screen while still being portable which is something that bigger tablets give up. The anti-glare coating makes it possible to read in direct sunlight where phone and tablet screens wash out completely which means that you can read at the beach, in an outdoor cafe, or at a sunny window seat without having to squint or move around like you would with reflective screens.</p>
<p>The <strong>adjustable color temperature changes from bright white light for reading during the day to warm amber tones for reading at night</strong>: This lowers blue light exposure, which can affect sleep quality. The warm light lets you read before bed without the blue light that phone and tablet screens give off, which keeps your natural sleep patterns going instead of messing them up.</p>



<p>The<strong> IPX8 waterproof rating</strong> means that the device can be submerged in water for up to two meters for 60 minutes. This means you can read by the pool, relax in the bathtub, or spend time at the beach without worrying about your electronics getting wet. The device won’t break if it falls into a pool, gets splashed by waves, or gets rained on, so you don’t have to be as careful with it when it’s wet, like you do with most expensive electronics.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery lasts for 12 weeks on a single charge</strong> so you don’t have to charge your phone or tablet every night, which can make them feel like they need constant care. Read every day for months without needing to charge, take vacations without bringing chargers, or keep reading without worrying about the battery running out like you do with devices that need daily power. The USB-C charging makes it easier to charge when needed because it doesn’t need special cables like older Kindles did.</p>
<p>The<strong> 16GB of storage can hold thousands of books</strong> which is much more than what most readers read before they upgrade their devices. The storage is especially useful when traveling internationally, when buying books can be difficult.</p>
<p>If you’ve thought about getting an e-reader but were put off by the usual prices, this is the perfect time to make the switch from physical books.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Lenovo Idea Tab Hits an All-Time Low, Now the Cheapest Android Tablet With Pencil and Case Included]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/get-a-headstart-on-your-2025-holiday-tech-shopping-with-the-ai-powered-lenovo-idea-tab-2000636961</link>
            <guid>1367626</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The digital device in pretty much every student’s backpack doesn’t absolutely have to be an expensive laptop computer. The apps and tech that make digital note-taking, research, and AI-assisted writing and coursework has filtered down not just to high-end tablets, but also some of the more affordable models as well. That’s where the Lenovo Idea Tab sits — an 11-inch Android tablet armed with everything a student needs, including Lenovo AI Notes, but without the hefty price tag that comes with a laptop. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/">It’s on Black Friday sale right now at Amazon for just $180 (-25%).</a></p>
<p>Odds are the Lenovo Idea Tab is going to outperform most if not all other $180 tablets for academic and productivity purposes. It comes with the Lenovo Tab Pen and a folio case, both of which are almost always added expenses with tablets. Google’s Circle to Search feature is built in as well, along with Lenovo’s AI Notes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Clear Picture</h2>
<p>The Lenovo Idea Tab comes with four apps that are tailor-made for academic performance: Squid, the powerful paper-replacing Android app for handwritten notes, PDF markups, and other tasks; MyScript Notes (formerly Nebo), a great freehand-sketching app; MyScript Calculator, which can solve your handwritten numerical equations; and Lenovo AI Note, which transforms your handwritten notes into AI-generated quizzes, and can also use AI to expand on your notes with greater insight.</p>
<p>Whether you’re working or playing, the 11-inch 2.5K screen on the Lenovo Idea Pad isn’t going to let you down. The MediaTek Dimensity 6300 octa-core processor ensures that the images on that screen come through smoothly, and the seemingly inexhaustible battery is good for up to 12 hours of video playback.</p>



<h2>All the Tablet, Without the Price</h2>
<p>Everything else you would ask of the tablets in the higher price brackets — fast internet, smooth streaming, quality built-in camera and Dolby Atmos quad speakers for video calls, and total portability (just 6.5 x 10 x 0.28 inches in size and 1.05 pounds in weight) — are here with the Lenovo Idea Pad, and don’t forget the included-in-price Lenovo Tab Pen and folio case.</p>
<p>The Lenovo Idea Pad might be considered to be an “entry-level” tablet by some, and to be fair, we wouldn’t throw it in the ring against the latest iPad Pro or Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra. But you’re certainly not getting anywhere near either of those heavyweights for $210, and the differences between them and the Lenovo Idea Pad probably don’t quantify the $1,000-plus price difference. Long story short, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/">you’re getting far more tablet than you would expect for $180 from the Lenovo Idea Pad, so this Amazon Black Friday deal is a solid thumbs-up.</a></p>
