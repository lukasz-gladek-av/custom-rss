              <p>Govee has been giving Philips Hue a run for its money with its suite of affordable smart lighting products. This <strong>uplighter floor lamp</strong> is a perfect example of what Govee does best, marrying ambient lighting, RGBIC effects and practical task lighting in one sleek device. For Black Friday,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5844/"> it has dropped to a record-low $125 on Amazon, down from $179</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tri-Zone Lighting That Transforms Any Room</h2>
<p>This floor lamp is impressive with its tri-zone system: <strong>the upper section projects dynamic ripple effects onto your ceiling, the middle zone delivers colorful RGBIC lighting, and the lower section provides 1000 lumens of focused task lighting</strong>. Control each zone independently or combine them for layered effects. Set up movie nights, work sessions, and parties with their perfect lighting.</p>
<p>The ripple projector creates mesmerizing, water-like patterns that dance across your ceiling and walls. The lamp head rotates 330 degrees, letting you aim the projection exactly where you want it. You<strong> can cover up to 215 square feet</strong> with these dynamic effects, which fills most living rooms and bedrooms easily. Govee includes more than 80 preset scenes in their app, or you can create your own custom patterns.</p>



<p>Circadian rhythm lighting is a feature that actually enhances your daily life once it’s setup: The <strong>lamp adjusts color temperature from 2700K warm tones to 6500K cool white throughout the day</strong>. Cool, energizing light in the morning helps you wake up and stay productive. Warm sunset hues in the evening signal your body to start winding down for sleep. The <strong>auto-run feature handles those transitions automatically</strong> so you don’t have to think about it.</p>
<p>Integration with smart homes works smoothly on all major platforms. The lamp is Matter compatible, meaning it plays nicely with Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant. With Voice Control, one can change scenes, adjust brightness, or turn the lamp on and off-all without reaching for the phone. The Govee Home app unlocks the full potential with DIY light shows and music-reactive modes.</p>



<p>The build quality is excellent for a lamp in its category: The <strong>solidly built rust-proof aluminum construction</strong> should last for years to come. The transparent black shade accents give it a modern look that suits most décor styles. The motors responsible for the rotating projector head work at under 25 decibels, meaning they are basically silent. This means you won’t have any disturbing mechanical noises when you’re relaxing or working.</p>
<p>Setting everything up with the Govee app takes only a few minutes: Connect to your 2.4GHz WiFi network, and it seems like the lamp is ready for customization. The interface of the app is intuitively simple to navigate, with easy access to scenes, schedules, and manual controls. Firmware updates unlock new features over time, including the combo mode for upper and lower sections.</p>
<p>The Govee uplighter floor lamp is an incredible value at $125 this Black Friday. This is Philips Hue-level smart lighting for a fraction of the price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-chose-market-share-over-margins-airpods-pro-3-crash-to-record-low-days-after-launch-2000646557</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-chose-market-share-over-margins-airpods-pro-3-crash-to-record-low-days-after-launch.1361968/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple released the AirPods Pro 3 a few weeks ago and they’re already discounted on Amazon. That’s unusual for brand-new Apple products which typically hold their full price for months after launch. Apple isn’t offering any discount on their website or in Apple Stores so Amazon is clearly absorbing the cost to drive Black Friday traffic: You’re saving $30 on earbuds that haven’t even been on shelves for a full month, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">and at $219 down from $249, this is the lowest price we’ve seen</a> and likely the best deal you’ll find on these new earbuds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Next-Level Audio</h2>
<p>Active noise cancellation on AirPods Pro 3 <strong>removes up to twice as much unwanted noise as the previous generation</strong>. And airplane engines, office chatter, and city traffic just fade away so you can focus on your music or podcast. The new acoustic architecture delivers transformed bass response with detailed clarity across all frequencies. Vocals sound stunningly vivid, and you can pick out individual instruments in complex recordings.</p>
<p><strong>Spatial audio immerses you in a three-dimensional soundstage</strong> where movies and music feel more real than ever. When you turn your head, the sound shifts around you, placing you in the heart of the action. Of course, this only works with compatible content on Apple Music, Apple TV+, and select other streaming services. It also extends to gaming, providing you with better spatial awareness so you know exactly where sounds are coming from.</p>



<p>These health features are genuinely groundbreaking for a product of this size. Integrated heart rate sensing keeps track of your pulse and calories burned across 50 different workout types. You get access to your Move ring, step count, and the new Workout Buddy feature powered by Apple Intelligence. The hearing health suite includes a home hearing test and a clinical-grade Hearing Aid feature with automatic Conversation Boost.</p>
<p>Live Translation is one of those features that sounds like science fiction until you try it. Firing on all cylinders thanks to Apple Intelligence, the feature translates conversations in real-time directly through your earbuds. You can communicate across language barriers during travel or international business meetings and <strong>the translation is local on your device for privacy and speed</strong>.</p>



<p>Battery life is significantly better compared to previous generations: You get up to <strong>8 hours of listening time with active noise cancellation enabled</strong> or up to 10 hours in Transparency mode using the Hearing Aid feature. The USB-C charging case provides additional charges when you’re on the go. A quick charge gives you hours of listening from just minutes in the case.</p>
<p>The <strong>new ear tips come in five sizes, up from the previous three</strong>, to provide a much more personalized and secure fit. A better seal means improved noise isolation and bass response sans cranking the volume up. The buds stay put during workouts, runs, and active daily use. Apple’s fit test in the Settings app will help you find the perfect size for your ears. Comfort matters when you are wearing earbuds for hours at a time.</p>
<p>At $219, the AirPods Pro 3 offer fantastic value on brand new Apple hardware. Amazon’s taking the hit on margins that Apple won’t match in their own stores. If you want the latest AirPods Pro at a price below retail, this record-low Black Friday deal is the opportunity to grab them.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-shows-no-pride-v11-vacuum-cleaner-now-sells-cheaper-than-mid-range-generic-alternatives-2000646571</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dyson-shows-no-pride-v11-vacuum-cleaner-now-sells-cheaper-than-mid-range-generic-alternatives.1361959/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dyson vacuums are known to be pricey, but they’ve also gained a reputation for being worth the price. One of Dyson’s most recent cordless models, <strong>the V11 Origin</strong>, packs serious suction and smart features into a lightweight design. There’s a reason this has been Dyson’s best-seller since Black Friday started on Thursday: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">At $399, down from $629, you’re saving $230 on a premium cleaning machine</a> that will revolutionize the way you do housework. And, with this record-low price, Dyson quality is now accessible.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Suction That Handles Every Surface</h2>
<p>The <strong>185 air watts of suction power places the V11 Origin</strong> among the most powerful cordless vacuums you can buy. This is a full 60% more power than previous Dyson generations, and you instantly tell the difference on carpets. Deep-embedded dirt, pet hair, and fine dust get pulled up from fibers that other vacuums leave behind. The same power works brilliantly on hard floors without scattering debris around.</p>
<p>The Motorbar cleaner head automatically<strong> adjusts to different floor types</strong> as you work your way through your house. Firm nylon bristles dig into carpets, while softer carbon fiber filaments capture fine dust on hard floors. The brilliant part is the de-tangling technology that stops long hair and pet hair from wrapping around the brush bar. You won’t spend time cutting hair out of the roller after every cleaning session.</p>



<p>Three power modes allow you to customize suction for what you’re cleaning. Auto mode intelligently adjusts the power as it senses different floor types and dirt levels. Eco mode makes the most of battery life for lighter cleaning tasks around the home. Boost mode unleashes full suction for stubborn messes and high-traffic areas. The <strong>LCD screen shows your current mode</strong>, remaining runtime down to the second and maintenance alerts.</p>
<p>It reaches up to <strong>60 minutes on a single charge in Eco mode</strong>&nbsp;which is enough to cover most homes. The removable lithium-ion battery charges in an included docking station that mounts on your wall. Having a dedicated home for the vacuum keeps it charged and ready whenever you need it. The accessories store neatly on the dock, too, so everything stays organized. Just grab, clean, and dock back in seconds.</p>



<p>Turn this floor vacuum into a portable cleaning machine <strong>with the handheld conversion</strong>. Pop off the wand and attach the various tools directly to the main unit: The crevice tool reaches into tight spaces, car seats, and between cushions. The mini soft dusting brush handles delicate surfaces and electronics without scratching. The hair screw tool tackles upholstery and stairs where pet hair tends to accumulate.</p>
<p><strong>At just 6.6 pounds</strong>, the V11 Origin feels manageable even during extended cleaning sessions. The weight balance keeps it comfortable to maneuver around furniture and up stairs. You can easily lift it to clean ceiling corners, curtains, and high shelves. The cordless freedom means no more unplugging and re-plugging as you move between rooms.</p>
<p>HEPA filtration captures allergens and microscopic particles that cheaper vacuums blow back into your air. This matters if anyone in your household deals with allergies or asthma. Whole-machine<strong> filtration traps 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns</strong>. You’re improving your indoor air quality while you clean your floors.</p>
<p>The Dyson V11 Origin offers unparalleled value at $399 this Black Friday and this is the best-selling Dyson vacuum for a reason.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/beats-pill-drops-to-pocket-change-apples-profit-margins-just-took-a-sick-day-2000646553</link>

              <p>Beats has been owned by Apple since 2014 but the brand has maintained its own identity and signature sound that fans love. The<strong> Beats Pill is one of the most iconic portable speakers</strong> ever made and it continues to deliver impressive audio in a compact package. This Black Friday, it <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5035/">has dropped to a record-low $99 on Amazon, down from $149</a>. If you’ve been eyeing this legendary speaker, now is the time to grab it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5035/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Seriously Loud Sound in a Portable Package</h2>
<p>The <strong>audio quality on the Beats Pill punches far above its weight class</strong>. A custom acoustic architecture produces rich, balanced sound with deep bass that fills a room. You get that signature Beats warmth without any of the muddiness that tends to plague cheaper portable speakers. It gets genuinely very loud while remaining clear, so outdoor gatherings and beach days can sound great.</p>
<p>Where the Beats Pill really impresses is in its battery life: it <strong>gives you as much as 24 hours of playback</strong> from one charge, so weekend trips and all-day events are covered without having to hunt for an outlet. The USB-C charging keeps things simple since you’re probably already carrying that cable for your phone. A quick 10-minute charge gives you enough juice for a couple more hours when you’re running low.</p>



<p><strong>Water resistance adds durability</strong> that makes the Beats Pill ready for real-life adventures. Splashes by the pool, rain at a picnic, or spills at a party won’t damage this speaker. You can take it out to places where you wouldn’t want to take more fragile electronics. The build quality feels solid and premium in your hands without being heavy or awkward to carry. This is gear designed for people who actually use their speakers outside of the living room.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth connectivity</strong> works seamlessly with both Apple and Android devices. For the iPhone, one gets extra benefits, such as one tap pairing and Find My integration to locate the speaker in case it goes missing. Android users, on the other hand, get the same excellent sound quality and reliable wireless connection. Pairing only takes seconds, and the connection stays stable even when you move around. You can also connect two Beats Pills together for stereo sound or amplified mode when one speaker isn’t enough.</p>



<p>The compact design makes this speaker truly portable in a way larger Bluetooth speakers just aren’t. It fits in a backpack, beach bag, or even a large jacket pocket without weighing you down. The cylindrical shape looks clean and modern while<strong> providing 360-degree sound dispersion</strong>. The matte black finish resists fingerprints and looks sleek in any setting. You’ll actually want to bring this speaker with you rather than leaving it at home because it’s too bulky.</p>
<p>The Beats Pill, at $99, is a seriously good Black Friday value. At the record-low price, an already great speaker becomes an incredible deal that’s hard to pass up.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Makes a Zero-Profit Play on Fitbit Charge 6, Pocket Change That Buries the Apple Watch]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-makes-a-zero-profit-play-on-fitbit-charge-6-pocket-change-that-buries-the-apple-watch-2000646578</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-makes-a-zero-profit-play-on-fitbit-charge-6-pocket-change-that-buries-the-apple-watch.1361950/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Google bought up Fitbit back in 2021 and the brand has been incrementally improving ever since. The <strong>Charge 6</strong> is Google’s direct challenge to Apple Watch in the fitness tracker space, albeit at a much friendlier price. This tracker packs serious health monitoring features including built-in GPS and Google app integration, into a slim wristband design. For Black Friday,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5847/"> it has dropped to a record-low $99 on Amazon, down from $159</a>. You also get <strong>six months of Fitbit Premium included</strong>, adding even more value to an already great deal.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5847/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Google-Powered Fitness Tracking on Your Wrist</h2>
<p>The Google integration changes how you interact with your fitness tracker throughout the day. On walks and runs, Google Maps gives turn-by-turn directions right from your wrist. With Google Wallet, you’re able to make contactless payments without having to pull out your phone or card. And control from YouTube Music lets you manage your workout playlist sans breaking stride.</p>
<p>That makes heart rate monitoring on the Fitbit Charge 6 a game-changer for indoor workouts, especially with compatible gym equipment. Connect to Bluetooth-enabled treadmills, ellipticals, and stationary bikes that can broadcast your heart rate. Your real-time pulse data appears on the machine’s display to help you stay in your target zone. Previously, this type of gym equipment compatibility had been limited to higher-end fitness watches. You get the premium features without the premium price tag.</p>



<p><strong>Built-in GPS tracks your runs, cycling routes, and hikes</strong> accurately without needing your phone nearby. Afterwards, you can see your pace, distance, and elevation changes in the Fitbit app. The GPS locks in quickly, so you are not standing around waiting before your run.</p>
<p>Health monitoring goes deep on the Charge 6, with continuous heart rate tracking and SpO2 blood oxygen sensing. Sleep tracking analyzes your rest patterns and provides a daily Sleep Score. Stress management tools include guided breathing sessions and an EDA sensor for mindfulness sessions. The tracker monitors your Active Zone Minutes, which count time spent in fat-burning or cardio heart rate zones.</p>



<p>The six-month Fitbit Premium membership that’s included with your purchase will unlock advanced insights and guided programs. With Premium, you get detailed sleep analysis, personalized workout recommendations, and mindfulness content. Video workouts from fitness experts give you fresh routines to try at home or in the gym. Health metrics dashboard shows trends in your data over time. <strong>This membership normally costs $10/month</strong>&nbsp;so you’re getting an additional $60 value included.</p>
<p>Battery life reaches<strong> up to seven days on a single charge</strong>&nbsp;which beats most smartwatches by a wide margin. You can track an entire week of workouts, sleep, and daily activity without touching a charger. When you do need to recharge, it takes about two hours to reach full capacity. The <strong>always-on display option</strong> shows your stats at a glance without tapping or wrist-raising. Less time charging means more time tracking.</p>
<p>The slim band design keeps the Charge 6 comfortable for all-day and all-night wear: <strong>Both small and large bands come in the box</strong>&nbsp;so you’ll find the right fit immediately. Water resistance up to 50 meters means showers, swimming, and sweaty workouts won’t damage the tracker. The<strong> touchscreen is quick to respond</strong> and easy to navigate through menus. You get a premium feel without the bulk of a traditional smartwatch.</p>
<p>At $99, the Fitbit Charge 6 is an absolute steal this Black Friday. This is the best fitness tracker from Google and Fitbit at nearly 40% off retail.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/logitech-went-full-charity-mode-the-mx-master-3s-now-sells-for-almost-free-this-black-friday-2000646547</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/logitech-went-full-charity-mode-the-mx-master-3s-now-sells-for-almost-free-this-black-friday.1361935/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gamers who also create content, edit videos, or work long hours at their desk need a mouse that handles everything. Your gaming mouse might be great for fragging but it’s probably not ideal for those 10-hour editing sessions or browsing between matches. The <strong>Logitech MX Master 3S</strong> bridges that gap with an 8K DPI sensor, ergonomic design and features that make productivity feel effortless. This Black Friday, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5841/">it has dropped to a record-low $99 on Amazon, down from $119</a>. If you want one mouse that dominates both work and play, this is the one to grab.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5841/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Precision and Comfort Built for Marathon Sessions</h2>
<p>The <strong>8000 DPI sensor</strong> inside the MX Master 3S tracks on virtually any surface, including glass. You can game on your desk, work from a coffee shop table or use it on your couch armrest with no need for a mousepad. Whichever you choose, the tracking remains accurate and responsive. Sensitivity is fully customizable through the <em>Logi Options+</em> software, so you can really dial in just the feel you want.</p>
<p>The ergonomics of this mouse are really impressive for long sessions of gaming and work: The <strong>sculpted shape fits naturally in your hand</strong>&nbsp;and reduces strain through those marathon streams or nights of editing. Your wrist and fingers stay comfortable even after hours of continuous use. The thumb rest provides support that cheaper mice simply don’t offer. If you have ever felt hand fatigue after extended time at the desk, this design makes a noticeable difference.</p>



<p>The <em>Quiet Clicks</em> feature cuts down the noise by 90% compared to the regular mice and becomes a game-changer in streamers’ and content developers’ lives. Your microphone will not catch any kind of annoying click sound while recording or on Discord with your buddies. They are still satisfying and tactile clicks, just without the audible snap.</p>
<p><em>MagSpeed</em> scrolling is one of those features you don’t know you need until you experience it. The scroll wheel moves with electromagnetic precision, allowing you to scroll through long documents or web pages in a single flick. It’s <strong>90% faster and 87% more precise than conventional scroll wheels</strong>. When you need fine control, it shifts automatically to a ratcheted mode that clicks through line by line.</p>



<p>Multi-device connectivity allows you to <strong>connect the MX Master 3S to up to three computers or devices at once</strong>. Switch between your gaming rig, work laptop, and tablet with the press of a button. Flow takes this a step further by allowing you to move your cursor seamlessly across computers and drag files across them. This is incredible if one runs a dual-system setup for streaming and gaming. The <strong>mouse connects via Bluetooth</strong> or the included Logi Bolt USB receiver for a great wireless connection.</p>
<p>And the battery life won’t leave you stranded mid-session: <strong>a full charge lasts up to 70 days of regular use</strong> and a quick one-minute charge gives you three hours of power when you’re in a pinch. The USB-C charging port also means you can use the same cable as your phone or controller.</p>
<p>The Logitech MX Master 3S is an unbelievable deal at $99 this Black Friday, make sure you don’t miss that opportunity.</p>

              <p>One of my favorite things to do on my Xbox Series S is occasionally trawl the digital storefront archives for <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-games-on-xbox-360-5878837">my favorite Xbox 360 games</a>. Often they aren’t available or are ridiculously expensive compared to their bargain bin physical versions. But very occasionally they’re available through Microsoft’s backwards compatibility program and only cost less than $10. Today is one of those days.</p> <p>Microsoft’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/black-friday-2025">Black Friday 2025 sale</a> this year happens to coincide with <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-favorite-memories-mw2-bastion-halo-2000646286">the 20th anniversary of the Xbox 360</a>. As a result, you can pick up some of the retro console’s best games for just the cost of a cup of coffee or Big Mac:</p> <ul> <li><em><strong>Deus Ex: Human Revolution</strong></em> – $2.25 (normally $15)</li> <li><strong><em>Blue Dragon</em></strong> – $5 (normally $20)</li> <li><strong><em>Lost Odyssey</em></strong> – $8.25 (normally $25)</li> <li><strong><em>Alan Wake</em></strong> – $6 (normally $20)</li> <li><strong><em>Fable II</em></strong> – $6.60 (normally $20)</li> <li><strong><em>Gears of War 2</em></strong> – $8.80 (normally $12)</li> <li><strong><em>Gears of War 3</em></strong> – $8.80 (normally $12)</li> <li><strong><em>Grand Theft Auto IV</em></strong> – $7 (normally $20)</li> <li><strong><em>Fallout 3</em></strong> – $2.50 (normally $10)</li> <li><em><strong>Street Fighter IV</strong></em> – $4 (normally $20)</li> </ul> <p>If you played <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> this year and loved it, do yourself a favor and pick up <em>Lost Odyssey</em>. The cult-classic turn-based RPG was developed by <em>Final Fantasy</em> veterans including Hironobu Sakaguchi and Nobuo Uematsu and has an emotional bombshell for a narrative arc.</p>

 <p>“For me, Lost Odyssey was the last grand turn-based RPG adventure with realistic graphics,” <em>Clair Obscur</em> director Guillaume Broche <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-the-last-game-that-made-me-cry-clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-on-the-iconic-xbox-360-rpg-lost-odyssey-and-its-unexpected-legacy">told <em>Eurogamer</em></a> earlier this year. “Its themes were very heavy and very well handled. It’s the last game that made me cry.”</p>

 <p><em>Deus Ex: Human Revolution</em>, meanwhile, is a great sci-fi immersive sim with incredible art direction that never got ported. <em>Street Fighter IV</em> might be the best entry in the series ever. And if you don’t want to wait for that rumored <em>Fallout 3</em> remaster to appear, you can revisit the Washington D.C. wasteland today for steal.</p> <p>And if you recent played through the original Gears story by way of <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-review-of-gears-of-war-reloaded-and-the-state-of-the-franchise-2000620106">this summer’s<em> Reloaded Edition</em></a>, you can find a local co-op buddy and complete the journey this Thanksgiving break. Rip to some real ones.</p>

              <p>It’s been over a year since Microsoft shut down the Xbox 360’s digital store, effectively putting the final nail in the beloved console’s coffin. While it’s a shame that the decades-old console’s marketplace is gone, it doesn’t take away from the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-360-tribute-retrospective-halo-3-red-ring-e3-1851609358">Xbox 360’s legacy as a popular, innovative, and weird machine</a> that paved the way for the current era of gaming.</p> <p>For better and for worse, when Microsoft’s Xbox 360 launched in 2005 it changed video games forever. And now seems like a perfect time to take a look back at the best and worst parts of its run.</p> <p><em>This article was originally published on Jul 31, 2024.
