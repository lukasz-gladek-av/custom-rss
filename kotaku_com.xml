              <p>Nobody should have to decide which one of their devices gets the fast charger while the other ones get the slow version, or none at all. You carry your smartphone and earbuds and wear your smartwatch at the same time, so you should be able to fast-charge them the same way.</p>
<p>That’s what Anker’s MagGo 3-in-1 charging station does for your Apple devices, including the brand-new iPhone 17, Apple Watch 11, SE 3, and Ultra, and AirPods 4 and Pro 3. They all get 15W charging power, and your desk or nightstand get a clean, organized look with just one cable for 3 devices. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4221/">Speaking of cleaning up, that’s what you’ll be doing with this limited-time Amazon sale that cuts the price of the MagGo 3-in-1 charging station by 30%, down to just $63.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4221/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Apple Certified</h2>
<p>The Anker MagGo 3-in-1 charging station is one of the rare chargers that’s officially certified by Apple as a fast charger for the Apple Watch. It’s powerful and fast enough to bring an Apple Watch Series 10 from 0 to a full charge in just an hour and 13 minutes — over 2 hours less than other wireless chargers. (It’s not compatible with Samsung or other non-Apple smartwatches.)</p>
<p>That amazing speed also applies to your MagSafe-compatible iPhone — watch your iPhone 16 Pro Max go from totally dead to 20% in just 20 minutes, a task which takes a 7.5W wireless charger over twice as long. And the Qi pad at the rear of the stand is a perfect fit for your AirPods wireless charging case, with a non-slip surface to prevent you (or your cat) from knocking them off in the middle of the night.</p>



<h2>Nightstand Upgrade</h2>
<p>The MagGo is a charging&nbsp;<em>stand</em>, so let’s not lose sight of that feature. Your iPhone charges with equal speed in portrait or landscape position, and the powerful MagSafe grip holds the phone in place and allows you to tilt it back vertically by as much as 45 degrees. That’s perfect if you want to watch a video or take a FaceTime call at your desk hands-free while your phone charges, and on your nightstand, your iPhone can be placed in StandBy mode and act as your bedside clock, all while receiving an optimal charge.</p>
<p>Anker’s rep for top-of-the-line charging device is well established, especially for the Apple ecosystem. This one’s not going to damage that rep one bit — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4221/">the MagGo 3-in-1 fast charger earned an Amazon’s Choice tag, and this 30% limited-time deal makes it a $63 steal</a> that will keep your devices charged and your desk or nightstand organized.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Daft Punk, one of the biggest electronic dance music groups in history, is coming soon to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gaijin-war-thunder-fortnite-the-pit-deal-millions-epic-1851786813"><em>Fortnite</em></a> alongside some classic tracks, Lego skins, new emotes, and also a big confirmation from Epic that, no, they aren’t getting back together. Sorry.</p> <p>On September 22, after some online leaks and teases, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/party-harder-better-faster-stronger-in-fortnite-with-the-daft-punk-experience">Epic officially announced that Daft Punk</a> was coming to <em>Fortnite</em> as part of a large in-game event. The robotic duo will arrive in Epic’s ever-growing battle royale on September 27 as part of something called the “Daft Punk Experience.” This will be an in-game location that players can visit alone or with friends, and it will feature various activities, including the ability to remix Daft Punk’s music, a horde mode featuring robots, and a dance club.</p> <p>But before all that, on September 25, cosmetic items based on the duo will be added to <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-missing-characters-wishlist-grimace-agent-47-weird-al-star-trek-2000617211"><em>Fortnite’s</em> in-game shop</a>. Cosmetics include multiple Daft Punk outfits, emotes, weapon skins, in-game music tracks, and even some adorable Lego minifigs based on the famous robots.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000627583" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627583"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627583">©Epic Games / Daft Punk</figcaption></figure> <p>Now, if you’re a big fan of Daft Punk like me, you might see all this news and start thinking that maybe, just maybe, the duo is about to get back together. Perhaps this is just a tease of something bigger. A new album? A new song? A new tour? Well, bad news: Epic makes it very clear in the post announcing all of the new <em>Fortnite</em> x Daft Punk content that, no, the group is not getting back together. First, Epic starts the post off with a mention of the group being “no longer” around and then, to make it very clear, Epic included this in the event’s FAQ:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><em>Is Daft Punk getting back together?</em></li> <li>No. The Daft Punk Experience is an immersive music experience based on the band’s beloved music. The band is not getting back together.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>So there you go. Sorry about that. Of course, if they wanted it to be a surprise, that’s exactly what they would say. So perhaps there is still a chance… (Editor’s note: It’s not happening, Zack. Move on.)</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>While reports are circulating that Disney-owned ABC and late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-fallon-colbert-stewart-trump-kirk-2000627249"><span>in talks to bring </span><i><span>Jimmy Kimmel Live</span></i></a> <span>back on air after the show was pulled last week, more high-profile names from some of Disney’s biggest franchises have spoken out in protest of the decision. While some, like Aunt May actor Marisa Tomei and She-Hulk actor Tatiana Maslany, have </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney-boycott-marvel-marisa-tomei-2000627135"><span>called for a straight-up boycott</span></a><span> of the company’s services, some other major players in </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>and Marvel are simply voicing their support for Kimmel and condemning ABC and Disney’s decision.</span></p> <p><span>Mark Hamill, who has portrayed original </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>protagonist Luke Skywalker since long before Disney ever got its hands on the franchise, posted on Bluesky that he believes Jimmy Kimmel being pulled from the air in an effort to placate the FCC and the Trump administration will only embolden further attacks on free speech in America, and says that he finds Kimmel “very talented and funny.” This is in reference to comments from ex-Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who expressed similar sentiments </span><a href="https://x.com/Michael_Eisner/status/1969088566098870363"><span>on his X account</span></a><span> and signed off with the same final line.</span></p>   <p><span>Another big </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>name calling out Disney for this move is Dan Gilroy, a writer whose work on the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/andor-season-2-ending-vgchat-star-wars-rogue-one-10-12-1851780720"><span>Disney+ series </span><i><span>Andor</span></i></a><span> earned him an Emmy. Gilroy wrote a guest column on </span><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/andor-dan-gilroy-jimmy-kimmel-commentary-1236549627/"><i><span>Deadline</span></i></a><span> comparing the real-world actions of the Trump administration to events of the show, which focuses on the Galactic Empire’s tyrannical reign.</span></p>

 <p><span>“As one of the writers on the Disney+ drama </span><i><span>Andor</span></i><span>, we spent six years thinking about a fascist takeover of a galaxy far, far away,” Gilroy wrote. “Six years thinking about ordinary beings as an authoritarian regime comes in for the kill. Many people saw parallels between </span><i><span>Andor</span></i><span> and the real world. I see them as well, particularly in the events of the last week.”</span></p>

 <p><span>On the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cinematic-universe-mcu-best-worst-movie-avengers-1851765913"><span>Marvel</span></a><span> side of things, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-anxiety-touch-controversy-1851787007"><span>Pedro Pascal</span></a><span>, who plays Mr. Fantastic in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-movie-marvel-mcu-1851786852"><i><span>Fantastic Four: First Steps</span></i></a> <span>and the upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-4-cast-announcement-stream-mcu-marvel-1851772474"><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday</span></i></a><span>, posted a photo of himself with Kimmel to his Instagram with the caption “Standing with you @jimmykimmellive Defend #FreeSpeech Defend #DEMOCRACY.” Pascal also <a href="https://kotaku.com/mandalorian-grogu-trailer-disney-boycott-2000627542">plays the Mandalorian in&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em></a>.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>Mark Ruffalo, who plays the Hulk in the MCU, has been vocally supporting Kimmel since the decision was made last week, criticizing the Trump administration </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJewRRfp4K4"><span>during a No Kings stream on September 18</span></a><span>, saying this move was an attack on free speech. After it was reported that Disney’s </span><a href="https://collider.com/disney-stock-nosedive-dis-nyse-drop-boycott-reaction-jimmy-kimmel/"><span>stock had dropped</span></a><span> following the calls for a boycott (though some dispute if this seven-percent drop is anything more than a standard fluctuation), Ruffalo warned </span><a href="https://www.threads.com/@markruffalo/post/DO1CP-Jjtsj"><span>on Threads</span></a><span> that “It’s going to go down a lot further if they cancel his show.”</span></p> <p><span>Disney and Kimmel are reportedly currently in talks, looking for a </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney-late-night-comeback-1236524695/"><span>“compromise” to bring the late-night show back</span></a><span>, but there has been no official word on whether these talks have borne any fruit.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Exclusive Pokémon Merch Comes To Another Museum Despite Van Gogh Debacle]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/exclusive-pokemon-30th-anniversary-merch-museum-despite-van-gogh-2000627540</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-pok%C3%A9mon-merch-comes-to-another-museum-despite-van-gogh-debacle.1304367/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Natural History Museum of London is getting a Pokémon pop-up shop experience beginning in early 2026. It’ll have exclusive stuff fans can’t get anywhere else. It’s intended to be part of Pokémon’s 30th anniversary celebration. Why does it seem destined to be yet <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-van-gogh-museum-scalpers-pikachu-card-1850882131">another scalper-infested mess</a>?</p> <p>Fans will need to register for a free ticket to visit the Pokémon x Natural History Museum pop-up store, which will run from 26 January 2026 until 22 March 2026. If you can’t make it to London yourself, the merchandise will be available to buy from the <a href="https://www.nhmshop.co.uk/?srsltid=AfmBOorBseC_DhtYXMqRbGzy3Zxn6ye5OvDqVzxM9dHraX54OsyrcOM7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online Natural History Museum shop</a> as well, according to <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-GB/Go-wild-as-The-Pokemon-Company-International-and-Natural-History-Museu">today’s press release</a>. It’ll include clothing, stationery, accessories, prints, and a brand-new exclusive plush, all of which “are sure to delight fans of all ages.”</p> <p>“The Natural History Museum and Pokémon share a fascination for and focus on the natural world and its creatures, from their evolution to their environment,” reads a press release. “In the Pokémon world, Pokémon can evolve into many forms which allow them to adapt smoothly and perfectly to any environment. Meanwhile, the Natural History Museum’s halls take you on a journey through the evolution and diversity of life on planet earth, from prehistoric dinosaurs to the species we live alongside today.”</p>

 <p>While The Pokémon Company hasn’t teased exactly what the exclusive merch will be, it’s promising “products designed especially for the collaboration.” Whether that’s a fossil-centric approach to the franchise’s creatures or something else thematically appropriate remains to be seen. “Design inspiration has been drawn directly from the Natural History Museum’s iconic building and architecture, as well as the beautiful naturalist sketches that fill the Museum’s archives,” head of Pokémon Europe licensing Mathieu Galante said.</p>

 <p>It certainly can’t go any worse than what transpired in 2023 when Holland’s Van Gogh Museum had its own Pokémon pop-up shop. The frenzy of fans and the race to scalp products online for jacked-up prices left an unfortunate scar on the fandom’s collectors. Have things mellowed out two years later? Hardly. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900">steady growth of Pokémon market speculators</a> and the ongoing scarcity of what The Pokémon Company is able to get manufactured when it comes to cards, plushies, and other rare collectibles <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-plush-scalper-reseller-world-championships-2000618087">has left communities exhausted</a>.</p> <p>It’s not yet clear how The Pokémon Company<em>&nbsp;</em>plans to avoid similar issues with the Natural History Museum collaboration. Hopefully, it’s either produced enough stock to meet at least most of the demand, or found a way to limit what people can buy. The 30th anniversary of Pokémon begins February 27, 2026.</p>
