              <p>Windows may prove a perfectly suitable platform for gaming on a traditional PC, but on handheld devices like the ROG Ally, Legion Go, or even the Steam Deck, it’s another story. Microsoft’s operating system is often too clunky and frustrating when you’re restricted to a gamepad for input. The upcoming Xbox-branded Ally from Asus, however, has promised a solution with a dedicated, controller-friendly user interface for running PC games on the go. These devices have yet to hit shelves, but a downloadable preview of a new version of Windows 11 is giving folks access to the new interface on just about any Windows handheld device.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-microsoft-steam-deck-steamos-xbox-pc-handhelds-1851735440">Steam Ate Microsoft’s Lunch On PC, It’s About To Do The Same On Handhelds</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780388/microsoft-xbox-fullscreen-mode-windows-11-handheld-leak">As noted by <i>The Verge</i></a>, The upcoming 25H2 update for Windows 11 lets you launch the new gaming-focused, fullscreen Xbox app for Windows with just a few tweaks to the registry and the help of a third-party tool (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ROGAlly/comments/1niwsfi/guide_for_enabling_the_full_screen_experience_on/">a Reddit post by user Gogsi123</a> outlines the whole process). Unlike the overlay that software companies like Asus provide for their Windows handhelds, this new Xbox app skips the entire Windows desktop environment in favor of a fullscreen, controller-friendly experience. And people are finding, by way of the preview workaround, that it seems to lead to marginal performance gains as well.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-price-pc-gaming-handheld-asus-pre-order-2000622751">The Xbox Ally PC Gaming Handheld Feels Great, But At What Price?</a></p> <p>While this version of the fullscreen Xbox app requires some legwork to get working, its availability across Windows handhelds undercuts one of the main appeals of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-price-pc-gaming-handheld-asus-pre-order-2000622751">upcoming ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X</a>–which is <a href="https://kotaku.com/asus-ally-x-review-steam-deck-sd-card-battery-windows-1851600340">distinctly different from Asus’ ROG Ally X</a>–which is expected to arrive on October 16, 2025.</p> <h2>The ROG Xbox Ally X is less than a month away, and we’re still not sure of pricing</h2> <p>Though the best graphical experiences are still had on well-kitted PCs and cutting-edge consoles, we are in the midst of a handheld arms race kicked off by Valve three years ago when it launched the Steam Deck. Since then, other PC manufacturers have jumped in with Windows-based options. More recently, <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465">the power of the Switch 2</a> has made it something of a competitor in this space as well.</p>

 <p>It’s all the stranger, then, that we’re not actually sure exactly how much Microsoft and Asus’ collaboration is going to cost. According to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-retailer-leak-suggests-surprising-price-point">report from former <i>IGN</i> writer Destin Legarie</a>, a local Best Buy indicated that a $549 version and an $899 one would be available when he called to ask about it. If this is accurate, that puts the lower-tier version of the Xbox Ally at the same price as the smaller-capacity Steam Deck OLED, and within competitive pricing range of the current ROG Ally and Ally X, which retail for about $649 and $899, respectively.</p>  <p>Having enjoyed my time with the ROG Ally X, I can definitely attest to the value of having more games available on a handheld that’s running Windows instead of Valve’s Linux-based SteamOS, though I typically prefer the form factor and controller-focused interface of the Steam Deck. Now, if a few tweaks to the Windows registry can also give people that experience on a non-Xbox Ally X, I imagine it’ll be harder to find a use case for the Xbox Ally for those who already own a handheld gaming device and aren’t afraid to tinker with their machines.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I recently got to play more <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-framerate-fps-xbox-series-s-ps5-2000626043"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a>, but this time on the game’s two biggest maps, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bigger-maps-leak-datamine-eastwood-mirak-ea-bf-labs-2000618202">I had a blast playing in these big ol’ stages.</a> But when I got a chance to speak to the devs behind <em>Battlefield 6</em>, I had to ask a strange question: Do you all have a button that lets you blow up everything that is destructible in the franchise’s famously destructible maps? The answer was yes, and there’s a good reason why.</p> <p>During a Zoom interview with DICE producer Jeremy Chubb and design director Shashank Uchil, we talked about all the work that goes into making a big<a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-struggled-xbox-series-s-60-fps-switch-2-2000625487"><em> Battlefield</em></a> map and how much effort they put into remaking the iconic and beloved Operation Firestorm map, which will be available in <em>BF6</em> at launch. But, when our conversation veered into talking about how to balance maps that can blow up in all kinds of ways, I had to ask if they had a tool or button that lets them destroy everything in one click. So I asked and got a blunt answer:</p> <p>“Yeah,” said Chubb. I then asked if it was fun to hit that button, and both Chubb and Uchil replied, with laughter in their voices, that yes, it was indeed fun to hit that big button.</p>

 <p><span id="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d7e0" tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d7e1"><span title="Play starting at 21:44"><span data-start="1303560" data-end="1315620">“It is fun!” Chubb told <em>Kotaku</em> while laughing more. “It usually causes some big meltdowns in teams working on performance because we designed the maps not to be instantly triggered, like every instance of destruction [all at once]. </span></span></span><span id="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d7ec" tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d7ed"><span title="Play starting at 21:56"><span data-start="1315620" data-end="1317120">And [the button was pressed] a few times, and t</span></span></span><span id="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d7f8" tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d7f9"><span title="Play starting at 21:57"><span data-start="1317380" data-end="1321860" data-active="">here were some raised eyebrows about what we were doing for sure.”&nbsp;</span></span></span></p> <p>When I mentioned that EA should release GIFs of the maps completely blowing up after hitting that button, Uchil said that was a “good idea.” So you’re welcome, EA marketing team.</p>

  <h2>The reason for <em>BF6</em>‘s big red button</h2> <p>You might be wondering why there’s a button in Frostbite, the engine <em>BF6</em> is built on, that lets you blow up an entire map instantly. The answer is so that the team can easily playtest the map in its most destroyed state to make sure it’s still fun and balanced.</p> <p><span id="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d894" tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d895"><span title="Play starting at 22:36"><span data-start="1356460" data-end="1360900" data-active="">“So…think of the map as [having] three different states, right,” explained Uchil. “</span></span></span><span tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d8a1"><span title="Play starting at 22:41"><span data-start="1361360" data-end="1366080">The map starts out in a pristine state, or however it is meant to be at the beginning. </span></span></span><span id="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d8ac" tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d8ad"><span title="Play starting at 22:47"><span data-start="1367020" data-end="1369560">And then, as the map progresses, it gets more and more destroyed. </span></span></span><span id="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d8b8" tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d8b9"><span title="Play starting at 22:51"><span data-start="1370780" data-end="1375980">And towards the end, if everybody’s using a rocket launcher or C4, you hit peak destruction. </span></span></span><span tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d8c5"><span title="Play starting at 22:58"><span data-start="1377640" data-end="1383740">And like I said, the game has to be good in all three phases, the pristine phase, the in-between phase, and the final phase.”</span></span></span></p>

 <p>According to Uchil, the “big red button” is the best tool for quickly testing that final phase of each map.</p> <p>“You can see what is the worst-case scenario,” said Uchil.&nbsp; “<span tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d8e9"><span title="Play starting at 23:11"><span data-start="1390500" data-end="1391460">Is there enough cover? </span></span></span><span id="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d8f4" tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d8f5"><span title="Play starting at 23:12"><span data-start="1391800" data-end="1393320">Do we need to add some more things? </span></span></span>Do we need to bring some more assets s<span tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11d90d"><span title="Play starting at 23:15"><span data-start="1394920" data-end="1397200">o in the final stage, it’s still fun to play? </span></span></span>So yeah, that’s why we have the big button.”</p> <p>At this point, I was fully distracted by the idea of the button, and asked if anyone had ever pressed it by accident. That doesn’t seem to have happened, and because the maps weren’t built to instantly explode, it could lead to problems if it did.</p>

 <p><span id="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11da80" tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11da81"><span title="Play starting at 25:11"><span data-start="1510520" data-end="1522440">“I mean, we have times when you can crash a bunch of things,” said Uchil. “The destruction is meant to happen in parts. </span></span></span><span id="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11da8c" tabindex="-1" aria-describedby="L-BihKRdJcs9lwQgBgHKX9eA11da8d"><span title="Play starting at 25:24"><span data-start="1523580" data-end="1527720">But if everything explodes at the same time, then it would melt down your computer.”</span></span></span></p> <p>Now I hope someone is able to mod <em>Battlefield 6</em> after it launches on October 10 and either activate this button as part of a wild mod or recreate its functionality. I really just want to hit a big button and make an entire map go ka-boom. That sounds like a blast. And after talking to the devs, it seems they agree.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tina Romero, the daughter of the late filmmaker and creator of the modern zombie, <a href="https://kotaku.com/that-time-george-romero-almost-directed-a-resident-evil-1766259870">George A. Romero</a>, is making her directorial debut with, appropriately enough, a movie all about an invasion of the undead. But <em>Queens of the Dead</em> shakes up the formula by having the zombies attack an NYC party featuring drag queen performers and their friends.</p> <p><em>Queens of the Dead</em> is a new horror comedy mixing together drag queens and zombies, and it’s set to hit theaters in October. The first look at this upcoming flick is out now, and the movie looks fun. It also looks like a movie that might greatly upset and confuse your conservative grandpa, who loves Fox News. Here’s the trailer:</p>  <p>The new movie stars the always excellent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_O%27Brian">Katy O’Brian</a>, Nina West, Jack Haven, and others, and looks to split its action between a group of clubgoers and drag queens stuck in a warehouse party, and the happenings at a hospital in New York City during the zombie uprising. After watching this trailer, I’m on board for this spin on the classic zombie movie. It’s also great to see Romero continuing her father’s legacy of making zombie movies that aren’t just gory and scary, but also filled with characters and ideas that feel extremely relevant. Romero’s iconic horror movie, <em>Night of the Living Dead,</em> essentially created modern-day zombies, or ghouls as he often called them, and laid out the basic framework most zombie movies follow: People stuck in a place fight back the dead while dealing with each other.</p> <p>Here’s the official description for the film courtesy of IFC Films:</p> <blockquote><p>When a zombie apocalypse breaks out in Brooklyn on the night of a giant warehouse party, an eclectic group of drag queens, club kids, &amp; frenemies must put aside their drama and use their unique skills to fight against the brain-thirsty, scrolling undead.</p></blockquote> <p>In 2025, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/surprise-press-conference-reveals-trump-still-not-dead-2000622401">President Trump</a> and <a href="https://translegislation.com/">other Republicans cracking down on LGBTQ people</a> and anything they deem “different,” a movie about a horde of nasty zombies trying to destroy a safe place for drag queens and queer folk seems pretty dang perfect. I’d bet George would be proud of his daughter’s first theatrical film. Before this, she had done TV and smaller projects. I’m excited to check out <em>Queens of the Dead</em> when it arrives in theaters on October 24. Just in time for Halloween.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-steam-library-valve-discord-radicalization-2000626897</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It didn’t take long after law enforcement officials publicly identified a <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-helldivers-bullet-engraving-2000625439">suspect in the Charlie Kirk assassination</a> for people online to begin combing the internet looking for his digital footprint. One of the profiles they found appeared to be his Steam account which, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-18/suspected-kirk-shooter-s-gaming-history-probed-by-secret-service?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true">according to <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, is now being investigated by the Secret Service.</p> <p>That’s because 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who was charged earlier this week with murdering Kirk at a speaking event last week, reportedly used Donald Trump’s name as an alias on the Valve-owned gaming storefront at one point. Sources told <em>Bloomberg</em> the reference to the president is what led to the Secret Service’s involvement despite the Homeland Security agency having no role in protecting Kirk at the time of the assassination.</p> <p>The Steam account many believe to belong to Robinson shows thousands of hours spent playing games like <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>, and <em>Counter-Strike</em>. The handful of public Steam reviews he seemingly authored were indistinct from the thousands of others posted for those games. People have also been combing through his apparent Steam inventory, which includes hats, trading cards, and other unlockables.</p>

 <p>Steam is among those gaming-affiliated internet platforms <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-discord-politics-helldivers-memes-2000626029">which have been called to Congress</a> next month to testify about online radicalization. The CEOs from Twitch, Discord, and Reddit have also been asked to participate. Despite a reference to <em>Helldivers 2</em> appearing on one of the casings left behind near the crime scene, there’s been little publicly disclosed evidence so far that gaming, memes, or any other part of the modern internet played much of a role in driving Robinson to allegedly assassinate the right wing podcaster.</p> <p>“The politically motivated assassination of Charlie Kirk claimed the life of a husband, father, and American patriot. In the wake of this tragedy, and amid other acts of politically motivated violence, Congress has a duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence,” House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.)&nbsp;<a href="https://oversight.house.gov/release/chairman-comer-invites-ceos-of-discord-steam-twitch-and-reddit-to-testify-on-radicalization-of-online-forum-users/">announced on Wednesday</a>.</p> <p>But <a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/exclusive-leaked-messages-from-charlie">leaked Discord chats and interviews</a> with friends have so far offered little that would suggest Robinson’s history with gaming and the internet were uniquely worrying, or different from those of most other people his age.</p>
