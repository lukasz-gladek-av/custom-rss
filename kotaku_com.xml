            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-5-reunion-chloe-max-summary-plot-leak-2000658198">The rumors were true</a>. <em>Life Is Strange: Reunion</em> is coming, and it’s bringing Chloe Price back into the fold after 2024’s <em>Double Exposure&nbsp;</em>hinted at her return. Perhaps most surprisingly, however, it’s coming out in just two months.</p> <p>The official announcement is <a href="https://x.com/LifeIsStrange/status/2011829955592585531?s=20">set to go live at 1 p.m. Eastern</a>, but Xbox Wire posted <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/20/life-is-strange-reunion-reveal/">its announcement blog a bit early</a>.&nbsp;<em>Reunion&nbsp;</em>will star both Max Caulfield and Chloe as co-protagonists, with both having different gameplay mechanics. Max is able to rewind time as she did in the first&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em>, while Chloe will use her argumentative “Backtalk” mechanic from the prequel&nbsp;<em>Before the Storm</em>.</p>

 <p>The big question is how Chloe is able to return despite her possibly dying at the end of the original&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em>, a choice that&nbsp;<em>Double Exposure&nbsp;</em>made a point to import. Based on this line in the blog post, it seems like it may be as a result of the timeline jumping Max did in&nbsp;<em>Double Exposure</em>, though I expect the minutiae of this to be affected by which choice you made way back in 2015.</p> <blockquote><p>Chloe’s return may be due to Max’s power, in particular, the power Max gained in <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em>&nbsp;to Shift between parallel timelines — a power Max subsequently lost when she merged those timelines back together and recovered her ability to Rewind.</p></blockquote> <p>Whatever the case, it does seem like&nbsp;<em>Reunion</em> is not undoing either choice, as the blog says “Whether Chloe lived or died in Arcadia Bay, and whether she and Max were friends or lovers — these choices are key not just to the&nbsp;<em>past</em>&nbsp;you’ll confirm as you play, but to the&nbsp;<em>future&nbsp;</em>you’ll fight for the chance to build.” So I will hold judgement for the time being, and I won’t have to wait long, as&nbsp;<em>Reunion</em> is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on March 26.</p>

 <p>It’s very likely that more details will be coming when developer Deck Nine posts its actual announcement, so we’ll update this story with that info as it comes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo presidents past and present are in the news this week. One of 2025’s biggest blockbusters might finally have a Switch 2 release date again. And if you bought <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> and barely played it, you’re hardly alone. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture.</p> <p>It’s currently <a href="https://kotaku.com/reviews/backlog">Backlog Week around these parts</a>. I spent the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend playing a ridiculous amount of <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-october-november-2025-powerwash-sim-2-2000638198"><em>Dome Keeper</em></a> with my kids. It came to Game Pass recently and is a clever little roguelite tower defense game that’s surprisingly hard to put down. The winter doldrums are ending this week, though. Lots of fresh 2026 releases are just around the corner.</p>

 <h2><em>Borderlands 4</em> seems slated to finally release on Switch 2 in February</h2> <p>A store listing on Portuguese site <em><a href="https://www.gamingreplay.com/pt/pre-reservas-nintendo-switch-2/32061-borderlands-4-game-key-card-switch-2-5026555072694.html">GamingReplay</a></em> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-date/"><em>TheGamer</em></a>) states a release date of February 27, 2026 for the sci-fi sequel. That’s a Thursday, so that tracks. It also puts it after a potential February Nintendo Direct to perhaps remind everyone it’s still coming. The port was <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-delay-cross-save-performance-2000628055">indefinitely delayed</a> last fall as Gearbox Entertainment addressed performance issues with the PC version of the loot shooter.</p> <h2>It’s a good thing<em> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> didn’t charge by gameplay minute actually completed</h2> <p>Alinea Analytics’ <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rhyselliott_my-ps5s-an-xbox-now-apparently-earlier-share-7417556440577470464-cl55/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhys Elliot recently pointed out</a> (via <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-sold-just-over-a-million-copies-on-ps5-but-50-of-gamers-played-just-15-hours-before-quitting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>FRVR</em></a>) that while <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> sold over 1 million copies on PS5, about half of those buyers played less than 15 hours of the sprawling RPG. The Steam data is similarly stark. <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/oblivion-remastered-ps5-half-players-15-hours/">Per <em>TheGamer</em></a>, only 55 percent of PC players got the game’s first story quest achievement, only 11 percent entered the Shivering Isles, and only 7.5 percent completed the main quest.</p>

 <h2><em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em> just had its best sales month in over 8 years</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sales for both BG3 and D:OS 2 have been incredible since the announcement of  Divinity. </p> <p>D:OS 2 really surprised us by having its best month since release in 2017.  Wish I’d removed the squirrel in time 🙂 <a href="https://t.co/fXTEUtuS7r">https://t.co/fXTEUtuS7r</a></p> <p>— Swen Vincke @where? (@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/2013481225030094906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The announcement of <em>Divinity</em> in December spurred players to return to both<em> Baldur’s Gate 3</em> and the 2017 RPG. No doubt part of that was a big Switch 2 upgrade and a half-off sale.</p>

 <h2><em>World of Warcraft</em> veteran will work on Riot’s MMO</h2> <p>Blizzard producer Raymond Bartos has joined Riot Games (via <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2026/01/19/riot-games-unnamed-mmorpg-project-picks-up-a-former-world-of-warcraft-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cy="styled-link"><em>MassivelyOP</em></a>). “I’m incredibly excited to be joining Riot on the MMO team!!!” he posted. “I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity to join such an inspiring group of people, and I can’t wait to get started — showing up every day to provide value for Riot gamers and help deliver an MMO experience players truly enjoy.” He’ll be back with past collaborator Orlando Salvatore and said he thinks the team will be “moving fast on day one.”</p> <h2>New <em>Fable</em> art work has surfaced</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fable | Concept Art<a href="https://t.co/OuQzqybQut">https://t.co/OuQzqybQut</a> <a href="https://t.co/ci23N0n0xW">pic.twitter.com/ci23N0n0xW</a></p> <p>— Klobrille (@klobrille) <a href="https://twitter.com/klobrille/status/2013499425688039483?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It looks very neat (via<em> <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fable-rebootconcept-art-showcase-locations">MP1st</a></em>). Will it be a modern open-world RPG? Who knows. But hopefully at least some of the game’s scenes can match the promise of its concept art. Will it actually come out in 2026? I’m still skeptical.</p>

 <h2>A message from Nintendo of America’s new leader</h2> <p>Recently promoted veteran Devon Pritchard appeared in a video at the New York Game Awards to encourage the next generation of creators (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-of-americas-new-president-devon-pritchard-makes-her-first-industry-appearance-since-taking-on-the-role/"><em>VGC</em></a>). “And remember, like any good video game character, you’re on an adventure, and every step you take matters,” she said. “There are some gnarly bosses, sure, but also many good friends along the way who will support you and powerful rewards for those who persevere. So, keep believing, keep playing, and know that you truly belong in this game.”</p> <h2>Doug Bowser joins Hasbro’s Board of Directors</h2> <p>The ex-Nintendo of America president <a href="https://newsroom.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-announces-additions-board-directors">will now be part of the corporate governance team</a> overseeing the owner of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, <em>Transformers</em>, and more. Is this the first step toward Nintendo doing a Universes Beyond <em>MTG</em> set? Probably not but I would, against my better judgement, buy the hell out of one.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-baldurs-gate-3-takedown-2000660987">A<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> VR mod has been nuked after its creator tried to charge people for it</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-lawsuit-ubisoft-marc-alexis-cote-hexe-2000660833">The former head of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> is suing Ubisoft over allegedly pushing him out of the company</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/i-cant-stop-flicking-coins-and-hiring-tiny-dudes-in-this-new-steam-game-2000660664">This coin-flicking indie game is surprisingly good</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <title><![CDATA[Every Old Game Deserves A 60FPS Update]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/every-old-game-deserves-a-60fps-update-2000661290</link>
            <guid>1411039</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Returning to old games isn’t always easy. Depending on how old the game is, you might run into various problems, including unusual controls or compatibility issues. Another common point of friction you might encounter is an older game running poorly. This can make it a slog to replay some of the modern classics, even if they’re just a decade or so old. So I’m happy to see Ubisoft going back and updating performance in games like <em>Far Cry Primal</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed Unity.</em></p> <p>Over the weekend, Ubisoft announced that <em>Far Cry 3 Classic</em> is getting an update on January 21 that will let it run at a smoother, higher 60FPS on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. It’s a free patch and, assuming nothing breaks, it should just work once players have updated the remastered version of the tropical shooter. Later, on January 19, Ubisoft announced that<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3mcrtpa5iy22r"><em> Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon Classic Edition</em> is also getting a 60FPS patch</a> on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. And then, on Tuesday, Ubisoft revealed that<em> Far Cry Primal,</em> the primitive-era caveman spin-off, is getting a 60FPS patch for those same platforms. Both of these are landing on January 21, too.</p>

  <p>Updating three older PS4-era games for free to add in performance improvements on newer consoles is cool enough. But Ubisoft has actually been doing this for a bit now. In December 2025, <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/2001336590119866505?lang=en">Ubisoft updated the OG <em>Division</em> on PS5 to unlock 60FPS.</a> Last year, Ubisoft updated <em>Far Cry 4</em> for current-gen machines, and now it runs like butter at 60FPS. In 2024, <em>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</em> got <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/fuCzsNMoMUkbdiYyJCWQU/assassins-creed-syndicate-60-fps-console-patch-out-now">a nifty 60FPS patch for free as well</a>. And the year before that, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/6b7bacKsgYhFEhoamVRmx2/far-cry-5-gets-60-fps-patch-for-xbox-series-xs-ps5"><em>Far Cry 5 g</em>ot a 60FPS patch</a> for Xbox Series X/S and PS5.</p> <p>Ubisoft doesn’t have to do this. A lot of publishers don’t do this, which you can tell by all the people in the comments below Ubisoft’s announcements begging for similar updates to other games from other companies. And look, sometimes, it’s not an option. Some games are built around 30FPS and updating them is very tricky or too resource intensive. It’s not impossible, though. Just look <a href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-60fps-mod-hack-remaster-sequel-ps5-dmca-1851752593">at fan updates to <em>Bloodborne</em></a>.</p>

 <p>Still, if you can update an older game without too much trouble to get it running at 60FPS or higher, I think it’s a smart move. From a business point of view, Ubisoft can now continue to market these older games and likely sell new copies. <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-tv-show-alien-earth-hulu-disney-rob-mac-2000647139">And with a<em> Far Cry</em> TV show in the works at FX</a>, Ubisoft has already ensured that if the show is a hit, people coming back to the older games it was inspired by will find a 60FPS experience that matches many of today’s games.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, for me, these updates make it more likely that I’ll return to one of these classic Ubisoft games in the future if I feel the urge to stab people in the throat. Which franchise am I talking about? Either. Both. My point is that I’m a bit of a performance snob when it comes to games, and returning to the choppy 30FPS era of the PS4 and late Xbox 360 is always painful for my eyes and never feels great. Emulation isn’t really a solution either, as PS4 emulation is currently still in its early stages and not nearly as robust as what you’ll find in modern PS2 or PS3 emulators.</p> <p>So it’s very helpful that Ubisoft is going back and doing the work to get its back catalog of PS4-era games, including some bangers like<em> Far Cry 4</em>, running at 60FPS. <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-even-is-a-video-game-backlog-in-2026-2000659435">I mean, I don’t really need more games to add to my damn backlog,</a> but still, thanks.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[SNL’s Stranger Things Skit Stokes The Flames Of A Dying Fan Fire]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/saturday-night-live-snl-stranger-things-finn-wolfhard-2000661307</link>
            <guid>1410985</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> actor Finn Wolfhard hosted </span><i><span>Saturday Night Live</span></i><span> over the weekend, and given the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><span>online shitshow that’s transpired</span></a><span> since Netflix’s horror series wrapped up last month, the sketch comedy show had a lot of material to work with. Like most episodes of </span><i><span>SNL</span></i><span>, this one had its assortment of</span> <span>hits and misses, but particularly noteworthy was its </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>spoof, which touched on the backlash that has sprung up in the wake of the finale and mentioned the widespread Conformity Gate conspiracy theory which proposed the existence of a secret, “better” ending to the series.</span></p>  <p><span>Wolfhard’s monologue may not have touched on the backlash </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ final season has received online, but it has come under some fire for some low-hanging misogynistic jokes. The former child actor talks about growing up on the Netflix show over the past decade, and says the first time he learned what a woman looked like “down there” was captured on camera during the show. We then cut to a clip of his character Mike seeing a Demogorgon open its monstrous jaws. You get it? Vaginas are scary! Like a flesh-eating monster!</span></p>

  <p><span>Thankfully the show’s actual </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>skit fared better, envisioning Netflix milking the series into multiple spin-offs, including a </span><i><span>Sex and the City </span></i><span>parody starring Wolfhard’s character as a writer in ‘90s New York City. However, it too has come under fire for what some are calling a tasteless joke about Lucas’ future sex life with partner Max, who now “just lies there like she’s back in that coma,” a reference to her character being in a coma during the show.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Meanwhile, the skit’s joke about Will’s infamous coming-out scene in season 5, which fans </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-coming-out-scene-will-byers-season-5-2000655961"><span>said was sweet but a bit hokey and longwinded</span></a><span>, has gotten an absurd bad-faith response from some viewers. </span><i><span>SNL</span></i><span>’s skit jokes that Will isn’t getting a spin-off because this coming-out scene is still going on. The choice to poke fun at the scene has been </span><a href="https://x.com/w1llb1yers/status/2012864726955380789?s=20"><span>deemed homophobic</span></a><span>, to which I say, making fun of the scene’s notorious length is not the same as making a joke at the expense of gay people.</span></p>

 <p><span>The real joke of note is the skit’s direct reference to the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704"><span>Conformity Gate conspiracy</span></a><span> which posits that a secret ninth episode that will “fix” the divisive finale is on the way. Wolfhard and two of his co-stars reunite on a mountaintop in Iceland, and Wolfhard exclaims that “everything we thought happened was an illusion that was planted by Vecna.” When asked for “one good reason” why they should believe him, Wolfhard responds, “How about eleven?” at which point Kenan Thompson steps in for Millie Bobbie Brown, holding an Eggo waffle and spouting gibberish.</span></p>

 <p><span>Though the </span><i><span>SNL </span></i><span>episode has come and gone, the Duffer Brothers were in attendance, and some </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fans unhappy with the ending </span><a href="https://x.com/bylerhughes/status/2012800392644436357?s=20"><span>heckled them in public</span></a><span> as they were leaving the venue.</span></p> <p><span>The Conformity Gate conspiracy has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-conformity-gate-secret-netflix-crash-2000658155"><span>mostly died down at this point</span></a><span>, though some true believers are moving the goalpost and saying that it might still be coming. While some cast members have been hesitant to comment on it directly, actor Joe Keery has </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@bbcradio1/video/7595593028492856598"><span>flatly denied that any such episode exists</span></a><span>.</span></p>
