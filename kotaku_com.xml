Developed by Nixxes Software, which has collaborated on tons of other Sony ports that didn’t have day-one issues, Insomniac Games’ open-world comic book game appears to be giving even players with powerful gaming rigs trouble unless they drastically dial down the settings. </p><p>“After my excitement to swing through New York City, I ran into significant technical problems with <em>Spider-Man 2</em> on my RTX 4090,” one Steam player wrote. “Despite having a high-end GPU and running the latest NVIDIA drivers (566.36), the game frequently crashes with graphics controller errors.”</p><figure id="" data-id="b8d2db4a418363e1419ef45261163fab" data-recommend-id="image://b8d2db4a418363e1419ef45261163fab" data-format="png" data-width="1599" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Steam users review Spider-Man 2.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> Another was similarly flummoxed. “Hold off on buying until they get a couple of stabilization patches out because holy hell,” they wrote. “To say this is ‘rough’ is an understatement. Lighting doesn’t load in some cutscenes, those same scenes run at seconds-per-frame, audio desync issues up the wazoo, freezing, stuttering, and just about every other performance issue I can think of.”</p><p>Lots of players report requesting refunds from Steam until a patch or two can sort out the trouble. Others have spent so much time trying to optimize settings to stop the game from crashing that they’ve exceeded the refund limit. “I can’t even refund this now because I’ve spent more time trying to optimize this game than actually playing it,” one wrote. “Worst birthday gift ever.”</p><p>This isn’t the first Sony port to get heavily criticized  at launch. <em>The Last of Us Part I</em> came to PC in even rougher shape. Updates subsequently solved most of the problems, and it currently has a 94 percent rating among recent reviewers. But it raised questions around why Sony would release the game if things were in such poor shape. Then again, we’ve seen lots of big blockbusters struggle day-one on PC as developers perform triage on unique issues isolated to certain PC gaming setups that couldn’t be tested during production. </p><p>We’ll see how long it takes <em>Spider-Man 2</em> to get sorted out. It’s one of 2023's best games and something that no doubt has the potential to look even better on PC than it did when it first came to PS5.  <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Warner Bros. then took the unusual step of un-releasing the game, continuing development on it, and launching a new version early in 2024. Despite the comeback, however, it never managed to build up the same following it had the first time around. </p><p><em>MultiVersus</em>’ <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/multiversus-buy-lives-microtransaction-bug-campaign-1851523162&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/multiversus-buy-lives-microtransaction-bug-campaign-1851523162">monetization model</a></span> didn’t do it any favors, either. Players complained about the cost of unlocking characters for local tournament play and the general grindy-ness for those who don’t spend lots of extra cash.</p><p>This is the latest game Warner Bros. has bailed on just a year after release, with 2024's <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> also being unceremoniously put out to pasture after struggling to find a following. </p><p>“This decision was not made lightly. All of us on the Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games teams have put our heart and soul into <em>MultiVersus</em>, creating a unique social and cooperative experience from the ground up that brings together a variety of popular characters and worlds,” the development team wrote on the game’s FAQ page. “We are very proud of the game we’ve built and are incredibly thankful for the support of the <em>MultiVersus</em> community throughout this journey. Your passion and enthusiasm have been unmatched.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
