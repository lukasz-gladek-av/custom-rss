In the show, the gruesome struggle for survival is a spectator sport in which The Front Man and the competition operators allow a select group of rich, masked douchebags to watch the games on television screens—like a sports bar for the perverse.</p><p>In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/squid-game-season-3-netflix-saw-black-mirror-circle-1851785257&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/squid-game-season-3-netflix-saw-black-mirror-circle-1851785257">Season 3</a></span>, the sadistic voyeurism goes to scarier depths when we find out some VIPs are given the chance to dress up as guards and execute contestants who didn’t finish the game properly. These are the people who personify the term “insanely rich.” Dong-hyuk said those people share a connection with one of the richest men in the world.</p><p>“Everybody talks about him. Not only is he the head of a huge tech company that controls the world, almost, but he’s also this showman. After writing [Season 3], of course I thought, ‘Oh, some of the VIPs do kind of resemble Elon Musk.’”</p><p>This isn’t the first time he’s noted the parallels between his imaginary class of elitists and the ones all over the news. In a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/squid-game-director-season-2-hwang-dong-hyuk-netflix-interview-1234670491/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/squid-game-director-season-2-hwang-dong-hyuk-netflix-interview-1234670491/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2021 interview with <em>IndieWire</em></a></span>, released a month after <em>Squid Game</em> premiered, he said President Donald Trump reminded him of one of the VIPs in the first season because “it’s almost like he’s running a game show, not a country, like giving people horror.” He told <em>Time</em> years later that the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol “was also part of the current events that inspired me.”</p><p>Truly, these are the reasons shows like <em>Squid Game</em> draw massive audiences. Economic imbalances afford certain groups of people the ability to watch those less fortunate desperately fight and kill for resources others&nbsp;have in abundance, resources they can frivolously spend on things like kicking back and taking in this brutal spectacle. <em>Squid Game</em> is far from a documentary, but as Dong-hyuk has all but admitted, it is a product of its time.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/netflix-squid-game-season-3-elon-musk-donald-trump-1851785435]]></content:encoded>

When they defeat someone in this metaphysical space, the target’s real-world counterpart has a “change of heart” and repents for their crimes.

While the original group were facing serious issues of systemic corruption, and here it appears they’re facing a petty criminal with a pro-wrestler name, it’s not quite the downgrade it seems. The Subway Slammer, also known as Takeyuki Kiuchi, is a disgraced baseball player who has since retired from the sport and gone to work at a corporate desk job. His athletic career ended after a sexual harassment scandal, and now all his misogynistic tendencies are manifesting in violent acts in Tokyo subway stations, because his “Shadow” in the metaverse is out of control.</p><p>Surely this must be dealt with, and the Phantom Thieves with their ability to enter the Metaverse and face these distorted villains are the ones to do it. But the over-the-top self-seriousness with which <em>The Phantom X </em>treats a guy with such a crass nickname, who so cartoonishly shoulder checks people on the subway, has made it perfect meme fodder for <em>Persona </em>fans. <em>The Phantom X </em>has been out overseas since last year, so some <em>Persona </em>fans were already well aware of this storyline. Now that it’s out worldwide, everyone is in on the joke.</p><p>To be fair, the issue <em>The Phantom X </em>is depicting here is an important one. There are plenty of real-world reports of subway station violence in big cities, sometimes ending in casualties as victims are pushed onto the tracks. The problem is that the game is depicting Kiuchi’s crimes in such a way that it lends itself to the kind of unintentional meme-bait that makes it hard to take seriously. X (formerly Twitter) user <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DeJected_Axe/status/1939373198505623932&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DeJected_Axe/status/1939373198505623932" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DeJected_Axe put it best</a></span> when they said calling him the Subway Slammer feels like giving him a “<em>Scooby-Doo </em>villain” nickname. It feels like the game isn’t treating his crimes with the gravity they deserve. How am I supposed to hear a grown man say “The whole subway’s mine for the slammin’” and not giggle softly to myself?</p><p>All that being said, it sounds like <em>The Phantom X</em>’s story probably gets better <em>later</em>. Yusuke Nitta, who worked as a scenario planner on the original <em>Persona 5</em> and its extended <em>Royal </em>edition, and as a writer on the tactical RPG <em>Tactica</em>, said in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1lnt17q/in_a_deleted_twitter_post_yusuke_nitta_revealed/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1lnt17q/in_a_deleted_twitter_post_yusuke_nitta_revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">deleted X post</a></span> that he wasn’t involved in the Subway Slammer story, and was brought on to write for the game in its third chapter. He apparently removed the post after he got “emotional” seeing the reaction to the Subway Slammer storyline, and said, “Rest assured, <em>P5X</em> will get more and more interesting from now on.”</p><p>I haven’t had a chance to boot up my copy of <em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em>, but I <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-5-the-phantom-x-gacha-rolls-preview-mobile-pc-1851783773&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-5-the-phantom-x-gacha-rolls-preview-mobile-pc-1851783773">did play a chunk of the Subway Slammer section</a></span> before the game launched. I don’t know if this makes me want to play the full game more or less. Maybe more? I gotta take down the greatest villain in <em>Persona </em>history, right?</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/persona-5-phantom-x-subway-slammer-villain-clips-gacha-1851785428]]></content:encoded>
