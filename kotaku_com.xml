              <p>Another month means another batch of <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-prime-gaming-free-pc-steam-games-january-2025-1851736481">“free” Amazon Prime games.</a> This time around, Amazon is giving away what I (and many others) consider to be one of the best PC games ever made: <em>Civilization 4.</em> Beyond that, you can currently grab the also-excellent<em> Into The Breach</em> for nothing and over the next week weeks, even more games will be available for Amazon Prime subscribers.</p> <p><a href="https://gaming.amazon.com/home">If you hop over to Amazon Prime Gaming</a> and are currently subscribed to Amazon Prime, you can snag PC copies of <em>Sid Meier’s Civilization 4: The Complete Edition,</em> <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Ravenloft Series</em>, and<em> Into the Breach.</em> Then, throughout the rest of September, Amazon will add more free games, including <em>Spelljammer, Pixel Cafe, and Tower of Time.</em> Even better, <em>Civ4</em>, <em>Spelljammer</em>, and other PC games given away this month are delivered via GOG codes, which means once you claim them, you own them completely with no DRM. Now ain’t that nifty!</p> <p>I personally think that <em>Civilization 4</em> is the pinnacle of the series, <a href="https://kotaku.com/let-s-rank-the-civilization-games-worst-to-best-1842571299/6">even if former <em>Kotaku</em> writer Luke Plunkett prefers <em>Civ5</em> over it</a>. Yeah, some bits of it are a little tedious and annoying, but the vibes are immaculate, and most of it still holds up perfectly today. Plus, it will run easily on any modern PC. If you were let down by <em>Civ6</em> or <em>Civ7</em>, check out <em>Civilization 4</em>. Just set aside like 9 hours of your day first, as it will consume them in a flash.</p>

 <p>Here’s the full list of games, as well as when they will be available for free on Amazon Prime and which storefronts they use. Oh, and keep in mind these are all PC games; sorry, console-only players.</p> <h3>Now available</h3> <ul> <li>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Ravenloft Series (GOG Code)</li> <li>Into The Breach (Epic Games Store)</li> <li>Sid Meier’s Civilization 4: The Complete Edition (GOG Code)</li> </ul> <h3>September 11</h3> <ul> <li>Afterimage (Amazon Games App)</li> <li>Spelljammer: Pirates of Realmspace (GOG Code)</li> <li>Tower of Time (GOG Code)</li> <li>Subterrain: Mines of Titan [(Amazon Games App)</li> </ul> <h3>September 18</h3> <ul> <li>Residual (GOG Code)</li> <li>Fate: The Cursed King (GOG Code)</li> </ul> <h3>September 25</h3> <ul> <li>Mystical Riddles: Ghostly Park Collector’s Edition (Legacy Games Code)</li> <li>Pixel Cafe (Amazon Games App)</li> </ul> <p>Also, some games added in previous months are still floating around on Amazon Prime Gaming’s site, so if you haven’t grabbed those freebies yet and you’re a Prime subscriber, you should check out everything on the site. You may find a few hidden gems still waiting to be played.</p>
