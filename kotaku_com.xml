              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-changer-deja-vu-video-game-dropout-tv-1851449932"><em>Game Changer&nbsp;</em>has become a popular online TV show</a>, probably because it’s fun to watch such masterfully controlled chaos. The series, which just aired its seventh season finale exclusively on Dropout, is all about forcing comedians to play different, often bizarre games, without any of the contestants being told in advance what the game is, how it works, or how you even win.</p> <p>For example, in a recent episode, three comedians were placed in velcro body suits and then forced to spin a wheel covered in modifiers and rules that they had to apply to their bodies each time they spun the wheel. Stuff like “Always be smiling” or “Be rude.” As the rules piled up, the contestants began to turn on each other, and eventually it all resulted in the game’s host becoming a contestant. It’s weird, hilarious, and unlike anything else on TV. I wanted to learn more about how it all works, so I sat down with <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-changer-dropout-video-game-sam-reich-interview-dimension-20-2000616708">Dropout CEO and <em>Game Changer</em> host Sam Reich</a> to talk about how he and his crew design multiple unique, funny, and strange games for their comedians to play each season, and all the work involved. I was shocked to learn that for most of <em>Game Changer</em>‘s run, they’ve avoided playtesting and just hoped things would work out on the day.</p>  <p>“Yeah, people, I think, would be scandalized to know that [season seven is the first time] we did any game testing,” said Sam Reich during our Zoom interview. He laughed about it and explained that there were some exceptions, like an escape room episode in 2023, but for the most part, they historically haven’t done much playtesting at all, at least before the most recent season.</p>

 <p>So if the show has mostly avoided playtesting, I asked Reich how they knew a game or an episode idea was ready for production, and once again I was surprised by how wild <em>Game Changer</em>‘s production is. Reich told me, “I think there’s probably a few different answers to that question. One is we don’t. <span>And we do it anyway.” We both laughed at the response.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>“The second [answer] is that, particularly in earlier seasons of <em>Game Changer,</em> a lot of our games were loosely inspired by games that already exist, whether they’re improv games or other games. There’s a lot of ‘this-meets-that’ going on. And in that sense, we kind of know something like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EbvU8OZtqI">Like My Coffee</a> is going to work, because it’s based on a popular improv game that we’re just doing our spin on.”</p> <p><span>“The reason why game testing becomes more relevant now as the seasons climb up is because, by virtue of the show going on and by virtue of us backing ourselves into a corner where originality is more and more hard to come by, we can’t afford to be derivative anymore. Like we have to be more inventive,” explained Reich.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Sam Says | Game Changer [Full Episode]" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vT-zZsjwZKk?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Another common problem that Reich and his team of talented writers and creators run into when coming up with ideas for new <em>Game Changer</em> episodes is making sure an idea is funny for more than a minute and has places to go throughout a full episode. A common pitch involves having the host and others speak in a foreign or gibberish language the comedians have to figure out. But while that sounds funny, Reich says it really has nowhere to go. The same is true of episode pitches built around lots of tiny games that aren’t connected thematically, including a pitch for a <em>Conclave</em>-like episode to replace Sam Reich with someone else.</p> <p><span>[The <em>Conclave</em> idea] becomes a kind of ‘who can be the best game show host?’ competition,” explained Reich. “But, the games don’t relate to each other enough…there’s no sort of journey of competence or discovery there. This gets into game design wonkiness. I’m really big on game design and it’s rare these days…that I’ll get excited about a game that feels like it’s just a series of mini games.”</span></p>

 <h2>How Dropout’s Sam Reich became a game designer</h2> <p>Reich’s thinking on this has come a long way since he started <em>Game Changer</em> back in 2019. As he told me when I asked if he realized he was going to have to become a full-time game designer to create a show like <em>Game Changer</em>:</p> <p><span>“I loved games, but I wouldn’t say that I loved games, like, more than the average person. I wasn’t a big board gamer,” said Reich. “</span><span>I’d probably done three escape rooms in my life. And thank God, because I think if I had been–if I had started <em>Game Changer</em> as the game designer I am today, I would have had far less room to grow into the show. Like in a way, I think my competence as a game designer has sort of grown as the show has grown and the budget has grown. </span><span>So if you start <em>Game Changer</em> from the beginning, you can kind of watch my journey as a game designer, which I think is fun.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p>Reich admitted to me that before starting <em>Game Changer</em>, he didn’t really know what the term “Balanced” meant in game design terms. Now, he consults often with table top, video game, and escape room designers as well as comedians to create the odd beast that is <em>Game Changer.</em> And while a lot of game design goes into the show, especially in its more recent seasons, it’s still a comedy series and the audience comes first, over rules, balance, or anything else.</p> <p><span>“Ultimately, I will break any rule in service of the audience or in service of entertainment,” said Reich. “It’s like, even if this isn’t a very well-balanced game, or even if it is a little clunky or whatever it is, we’ll plow forward with it if we think it’s going to be very entertaining. We’ve totally taken out clunky moments [in post-production].”</span></p>

 <h2><em>Game Changer</em> is falling apart, in a good way</h2> <p>And that clunky, sometimes messy, often chaotic nature of <em>Game Changer</em> is, according to Sam, one of the reasons it has connected with such a large audience. <span>“I would almost equate it to, like, <em>Saturday Night Live</em> in a way where it’s like, the fact that it’s live will always make it feel a little dangerous,” said Reich. “And that’s part of the fun.”</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Sam Stole Jacob's Blood For a Trivia Question 🩸" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tpwgC1Y2NDs?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>“There is sort of an excitement to every episode of <em>Game Changer</em>, which is like the excitement of: Is this even going to work? And I think that some games sort of require that more than others,” said Reich. “</span><span>Look, at the end of the day, we’re making a show and production schedules are what they are. And <em>Game Changer</em> always feels like a trust fall by the time we’re on the shoot day. [During the episode] Beat The Buzzer, I swear to you, five of those buzzers weren’t working in dress rehearsal. </span><span>We’re hanging on for dear life to this show,” explained Reich with a chuckle and a big smile.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>He did admit that he expects future episodes and seasons will feature a lot more playtesting as ideas get bigger and games get more complicated. But he also explained that he wants <em>Game Changer</em> to avoid the “sterile” and sometimes boring feel of popular big-budget game shows that have been on the air for decades, adding: </span><span>&nbsp;“In a way our show feels sort of like, um, it’s always falling apart a little bit. Just a little bit, which is a part of the fun, you know?” So don’t worry that future seasons of the hit series will playtest the life out of everything and make sure the game is perfectly balanced. There will still be plenty of chaos in the future.<br> </span></p> <p><a href="https://www.dropout.tv/game-changer"><em>Game Changer</em>‘s season seven finale is now live on Dropout</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101"><em>Subnautica 2</em> publisher Krafton</a> has filed its answer to a complaint by Unknown Worlds cofounders alleging breach of contract. It accuses Charles Cleveland, Adam “Max” McGuire, and Edward “Ted” Gill of prioritizing a $250 million payout over the successful launch of the second-most-wishlisted game on Steam. The company said the veteran developers were fired “to prevent {them] from permanently damaging Unknown Worlds’ most valuable IP, the company itself, and its goodwill with its fans.”</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-lawsuit-krafton-unknown-worlds-delay-1851786439">In a lawsuit filed last month</a>, the cofounders claimed Krafton tried to sabotage <em>Subnautica 2</em>‘s planned Early Access launch this year to avoid paying a $250 million bonus it had agreed to at the time Unknown Worlds was sold if the studio hit certain revenue targets in 2025 and early 2026. The legal complaint alleged that Krafton violated the terms of the deal by overriding the studio’s independence and firing the cofounders without cause.</p> <p><a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/900707287/Defendant-s-Answer-to-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=ha0mUjTuK1JQkOU4QaYn">In its response filed on August 12</a>, Krafton denies most of the allegations in the original complaint and argues that it was the cofounders who were trying to rush <em>Subnautica 2</em> out into the wild despite being behind on its expected content scope. When the company tried to enlist the cofounders, who were not directly involved in the game’s development, to get it back on track, it says it was rebuffed. Krafton claims it had no choice but to remove them from the studio in order to protect <em>Subnautica 2</em> and prevent a disastrous launch.</p>

 <p>According to Krafton’s response, a development director at Unknown Worlds told Gill in 2023 that “folks think…Max and Charlie are checked out as studio heads and are confused as to why.” It accuses the cofounders of being more involved in passion projects than in getting<em> Subnautica 2</em>—which suffered delays throughout 2024—ready to ship.</p> <p>“Krafton was not willing to take the risk of the resulting damage to the <em>Subnautica</em> franchise and the Company’s long-term reputation–a risk that, if materialized, would be irreversible, as shown with <a href="https://kotaku.com/olliolli-world-rollerdrome-kerbal-space-program-2-1851450223"><em>Kerbal Space Program 2</em></a>,” the filing reads. “As Unknown Worlds’ sole stockholder, Krafton had invested $500 million in the success of not only <em>Subnautica 2</em>, but also <em>Subnautica 3</em>, <em>Subnautica 4</em>, and any other future<em> Subnautica</em> franchise product.”</p> <p><em>Subnautica 2</em> is currently scheduled to arrive sometime in 2026 and Krafton has promised bonus payouts to the remaining staff at Unknown Worlds despite the delay. Many fans on the subreddit, initially incensed by the sudden upheaval at the studio, have sounded increasingly burnt out on the back-and-forth volleys of accusations. At the rate at which most legal battles unfold, they’ll likely be playing the sequel long before the $250 million dispute is settled.</p> <p>“We believe the facts speak for themselves,” Krafton wrote in a statement today. “This answer reflects our commitment to protecting both the<em> Subnautica</em> IP and the global community that has supported it for years.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The hit 2024 survival crafting sim <em>Palworld</em> is conspicuously absent from the Nintendo eShop amid an ongoing battle with Nintendo, which has <a href="https://kotaku.com/palworld-pokemon-company-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-1851652124">accused the game of violating its patents</a>. The same can’t be said for <em>Palland</em>, a cheap knock-off that Nintendo seemed to have no problem approving for sale on the Switch eShop earlier this summer.</p> <p>Glance at the store listing for <em>Palland</em> (via <em><a href="https://nintendosoup.com/palworld-ripoff-palland-launches-on-nintendo-switch/">NintendoSoup</a></em>) and you’ll instantly clock it as a <em>Palworld </em>clone. Like much of the knock-off slop that crowds digital storefronts, it’s a simplified version of an existing game that mimics the art style and marketing more than the actual gameplay. Published on July 31 by BoggySoft, the $10 game bills itself as a base-building survival sim in which you harvest resources and kill stuff. What it doesn’t mention is anything about collecting creatures that look strikingly similar to certain Pokémon.</p> <p>“<em>Palland</em> delivers a rich and immersive experience where base-building, combat, exploration, and evolution blend into one dynamic and strategic journey,” reads the description. Gameplay footage uploaded by various people on YouTube shows the reality: an avatar who looks straight out of<em> Palworld</em> running around boring fields fighting cute creatures with incredibly low-budget animations.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Palland - Nintendo Switch / Switch 2 Compatible gameplay release" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5cgDinhbB9k?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>What <em>Palland</em> is missing that got <em>Palworld</em> in trouble are Pokémon mechanics like getting creatures to low-health, aiming not-Poké-Balls at them to capture them, and later being able to ride on their backs. Those are the gameplay loops Nintendo said <em>Palworld</em> maker Pocketpair violated its patents for, leading to a lawsuit filed last year. <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/palworld-pocketpair-nintendo-pokemon-lawsuit-whats-next">As reported by <em>Game File</em></a>, Pocketpair has been implementing a series of tweaks beginning last November to each of these mechanics to address Nintendo’s legal complaints, although it remains for the court to decide if the updates go far enough.</p> <p>While Nintendo might not have a problem with <em>Palland</em> since its creatures aren’t obvious knock-offs of Pokémon and it isn’t selling tens of millions of copies, the proliferation of games like <em>Palland</em> is a clear problem for developers on storefronts like the eShop. In addition to lots of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-psn-playstation-store-ai-slop-brainrot-junk-spam-1851786494">other generic AI slop</a>, it’s now common to see console storefronts quickly fill up with knockoffs of Steam games after they blow up in popularity on PC. PSN is already <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/1mgas2z/a_popular_game_on_steam_called_peak_just_recently/">chock full of <em>Peak</em> clones</a>.</p> <p>That was part of the irony of Sony <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-tencent-sony-lawsuit-knockoff-steam-art-2000616608">suing Tencent</a> over its obvious <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> ripoff. While the publisher is quick to deal with rival companies allegedly infringing on its IP, small studios and solo devs are left to scream into the customer service void to try and get cheap cash-grab clones of their work policed on the PlayStation Store. You’ve heard of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/schedule-1-drug-dealing-sim-steam-big-hit-400k-indie-1851773695">2025 Steam sensation <em>Schedule I</em></a>, but can I interest you in some <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10015587"><em>Trippy Trader&nbsp;: Schedule &amp; Sell</em></a>? Unlike <em>Schedule I</em>, it’ll be available on PS4 later this month</p>
