Now, well-known TV writer Ronald D. Moore has confirmed he’s joined the project, adding that it’s already slated for at least two seasons. Also, he’s never really played the games because modern controls are just a pain in the ass. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196191" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="God Of War Ragnarök DLC: Spend 19 Minutes In Valhalla" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="1149" data-playlist="196191,196196,195922" data-current="196191"><div><p>God Of War Ragnarök DLC: Spend 19 Minutes In Valhalla</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196191/196191_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196191/196191_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196191/196191_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196191/196191_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21730.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p> “Right now I’m working on the adaptation of this video game called <em>God of War</em>, that Amazon has ordered two seasons of and they asked me to come in, I’m literally in the writers room and that’s my new thing,” Moore, best known for the 2004 <em>Battlestar Galactica</em> reboot<em>,</em> said on a recent episode of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu704p568-Y&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xu704p568-Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sackhoff Show with Katee Sackhoff</a></span> who starred in that show as Kara “Starbuck” Thrace  (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/fantasy-shows/god-of-war-tv-show-writer-reveals-amazon-has-already-ordered-two-seasons-and-that-he-cant-play-the-video-games-at-all/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/fantasy-shows/god-of-war-tv-show-writer-reveals-amazon-has-already-ordered-two-seasons-and-that-he-cant-play-the-video-games-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gamesradar</em></a></span>). </p><p>He added that he hasn’t played video games since the arcade days, however, and quickly bounced off the new <em>God of War </em>series. “The controllers now…” he said laughing, “Press R1. Which one’s R1? Oh, I’m dead! I can’t quite get a hold of that.”</p><p>If anyone else said this, gaming fans—a notoriously chill and reasoned bunch—would unleash a cacophony of online Kratos yells. Moore, who has credits on some of the most beloved TV episodes around, starting with <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em>, can probably get a pass. In fact, players will probably just be relieved that the project is continuing forwards with the involvement of such a veteran creative force. </p><p>Variety reported that the <em>God of War </em>TV show had to effectively <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-tv-show-amazon-last-of-us-expanse-1849895011?_gl=1*19e3ku1*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjMxNDI2Ny4xNi4xLjE3NDIzMTU0NzcuNDEuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-tv-show-amazon-last-of-us-expanse-1849895011?_gl=1*19e3ku1*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjMxNDI2Ny4xNi4xLjE3NDIzMTU0NzcuNDEuMC4w">start over from scratch</a></span> last year after <em>S</em>howrunner Rafe Judkins (<em>Wheel of Time</em>) and executive producers Hawk Ostby (<em>The Expanse</em>) and Mark Fergus (<em>Children of Men</em>) all simultaneously departed the project.

So, maybe Moore having no experience with the actual games will be a boon to the project. Or he can just watch a longplay on YouTube. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The studio believed it had taken all necessary steps to avoid any such action, but what the team hadn’t expected was for Nintendo to go after patents rather than copyright infringement.</p><p>“We did legal checks before <em>Palworld</em> released and they were all cleared in Japan,” Buckley remembers. “So obviously when the lawsuit was announced we were like, ‘What?’ And we went back to the lawyers, and the lawyers contacted the courts and asked, ‘What’s going on?’ and that’s when we realized it was patents they were going for.”</p><p><em>Palworld</em>’s monster designs have been under scrutiny for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-palworld-comparison-models-plagiarism-ai-1851192901&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-palworld-comparison-models-plagiarism-ai-1851192901">being incredibly similar to those of <em>Pokemon</em></a></span>, but Nintendo and The Pokemon Company’s lawsuit instead focused on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-patents-lawsuit-pocketpair-1851692965&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pokemon-palworld-patents-lawsuit-pocketpair-1851692965">patented mechanics</a></span>, like throwing an object to capture a critter. Buckley says the day the lawsuit happened was a dark time for the studio, and it even went as far as to hire additional security at an industry event as a precautionary measure.</p><p>“Pretty much everyone at Pocketpair is a huge fan, so it was a very depressing day, everyone heads down and walking in the rain,” he said. “It changed a lot of things for us. We were just about to release the PlayStation version, we were just about to go to Tokyo Game Show, so obviously we had to scale back a little bit and hire security guards and stuff like that.”</p><p>Despite all the controversy, <em>Palworld </em>has been a runaway success, having accumulated over 32 million players in the past year.
