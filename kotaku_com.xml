              <p>An indie game gets raked over the metaphorical coals over a split second in its Steam trailer. Remedy Entertainment gets a new boss. And the publisher of<em> Arc Raiders</em> might be involved in a new <em>StarCraft</em> shooter. It’s a very late edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. Who’s ready to <a href="https://x.com/conzmoleman/status/2020112379304972716">get into UncBall</a>?</p> <h2><em>Void War</em> is back on Steam after a dispute over shoulder pads</h2> <p>The <em>Warhammer</em>-inspired<em> FTL</em> mash-up was removed from Steam last month over a DMCA takedown request. Thought to possibly be someone trolling at the time, it turned out the 2025 strategy game was very much on the receiving end of <em>Warhammer</em> owner Games Workshop’s actual ire.</p>

 <p>“After over a week of no response, Games Workshop eventually replied to our email and confirmed the notice was theirs,” developer Tundra <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-issued-ftl-in-a-warhammer-40000-skin-steam-game-with-a-dmca-takedown-because-of-oversized-convex-shoulder-pads-with-a-metallic-rim-dev-says">told <em>IGN</em></a> in a statement. “They said their concern was limited to a specific shot from one of the trailers on the store page, arguing that certain elements could create the mistaken impression that<em> Void War</em> is associated with Games Workshop, specifically what they described as ‘the oversized convex shoulder pads with a metallic rim.'”</p>  <p>Tundra ended up pulling the trailer to make the whole thing go away and the game is back up on Steam. “While we disagree with their assessment, the simplest way to get the game back up and avoid getting bogged down in DMCA process was to remove that trailer and move on,” it wrote. What a great system Valve has for hashing out frivolous complaints!</p>

 <h2>The owner of <em>Arc Raiders r</em>eportedly gets involved with <em>StarCraft</em></h2> <p>Korean publisher Nexxon signed a cooperation agreement with Blizzard to help it develop a project in the <em>StarCraft</em> universe according <a href="https://www.dnews.co.kr/uhtml/view.jsp?idxno=202601301526154230994">to<em> Dnews</em></a> (via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexon-to-reimagine-starcraft-as-a-shooter-secret-project-underway.1429834/">ResetEra</a>). It was <a href="https://kotaku.com/blizzard-starcraft-far-cry-open-world-shooter-leak-fps-1851700828">previously reported</a> that Blizzard is working on bringing back <em>StarCraft</em> as an open-world first-person shooter. Maybe we’ll get an announcement or at least a tease for whatever this is at BlizzCon 2026.</p>

 <h2><em>Mewgenics</em> fans go full cringe mode</h2> <p>Edmund McMillen and co-developer Tyler Glaiel asked players of the new roguelike to go act like kittens in public to win stuff online. <a href="https://twitter.com/SimpleSushii/status/2020279382464737372">They did exactly that</a>.</p> <h2>Remedy Entertainment gets a new CEO</h2> <p>Jean-Charles Gaudechon will take the role on March 1 as the studio gets ready to launch<em> Control 2</em> and hopefully, eventually, maybe tell people what’s up with the <em>Max Payne</em> remakes. He has creative director Sam Lake’s endorsement. “He very much understands our wildly unique vision and the value of the Remedy Connected Universe,” the Remedy veteran <a href="https://x.com/SamLakeRMD/status/2020929412972282195">wrote</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Replaced</em> gets a free demo</h2> <p>Players can now go hands-on with Sad Cat Studios’ long-awaited, retro-futurist, pixel-art action game on Xbox and PC for themselves starting February 11. The game has been delayed a bunch but comes to Game Pass on March 12.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/littlestjeff1-epstein-files-fortnite-v-bucks-conspiracy-epic-2000666464">Epic calls the Jeffrey Epstein <em>Fortnite</em> account a hoax, but conspiracy theorists aren’t buying it</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gen-ai-roblox-maelle-2000666407">Roblox promotes genAI and immediately rips off <em>Clair Obscur</em></a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/danganronpa-hundred-line-kazutaka-kodaka-deceive-company-2000666463"><em>Danganronpa</em> dev explains the only way to get good games made is to lie to your boss</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <title><![CDATA[Borderlands 4 Is Steam Deck Verified, But I Wouldn’t Play It There If I Were You]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-steam-deck-verified-bad-mess-performance-fps-settings-2000667017</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> received a Steam Deck Verified badge. This should imply that the game is a great experience on <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-console-switch-horizon-zero-dawn-re-1848628507">Valve’s portable PC</a>. But that’s not the case. And worse, Gearbox removed the option to adjust the game’s advanced visual settings on Steam Deck for some strange reason.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">It’s no secret that when <em>Borderlands 4</em> launched late last year,</a> it had all kinds of performance problems on both console and PC. Patches helped a lot, but those first weeks were rough, with frequent crashes, FPS drops, and other issues making it hard to enjoy the open-world looter shooter. Since then, things have improved a lot. I’ve been replaying the game on PC and have had a great time. So I was hopeful that the recent news that <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/2019094762159214993"><em>Borderlands 4</em> is now Verified on Steam Deck</a> meant it would be a great way to play the game away from my desk. Well, that ain’t the case at all.</p>

  <p>As documented by a few different channels on YouTube, <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Steam Deck is technically playable, but looks extremely rough, features plenty of input lag, runs poorly at its default settings, and doesn’t at all seem worthy of Steam’s Verified badge. That’s supposed to signal to players that a game will be a great experience with no tweaking needed on the aging portable PC. But that’s simply not true of <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Steam Deck.</p>  <p>But the weirdest part of <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Steam Deck is that for some odd reason, Gearbox has removed the advanced visual settings submenu from the game when playing on the portable PC. Yeah. I don’t know why Gearbox would do this, as it just makes it trickier for your average user to tweak <em>Borderlands 4</em> and make it possibly run a bit better on the Steam Deck. You can’t change the game’s resolution, shadow quality, draw distance, etc. It’s a baffling choice that makes an already bad way to play this game even worse.</p>

 <p>While Gearbox deserves some blame, I also think Valve needs to overhaul or update its Verified system. <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-verified-valve-ff7r-avowed-ninja-gaiden-2000637741">It’s becoming more and more common</a> to find Verified Steam Deck games that don’t seem to deserve that green checkmark at all. And as the Deck gets older, <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2024-big-games-unplayable-space-marine-2-pc-1851669933">this problem is only going to get worse</a>.</p>

 <p>Seeing how <em>Borderlands 4</em> runs on Steam Deck might provide some insight as to why Gearbox and 2K have indefinitely <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-delay-cross-save-performance-2000628055">delayed the Switch 2 port that was announced ahead of the game’s launch</a>. Maybe that version will one day see the light of day, but if it does, I really hope it looks and plays better than what I’m seeing on Steam Deck.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Riot’s New Fighting Game Is Already Imploding As It Lays Off 80 Developers Less Than a Month After Coming To Console]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/2xko-layoffs-league-legends-riot-update-2000666998</link>
            <guid>1430521</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>2XKO</em> hasn’t even finished its <a href="https://kotaku.com/2xko-ps5-league-legends-fighting-game-issues-2000661845">first month out on PlayStation 5</a> and Xbox Series X/S and Riot Games is already cutting its losses. The<em> League of Legends</em> maker announced that it would be laying off 80 employees as the tag-teaming fight game fails to gain momentum.</p> <p>“I want you to know that decision wasn’t made lightly. As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with <em>2XKO</em>,” executive producer Tom Cannon <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko">wrote in a new blog post on February 9</a>. “The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term.”</p>

 <p>Featuring fighters from <em>League of Legends</em>‘ Runeterra universe, <em>2XKO</em> employs beautiful cel-shaded animations and tons of flashy combos. But it seems none of that was enough to help it make a huge splash in the fighting game community when it came to PC in Early Access last October. The game hit its 1.0 launch and arrived on consoles last month, where it became the third most-downloaded free-to-play game across PS4 and PS5, putting it ahead of <em>Marvel Rivals</em> and <em>Highguard</em>.</p> <p>That sounds…not bad considering the game’s existing trajectory, but apparently Riot was expecting something much bigger. Or maybe it was always the plan to cut the development team in half after release as the<em> League of Legends</em> company struggles to find success outside of its hit MOBA.</p>

 <p>Cannon said that there are no plans to pull the plug on 2XKO,and its remaining team will continue updating the game and carrying through with its year-one competitive plans. “Ultimately, this decision reflects a shift in how we operate,” he wrote. “This isn’t a judgment on individual Rioters or a signal that the journey is over. We’re reshaping the team to give <em>2XKO</em> a more sustainable path forward.”</p>

 <p>Cannon acknowledged how bad the layoffs and the timing sounded. “I know this update will raise questions and concerns,” he wrote. “That’s understandable.” But he didn’t have anything more concrete to share to reassure fans.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Don’t Let Nioh 3‘s First Boss Yamagata Masakage Keep You Down]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nioh-3-yamagata-masakage-boss-guide-tips-how-to-beat-2000666993</link>
            <guid>1430491</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Nioh 3</em> is Team Ninja’s new open-world-ish Soulslike. All things considered, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nioh-3-the-kotaku-review-2000665666">it’s pretty great</a>. The action is top-notch. You can play a sizable chunk of the start of the game for free via the demo, which includes a prologue boss fight against Yamagata Masakage. He might kill you a bunch. You might end up thinking <em>Nioh 3</em> isn’t for you. But that would be a dumb reason to lose out on experiencing a very good video game.</p> <p>Plenty of players will have no trouble with this prologue fight whatsoever, but I’ve already come across plenty of recent<em> Nioh</em> inductees who have struggled. Here are some tips for skating past Yamagata Masakage.</p> <h2>Grind some levels</h2> <p>If you’re getting your ass kicked, go fight a bunch of guys until you have enough Amrita to get to level six or seven. Put points into stats like Constitution and Strength. You’ll also get better armor drops this way. There’s a Yokai right behind you at the last shrine before the Yamagata Masakage fight. Kill that thing a bunch to get some better gear.</p>

 <h2>Summon an ally</h2> <p>This is also where the game teaches you how to summon NPC allies at the little blue pools of light. You spend Ochoko cups to “call” AI-controlled Acolytes to help you. Doing so goes a long way toward making the Yamagata Masakage fight a walk in the park.</p> <h2>Memorize the attack pattern and stay out of harm’s way</h2> <p><em>Nioh 3</em> is a Soulslike which means you need to know when to watch, when to wait, and when to be aggressive. Yamagata Masakage only has a handful of different attack patterns and animations and you should be able to block them all without getting stunned and still have time to create space and recover your stamina before the next barrage. In Ninja stance, it’s extra easy to play keep away.</p>

 <h2>Master the Burst Counter</h2> <p>If you’re having trouble with this fight, the best thing to do is not to worry about chipping away at Yamagata Masakage’s health throughout the entire fight. Instead, keep blocking and maintaining distance until he uses his special attack that flashes a red glowing aura around him right before it lands. Hit the right trigger to stance-shift right at that moment to parry it. That’s called a Burst Counter.</p>

 <p>When successful, you can transition into attacking to quickly stun him. Get a three-hit combo in and then back off until the next time he glows red before his attack. You can basically block and Burst Counter the entire fight as long as you manage your stamina meter carefully.</p> <h2>Let your Acolyte do all the work</h2> <p>While Yamagata Masakage is focused on attack you and you’re soaking up all his attacks by blocking, your AI-controlled Acolyte should be tearing into him from behind. Easy mode! Just keep aggro-ing him while your friend does all of the work.</p>

 <h2>Save your Living Artifact to finish the fight</h2> <p>Filling up your Amrita Gauge throughout the fight will let you press Y + B/triangle + circle to initiate a powerful transformation in which you summon your equipped Guardian Spirit and can unload on the enemy until the short cooldown expires. You only have to get Yamagata Masakage down to less than a third of his life before the battle ends and he’ll flee. Just watch out for his attack change-up in the second half of the battle, where his red glow animation adds some extra delays before it hits.</p> <p>With these strats, hopefully you’ll be able to make short work of Yamagata Masakage and experience the first part of <em>Nioh 3 </em>which begins to open up exploration. From there you can do lots of stuff before taking on the game’s first real&nbsp;major boss: Jakotsu-baba. That fight is the game’s first real skill check, but you’ll have more tools in your arsenal by the time you get to it.</p>
