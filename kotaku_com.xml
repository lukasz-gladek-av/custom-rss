            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’m not one for video game marketing drip-feeds, but everything we’ve <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-runner-extraction-hardcore-1851775956">seen of <em>Marathon</em></a> since it’s emerged from its 2025 playtest delay has had me more and more excited. The latest trailer from Bungie provides developer breakdowns of each of the extraction shooter’s classes and while I have no idea if they’ll be interesting in practice, the footage sure looks cool.</p> <p>“Each Runner shell is built around a different gameplay archetype, such as intel gathering, combat disruption, or combat healing,” reads a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/dev-insights-runner-shells-new-video">new blog post</a> from the <em>Destiny 2</em> maker. “With distinct silhouettes, shells allow you to evaluate player threats and strategize your next steps on the fly. Each Runner shell’s playstyle can be customized using the cores, implants, weapons, and mods you bring on your runs.”</p>

 <p>Even before getting into each of the six character classes and their abilities, the new gameplay footage <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-visuals-art-bungie-updated-director-2000655713">has would-be fans impressed</a>. “<span dir="auto" role="text">It is insane how much better this looks than the alpha test,” read one of the top comments on YouTube. “This game looks better than every extraction shooter,” wrote a viewer on X. Whether it actually plays better than every one extraction shooter, including <em>Arc Raiders</em>, will be the big test.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p>There are seven runner shells with the following main abilities:</p> <blockquote>  <ul data-offset-key="54lu5-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="54lu5-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="54lu5-0-0">Archetype: Combat specialist</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="3oeqb-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="3oeqb-0-0">Armed with a personal defense barricade, missile systems, and movement thrusters, Destroyer shells are designed to bring the fight to enemy threats.</span></p> </li> </ul>  <ul data-offset-key="79let-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="79let-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="79let-0-0">Archetype: Shadow agent</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="4t9ge-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="4t9ge-0-0">Synthetic smoke deployment and camouflage technology allow Assassin shells to plan unseen strikes or take cover during hostile engagements.</span></p> </li> </ul>  <ul data-offset-key="apkkd-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="apkkd-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="apkkd-0-0">Archetype: Intel specialist</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="7rb4a-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="7rb4a-0-0">Recon shells excel at identifying threats and tracking movements using echo pulses, tracker drones, and holographic footstep trails.</span></p> </li> </ul>  <ul data-offset-key="b8atk-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="b8atk-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="b8atk-0-0">Archetype: Combat anarchist</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="20tdg-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="20tdg-0-0">Vandal shells traverse ground at incredible speeds, using their advanced movement and knockback cannon to disrupt combat.</span></p> </li> </ul>  <ul data-offset-key="doq0a-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="doq0a-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="doq0a-0-0">Archetype: Covert acquisitions</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="n6b7-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="n6b7-0-0">With enhanced visors and piloted butterfly drone, Thief shells can locate and acquire loot, then use their grapple to push an advantage or make an escape.</span></p> </li> </ul>  <ul data-offset-key="5o05o-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="5o05o-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="5o05o-0-0">Archetype: Field medic</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="fdthu-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="fdthu-0-0">Triage shells help keep themselves and allies alive using deployable healing drones, onboard reboot abilities, and combat buffs.</span></p> </li> </ul>  <ul data-offset-key="f4h8h-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="f4h8h-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="f4h8h-0-0">Archetype: Scavenger</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="b6ndd" data-offset-key="1f1uu-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="1f1uu-0-0">The Rook frame is designed for scavenger mode, a unique way to play Marathon. As Rook, you’ll drop into a match that’s already in progress as a solo player. You won’t be able to bring a loadout, but you also aren’t risking anything, which makes Rook an excellent option for scavengers.</span></p> </li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>Each runner can be outfitted with cores and implants to augment abilities and stats. Cores will be unique to each runner class, while implants can be mix and matched across all types. The idea is that different builds will push runners into unique playstyles. For example, Vandal could equip a triple jump and speed boosts for more mobility, or go with an arm cannon that can be used to launch players into the air and ground stomp for AOE damage for a more offensive-leaning shell.</p>

 <p>Bungie isn’t ready to spill the beans on how cosmetics will work just yet. Fashion has become a pillar of modern multiplayer shooters, and the microtransaction lifeblood that fuels their ongoing development. “We’ll talk about the ways you can customize your shells visually in the future, including more details on the earnable cosmetics you’ll unlock through the Codex and other ways,” the studio wrote today.</p>

 <p>But over 50 apparent early cosmetic shell options for each runner have <a href="https://thegamepost.com/marathon-leak-first-look-55-runner-skins-deluxe-edition/">reportedly already leaked</a> from a recent test build, including some that will be exclusive to the Deluxe Edition. The base version of Marathon is priced at $40 and coming sometime in March 2026. We don’t have the specific release date yet, either. For now, the drip-feed continues.</p>

              <p>I’m having a lovely time playing the early access release of&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em>. But then of course I am: I love playing&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>. So I’m enjoying building a pretty little log cabin, exploring underground caves for precious ores, battling skeletons with a bow and arrows, and travelling far from spawn to visit distant biomes. Because that’s what I do when I play <em>Minecraft</em>. What I’ve yet to figure out is why&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em> exists as anything other than a texture pack for Microsoft’s behemoth.</p> <p>There&nbsp;<em>are</em> differences. But when I describe them to you, they’re going to sound so minuscule. For instance, <em>Hytale</em> has a much better jump: you can jump two blocks high, and you can mantle up from four blocks below. I love that. That would make <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/bukkit-plugins/highjump">a good&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em></a><a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/bukkit-plugins/highjump"> mod</a>.&nbsp; And there’s the slightly improved combat in which enemies actually block and you need to time your attacks. Then again, I can just add the <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/smart-mobs">Smart Mobs</a> option to Mojang’s game. And you can <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/realistic-mc-graphics">see where I’m going</a> when I point out that <em>Hytale</em> is a far prettier game with gorgeous sunrises.</p>

 <p>Ten years in the making, and famously cancelled by Riot in the middle of last year <a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-riot-minecraft-hypixel-revived-cancel-shutdown-2000645248">before being revived in November</a>, this early access build of&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em> is unquestionably a really good reimagining of <em>Minecraft. B</em>ut in its current form, as released this week for a minimum of $20, that’s <em>all</em> it is, and I’m left pretty bemused how that can be the case.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000660163" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660163"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660163">© Hypixel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>To give you an idea of how peculiarly the two games overlap—even beyond the core concept of a procedurally generated world made of cubes in which you dig, chop, mine and shovel to gather materials for crafting tools, construction materials and decorating items—let’s just look at the mobs. The main ones you’ll encounter at first are skeletons and spiders. Big, chunky spiders that are two blocks wide. It didn’t need to be skeletons and spiders, but it is. Are there zombies? Yes there are zombies. But surely not golems? I’m afraid there are golems. There <em>are</em> other mobs in there, with pillagers replaced by goblins and Outlanders, and villagers swapped out in favor of Ewok-like Kweebecs, as well as the most astonishingly overpowered underground-dwelling giant frogs. But then there’s also a place called the Void which I read contains a Void Dragon. Seriously?</p>

 <p>The other aspect I can imagine an angry person on Reddit bringing up in response to accusations of cloning is crafting. It’s…it’s a lot worse. While it’s true that <em>Minecraft</em> has a fairly broad array of workbenches, for the most part people are using the basic crafting table and then an anvil and enchantment table. Sure, there’s the cartography table, the loom, the stonecutter, but these aren’t exactly core to the game. In <em>Hytale</em>, within the first couple of hours, I had needed to build a Workbench, Furniture Workbench, Blacksmith’s Anvil, Tanning Rack, Armorer’s Workbench, Builder’s Workbench, Furnace, and Campfire. I had to upgrade my main workbench to be able to then build the Chef’s Stove and Salvager’s Workbench, but still haven’t crafted the Alchemist’s Workbench and Arcanist’s Workbench because I don’t have enough gold or thorium. Each is enormous, meaning I’ve twice had to add sizable new wings to my cabin just to fit them all in the same location. It’s bonkers!</p>

 <p>Legitimately great is that if you have chests directly next to workbenches, it’ll recognize their contents when showing what can be constructed. (Less great is the need for a small auditorium to fit all the benches in, and so of course not being able to have them all adjacent to the necessary chests.) This is a huge improvement, and I really appreciate it.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000660164" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660164"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660164">© Hypixel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But the more I try to allow <em>Hytale</em> to be its own game in its own right, the more it fights back against that. When you pick up items from the ground, which bob up and down floating in the air, they emit a little “pop” sound, exactly like in <em>Minecraft</em>. Put two one-tile chests next to each other and they’ll ping into one double-width chest. Let alone that you already know what every block type is likely to be, given its visual similarity to the source. And the thing is, it’s necessary! This game both looks and feels so much like <em>Minecraft</em> that any time it does behave differently, it feels wrong.&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em> is such an unabashed clone that it’s backed itself into a corner of needing to do everything the same way&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>does. From the nine-box inventory along the bottom of the screen with a space for a shield to the left to how chest inventories appear, it’s just the same designs. It feels like playing the same game, in the same way, with the same goals.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000660166" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660166"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660166">© Hypixel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This&nbsp;is supposed to change, when&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em> adds its Adventure Mode, which will offer RPG-like storylines and quests to solve, and that sounds great! It’s something I always longed for in the earliest days of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> and that still only exist today through mods, and usually ones that eschew a lot of the core nature of <em>Minecraft</em> to do so. There are hints of this in place, like the Forgotten Temple which will teleport you to a peaceful hub-like area, almost entirely consisting of buildings with “Under Construction” signs over their doors, and a statue which catalogs every mob type you’ve encountered so far. It’s a cute idea, and unlocks more crafting options when you ding specified numbers.</p> <p>Adventure Mode should add in “Alterverses” and bespoke quests and all that good stuff that will make <em>Hytale</em> distinct from the game it’s so wantonly copied. You know, if it happens. Clearly none of us knows what happened over the last five years at Riot, and whether the Hypixel team had developed huge sections of this before Riot pulled the plug, forcing the developers to revert back four-and-a-half years for this early access version. Or perhaps even then the game was so much like a <em>Minecraft</em> texture pack that Riot couldn’t see a way to release it.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000660165" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660165"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660165">© Hypixel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>As I said at the start of this, I’m having a lovely time! There are a whole bunch of balancing issues, but that’s entirely expected at this point. (Those toads, man, with the tongues that grab you. And iron is wildly too rare just now.) But I’m not having as lovely a time as I do when I join my son on his <em>Minecraft</em> Realm, or <a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-donut-smp-server-farm-notch-2000656412">goof around on DonutSMP</a>, because, you know, it’s the OG.&nbsp;<em>Minecraft </em>has&nbsp;had 17 years to make itself buttery smooth, balanced to complete perfection, and at the same time old enough to engender nostalgia and comfortable familiarity.&nbsp;<em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>is an awful lot prettier (albeit still in pixelly blocks), but right now it’s in no important way <em>better</em>. I mean, the jumping and mantling is great! But, you know, it needs to offer an awful lot more than that. I’m still left just wondering&nbsp;<em>why</em>? Why fight so, so hard to make the same game that already exists?</p>

 <p>I’ll happily keep playing it for a little bit, see what the biomes I’ve yet to reach have to offer (the one where everything’s on fire is pretty fun), but I fear that in its current state I won’t be the only one quickly drifting away.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Monster Hunter Wilds Modder Uncovers Bizarre Reason Why PC Performance Might Be So Bad]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-framerate-dlc-2000660149</link>
            <guid>1407025</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113"><i><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></i></a><span>‘</span><span> performance on PC has been notoriously bad <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-tu4-title-update-4-pc-fixed-2000652579">going back to launch</a>, and nobody is quite sure why. One new theory suggests part of the problem could be related to all of the game’s DLC add-ons and how it checks for them. It sounds wild, but video footage has made it one of the most convincing possibilities yet.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Yesterday, user u/de_Tylmarande published a rather lengthy post on the r/MonsterHunter subreddit titled “</span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/mh_wilds_bad_performance_mystery_solved/?share_id=sKxGG694fIAcaycKb_Qhd&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1"><span>MH Wilds – Bad performance mystery (Solved?)</span></a><span>” As they explain, they discovered the issue by mere chance after playing </span><i><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></i><span> through a friend’s Steam account. They immediately noticed that, even though they were using the same machine, </span><i><span>Monster Hunter Wilds’ </span></i><span>FPS was dramatically better when playing the game through their friend’s account than on their own.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>After some testing, u/de_Tylmarande came to a bizarre conclusion: the only difference was that their friend had bought all of </span><i><span>Monster Hunter Wilds’ </span></i><span>downloadable content on Steam. As they explained, “on the account with no DLC I get heavy and stable FPS drops down to like 20-25 in hubs, while on the account with all DLC bought it’s 80+ FPS.”</span></p>

  <p><span>Obviously, this claim was a little hard to believe for some users on the subreddit, so u/de_Tylmarande </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uf5cICpDXX0"><span>provided a video</span></a><span> of themselves utilizing a custom mod they created that essentially bypasses </span><i><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></i><span>’ DLC checks. The theory has gone viral online as a result. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>But the story gets even weirder, because u/de_Tylmarande revealed that this isn’t the first time they’ve discovered a performance fix for one of Capcom’s PC games. According to them, </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1qcy3hn/comment/nzmfveb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>they contacted Capcom</span></a><span> with an FPS fix for </span><i><span>Dragon’s Dogma 2</span></i><span> back in 2024. They claim that fix was then incorporated into the next patch for the open-world RPG on Steam.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>It’s also worth noting that </span><i><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></i><span> players on PC </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/monster-hunter-wilds-steam-reviews-absolutely-tank-as-players-lose-patience-with-its-technical-woes-every-time-the-game-gets-updated-my-performance-decreases/"><span>have felt</span></a><span> like performance keeps getting worse with each new update. Each new update for the game also comes paired with new DLC. As of writing, </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/dlc/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/list/162627"><span>190 individual pieces of DLC</span></a><span> are available for the game on Steam. This new theory would explain a lot.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Capcom hasn’t yet confirmed the modder’s findings or substantiated how much of the performance issues might be attributable to the DLC checks. The Reddit sleuth also made clear that they don’t think Capcom is doing any of this on purpose to incentivize players to buy DLC. “I did NOT mean Capcom did this on purpose,” de_Tylmarande wrote in an addendum. “No, no, and again no…it’s just a bug in the code they need to fix.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>No word from Capcom’s end yet on the veracity of de_Tylmarande’s findings, but it will be interesting to see if the issue is suddenly resolved once the next patch for </span><i><span>Monster Hunter Wilds </span></i><span>drops on PC.</span></p>

            <guid>1407022</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>As a competitive game, </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> is in the best state it’s ever been, but its story and hero selection are in a much more tenuous place. Blizzard is finally </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-pve-canceled-campaign-null-sector-2000641177"><span>moving the hero shooter’s narrative along</span></a><span> and teasing heroes fans have been </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-emre-sarioglu-freja-animated-trailer-who-is-1851771309"><span>waiting to learn more about for years</span></a><span>, but it’s still mostly just gesturing at forward momentum rather than making significant leaps. Now, the team is teasing the next hero coming to the game, and the character in question is arguably emblematic of the rut </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s found itself in.</span></p> <p><span>Anran, a fire-wielding hero and the older sister of Wuyang, has been teased already as an upcoming hero, but it seems now she might be imminent. Blizzard released a short audio drama of gorilla scientist Winston sending out invitations to join the Overwatch team while looking at footage of Anran and Wuyang fighting Omnic soldiers.</span></p>

  <p><span>If that wasn’t enough confirmation, fans have datamined voice files of Echo, a hero who can transform into other characters, replicating what seems to be Anran’s Ultimate voice line.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">❗ Anran ultimate voicelines are ALREADY in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Overwatch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Overwatch2</a> game files</p> <p>You can find them among Echo phrases (her imitating other heroes ultimates). Fun fact: in non-English versions of the game these lines were voiced by a new voice, potentially voice of Anran in the corresponding… <a href="https://t.co/OeIpxCVa44">pic.twitter.com/OeIpxCVa44</a></p> <p>— OverFire / Overwatch (@overfire_news) <a href="https://twitter.com/overfire_news/status/2011521527468941516?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 14, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Anran could be a great hero, but her moving this quickly up the hero queue means a few things. First, it likely means that </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>is once again passing up a chance to add a new tank hero. We’ve seen Anran in action </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytZnOGwEq9s"><span>in Wuyang’s promo trailer</span></a><span>, and she seems very light on her feet and offense based, unlike the usually bulky, brawling, defensive tanks in the game. 2025 came and went without a new tank being added to the roster, with Blizzard opting to release one support character in Wuyang and two damage heroes in Freja and Vendetta, so tank mains are feeling a little burned right now.</span></p>

 <p><span>Second, </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>fans have criticized the game for what they perceive to be characters “made for skin sales,” which usually means young, conventionally attractive characters who aren’t quite part of the main story, and who some feel </span><a href="https://x.com/Kagamine_asheOW/status/2011493297731375575?s=20"><span>get skins churned out for them</span></a><span> but little other attention from the devs. Some also have called out that </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>, a game often celebrated for its diversity, has been </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-kiriko-mercy-venture-reaper-season-12-skins-1851626893"><span>showing favoritism to its east Asian heroes</span></a><span> when it comes to skins, and Anran would be </span><a href="https://x.com/LALALLALLALA21/status/2011492390415053159?s=20"><span>another character</span></a><span> who falls into that category.</span></p>

 <p><span>Not everyone is upset, mind you, but Blizzard has said a few questionable things about upcoming heroes that have fans worried about the future of the game’s hero designs. Though the team did walk it back, there was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-oddball-aspirational-character-hero-design-2000617761"><span>a brief controversy</span></a><span> last year about the game moving away from “oddball” heroes like Winston and the robot-piloting hamster Wrecking Ball in favor of “aspirational” characters. Fans took this to pretty much mean “young and hot,” and Blizzard quickly responded saying that “oddities” were still important to the game, and that a character who matches that description is in the works. We’re still waiting on them, though. I guess we’ll see them sometime after Anran, who all evidence points to being the next new hero joining in a future season.</span></p>
