And he somewhat has an answer.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>X account <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MCUFilmNews&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MCUFilmNews" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@MCUFilmNews</a></span> reports that during the aforementioned panel, Boyega confirmed that he has spoken with Feige at least once about potentially joining the MCU. While he didn’t have an answer for Feige at the time when he was asked who he might like to play, the C2E2 crowd helped him with his indecision when one attendee loudly suggested he play time-traveling <em>X-Men </em>hero Bishop. In response, Boyega agreed: “Oh, I’d play Bishop.” </p><p>Now, before you start slamming on your keyboards pumping out Bishop and Storm romance fanfiction, nothing about what Boyega said should be construed as confirmation of anything more than him being open to the possibility of someday being part of the most profitable film franchise of the 21st century. However, him even entertaining the possibility marks a considerable shift from his stance in 2022 when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://menshealth.com/entertainment/a40640779/john-boyega-movies-interview/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://menshealth.com/entertainment/a40640779/john-boyega-movies-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he told <em>Men’s Health</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>that Marvel wasn’t what he envisioned for his career at the time because “I want to donate my services to original indie films that come with new, fresh ideas, because I know it’s real hard to top <em>Iron Man</em> in that universe.”</p><p>Since then he’s played a financially devastated man turned bank robber in the indie film <em>Breaking</em>, starred alongside Viola Davis in the phenomenal <em>The Woman King</em>, and starred opposite Jamie Foxx in the Netflix film <em>They Cloned Tyrone</em>. Those early aversions to superhero movies shouldn’t completely shut down the possibility of him joining the MCU.
