            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s always been a given that gaming monitors come with a high price tag, especially when you’re talking about OLED technology with specs that push the limits of what’s possible. LG’s 34-inch Ultragear has been the reference point for serious gamers, but its $1,399 price kept it out of reach for many enthusiasts. Amazon just drastically upended that equation by dropping this curved beast down to $679, or nearly half off the original price. This all-time low opens up premium OLED gaming to a much wider audience who have been just looking for the right moment to improve their screens.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5610/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>When Curve Meets Speed</h2>
<p>This<strong> 34-inch display features an 800R curvature</strong> that aggressively wraps around your field of view compared to most other curved monitors you might have laid eyes on. LG steepened the curve enough to draw in peripheral vision into the action for an immersive experience not possible with flat-screen monitors. The curve works a treat in racing games or flight simulators where spatial awareness counts. You’ll notice how the edges of the screen stay within your natural viewing angle without requiring constant head movement.</p>
<p>The <strong>OLED panel delivers perfect blacks</strong> because each pixel can turn off completely and creates an infinite contrast ratio in practice. LG rates this at 1.5 million to one, but the real-world impact is in dark game scenes where you can actually distinguish details in shadows. The 1300-nit peak brightness might sound excessive, but it makes HDR content truly pop with highlights that leap off the screen.</p>



<p>The anti-glare coating does a great job <strong>with ambient light for an OLED display</strong>; you can game during the day without fighting reflections from windows or overhead lights. The 3<strong>440 x 1440 resolution gives you 34% more pixels than standard 1440p displays</strong>&nbsp;while the 21:9 aspect ratio expands your horizontal view in supported games. This ultrawide format is particularly great in competitive shooters where you can see more of the battlefield and that will give you an edge</p>
<p>It pushes four times more frames per second <strong>at 240Hz</strong> than the standard 60Hz monitors. This makes quite a difference in fast-paced games in which split-second reactions often make a lot of difference. You notice the difference clearly in the moments of fast panning of the camera or tracking fast-moving objects across the screen. With a <strong>response time of 0.03ms</strong>, you get almost zero motion blur or ghosting during rapid movements.</p>
<p>Both <strong>AMD FreeSync Premium and Nvidia G-Sync compatibility</strong> ensure that your gameplay will be silky smooth. These technologies synchronize your GPU’s frame output with the monitor’s refresh rate, thereby eliminating screen tearing and stuttering. You can push frame rates above 200 fps in esports titles and still maintain perfect visual fluidity.</p>
<p>Cloud gaming services such as Nvidia GeForce Now, Amazon Luna and Blacknut run directly from the monitor. You’ll be able to experience demanding game titles without the need for expensive hardware but with a good internet connection and a controller. The USB Type-C port also provides 65W of power delivery so you can charge your laptop while using the monitor as a display.</p>
<p>There is more than one HDMI 2.1 port on this monitor with support f<strong>or complete 4K at 120Hz from both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles</strong>. You get the full next-generation console experience with variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode working without a hitch. Basic audio is taken care of by onboard speakers, but serious gamers will want dedicated headphones or external speakers for the best sound.</p>
<p>This is a new all time low price on Amazon, make sure you don’t miss it.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/massive-2200w-power-station-slashed-54-off-now-priced-at-budget-gas-generator-levels-without-the-stink-and-noise-2000644610</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/massive-2200w-power-station-slashed-54-off-now-priced-at-budget-gas-generator-levels-without-the-stink-and-noise.1354897/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gas generators solve power outages but fill your garage with fumes, wake the neighbors with engine noise and require constant fuel runs that get expensive fast. Portable power stations eliminate all those headaches while delivering clean electricity that works safely indoors during winter storms when you need heat, light, and charged devices the most.</p>
<p>The good news is that the <strong>Jackery Explorer 2000 v2</strong> just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4831/">dropped to an all-time low of $699 on Amazon, slashed from its usual $1,499 price</a>. This massive 2042Wh battery costs roughly what budget gas generators do, except it runs silently, produces zero emissions and charges from wall outlets or solar panels.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4831/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Crushes Gas Generator Alternatives</h2>
<p>Jackery Explorer 2000 v2 is capable of providing <strong>up to 2200W continuous power via three AC outlets</strong>, and runs multiple appliances at the same time during outages or off-grid. That wattage capacity will run space heaters, electric blankets, mini fridges, laptops, and medical equipment all at once without overloading the system. The 2042Wh translates into real-world runtime that matters during extended winter power outages, keeping a typical space heater running for about four hours and charging laptops 30 times over.</p>
<p>Jackery engineered this unit using Cell-to-Body technology borrowed from electric vehicle manufacturing. CTB optimizes internal space by incorporating battery cells directly into the structural frame. This design approach minimizes wasted space and unnecessary materials, so this massive-capacity power station weighs just 39.5 pounds. That’s a <strong>41% weight reduction and 34% size decrease compared to typical 2kWh LiFePO4 power stations</strong> from competitors.</p>



<p>The secret to differentiating this Jackery from its slower competitors is multiple fast-charging pathways that get you back to full power quickly. Wall outlet AC charging <strong>pushes the battery from zero to 80% in just 66 minutes</strong> and gives you usable power fast when storms approach and you’re racing to prepare. The Emergency Super Charging mode accessible through Jackery’s smartphone app completes a full charge in 102 minutes; this accelerated charging generates more heat and should be reserved for genuine emergencies, though.</p>
<p>Silent Charging mode charges the battery to full capacity in five hours <strong>at whisper-quiet 30dB noise levels</strong> which is quieter than a library or a bedroom at night. This mode proves invaluable for overnight charging sessions where you may be trying to sleep or work without distraction from fan noise. The smart temperature control system constantly monitors internal component temperatures and automatically adjusts cooling fan speeds based on actual thermal load rather than operating fans at maximum speed regardless of conditions.</p>
<p>The<strong> USB-C PD 100W port charges laptops, tablets, and phones</strong> at the maximum possible speed, without separate power adapters that you’d otherwise need to plug into the AC outlets. Two more USB-A ports and a 12V car port handle smaller devices and accessories efficiently. The pure sine wave AC output protects sensitive electronics from the power quality issues that modified sine wave inverters create, and allows safe operation of everything from computers to medical equipment.</p>
<p>For $699, you’re paying budget gas generator prices for clean, quiet, indoor-safe power that charges multiple ways and lasts a decade.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dell-dumps-its-vostro-1tb-laptop-for-70-off-now-selling-for-what-generic-budget-laptops-cost-2000644605</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell-dumps-its-vostro-1tb-laptop-for-70-off-now-selling-for-what-generic-budget-laptops-cost.1354876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Laptop shopping is overwhelming when you’re staring at options ranging from $200 Chromebooks that barely function to $3,000 premium machines loaded with specs you’ll never use. Most people just need something reliable for everyday tasks like web browsing, document work, video calls and media streaming. The Dell Vostro 15″ <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5607/">1TB model just crashed to an all-time low of $599 on Amazon, slashed from its usual $1,999 sticker</a>, and this 70% discount puts a brand-name business laptop at literally the same price point as generic budget machines.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5607/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Value for Money Laptop</h2>
<p>The Vostro 3530 is powered by Intel’s 13th Generation Core i3-1305U, a five-core chip with one performance core and four efficiency cores. It divides the workload smartly between those efficiency and performance cores, depending on how demanding the task is. The performance core <strong>runs at a turbo frequency of as much as 4.5GHz for resource-intensive tasks</strong> such as video editing or a heavy spreadsheet while the efficiency cores do the background work without consuming much power to give you extended battery life.</p>



<p>Dell equipped this laptop with a <strong>massive 32GB of DDR4 RAM, placing it firmly in the realm of a professional workstation</strong> rather than basic consumer laptop specs. That amount of memory lets you run dozens of Chrome tabs, have multiple Microsoft Office documents open, stream background music, host video calls, and still have some headroom left over. Students can research papers with innumerable reference tabs open alongside writing in Word and chatting on Discord without their system choking.</p>



<p>The <strong>1TB PCIe NVMe SSD is plenty to store years</strong> of documents, photos, and videos, and apps in a way that doesn’t require you to live in constant file management or cloud storage subscriptions. Modern SSDs like this one access data at speeds that make traditional hard drives seem prehistoric: they boot Windows 11 Pro within seconds of start-up and load programs almost instantly.</p>
<p>That<strong> 15.6-inch Full HD display refreshes at 120Hz</strong> instead of the more common 60Hz seen on most budget laptops, and it makes motion noticeably smoother as you scroll through documents, web pages, or video content. In practice, that doubled refresh rate reduces eye fatigue during long work sessions because the subtle flicker and stuttering common with lower refresh displays are gone. The anti-glare coating and 250-nit brightness let you work near windows without reflections destroying visibility, while the narrow border design maximizes screen real estate without increasing the laptop’s physical footprint.</p>
<p>With it, <strong>you get Windows 11 Professional pre-installed</strong> rather than the Home edition found on consumer laptops, offering extra security features, remote desktop capability, and business-focused tools that matter for professional environments. The Pro edition supports BitLocker encryption for protecting sensitive data, domain joining for corporate networks, and advanced group policy controls needed by IT departments.</p>
<p>Connectivity options fill both modern and legacy needs with a practical mix of ports. A USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C handles fast data transfers and can connect to modern docks and displays, while traditional USB-A ports ensure the existing peripherals work without adapters. The RJ-45 Ethernet port provides you with dependable wired network connections that surpass WiFi in stability and speed in a home office or dorm room. External monitors or projectors are connected via HDMI 1.4 output for presentations and expanded workspaces.</p>
<p>You’re getting here 32GB RAM, 1TB storage, a 120Hz display, and Windows 11 Pro for $599, which is what most people pay for basic 8GB Chromebooks.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Controllers See Their First Major Black Friday Deal, Now Selling for New All-Time Low on Amazon]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-controllers-see-their-first-major-black-friday-deal-now-selling-for-new-all-time-low-on-amazon-2000644601</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-controllers-see-their-first-major-black-friday-deal-now-selling-for-new-all-time-low-on-amazon.1354870/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>First major Black Friday deals just landed on Amazon and Xbox controllers finally joined the discount party with their deepest price cut ever. Gaming controllers take a beating from intense button mashing, thumbstick abuse and the occasional rage-induced floor meeting so having a backup or upgrade becomes essential rather than optional.</p>
<p>The Xbox wireless gaming controller in <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">Carbon Black just hit an all-time low of $49 on Amazon, slashed from its usual $64 price</a>, and over 20,000 people grabbed one this month as stock moves incredibly fast. This 2025 model works across more devices than any previous Xbox controller which makes it useful beyond just console gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Cross-Platform Gaming</h2>
<p>Microsoft designed this controller with universal compatibility extending well beyond the Xbox consoles, wirelessly <strong>connecting to Windows PCs, Android phones and tablets, iOS devices, FireTV Sticks, smart TVs, and even VR headsets</strong>. This means that you buy one quality controller and use it everywhere, rather than having different gamepads for every different platform you own.</p>
<p>That <strong>Bluetooth connection rapidly pairs with any device</strong> it’s hooked up to, which sidesteps the clutter of dongles and adapters found with older controllers. You can easily toggle between playing Halo on your Series X, streaming games on your phone during your lunch break and changing media on your Fire TV Stick without juggling multiple remotes or controllers.</p>



<p>The ergonomic design refines the proven Xbox controller shape that’s felt natural in gamers’ hands for over two decades with subtle improvements to grip texture and button placement. The textured surfaces on the triggers, bumpers and back casing provide a secure grip even during sweaty gaming sessions or when your hands get slick from snacks. Microsoft positioned the buttons and thumbsticks at distances that reduce hand fatigue during extended play, so you can game for hours without developing cramping or soreness in your thumbs and fingers.</p>



<p>The hybrid D-pad delivers accurate input for fighting games, platformers and any title that requires precise directional commands. This design marries the best aspects of traditional cross-shaped D-pads with the faceted style that most hardcore fighting game players prefer, providing you with tactile feedback for each direction press without mushy or ambiguous inputs. You’ll nail complex move combinations and rapid direction changes more consistently compared to cheaper controllers with spongy or imprecise directional pads.</p>
<p>Textured grips on the triggers and bumpers improve control in those split-second moments of intense gaming that determine victory or defeat. The triggers feature smooth analog travel that works perfectly for racing games where gradual acceleration and braking come into play, while also providing crisp digital clicks for shooters that need instant fire response.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life runs on two AA batteries that are expected to give about 40 hours of gameplay</strong> before needing replacement, giving you weeks of casual gaming or several marathon weekend sessions between battery swaps. The AA battery design lets you choose between disposable batteries for convenience or rechargeable batteries for cost savings and environmental benefits in the long term. You can also connect the controller via USB-C cable for wired play that eliminates any potential wireless latency while simultaneously charging rechargeable batteries if you’re using them.</p>
<p><strong>The 3.5mm headset jack</strong> connects any wired gaming headset directly, thereby routing game audio and chat through your headphones without the need for separate dongles or adapters. This direct connection reduces the audio latency compared to wireless headsets and gives you instant sound feedback, which helps in competitive gaming when hearing the enemy’s footsteps or gunshots a fraction of a second earlier provides strategic advantages.</p>
<p>At $49, you get Microsoft’s official controller quality for less money than most third-party alternatives that lack build quality or platform support.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Clears Out the Meta Quest 3S, Your Cheapest Path to Premium VR Is Nearly Free]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-the-meta-quest-3s-your-cheapest-path-to-premium-vr-is-nearly-free-2000644596</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-clears-out-the-meta-quest-3s-your-cheapest-path-to-premium-vr-is-nearly-free.1354852/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Virtual reality stopped being a futuristic fantasy the moment Meta cracked the code on affordable and high-quality headsets that actually work without a gaming PC tethered to your head. The <strong>Quest 3S brings premium VR experiences at a fraction of what you’d expect to pay</strong>, and Amazon just dropped both storage configurations to record-low prices for early Black Friday: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/">128GB model (including a Gorilla Tag bundle) now costs $249 instead of $299</a>; and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/">the 256GB version (including Batman: Arkham Shadow) sits at $329 down from $399</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why the Quest 3S Destroys the Value Competition</h2>
<p>Meta equipped the Quest 3S with the same core processor inside the flagship Quest 3 <strong>and offers you identical graphical processing capability for significantly less</strong>. That Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip boasts double the GPU performance of the Quest 2 for rendering virtual environments with sharper textures, smoother frame rates and more complex objects.</p>
<p>The Quest 3S runs <strong>entirely wireless and frees you from the cable management nightmares that plague PC VR setups</strong>. You simply charge the headset, put it on, and jump into experiences without configuring external sensors or worrying about tripping over cords mid-game. This standalone design means you can play in your living room or even outside if you want with the h<strong>eadset tracking your movements</strong> through built-in cameras and sensors. Battery life typically gives you<strong> two to three hours of active play</strong> before needing a recharge which feels about right for VR sessions before eye strain sets in anyway.</p>



<p>Both bundles include<strong> immediate access to more than 40 games</strong>&nbsp;and avoids the sticker shock of buying a headset only to find out you’ll have to spend another hundred bucks on software. The 128GB version includes an exclusive Gorilla Tag bundle, while the 256GB model throws in <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em>, along with a three-month trial of Meta Horizon+, which unlocks even more premium titles.</p>
<p>If there’s one thing that’s become a cultural phenomenon in VR, it’s Gorilla Tag, which lets you swing through environments using only arm movements in a shockingly physical workout disguised as a game. Batman: Arkham Shadow is a full-fledged superhero adventure built specifically for VR with hand-to-hand combat and detective work that feels genuinely immersive.</p>
<p>Storage considerations matter more than you might think with VR headsets, too. Games with detailed environments and high-resolution textures can easily consume 10GB to 20GB each, and the Quest 3S does not support expandable storage. The 128GB model gives you enough room for roughly eight to ten major games plus several smaller experiences, which works fine if you’re comfortable deleting and redownloading titles as you rotate through your library. The 256GB version doubles that capacity and lets you maintain a larger installed library without constant storage management.</p>



<p>The visual experience inside the Quest 3S uses <strong>Fresnel lenses with a resolution of 1832 x 1920 pixels per eye</strong>, and matches the Quest 2’s clarity while benefiting from that doubled processing power. Colors pop with better saturation, black levels deepen in dark scenes, and the overall image feels crisper during gameplay. The Quest 3 does offer slightly better optics with pancake lenses that reduce the headset’s overall bulk, but the visual improvement doesn’t justify the $250 price premium for most users.</p>
<p><strong>Meta’s mixed reality capabilities</strong> transform your real room into a game zone by mapping your furniture and walls, then seamlessly integrating virtual elements. You could place a virtual chess board on your real coffee table, have a movie screen floating above your couch, or defend your living room from virtual invaders crawling across your real furniture.</p>
<p><strong>The Quest 3S weighs about 515 grams</strong> and distributes that mass across your face with adjustable straps that take into account head size and shapes. Comfort will, of course, vary from person to person, but most people can handle hour-plus sessions before taking a break. The included elastic strap works well enough, though more serious VR enthusiasts often upgrade to Meta’s Elite Strap for better weight distribution during longer play.</p>
<p>At these early Black Friday prices, the Quest 3S completely rewrites the entry cost for quality VR. When you’re paying almost double for marginal improvements, the regular Quest 3 simply can’t compete on value. And for PC-based headsets, an expensive computer is needed in addition to the investment into the headset itself. Meta nailed the sweet spot between performance and affordability with this model.</p>
