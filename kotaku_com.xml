              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-round-up-switch-2-metacritic-2000635309"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> is coming to both new and old hardware, leaving fans with an important decision to make. Is it worth upgrading to play it on Switch 2, or will the old version handle well enough? According to one of the first comparison videos of the game running on both consoles, the differences are hardly noticeable outside of it running at 60fps on the newer hardware. That’s good for Switch 1 owners, but a bit underwhelming for those who’ve already bought a Switch 2.</p> <p>A new 15-minute video published on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H34ZUA-DD3M">YouTube channel ElAnalistaDeBits</a> shows a deep-dive comparison between both versions of the game. On Switch 1, <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> is capped at a resolution of 1080p and goes down as far as 800p in handheld mode. On Switch 2, it displays up to 2160p, and down to 1080p in handheld. By far the most meaningful difference is the 60fps perk for Switch 2 owners. Every other side-by-side comparison, however, looks pretty similar.</p>

  <p>The Switch 2 version appears to sport better shadows, textures, object draw distance, and density of vegetation and other details, but at least when viewed through captured footage uploaded to YouTube, the differences are pretty minor. On the one hand, that’s good news for everyone who will be playing <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> on the old hardware. On the other hand, it makes it that much harder to stomach the $10 upgrade for the game on Switch 2. The Pokémon Company is essentially charging for a 60fps mode within the new console’s first six months.</p>

 <p>“Before vs before,” joked one YouTube commenter. “From Water to H²O,” quipped another.</p> <p>New <em>Pokémon</em> games always get dragged through the ringer for their lack of graphical prowess as some fans pine for a major visual upgrade on par with the ones some franchises got with the previous Switch hardware. As a cross-gen game, it’s clear <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> isn’t going to provide that “next-gen-feeling” leap. At the very least, it seems like the Switch 1 version of the game is in better shape than <em>Pokémon Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em> were at launch back in 2022. The video doesn’t show off any major glitches or framerate dips. Hopefully, that reflects the experience most players have when the game comes out on October 16.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Regular Steam Deck users (and those who enjoy gaming on the variety of mini-PCs out there) are likely familiar with a certain physical sensation: wrist pain, tingling, and numbness. It’s not fun, and typically cuts your gaming short long before the battery gives out. These devices are just heavier and bulkier than the handhelds of yore, and even outweigh the Switch by a significant margin. But there’s a way to enjoy hours of gaming on them without that extra weight taking a toll on your wrists. If you don’t already have a kickstand, either by way of <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-deckmate-valve-kickstand-portable-1849583263">something like a Deck Mate</a> or a case with a built-in stand, consider it one of the most essential investments you can make in your mini-PC gaming quality of life.</p> <p>It really doesn’t matter how strong you are. Muscling through signs of strain is a good way to give yourself pain and, even if you’re willing to grit your teeth and endure it, consider that powering through the pain is a great way to increase the likelihood that you’re going to accidentally drop your very expensive gaming device. As I’ve learned in Olympic weight training lately, doing unnecessary reps or spending too much time under tension decreases your potential to keep carrying something. That may seem obvious when we’re talking about carrying over a hundred pounds, but it’s not something that clicked so easily for me when it came to the Steam Deck.</p>

 <p>However, replaying <i>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</i> on Steam Deck recently made this glaringly obvious. As I sat there watching the game’s notoriously lengthy cutscenes, that familiar tingly sensation I often get in my wrists from prolonged Steam Deck sessions started kicking in, and I realized that given the length of the game, this would be a problem. That feeling is a prelude to pain and tens of minutes spent flexing out my wrists instead of gaming. It became obvious to me that, during these cutscenes, there was no good reason for me to be holding this device. I flipped out the stand on the JSAUX case that currently houses my Steam Deck (I have another one for the Ally X as well) and just put it down on the nearest table while I watched the remainder of the cutscene.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000635414" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000635414"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000635414">© Image: Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s become common practice now when I’m playing on either the Steam Deck or Ally X. If I don’t need to be pressing buttons, the machine is resting on its stand–provided there’s a table somewhere nearby. I only rarely experience wrist pain as a result and have a far greater experience with the devices, especially since the stands keep the screen facing me, as opposed to just laying them flat. This small practice has also dramatically increased how much time I spend on Steam Deck.</p> <p>So however you get one on the back of your device, please save your wrists and put your machine on its stand whenever you don’t have to be actually holding the thing. You’ll thank me later, after many hours of blissful portable gaming.</p>

              <p><span>I wasn’t at New York Comic Con this year, but I could feel a wave of awkwardness reverberating from the Javits Center in my Brooklyn apartment like a disturbance in the Force. It wasn’t until videos of one of the most uncomfortable convention panels I’ve ever seen started circulating online that I knew the source of this sudden secondhand embarrassment. Participants in the Blumhouse panel, also known as Blumfest, talked a bit about the upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fnaf-2-five-nights-freddys-2-movie-trailer-teaser-foxy-1851786887"><i><span>Five Nights at Freddy’s </span></i><span>sequel</span></a><span> before revealing that Megan Fox, of </span><i><span>Transformers </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Jennifer’s Body</span></i><span> fame, would be voicing Toy Chica, the evil animatronic bird, in the live-action follow-up. This was met with an underwhelming response from the crowd, and oof, it is a brutal watch.</span></p> <p><span>I have no stake in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/five-nights-at-freddys-fnaf-2-movie-sequel-release-date-1851149677"><i><span>Five Nights at Freddy’s 2</span></i></a><span> cast, but I do understand why Fox’s casting might not elicit an enthusiastic response from the crowd. Fox’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/megan-fox-mk1-voice-acting-nitara-mortal-kombat-1-1850853516"><span>voice acting in </span><i><span>Mortal Kombat 1 </span></i><span>was atrocious</span></a><span>, and it also wouldn’t surprise me if some of the </span><i><span>FNAF</span></i><span> fandom doesn’t have a strong association with her, given the series has a pretty young fanbase and the actor was most prominent in Hollywood well over a decade ago. But the crowd at the Comic Con panel could barely muster up a polite cheer. Instead, Fox’s announcement is met with some murmurs and a </span><i><span>few </span></i><span>claps, but mostly deafening silence.</span></p>   <p><span>The panelists try to hype up the announcement by saying her name, almost as if they fear people don’t recognize her from the photo alone, and then you can hear some people in the crowd laughing at how uncomfortable it is. Whether or not Fox actually pulls off the role remains to be seen, but the whole thing feels like a miscalculation of both the crowd’s enthusiasm and, perhaps, Fox’s cultural cache. </span><i><span>Five Nights at Freddy’s </span></i><span>fans are notoriously protective of its characters, so we’ll see how they react to her performance when the movie premieres on December 5.</span></p>

              <p>Odds are you’ve seen Drew Struzan’s work at some point. The artist and illustrator was responsible for some of the most iconic movie posters around. From <em>Star Wars</em> to <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i>, he elevated the promotional marketing format into a pop art form few have been able to match. He passed away earlier this week at the age of 78.</p> <p>His career started with album art for groups like <em>The Beach Boys</em> and<em>&nbsp;Earth, Wind &amp; Fire</em>, before he moved on to creating the airbrushed one-sheets for movies that would make him famous in the late ’70s. His wife <a href="https://www.facebook.com/drewstruzan/posts/1193923778759477">revealed earlier this year</a> that he was suffering from&nbsp;Alzheimer’s disease.</p>

 <p>“Drew made event art,” Steven Spielberg said in a statement (via <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/drew-struzan-dead-star-wars-1236552587/"><em>Variety</em></a>). “His posters made many of our movies into destinations…and the memory of those movies and the age we were when we saw them always comes flashing back just by glancing at his iconic photorealistic imagery. In his own invented style, nobody drew like Drew.”</p>

His style collapsed photo-realistic portraiture into dense and dramatic compositions that married the deeply personal and the fantastical.</p>

 <p>His lasting influence on cover art of all types is immeasurable, including in video games. There are clear nods to his airbrush style and framing in the box art for the original <em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/d30a1m/image_death_stranding_new_key_art_visual_by_pablo/">Death</a></em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS4/comments/d30a1m/image_death_stranding_new_key_art_visual_by_pablo/"> Stranding</a>, and <em>Judas</em> director Ken Levine said Struzan’s work <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/judas-ken-levine-details-how-player-actions-determine-who-becomes-the-villain/">was a direct inspiration</a> for the key art for the upcoming sci-fi immersive sim.</p>

 <p>“A giant among giants,” wrote DC’s Jim Lee in response to Struzan’s passing (via <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/drew-struzan-dies-movie-posters-1236400361/"><em>Hollywood Reporter</em></a>). “His work captured the humanity, power and emotion of his subjects in ways not seen since. Thank you for bringing to life all the tentpole moments of my childhood and beyond.”</p> <p>If you’ve visited a movie theater in the last decade, you can feel the shadow cast by Struzan’s absence on the lobby walls. Some of the posters are fine. Almost all of them are forgettable. Now with the rise of AI, Hollywood seems to have less of an appetite than ever for trying to treat its biggest releases with a human touch. Thanks to the streaming revolution, movies are no longer a destination, and Struzan’s art feels as much like a relic as the stuff in those crates at the end of <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>A year after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688"><span>the first one</span></a><span>, a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><span>new leak of documents and production concepts</span></a><span> has hit Game Freak and the contents are spreading across social media. The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>developer has several upcoming games in the works, including a Generation X game, a </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>game set in Galar, and an MMO-style game that lets players explore multiple regions. But the leak isn’t just about the games that are on the way. We also learned a few interesting tidbits about older games and the inner workings of the company. While they may not be as exciting as “Generation X games will feature procedurally generated worlds,” here are a few takeaways.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b><i>Scarlet</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Violet</i></b><b>‘s DLC cost as much to make as a full game</b></h2> <p><span>I was pretty lukewarm on both of </span><i><span>Scarlet</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>‘s DLC expansions, but the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-indigo-disk-dlc-review-terapagos-1851100679"><i><span>Indigo Disk</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-teal-mask-dlc-review-ogerpon-1850839564"><i><span>Teal Mask</span></i></a><span> were such big projects that they ended up </span><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1978000011733664139"><span>costing as much as </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</span></i><span>‘ entire budget</span></a><span>. According </span><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977994754085253581"><span>to the leaks</span></a><span>, the add-ons sold around 6.15 million copies in the first 10 months, compared to the base </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>’s 27 million in sales. </span><i><span>Arceus, </span></i><span>meanwhile, moved roughly twice what the DLC did (14 million copies) at a higher price point, so Game Freak is looking to scale back budgets for its DLC packs to make the business model more sustainable.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Development Budgets:</p> <p>– SV DLC: 500 million yen<br>– Legends 2/ZA: 2 billion yen<br>– Winds/Waves: 3 billion yen</p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977779651352133635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Another interesting fact about </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>’s DLC is that while the final product ended up taking place in Kitkami and the Blueberry Academy in Unova (</span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White</span></i><span>), the original plan was to set them in Kalos (</span><i><span>X</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>/</span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>) and Alola (</span><i><span>Sun</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span>).</span></p>

The 2019 Switch games introduced a new battle gimmick called Dynamaxing that allows players to temporarily transform their monsters into powerful kaijus under certain conditions. Every Pokémon could use this technique, but a select few were able to take on new forms entirely, called Gigantamax forms, once they grew to the size of a skyscraper. One of the original 151 Pokémon, the poison-type monster Nidoking, was at some point in development going to have one of these forms. He would have sported a red crown and beard, as well as a cape on his back. It would have really leaned into the “king” part of the Pokémon’s name, but it was scrapped. It’s unknown if its female counterpart, Nidoqueen, would have also received a similar form.</span></p>

But it looks like the group was pretty different in the early concept stages. Leaked concept art shows several adult leaders in Team Star, rather than the school-aged crew we ended up facing in 2022. Some design motifs survived the iteration process, such as each member having a float/vehicle they pilot that caters to their different aesthetics, but overall, it seems like Team Star would have had a much different role if this version of the group had survived. One member has a biker/monster truck theme, another has a Wailmer-run boat, and there’s also a cunty-ass car being held up by several Togekiss. It looks like this would have been piloted by a dapper male character, and I wish I could have met this queen.</span></p>

Well, that doesn’t seem to be the case. At least, not yet. The documents in the leak make note of what the team wants for a future remake, but it’s not currently listed on any of Game Freak’s pipelines. Another developer could take on the project like ILCA did for </span><i><span>BDSP</span></i><span>, but for right now, I think we can safely assume that an eventual </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>remake is a ways down the line.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Game Freak nearly made a Pokéwalker mobile app</b></h2> <p><span>Game Freak had plans to create a PokéWalker app that would be compatible with </span><i><span>Sword</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>. This would have allowed you to take your Pokémon with you on your phone, play minigames, and even catch new monsters to send to your copy of </span><i><span>Sword</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>. The name “Pokéwalker” initially referred to a peripheral that was first introduced back in </span><i><span>HeartGold </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>SoulSilver</span></i><span> as a pedometer you could clip onto your clothes or bag, and was essentially a virtual pet compatible with the DS games. It sounds like this would have served a lot of the same function, but without the manufacturing costs.</span></p>

Before Game Freak decided to take us back to Kalos, it was considering going to Johto, the region from </span><i><span>Gold </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Silver</span></i><span>. The idea was to have two games, </span><i><span>Legends: Ho-Oh</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Legends: Lugia</span></i><span>, rather than just the lone game like </span><i><span>Arceus </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>have been. Like </span><i><span>Arceus</span></i><span>, these games would have been a period piece with a protagonist shot through time into historical Johto and seeing the beginnings of Pokémon trainers. Hopefully Game Freak revisits the idea down the line, but we do know from the leaks the next </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>game will be set in Galar.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Pokémon Legends: Ho-Oh / Lugia” (yes there were 2 versions for this one)</p> <p>2024 marks the 25th anniversary of Gold and Silver.</p> <p>A historical episode set in the past of the Gold and Silver era — “Pokémon: Tales of Then and Now.”</p> <p>Aims to be the ultimate form of the Legends series.… <a href="https://t.co/vDxNJBdnfL">https://t.co/vDxNJBdnfL</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977772672156352582?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2><b>Drama behind the scenes</b></h2> <p><span>Some of the documents refer to internal politics at Game Freak, including long-time series director Junichi Masuda being </span><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1978095519286050884"><span>“banned” from directing mainline games</span></a><span> for a period of time. According to translations of Game Freak personnel documents, employees considered the period up to </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>to be largely dominated by Masuda and felt no one in the company could oppose him, leading to a “concentration of power” and disorganization within the studio. This eventually led to an argument between Masuda and character artist Ken Sugimori during the</span><i><span> X</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span> era, ultimately resulting in the company’s decision to remove Masuda from the director’s chair. Masuda has since stayed on as a producer and supervisor of mainline games, and was able to direct the remakes </span><i><span>Let’s Go, Pikachu</span></i><span>/</span><i><span>Eevee</span></i><span> and</span><i><span> BDSP</span></i><span>. In 2022, Masuda left Game Freak for a role at the wider Pokémon Company, where he acts as Chief Creative Fellow.</span></p> <p><span>—</span></p> <p><span>More news is coming from this leak as we speak, so there might still be some major bombshells to come.

              <p>Of the many updates <i>No Man’s Sky</i> has received over the years, few have <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-corvette-steam-players-2000622428">transformed the game</a> in the same way as the <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-6-0-star-trek-mass-effect-2000620674">recently released Voyagers update</a>. Arriving toward the end of last summer, the update allows players to construct ships on a scale never seen before in the game, complete with fully traversable interiors. It led to some <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-corvette-ship-build-voyagers-update-star-wars-2000630689">wild original builds and recreations</a> of ships from legendary sci-fi franchises. Now, as spotted on Reddit recently, one player is looking to top them all with an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1o683xa/someone_built_a_deathstar/">intimidating Death Star</a>.</p>   <p>Reddit user Even-Ad648 caught sight of the ominous orb of planet-destroying death in a <i>NMS</i> multiplayer game. And though it technically looks a bit smaller than the “real” thing would be, it’s nonetheless an impressive and grim-looking spectacle.</p>

 <p>Though you can create some impressive flying machines with <i>NMS</i>’ corvettes, this Death Star clearly uses some glitching to scale to the size of an in-world space station. And, according to Even-Ad648, the game crashed once they got too close. So I guess that rules out any death-defying close runs to exploit a structural vulnerability.</p> <p>Folks have made attempts to build Death Stars before. Some have struggled a bit to perfectly match the <a href="https://x.com/tuyosi723_pilot/status/1977671635256971341">spherical dimensions of the original</a>, but <a href="https://x.com/NoMansZine/status/1976211868017676486">others have made some decent efforts</a>. Still, there’s something eerie about that one in the Reddit vid. Fly safe out there, ya’ll.</p>
