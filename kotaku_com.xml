Talk to some guys on the overworld map, get into a battle, fight all the soldiers and capture all the bases, rinse and repeat until the game is done. Even the postgame lays a clear path forward for those who want to see and do everything the game offers. With that said, you can imagine my surprise once I realized that, with over 100 hours put into the game, I found some pretty huge secrets that I <em>totally </em>missed as I played.</p><p>It’s a shame, as some of these hidden scenes and battles are pretty awesome! So whether you’re aiming for total completion yourself, or you just want to pick the game up again, here are five secrets that you don’t want to miss.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="85431102d5f363e9dfa173dfbc30dc23" data-recommend-id="image://85431102d5f363e9dfa173dfbc30dc23" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

However, even after her semi-romantic date with Ziluan and her dramatic capture by Dong Zhuo, she almost completely disappears from the main story after Chapter 3. What happened with her and Lu Bu? Where did she go?</p><p>Don’t worry, these questions have answers! <strong>To uncover Diaochan’s fate and unlock her final Bond event, you must attain complete peace in the Sili Province</strong>. You’ll naturally bolster the peace gauge if you aim to unlock every story path in the game, but you’ll almost certainly need to grind skirmishes to max out the peace in this region completely. Once you achieve total peace, a letter will appear in the inn as long as you’ve progressed far enough in the story. This will lead you to one final conversation with Diaochan, uniting her and Ziluan as they discuss what the future will look like for them.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d382e72894616303d601d87dfcb2189e" data-recommend-id="image://d382e72894616303d601d87dfcb2189e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

Fortunately, it seems Koei Tecmo and Omega Force agree, as <strong>you can unlock an entire string of Bond events with Zhang Jiao by replaying Chapter One in New Game Plus.</strong></p><p>Maxing out this Bond can be a bit tricky, as you need to complete several missions that you can’t skip by visiting Shui Jing Retreat. However, once you see the first two Bond event cutscenes, you can skip to Chapter 2 to unlock the final scene.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="37be1337b9cc242d3f4b26a7e2940820" data-recommend-id="image://37be1337b9cc242d3f4b26a7e2940820" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot from a cinematic in Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

You can save Dian Wei in Chapter 4, save Guo Jia in Chapter 5, and completely change the final Battle of Chibi by bringing Guo Jia with you and foiling Zhuge Liang’s surprise fire attack. With all these alternate outcomes, it’s <em>incredibly </em>easy to miss one <em>technically </em>unique cutscene that <em>only </em>triggers if you <em>don’t </em>save Dian Wei but <em>do </em>save Guo Jia. I <em>hope </em>my <em>use </em>of <em>italics </em>drives <em>home</em> how much <em>fun</em> I had <em>figuring </em>this <em>out</em>.</p><p>This scene genuinely adds functionally nothing to your experience, but it is a requirement if you want 100 percent story completion.

I’m left somewhere in between. Of course it’s not up to me at all, but my pie-in-the-sky hope is that we do see a sequel of sorts to <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, a kind of coda to conclude the series. But rather than being packed with more of the suspenseful violence that helped make <em>The Last of Us </em>one of the most well-known game franchises of all time, I hope the sequel leaves it behind entirely. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195928" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="190" data-playlist="195928,195922,195896" data-current="195928"><div><p>How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21446.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>(<strong>Note</strong>: this post will discuss the ending of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, so if you’re only discovering the story via the TV show, there may be what you consider <strong>spoilers ahead.</strong>)</p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler Warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Spoiler Warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The remarks, which Druckmann made during <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with <em>Variety</em></a></span>, aren’t the worst news I could have heard about the future of <em>The Last of Us. </em>If my choices are between another hyperviolent entry in the series and no game at all, I’ll choose the latter, because while I admire the first two games, I don’t think there’s anywhere meaningful left to take from the violence at their core. The characters have  already suffered so much, endured so much, and wrought so much violence themselves; what’s to be gained from seeing them continue to be trapped in this vicious cycle, enacting even more brutal violence on each other?</p><p>No. In my opinion, the only place to go from the second game’s crescendo of brutality and bloodshed, which ultimately sees one major character spare the life of another she has fought very hard to kill, is to explore who these characters become and what they’re left with <em>after </em>breaking the cycle. The only meaningful way forward for the series, it seems to me, is in seeing these characters forge some kind of new path for themselves that, at long last, leaves the violence which has exacted such a terrible price behind.</p><p>In all likelihood, such a game would never get made because that violence is considered core to the series’ marketability. The nailbiting and often staggeringly brutal combat is what makes them blockbusters. And yet, if any studio working in the so-called “AAA” space can challenge the notion that a game in a franchise like <em>The Last of Us</em> needs to involve violence, it’s Naughty Dog. After all, this is the team that produced the work which, more than any other game up to this point, goes against the conventional wisdom about M-rated AAA games: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-left-behind-the-kotaku-review-1521786675&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-left-behind-the-kotaku-review-1521786675"><em>Left Behind</em></a></span>, the story-focused DLC expansion for <em>The Last of Us. </em></p><figure id="" data-id="5741f95ef83c7d4f4b0d1bcbffaae87f" data-recommend-id="image://5741f95ef83c7d4f4b0d1bcbffaae87f" data-format="png" data-width="1654" data-height="925" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie and Riley make goofy &quot;romantic&quot; gestures in a photo booth in a moment from The Last of Us: Left Behind." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie and Riley make goofy &quot;romantic&quot; gestures in a photo booth in a moment from The Last of Us: Left Behind." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5741f95ef83c7d4f4b0d1bcbffaae87f" data-recommend-id="image://5741f95ef83c7d4f4b0d1bcbffaae87f" data-format="png" data-width="1654" data-height="925" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie and Riley make goofy &quot;romantic&quot; gestures in a photo booth in a moment from The Last of Us: Left Behind." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This release took mechanics that had been components of the original game’s brutal combat—stealthy sneaking, brick throwing, and so on--and recontextualized them as the stuff of bonding and play between Ellie and her friend (and crush) Riley while they explore an abandoned mall. <em>Left Behind </em>did still have combat in it; Ellie had to fight both humans and infected in the game’s “present day,” in between flashbacks to her trip to the mall with Riley. Even so, the DLC chapter<em> </em>illuminated the possibility for releases to exist in the AAA space that are more about storytelling, character interaction, and environmental exploration than about traditional video-game action.</p><p>So here’s what I’d love a follow-up to <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>to be: a new chapter, perhaps somewhat akin to <em>Left Behind</em>, that de-emphasizes combat or abandons it altogether, and focuses its energies entirely on bringing the story to a close that shows the characters carrying on their lives now that the circle of violence has been broken. Who can they be, now that they are no longer pursuing vengeance? What kind of relationships can they form? What kind of world can they try to build, for themselves and each other? I think these are fascinating questions, rich with storytelling possibility. I especially want to see Lev, a character introduced in <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>who is only just beginning to come into his own by the time the game ends, get to discover and define himself.</p><p>Truth be told, I think the shocking violence of the existing two games could be given new meaning if we really get to see the characters, at long last, finding their way out of it, out of its limiting and destructive patterns that have cost them all so much. We are not doomed to live that way. We can make better choices. And the remarkable thing about such a game is that, in illuminating new possibilities for the lives of its characters, it would also show new possibilities for the realm of AAA games. </p><figure id="" data-id="1014788c3765f300446ece32a500b47a" data-recommend-id="image://1014788c3765f300446ece32a500b47a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1299" data-height="724" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie looks at a skyline on an overgrown city street in a moment from The Last of Us Part II." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ellie looks at a skyline on an overgrown city street in a moment from The Last of Us Part II." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1014788c3765f300446ece32a500b47a" data-recommend-id="image://1014788c3765f300446ece32a500b47a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1299" data-height="724" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ellie looks at a skyline on an overgrown city street in a moment from The Last of Us Part II." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I don’t think it has to be a 25-hour epic like <em>Part II </em>was. A coda that just lasts three hours or so, and that maybe sells for $20, would be just fine. We know Naughty Dog isn’t abandoning blockbuster video game action; they’ve got <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-ps5-actors-1851722128?_gl=1*4y8uu8*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MTc1NDk0Mi40OS4xLjE3NDE3NTYzOTEuMTEuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-ps5-actors-1851722128?_gl=1*4y8uu8*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MTc1NDk0Mi40OS4xLjE3NDE3NTYzOTEuMTEuMC4w">the very high-concept <em>Intergalactic </em></a></span>in the works. I think that game looks rad, and I hope it sells like hotcakes. But what if, in addition to doing mainstream commercial work like that, Naughty Dog was able, with Sony’s full support, to produce something riskier, something less commercial that defied the rigid expectations that hold so much sway in mainstream gaming? Isn’t there value in making bold artistic choices, in broadening people’s notions of what’s possible within a space? It may not make heaps of money, but I bet a move like that would earn respect and be very exciting to those who care about games as an art form.</p><p>In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://carolynpetit.medium.com/broken-people-broken-worlds-thoughts-on-the-last-of-us-part-ii-a012de5d2acf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://carolynpetit.medium.com/broken-people-broken-worlds-thoughts-on-the-last-of-us-part-ii-a012de5d2acf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a piece about <em>The Last of Us Part II</em></a></span>, I lamented all the things the game, in its endless, indulgent violence, didn’t show us:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Why don’t we get to see Ellie doing the work of trying to be a better person? Why don’t we get to see her trying to rebuild things with Dina, and trying to internalize what Joel said to her, that she deserves to love and be loved? Because these remain the limits of AAA games. Because that’s the part where no shooting happens, and therefore it remains outside the scope of a game like this. Because we’re still so trapped.</p></blockquote><p>We don’t have to be trapped anymore, though. Naughty Dog has demonstrated that it’s more than capable of brilliantly creating the kind of interactive storytelling that could give <em>The Last of Us </em>the poignant, meaningful coda it deserves. I don’t really want a standard <em>Part III </em>for this series, not if it comes with even more of the horrifying, senseless, profoundly costly violence that has defined the series up to this point. But a game that breaks that cycle? That lets the series end on a note of tenderness, of muted, grounded hope for a better world or a different way of life? Yeah. That I’d like to see. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
