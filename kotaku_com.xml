              <p>Would PS VR2 have sold better if the games looked and played more like PlayStation 2 classics? Will John Romero’s next game also get suddenly canceled? And can a <em>Cyberpunk</em> trading card game bring back those awesome <em>Netrunner</em> vibes? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint,&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. It’s Game Awards Eve and I’m celebrating by remembering the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-rA5LzFc9I">special kind of hell</a> that was Joel McHale co-hosting the 2013 VGX.</p> <h2><em>The Boys</em> is getting a VR game that looks like a PS2 game</h2> <p><em>The Boys</em> is coming to Meta Quest just in time for season 5. The licensed tie-in is called <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/the-boys/5661258417332116/?srsltid=AfmBOoo8okddGts-VWwafdidPQDXpRHiKIOe81sLpIEKTA65ljxAbGVV"><em>The Boys: Trigger Warning</em></a>, drops in spring 2026 for $24, and features Butcher and Mother’s Milk “guiding from the shadows” as game protagonist Lucas Costa “sets off on a no-mercy hunt” to kill “a washed-up but still lethal family of Vought Superheroes.”</p>

 <p>As <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-boys-trigger-warning-vr-game-ps2-graphics/"><em>The Gamer</em> notes</a>, it somehow looks like something that would have come out in 2003. Despite weird, lifeless depictions of Karl Urban and Laz Alonso, the VR spin-off by Arvore Immersive Games, which is inexplicably published by Sony Pictures Virtual Reality, promises “brutal boss fights” and “partial nudity.”</p>

 <h2>Minecraft has a big new content drop</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/mounts-of-mayhem-official-release-date"><em>Mounts of Mayhem</em></a> arrived December 9 and added new creatures for players to ride and a new weapon. Spears are finally in the game, too. They bring a new lunge capability to mounts. Fans are already fantasizing about recreating the<span dir="auto" role="text"> “Charge of the Rohirrim” in <em>Minecraft</em>.</span></p>  <p>The developer was speaking at Salón del Videojuego de Madrid (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-cancelled-shooter-has-been-saved-with-fresh-redesign-inspired-by-elden-ring"><em>Eurogamer</em></a>) when he confirmed that Romero Games is working on a new project that “incorporates a lot of the elements” from a game that was cancelled earlier this year when Microsoft <a href="https://kotaku.com/romero-games-xbox-layoffs-shut-down-canceled-game-1851785765">suddenly pulled funding</a>. “We’re not starting at ground zero,” he said. “We can take pieces out of and put into a brand new indie game. We have a lot of stuff we can put in the game. The design is completely different, but the team is very excited about the new design.”</p>

 <h2>Switch Online is getting two more N64 adventures</h2>  <p><em>Rayman 2: The Great Escape</em> and <em>Tonic Trouble</em> are getting added to the Expansion Pack on December 17. It’s the first time the Ubisoft classics will be available on a modern console, which may help get fans primed for the eventual new<em> Rayman</em> game Ubisoft is reportedly working on.</p>

 <h2>Microsoft is reportedly working on getting legacy Xbox games running on PC gaming handhelds</h2> <p>That’s according to industry leaker NateTheHate. “There exists a hope to make legacy Xbox (OG and Xbox 360) games [backwards compatible] on ROG and Windows. Whether they succeed is the unknown; but there is an effort being made,” he wrote on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jason-ronald-on-25th-anniversary-we-want-to-celebrate-the-legacy-of-xbox-as-well-as-define-the-future-of-where-the-xbox-ecosystem-is-going.1376665/#post-148633819">gaming forum ResetEra</a>. “The other unknown would be how extensive will the initiative be in offerings. Will it be what we currently have on Series or will BC expand to add more titles across the Xbox ecosystem.”</p>

 <h2><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> is getting turned into a trading card game</h2>  <p>The<em> Cyberpunk TCG</em> is a collaboration between CD Projekt Red and TCG newcomers WeirdCo. Characters like Johnny and Panam will make the cut for the starting set, as will<em> Edgerunners</em> characters like Lucy. It’s still not entirely clear what the mechanics of the game will be, but it looks like it will revolve around cybernetic enhancements, as you’d expect. The game will be crowdfunded through Kickstarter.</p> <h2>Warner Bros. is reportedly sticking with the Netflix deal</h2> <p>Despite Paramount’s 11th-hour bid of over $100 million, which included financing from Saudi Arabia and Jared Kushner, <a href="https://x.com/Lucas_Shaw/status/1998550897232880032"><em>Bloomberg</em>‘s Lucas Shaw</a> says Warner Bros. Discovery isn’t interested. The company is expected to stick with Netflix’s bid after the streaming platform shored up support among its board. Maybe it’ll bring back <em>Succession</em> for a bonus season to celebrate.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-theft-card-store-phantasmal-flames-2000651666"><em>Pokémon</em> card thieves went on a $100,000 burglary spree</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-game-awards-statue-theory-2000651769">The Game Awards hell statue is probably for a new Larian Studios RPG</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-review-switch-sakurai-2000651657"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> isn’t shy about being a Switch 2 sugar rush: our review</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-lenovo-15-laptop-with-good-everyday-specs-drops-75-off-but-only-on-amazon-not-official-site-2000652164</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Basic computing needs haven’t changed much over the years, and most people don’t need gaming rigs to handle their daily digital lives. Email, web browsing, video streaming, and video calls represent the bulk of what typical users do with their laptops, and the <strong>Lenovo V15 G2</strong> handles these tasks without breaking a sweat or your budget.</p>
<p>This 15.6-inch machine packs enough power (8GB DDR4 RAM, 256GB PCIe SSD, WiFi 6) for anyone who needs a reliable Windows 11 laptop for everyday productivity and entertainment. The good news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6337/">Amazon has just slashed the price to a record low of $299, down from the typical $1,199 asking price</a>, while Lenovo’s official website maintains full pricing without similar discounts available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6337/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real-World Computing Performance</h2>
<p>The <strong>Intel Celeron N4500 dual-core processor</strong> runs at base speeds that can go up to 2.8GHz when applications need more processing power and it is enough power for most people’s everyday computing tasks. This chip won’t beat high-end processors in benchmarks, but it starts Chrome quickly, can handle a lot of browser tabs without slowing down too much, and runs Microsoft Office apps smoothly. The built-in Intel UHD Graphics handle video encoding without any stuttering or lag that would interrupt conversations, so video calls through Zoom or Teams work well.</p>



<p>The 8GB DDR4 RAM gives you enough room to comfortably multitask with normal application loads: You can keep your email open while you work on a word processor, a spreadsheet, and several browser tabs without having to close applications all the time to keep performance up. This 8GB setup leaves enough free memory for your actual work, but power users who often work with dozens of tabs or apps that use a lot of memory may eventually run into problems.</p>
<p>A <strong>PCIe SSD gives you 256GB of storage space and fast boot times and instant application launches</strong> that make modern computers feel responsive: You can keep a good number of documents, photos, and media files on your computer, but people with a lot of videos or games will need to be more careful about how they use their storage or buy external drives. The PCIe interface makes it possible to quickly back up files or move large folders instead of taking a long time and the lack of moving parts means that the device will run quietly and be more durable when it is moved.</p>
<p>The <strong>Full HD display is 15.6 inches wide and has a resolution of 1920×1080</strong> which makes text easy to read without straining your eyes and gives you enough space to work comfortably. Anti-glare coating cuts down on reflections from windows and overhead lights, so you can see clearly no matter what kind of lighting you have at home, at work, or at a coffee shop. The laptop’s thin bezels around the screen give it a modern look while making the most of the display area. The Dolby Audio speakers make the sound clearer than the cheap laptops’ tinny sound which makes the laptop more fun to use for streaming shows, listening to music, or video calls where you need to hear everyone clearly.</p>
<p>The 720p webcam has a <strong>physical privacy shutter that blocks the camera lens</strong> when you’re not using it which solves security issues without needing tape or third-party covers that leave residue. The video quality is good enough for casual video calls and meetings, but content creators who want high-quality streaming will need to use external cameras. What’s more, WiFi 6 support gives you faster wireless speeds and better performance in busy network areas than older WiFi 5 standards.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to connect<strong>, including USB-A ports for older devices, USB-C ports for newer accessories</strong> and data transfer, HDMI output for external monitors or presentations, and an Ethernet jack for when wired networking is more reliable than WiFi. The keyboard has a full-size numeric keypad that is useful for anyone who works with spreadsheets or enters data. The layout of the keyboard follows standard spacing, so there is no need to get used to it.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Home comes with a familiar interface for Windows users: It gives you access to the Microsoft Store, built-in productivity apps, and works with the huge library of Windows software. This hardware runs the operating system smoothly, without the lag that comes with underpowered machines. It stays responsive during normal daily use.</p>
<p>When entry-level Windows laptops from big-box stores often cost more and have similar or worse parts, spending $299 on a laptop with these specs is a great deal. Lenovo usually charges $1,199 for Celeron-based hardware, which seems high. However, even when compared to realistic market rates, this 75% discount gives you a complete, working laptop for a price that is only slightly higher than a basic Chromebook.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ring Battery Video Doorbell Priced Like Basic Doorbell, Amazon Plays Zero Profit on Own Brand]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ring-battery-video-doorbell-priced-like-basic-doorbell-amazon-plays-zero-profit-on-own-brand-2000652158</link>
            <guid>1378597</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ring belongs to Amazon, which gives the retail giant complete freedom to price these video doorbells however aggressively it wants without worrying about profit margins on individual units. Amazon’s strategy focuses on getting Ring devices installed in as many homes as possible and knows that subscription revenue and ecosystem lock-in will pay off long-term even if the hardware sells at cost or below.</p>
<p>The newest<strong> battery doorbell model delivers head-to-toe video coverage with 66% more vertical view</strong> than the previous generation, and captures packages on the ground and tall visitors’ faces in a single frame. This<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/"> latest version currently sells for $49 on Amazon instead of the usual $99</a>&nbsp;which marks a record low price that makes smart doorbell technology accessible to practically anyone with a front door and a WiFi connection.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6333/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Video Coverage That Shows What Really Matters</h2>
<p>The <strong>bigger vertical field of view is a big improvement over older Ring doorbells</strong> which often cut off the tops of tall people’s heads or packages on the ground below the camera’s frame. This full-body coverage gets rid of the annoyance of having to watch footage again and again only to find that important details are missing because they were out of the camera’s view: You can clearly see the faces of delivery drivers while also making sure they really left your package instead of just pretending to deliver it. You can also see people who look suspiciously like they’re casing your property while they think they’re outside the camera’s range.</p>



<p>The<strong> built-in rechargeable battery</strong> means you don’t have to connect the doorbell to your home’s electrical system so renters or anyone who doesn’t want to deal with electrical work can install it. You probably already have cables that work with the USB-C charging port because it uses modern connector standards that are the same as those used by most new phones and tablets. When the battery gets low, just take the doorbell off its mount, plug it into any USB-C charger, and put it back in place after a few hours.</p>
<p>With the <em>Live View</em> feature, <strong>you can use the Ring app on your phone to see what’s going on at your door</strong> at any time, even if no one has pressed the doorbell button or motion detection has been triggered. This is helpful if you’re waiting for a delivery and want to see the driver, if you want to make sure your kids got home from school, or if you just want to see what’s going on outside without having to walk to the door.</p>



<p>When there is movement near your door, <strong>motion detection sends real-time alerts to your phone</strong>. However, the basic notifications only let you know that motion was detected and don’t say what caused it. Ring’s subscription service offers Smart Alerts, which use AI to tell the difference between people, packages, and other moving things like cars or animals. This way, you get more useful notifications that help you decide if something needs your immediate attention.</p>
<p>With Alexa integration, you can stream doorbell video to Echo Show devices all over your house, use Alexa speakers to announce visitors, or use voice commands to control Ring functions. You can ask Alexa to show you the front door, and within seconds, the video feed will appear on compatible Echo displays which lets you check who’s there without having to pull out your phone.</p>
<p>When you consider that smart doorbells from well-known brands usually cost between $150 and $250, spending $49 on a Ring video doorbell with its build quality and features is a great deal. Amazon’s usual price of $99 already made this a good deal compared to other options, but the 50% discount makes it so cheap that it is almost as cheap as regular doorbells from home improvement stores.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals Fans Are Terrified Of Rogue, And She’s Not Even Out Yet]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-rogue-reaction-vanguard-release-date-tank-2000652174</link>
            <guid>1378543</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Rogue has always been one of my favorite X-Men thanks to the </span><i><span>X-Men Evolution </span></i><span>animated series and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-movies-best-worst-ranked-deadpool-logan-wolverine-1851595435"><span>the Fox movies</span></a><span> I grew up with (justice for Anna Paquin!), and I was curious how </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a> <span>would balance a hero with unlimited possibilities for a competitive game. Now that we’ve finally seen her in action, it’s clear NetEase just made her a comic-accurate powerhouse, and fans are terrified of the power-siphoning hero’s abilities.</span></p>  <p><span>For those not steeped in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-97-disney-plus-premiere-impressions-1851356830"><i><span>X-Men</span></i></a> <span>knowledge, Rogue is a mutant with the ability to absorb people’s memories, personality, and powers at the slightest touch. Typically, this exchange causes a great deal of pain for the affected person, and Rogue can even kill someone through skin-to-skin contact if she hangs on long enough. </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>is implementing this into her kit, as she is able to absorb an ability from nearly every other character in the game. This lets her change her playstyle on the fly; she might take Doctor Strange’s shield to raise team-wide defenses, for instance, or copy Invisible Woman’s crowd-controlling bubbles to move enemies around.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Anyone playing Rogue has to be adaptable, as she can only copy abilities from enemies on the field, rather than just pulling from the roster at her whim. She’s not too dissimilar to Echo from </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>, whose ultimate lets her copy an enemy or ally’s form and kit, but Rogue still maintains her own cooldowns and abilities when she siphons an ability. Even without taking an ability from one of her foes, Rogue is a powerhouse of a tank. Her primary attacks are pretty straightforward, as she punches, kicks, and tosses around enemies like they’re nothing. She also has a block move that minimizes damage as she absorbs all that energy for a more powerful punch.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Rogue looks great for leading the front line and controlling a crowd, and that all comes together in her Ultimate, which creates an area-of-effect that siphons health, ult charge, and some other properties from heroes in her proximity. This gives her a ton of survivability and drains resources from enemies, some of which seems to be based on what enemy classes are in your field. Early footage shows her absorbing what looks to be base health from other Vanguards. The ult charge absorb is the real boon here, as that can undermine some of your opponents’ plays before they even get a chance to fire off their game-changing abilities. As you can expect, fans are both excited to play as this powerhouse and also scared to see her coming out of the enemy spawn.</span></p>         <p><span>All that said, some fans </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1pircv5/rogue_cant_steal_abilities_from_punisher/"><span>think she might have a weakness</span></a><span> when she drops on December 12. Based on the footage we’ve seen of her thus far, it seems like heroes that don’t technically have superpowers may be safe from her ability siphon. Punisher fights with firearms, and doesn’t seem to have the icon that shows Rogue can steal a power from him. So maybe Rogue’s counter is actually just regular guys who shoot at superheroes, like Hawkeye and Black Widow. We’ll know for sure when she launches on Friday.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Genies Avatar SDK Lets You Build Customizable Avatars and Drop Them Straight Into Your Unity Game]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/genies-avatar-sdk-lets-you-build-customizable-avatars-and-drop-them-straight-into-your-unity-game-2000651849</link>
            <guid>1378540</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Game characters have come a long way in the last few years, but Genies — the company best known for its ultra-stylized digital avatars — is kicking that evolution into high gear. After announcing a partnership with Unity this summer, the company has begun rolling out its first set of tools to developers: the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6338/">Genies Avatar SDK, now available on the Unity Asset Store</a>.</p>
<p>The process is exceptionally easy: Drop this package into your project, and suddenly your game can support high-fidelity, fully customizable player avatars that persist across any game built using the Unity dev engine and that plugs into the same system. The avatars are then available across Unity-based games. The Genies Avatar SDK gives players something games have tried (and often failed) to nail for years — a digital identity that’s entirely theirs, not one feels like a generic character creator pulled from a dropdown menu.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6338/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Genies</a></p>

<h2>Change On the Fly</h2>
<p>The Genies editor lets players tweak body features, facial details, outfits, hairstyles, and accessories with a surprising amount of nuance. There’s a built-in “Closet” with starter clothing, and new outfits will roll out regularly, with developers able to also toss their own designs into the mix. Thanks to the company’s auto-rigging pipeline, custom wearables snap onto any avatar without breaking animations, clipping through bodies, or tanking visual fidelity.</p>
<p>Developers get a flexible avatar framework baked directly into the SDK. It comes with a ready-to-use character controller and can plug into existing animation systems if you already have one. NPCs can be created through the same editor — meaning every character in a world, not just players, can share the same expressive stylization. More importantly, everything persists. If a player unlocks or buys a wearable in one experience, it lives in their inventory everywhere the Genies system is supported.</p>



<h2>Bringing It All Together</h2>
<p data-start="2161" data-end="2490">The Genies SDK also includes a streamlined login flow. Instead of making players juggle passwords or account portals, Genies uses a one-time email code system that carries a user’s avatar and items from game to game. For any developer building a social space, UGC world, or multiplayer hub, that’s the holy grail.</p>
<p data-start="2492" data-end="3028">But Genies is already teasing what comes next — and this is where things get&nbsp;<em>really</em> interesting. The company is developing an AIGC SDK that can generate game-ready 3D assets in minutes, a Smart Avatar SDK that turns NPCs into AI-driven characters capable of learning and adapting to players, and a Genies Party SDK that bundles all of this into a platform for IP-driven experiences. Their stated goal is to turn some of the most tedious parts of development — asset creation, rigging, optimization — into fast, automated workflows.</p>
<p data-start="3030" data-end="3308">Whether this becomes the next big shift in game development or just a very fancy avatar creator remains to be seen. But if you’re curious, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6338/">the Avatar SDK is already live on the Unity Asset Store</a> — and Genies says it’s only the first step in a much cooler, more ambitious plan.</p>

            <guid>1378534</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-skyrim-port-switch-2-upgrade-free-release-date-trailer-dlc-2000651683"><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – Anniversary Edition</em> was shadowdropped</a> onto the Nintendo Switch 2. Bethesda promised this port of the classic 2011 open-world RPG was an improvement on the Switch 1 version. And in some ways, that’s true. But players are disappointed by how it runs and feels, and by all the space it takes up.</p> <p>The original <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch felt like a big deal at the time in 2017. Bethesda getting its ambitious RPG running on Nintendo’s portable hybrid console was wild to see, and it became a solid way to experience <em>Skyrim</em> while on the go. So, when <em>Skyrim</em> made the leap to Switch 2 yesterday, fans were excited to see Bethesda’s aging RPG get a big shot in the arm on the more powerful hardware. And visually, this new version of <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 does look nicer, with many of the enhancements to models and textures found in the other Anniversary Edition ports. So that’s nice!</p>

  <p>However, for some reason, this 2011 game, which runs at 60FPS or more on almost every other platform, remains stuck at 30FPS on Switch 2, as if it were 2017 all over again. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1piid4c/skyrim_swith_2_is_absolutely_terrible/">Across Reddit and social media</a>, fans feel that this 30FPS cap is one of the biggest problems with this new port. As many point out, games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2-2077-switch-2-mouse-mode-greyed-out-turn-on-1851785724"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a> run at 40FPS on Switch 2, yet <em>Skyrim</em> is still stuck at 30? Another annoying issue is that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1piegpl/input_delay_on_skyrim_switch_2_edition_is_terrible/"><em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 seems to have horrendous input lag.</a> Some players are calling it borderline unplayable in handheld mode, and coupled with the 30FPS cap, it adds up to <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 feeling like shit.</p>

 <p>And what’s baffling is that this version of Skyrim takes up 53 GB of space on <em>Switch 2.</em> In comparison, the Special Edition version of <em>Skyrim</em> on PC is 12GB. Add the <em>Anniversary Edition</em> DLC upgrade, and it requires approximately 25 GB of space. Meanwhile, on Xbox Series X/S, <em>Skyrim Anniversary Edition</em> has a digital footprint of 32GB. Why the Switch 2 version is this big is unknown, though some speculate it’s a mistake. Others wonder if it has to do with the Switch 2 hardware itself and how Bethesda’s old tech runs on it. Either way, it’s wild to think that <em>Cyberpunk</em> on Switch 2 is only 10GB bigger, at around 60GB, and looks 10 times better and runs at a higher framerate. Something seems off here.</p> <p>Hopefully, Bethesda does the other thing it’s famous for:<a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-next-gen-update-fix-bethesda-new-patch-xbox-1851469635"> patching its broken games</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4s-10th-anniversary-update-is-a-complete-shit-show-that-nobody-wanted-2000642938">terrible updates</a> to make things more playable. But until then, you might want to hold off on buying <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2.</p>
