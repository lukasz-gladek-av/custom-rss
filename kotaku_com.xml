            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s unclear exactly how big the audience is for an exceedingly faithful remaster of an RPG spin-off that came out over 25 years ago, even if it does have <em>Final Fantasy</em> in the name and is one of the best games ever made. But those who fell in love with <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> once they discovered it and have been obsessing about it ever since care very much about the upcoming <em>Ivalice Chronicles</em> remaster, especially what it will or won’t change about the original, and what it might mean for a potential sequel all these years later.</p> <p>You can find <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-ivalice-demo-hands-on-changes-2000622300">my thoughts on what I played</a> of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics – The Ivalice Chronicles</em> recently behind closed doors at PAX West 2025, but a recent barrage of interviews with the development team has provided some more clues about what fans can expect from the overhaul. The game isn’t out until September 30, but the director of the project has already been tipping his hand about some big questions I’ve had, including how the remaster approaches <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>‘ most broken characters.</p> <h2>Orlandeau Thunder God Cid will still be OP</h2> <p>Every<em> Final Fantasy</em> has a Cid, and <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>‘ is by far the most broken. He joins your party late into the game and comes with a full suite of magic sword abilities with no charge time that do incredible damage. He also arrives equipped with Excalibur, which auto-casts Haste on the user. He’s a wrecking ball that trivializes every fight, which is why I have a strict rule against ever using him.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">If we remaster it, what do you think about whether it is better to weaken " The Thunder God Cid", who was accused of destroying the balance&nbsp;?</p> <p>— 松野泰己🐈‍⬛ (@YasumiMatsuno) <a href="https://twitter.com/YasumiMatsuno/status/1664069034579759104?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 1, 2023</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It sounds like he will still be that way. “We haven’t made any changes to characters that were powerful,” director Kazutoyo Maehiro <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-devs-havent-made-any-changes-to-characters-that-were-powerful-because-they-didnt-really-want-to-disappoint-og-fans-with-nerfs/">told <em>Gamesradar</em></a>. “And similarly, not just for the unique characters, but for jobs such as the arithmetician, we haven’t made any major changes.” While some classes like Archer have been buffed, the team wanted to avoid players experiencing any moments of “your favorite job got nerfed.”</p> <h2><em>FF7</em>‘s Cloud won’t suck so much when you first get him</h2> <p>The <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> protagonist has an unusual cameo in <em>Tactics,</em> where he not only appears in the world but can be recruited and used in battle. I won’t get into the story details that explain Cloud’s arrival, but in the original game he’s kind of a pain to use, at least until you finish his side quest. That’s changing for <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em>.</p>

 <p>“We’ve made it so that his stats are adjusted a little bit. On top of that, he will come equipped with the Materia Blade when he joins your party initially,” Maehiro <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-maehiro-minagaintewa-interview-sequel-advance">told <em>Inverse</em></a>. “So in terms of usability of him as a character, it will be much more approachable than it was in the original.” Players will also be able to recruit him earlier in the remaster, starting in chapter 4. It remains to be seen if the charging time and attack power on his Limit command will get the buffs they deserve.</p> <h2>The Wiegraf boss fight isn’t easier, but it won’t break your save file</h2> <p>Wiegraf is one of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>‘ most tragic characters and most difficult enemies. Most first-time players are completely unprepared for the unique one-on-one fight with the ex-revolutionary that the game throws them into without warning about halfway through. Worse still, in the original game, the encounter happens inside a castle, wedged between two other encounters with no opportunity to go grind on the world map if you’re having trouble. Without a backup save, a playthrough can grind to a complete halt this way.</p>

 <p><em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> doesn’t make Wiegraf easier, but it does offer a new option to back out of the fight if you’re having trouble. “We have the ability to retry battle, or when you’re doing consecutive battles, you can actually back out to the world map,” Maehiro <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-maehiro-minagaintewa-interview-sequel-advance">told <em>Inverse</em></a>. “We have those types of features for accessibility and ease of play.” Players can also switch to the easy mode if they’re having too much trouble, or they can exploit one of the many strategies fans have come up with over the years to make easy work of Wiegraf and his OP holy sword attacks (including a glitch <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/finalfantasytactics/comments/196bg6h/wiegraf_fight_yeah_you_know/">that’s still in the new version</a>).</p> <h2>Genji armor stealing is back in a day-one patch due to popular demand</h2> <p>Another big fight in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is against Marquis Elmdore in the Limberry Castle. One of the things that’s unique about it is that Elmdore has a full set of Genji samurai gear that appears nowhere else in the game. Diligent players can spend the entire battle trying to steal it from him but it’s very difficult because, among other things, Elmdore has an ability that reduces the success rate below 20 percent unless you spend a lot of time debuffing him.</p>

 <p>Stealing the armor was only possible in the U.S. version of the original game, not the Japanese version or the later <em>War of the Lions</em> port that was based on it. The option is coming back for <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em>, though. “In interviews when the game was announced, we received a lot of feedback from fans both in Japan and overseas saying, ‘I wish we could steal Genji equipment,'” Maehiro <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/51058">told <em>Famitsu</em></a>. “Matsuno, the director of the original version, also mentioned the same thing, so we decided to make it possible to steal in the Enhanced Version. This will be reflected in a patch on the release date, so please connect online and apply the patch.”</p> <h2>The Time Mage’s all-powerful Teleport skill now costs 3,000 JP to unlock</h2> <p>This one cuts me to my core. Teleport is one of the best skills in the game, and you can have a character learn it very early as long as you grind for job points to unlock it in a couple of battles. It lets a character try to move anywhere on the battlefield, but the farther the square is from their current location, the lower the probability of success. On levels divided by castle walls or other difficult terrain, however, it makes it easy to dominate the battlefield.</p>

 <p>In the original game, the skill only costs 600 JP. It’s a steal. Not so in the remaster. <a href="https://www.rpgfan.com/feature/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-chronicles-kazutoyo-maehiro-interview/">As pointed out by <em>RPGFan</em></a>, the skill now costs 3,000 JP to unlock. That’s going to be a whole lot of characters standing around attacking one another before a battle ends to grind for points. At least this way, finally obtaining the skill will feel a little less easy-mode.</p> <h2><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> could still get (another) sequel</h2> <p><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is far from the only strategy RPG Square Enix has released, even in recent years. There were two spin-offs on Game Boy Advance back in the 2000s and more recently, the spiritual successor, <em>Triangle Strategy,</em> which is to <em>Tactics</em> what <em>Octopath Traveler</em> is to <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>. But for some fans, none of these games ever hit the way the original did and they’re still pining for some cosmic convergence that captures tactical-RPG lightning in a bottle a second time.</p> <p>“Our first and foremost goal here really was to recreate the original game,” Maehiro <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/final-fantasy-tactics-refresh/">told<em> Wired</em></a>. Though he can’t make any promises, there’s apparently a possibility <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> could get additional new content in a future update if the game sells well enough. “If [<em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em>] were to become a success,” he continued, “I do feel that that would then lead to discussions around potentially bringing out sequels, for example, or newer tactical RPGs.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-review-impressions-horror-bloober-team-silent-hil-2-ps5-2000622488</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/in-the-new-horror-game-from-silent-hill-2-remake-devs-cats-are-your-best-allies.1287699/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A few hours into playing <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>,</em> while I was creeping around a desolate and nightmarish world filled with dilapidated buildings and creepy, fleshy monsters, I heard a cat meow from behind a locked door. Later, after killing some nasty horrors and solving a puzzle, I returned with bolt cutters and freed the cat. In exchange, it granted me a useful item. All future cats I found in <em>Cronos</em> did the same. It was good to have an army of cats as allies in this strange, hellish world. Also good: <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em>, the latest horror game from Bloober Team.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482">Last year’s <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake from Bloober Team</a> proved that the studio, which has sometimes been criticized for making sloppy, bad horror games, could knock it out of the park if given the chance. But remaking one of the greatest scary games of all time into something that’s also scary and good, while impressive, arguably isn’t as hard as creating something unique and fresh that is also memorable and creepy in its own right.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-horror-new-bloober-cronos-new-dawn-xbox-1851675319">So I was both excited and nervous about <em>Cronos</em></a>. Could Bloober deliver a worthy follow-up to the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake that was also a game wholly of its own creation? Well, the answer is mostly yes. While <em>Cronos</em> isn’t as good as <em>Silent Hill 2</em> (but like, what is?), it is still a fantastically nasty third-person horror game that is a perfect post-apocalyptic, sci-fi survival experience that fans of<em> Resident Evil 4 </em>will feel right at home with.</p>

  <p><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> is a third-person horror game that places you in the big, lumbering boots of The Traveler. This strange character is a time traveler of sorts with advanced weaponry and tech. Her mission, or “vocation,” is seemingly to fight back against a dangerous, unnatural virus that turns people into sickly, decaying monsters that only want to kill you and merge their flesh together with other monsters and corpses. Doing so lets them grow stronger, and you’ll want to burn bodies to stop that from happening. At some point in the ’80s, as seen during sections of the game in which you go back in time briefly, this horrible virus spread across the planet and destroyed everything. Now you and your fellow Travelers work tirelessly to stop it, contain it, and learn more about it. Or maybe, you all are to blame…</p> <p>The narrative <em>Cronos</em> weaves is weird and kept me guessing for most of my time playing it. Sadly, I wasn’t able to finish the game and had to restart it due to some technical issues involving the game’s PS5 build (don’t worry, this won’t happen to you), but from what I was able to play (and later re-play), <em>Cronos</em> tells an odd story that isn’t like that in any horror game I’ve played in recent memory. It doesn’t always work and it can sometimes feel like you go long stretches without the narrative moving forward, but I mostly enjoyed peeling back another bloody layer of flesh from this disgusting onion.</p>

 <p>The real meat of <em>Cronos</em> is found outside of the cutscenes and dialogue. Most of the game is spent creeping around horrible places with limited ammo, health items, and other resources, trying desperately not to die to some nasty flesh-ghoul in the dark. Combat in <em>Cronos</em> is tough at times, especially if you let any of the monsters merge with dead monsters or other corpses. Bigger enemies easily made me burn through most of my ammo and sometimes proved tougher than the actual boss fights. Thankfully, you can use the environment to your advantage; there are many oil tanks and red barrels dotted around the wasteland, which can be very useful for thinning out the herds of enemies the game sometimes throws at you.</p> <p>I do expect some will be put off by how much combat is in <em>Cronos</em> and how hard it can be, especially if you aren’t hoarding resources like a crazed survivalist who has spent too many weeks listening to Joe Rogan podcasts. I liked the tough-as-nails encounters, especially as I started to upgrade my suit and guns and could put up a better fight, but your mileage may vary.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000622721" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000622721"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000622721">©Bloober Team</figcaption></figure> <p>Between these fights and scrapping for supplies, you occasionally solve environmental puzzles by using a strange energy tether tool that can let you manipulate time by either rewinding or fast-forwarding specific areas of the map through the timeline. So a set of collapsed stairs can be rewound to when they were whole again, or a fallen piece of flooring can be brought back to its original location and raised like an elevator in the process. It’s a neat trick that looks cool, but it sometimes felt like the designers forgot it was a part of <em>Cronos</em>, and I’d go a long time between these time shenanigans. Still, I enjoyed messing with the flow of time, and being able to rewind it to bring back a red barrel and use it again against flesh monsters was fun.</p> <p>What I didn’t enjoy were the technical issues I encountered playing <em>Cronos</em>. While things greatly improved after Bloober Team sent me a new build of the game running on PS5, I still encountered performance spikes, weird animation bugs, broken subtitles, and some classic Bloober Team jank. The quality of character dialogue also varies wildly. Sometimes folks you encounter sound like real people, with great performances supporting excellent writing, and other times you might think you’re watching a cheesy <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em> horror movie, just without the bots and Joel riffing over the top of the bad acting and clunky dialogue. Thankfully, the game is mostly the Traveler talking to herself and the cats she finds while recording and documenting everything.</p> <p>I’m excited to return to <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> and finish it, as the large chunk of the game I played, while at times rough, was an earnest and dedicated attempt by Bloober to create something new and creepy. Not every part of <em>Cronos</em> succeeds at what Bloober set out to do, but most of it does, and often in a way that sets it apart from other recent horror games. <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-bloober-team-underdog-proved-wrong-remake-1851787141">This might not be as good as the<em> Silent Hill 2</em> remake</a>, but those craving a new third-person survival horror game that is more shooty-shooty, like <em>RE4</em> or <em>Dead Space,</em> will want to check out <em>Cronos</em> when it launches on September 5 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2 and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nothing grabs consumer eyeballs like a bundle deal. But who could possibly avert their eyes when Amazon takes an elite-level touchscreen laptop like<strong> the Dell Inspiron 15 3535 and bundles it with Windows 11 Pro and a box of goodies including a stylus pen, camera privacy cover, and USB flash drive</strong>, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3882/">and offers that $3,000 package for just $800?</a></p>
<p>The Dell Inspiron 15 3535 alone at that price is a steal, especially when you see how loaded this model is.<strong> It’s packed with 32GB of RAM and a fat 1TB solid-state drive, with the AMD Ryzen 7 processor at the heart of the machine to make everything run fast and smoothly</strong>. The bundle add-ons of usually sold-separately necessities like <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/windows-11-pro">pre-installed Windows 11 Pro</a> with Copilot, a protective sleeve, and 128GB USB flash drive are the clincher that make this deal truly amazing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3882/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>No Shortcuts Taken</h2>
<p>We know, bundle deals are often just the sweetener to sell an iffy product that doesn’t move units on its own. This is most definitely not that. The Dell Inspiron 15 3535 is a total beast, with a 15.6-inch touchscreen that’s also LED-backlit and full-HD (1920×1080 resolution) with a refresh rate of 60Hz. The screen takes up nearly all of the inside lid thanks to the slender borders. The AMD Ryzen 7 processor can really cook, with speeds of up to 4.5GHz at the ready.</p>
<p>The Dell Inspiron 15 3535 isn’t one of those thick, heavy old-school laptops that are a chiropractor’s nightmare when carried in a shoulder bag. It’s sleek and trim at just three-quarters of an inch thick with the lid closed, and the 3.6 pound weight isn’t going to drag you down. The anti-glare screen, HD webcam, and generous array of ports and connection options complete the package.</p>



<h2>Meet Your Copilot</h2>
<p>This bundle deal also does not skimp on the operating system, as Windows 11 Pro is preloaded and just a press of the power button away from launch. Pro is designed for business professionals and power users, packed with advanced security network management features. It also comes with Copilot, one of the very best of the huge recent wave of AI assistants. Copilot is a great source for quick, accurate research, and if you’re ever stuck on writing the perfect email or any other creative effort, Copilot is one of the best assistants around.</p>
<p>This incredible bundle is topped off with an accessories kit that includes a stylus pen (remember, the Inspiron is a touchscreen), privacy cover for the webcam, 128GB USB flash drive, laptop dust plug, protective sleeve, and microfiber cleaning cloth. These are all of the little incidentals that can run up a shockingly big bill as add-ons, and they’re free. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3882/">Amazon’s $800 deal on this massively packed bundle is a killer 73%-off deal that brings you an elite-level laptop, OS, and accessory package at a savings of $2,200.</a></p>

              <p>Why was a decision that saved <em>Borderlands</em> such a dumb one to make? What was it like to play <em>Prey 2</em> at E3 2011? Will <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> eventually come to Switch 2? Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Yours truly is still recovering from the weekend’s PAX West marathon and I have a bunch of interviews and previews still to publish on the site throughout the week. In the meantime, let’s take a short walk down memory lane.</p> <h2>Watch someone play Bethesda’s canceled sci-fi shooter <em>Prey 2</em></h2>  <p>Let’s talk about <em>Prey 2</em>. The short version is that <em>Prey 2</em> was a sequel to a popular 2006 shooter by Human Head Studios about solving puzzles on an alien spaceship. It got a big blowout showing at E3 2011, including a playable demo that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/jun/20/e3-2011-prey-2-game-preview">generated a ton of buzz</a>. As a bounty hunter in an alien city, players used guns and parkour to chase suspects and choose how to apprehend them. A robot punished you if you caused too much immersive sim chaos,&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>style.</p> <p>The game was supposed to come out in 2012 but never did. What was most surprising of all was that Bethesda never provided clear reasons for why the project was suddenly scuttled. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/05/what-went-wrong-with-human-heads-prey-2">There were reports</a> of contractual disputes and Bethesda leveraging the <em>Prey 2</em> publishing agreement to try to fully acquire Human Head Studios. Ultimately, Arkane began working on a reboot of the game that would become 2017’s very different sci-fi immersive sim <em>Prey</em>. This is where the <a href="https://kotaku.com/leaked-e-mails-suggest-bethesda-misled-gamers-about-pre-1149092622">term of endearment “press sneak fuck” was born</a>.</p>

 <p>Now fresh footage of the original <em>Prey 2</em> has leaked on YouTube under the account “David Halsted.” There are five videos totaling just over 20 minutes of gameplay showing off different features as well as the E3 demo. “I remember when they revealed this at PAX back in the day,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n6zcc8/prey_2_development_videos_leaked/?share_id=GehdxVGPPqJefxwNWn5Ci&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">wrote one fan on Reddit</a>. “The whole con was buzzing about how cool it was and how hype we were for it. And then we got whatever it rebooted as. Dream revival game though.”</p> <h2><em>Borderlands</em> devs reflect on its “insane” art style overhaul</h2> <p>Gearbox’s loot shooter series is known for its <em>Diablo</em>-style loot, rude attitude, and bubblegum wrapper cel-shaded art style. But it was not always thus. Early in development, the first game in the shooter series looked like a broke knock-off of <em>Fallout 3</em> and <em>Rage</em>. That’s how it appeared in a <a href="https://kotaku.com/that-time-team-fortress-2-and-borderlands-changed-art-s-1749106652">demo at E3,</a> and on the cover of a 2007 <em>Game Informer</em> containing a deep dive on the game back before anyone had ever even heard of Claptrap.</p>

 <p>The magazine is back <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/01/the-behind-the-scenes-story-of-the-art-style-swap-that-saved-borderlands-1">with a new series of interviews</a> about Gearbox’s race to overhaul the grim, gritty, and dull look of the game to help it stand out and eventually become the mega-hit it is today. Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford gave members of the art team permission to look into overhauling the art style, even as milestone deadlines were breathing down their necks:</p> <blockquote><p>It was, like, five guys with two weeks to go mess around with the look and the feel, and I immediately knew I made a mistake. I was like, ‘S—. We’re trying to get to Alpha, dude. There’s a business here. I’m responsible for other people’s money. I’m going to let these guys spin for two weeks, which means they’re going to be even more invested in what they’re doing, and then I have to go in and look at what they did, and I have to shoot it in the head. That’s what’s going to happen here. Son of a b—-. I’m an idiot. Why did I do that?’ But there was something in my heart that knew that we had to at least look at and explore. I knew we weren’t right.</p></blockquote> <h2>There’s another <em>28 Years Later</em> movie coming in just a few months called<em> The Bone Temple</em></h2> <p>Ralph Fiennes got so ripped fo<em>r 28 Years Later</em> that they made him the star of the sequel just 12 months later. <em>The Bone Temple</em> will briefly have Cillian Murphy return as Jim from the original movie as well. He’ll have a much bigger role in a trilogy-capping third movie arriving after <em>The Bone Temple</em>.</p>

  <h2><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> director can neither confirm nor deny the existence of a Switch 2 port</h2> <p>The turn-based GOTY contender seems like a perfect fit for Nintendo’s new handheld hybrid. Will it get there sooner or later? Sandfall Interactive isn’t saying. “We have some possibilities that we will explore, but at the moment we cannot confirm anything,” the studio <a href="https://www.nintenderos.com/nintendo-switch-2/sandfall-interactive-esta-explorando-lanzar-clair-obscur-expedition-33-en-nintendo-switch-2/">told <em>Nintenderos</em></a>. That sounds like a studio who promised not to disclose that they have a Switch 2 dev kit.</p> <h2><em>Stellar Blade 2</em> is fully in development</h2> <p>That’s according to <a href="https://x.com/genki_jpn/status/1963102317886283809">developer ShiftUp’s latest financial report</a>. “We are actively pursuing the franchise development of the ‘Stellar Blade’ IP and are currently developing a sequel to ‘Stellar Blade.'” The game is supposed to have a bigger world and some additional action mechanics. In the meantime, the first game is another candidate ripe for porting to Switch 2.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-saudi-arabia-street-fighter-6-sony-esports-2000622367">Fighting game pros are confronting Saudi Arabia’s new co-ownership of Evo</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-corvette-steam-players-2000622428"><em>No Man’s Sky</em>‘s Voyager update is leading players and the game’s Steam records to new heights</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381">A look at&nbsp; <em>Kpop Demon Hunters</em>‘ cultural takeover</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>
