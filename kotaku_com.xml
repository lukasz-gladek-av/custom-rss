              <p>Apple’s official 20W USB-C charger is a $19 single-port affair that doesn’t include any cables in the box. Anker’s solution flips that equation entirely, with two chargers <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/">sporting dual-ports apiece, plus two included USB-C cables, all for just $12 on Amazon right now</a>. That’s down from the regular $18 price and an all-time low for this bundle. You’re essentially getting five times the charging capability for less than what Apple charges for their basic single-port adapter, and you won’t need to hunt down cables separately since Anker includes <strong>two 5-foot USB-C to USB-C cables</strong> in the package.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Dual-Port Flexibility Changes Your Charging Setup</h2>
<p>Each charger <strong>has both a USB-C and a USB-A port,</strong> each of which works simultaneously, enabling you to charge two devices from a single wall outlet. The maximum output of 20W is intelligently split when you charge two devices simultaneously, though when charging just one device through the USB-C port, you get the full 20W for fast charging speeds. This dual-port design is very convenient, especially for traveling when hotel rooms never seem to have enough outlets, or when everyone in your family has a different device that they need to charge in the same area.</p>



<p>This means the 20W of power delivery through <strong>USB-C charges an iPhone from zero to 50 percent in roughly 30 minutes</strong> – just like Apple’s own fast chargers-and it works across iPhone 15, 16 and 17 series models, iPad Pro, and other USB-C devices that support Power Delivery protocol. For comparison, it would take older 5W chargers, which used to ship with iPhones, nearly two hours to reach that same 50 percent charge level.</p>



<p>Anker designed these chargers with compact form factors that <strong>keep them from blocking adjacent outlets on power strips or wall plates</strong>. The foldable prongs on the US version further make them more travel-friendly by removing the sharp edges that can snag on clothing or scratch other items in your bag. About the size of Apple’s standard charger, these easily slip into a laptop bag, purse, or jacket pocket without adding bulk.</p>
<p>The included safety features address common charging concerns through Anker’s proprietary protection system. Overvoltage protection prevents power surges or inconsistent electrical supplies from causing any damage and thus is important during international travels or when one has to use the electrical systems of older buildings. Monitoring temperature control means this charger will not overheat during a long session and can throttle power output in case temperatures rise above safe thresholds. Short-circuit protection provides protection against wiring faults that may otherwise damage connected devices.</p>
<p>Those <strong>two included 5-foot USB-C to USB-C cables add a considerable value</strong> as quality USB-C cables usually cost $10-$15 each if you buy them separately. This 5-foot length is long enough to use your device comfortably while charging, unlike those frustratingly short 3-foot cables that make you sit right next to the outlet. These cables support the full 20W power delivery which means you are not bottlenecking the charging speed through some inferior cable.</p>
<p>That comes to $6 per complete charging setup when you buy two dual-port chargers plus two cables for $12, which is less than a third of what Apple asks for its base single-port adapter before cables. It gets even better because, with Apple, you would have to purchase the cables separately which will easily push the price tag north of $25 per charging setup if you were buying from Apple.</p>

              <p>Apple products have long carried a premium price tag that puts them out of reach for many shoppers, forcing budget-conscious buyers toward mid-range Windows laptops instead. The landscape shifts dramatically this Black Friday as Amazon drops<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/"> the 2025 MacBook Air with M4 chip and 256GB SSD storage to $749, slashed from its regular $999 price</a>. This 25% discount is an <strong>all-time low that arrived on Friday</strong>, November 14th, and makes Apple’s latest-generation laptop accessible at the same price point as solid mid-range Windows alternatives. Apple famously avoids Black Friday sales in its own retail stores which means you need to check authorized retailers like Amazon to catch these deals when they surface.</p>

<h2>M4 Performance That Redefines Ultraportable Computing</h2>
<p>The M4 chip provides a significant performance jump over previous MacBook Airs due to the improved architecture of the CPU and GPU that handle demanding workloads with ease. The eight-core CPU splits into performance and efficiency cores, with the system apportioning intensive tasks to high-power cores and routing background processes to power-sipping efficient cores.</p>



<p>The 16GB of unified memory is a significant boost compared to the base configuration of 8GB that shipped with previous models, offering plenty of RAM overhead for professional applications and serious multitasking. Unified memory architecture means the CPU and GPU share one pool of memory, averting the data transfer bottlenecks inherent in systems where graphics processors must copy data from system RAM into dedicated video memory.</p>



<p>Storage comes by way of a 256GB SSD, providing ample room for the operating system, essential applications, and working files; however, heavy media creators or users with considerable local storage needs may want to look into external storage options. The SSD uses Apple’s custom controllers, which have a read speed of over 2,000MB/s, making the MacBook Air launch applications instantly and transfer large files in seconds.</p>
<p>The <strong>Liquid Retina display is 13.6 inches with a resolution of 2560×1664 and a support for one billion colors</strong> for excellent color accuracy and detail that is rivaled only by displays on much more expensive professional laptops. It will automatically adjust the white balance using True Tone technology if the ambient lighting changes. This reduces eye strain during marathon work sessions since color temperature is consistently maintained independent of your surroundings.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Intelligence integration brings AI-powered writing assistance</strong>, content generation and automation of tasks right into macOS through on-device processing that keeps your data private. This personal intelligence system helps in drafting emails, summarizing documents, generating images, and organizing information-all without sending your data to cloud servers.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life reaches up to 18 hours of mixed use</strong> which translates to full workdays without hunting for power outlets or carrying charging cables. This endurance comes from the efficiency of Apple Silicon combined with macOS optimization that manages background processes aggressively. The laptop delivers consistent performance whether plugged in or running on battery, unlike many Windows laptops, which throttle performance significantly when unplugged as a means of preserving battery life.</p>
<p>At $749, this MacBook Air is cheaper than many premium Windows ultrabooks.</p>

              <p>Power outages leave you sitting in the dark with dead phones and spoiling food in the fridge while camping trips often mean sacrificing modern conveniences or lugging noisy generators. Jackery’s Explorer 1000 portable power station solves both problems by <strong>delivering 1,500W of clean and quiet power</strong> that runs refrigerators, charges laptops and keeps essential devices operational wherever you need electricity. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/">has slashed the price to $349 from the usual $699 for Black Friday, which marks an all-time low that undercuts even Prime Day pricing</a>. This 50% discount makes backup power accessible at a price point where you’d normally find much smaller capacity units with limited output capabilities.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Serious Power Output in a Portable Package</h2>
<p>The <strong>1,500W of continuous AC output</strong> tackles demanding appliances that smaller power stations can’t touch: air conditioners, full-size refrigerators, electric kettles, and power tools. The <strong>3,000W surge peak</strong> covers the inrush of power at startup for appliances with motors, which generally requires two to three times the running wattage for a brief moment. That surge capacity means you can cold-start a refrigerator or air conditioner without tripping the protection circuits on the power station-a problem that frequently occurs with underpowered portable generators.</p>
<p>The battery capacity, <strong>1,070Wh</strong>, translates to approximately 1.07 kilowatt-hours of stored energy-sufficient to keep an average refrigerator running for about 12 to 15 hours, charge a laptop eight to ten times, or run LED lights for days. This capacity sits in the sweet spot between smaller units that drain too quickly and larger systems that become impractical to move around. At <strong>just 23.8 pounds</strong> with a foldable handle, the power station remains genuinely portable rather than being a stationary unit that requires two people to relocate.</p>



<p>Jackery fitted this model with LiFePO4 battery chemistry instead of the more conventional lithium-ion, which grants it much better longevity and safety characteristics. The LiFePO4 cells retain more than 70% of their original capacity after 4,000 charge cycles, which equates to well over a decade of regular use before you’d notice significant capacity degradation.</p>



<p><strong>The capability for one-hour fast charging</strong> requires the emergency charging mode, which can be turned on via the Jackery app and will push this power station from empty to full in sixty minutes when you need a quick turnaround. The default for the system is a 1.7-hour charging mode that optimizes battery health by reducing stress on the cells during charging, adding to the long lifespan.</p>
<p>Port selection largely covers most device types: <strong>two USB-C ports providing 100W each, one USB-A port, one DC car port, and three pure sine wave AC outlets</strong>. The 100W USB-C ports can charge modern laptops at full speed with no need for bulky power adapters, while pure sine wave AC output safely powers sensitive electronics like medical devices or audio equipment that can be damaged by modified sine wave inverters found in cheaper units.</p>
<p>For sale at $349, this power station is half its regular price and brings with it capabilities that easily command between $600 to $800 in today’s market.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This HP Laptop with Serious Specs (Ryzen 7, 1TB SSD, 32GB) Is Down $2,200, Now 73% Off on Amazon]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-hp-laptop-with-serious-specs-ryzen-7-1tb-ssd-32gb-is-2200-off-but-hp-is-keeping-it-quiet-on-amazon-2000644474</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-hp-laptop-with-serious-specs-ryzen-7-1tb-ssd-32gb-is-down-2-200-now-73-off-on-amazon.1354396/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Budget laptops usually force you to compromise on something important whether that’s skimping on RAM, settling for slow storage or accepting some dim screen that strains your eyes. <strong>HP’s 2025 laptop breaks that pattern by packing 32GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U</strong> processor into a package that Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5596/">currently offers for $799, slashed from the typical $2,999 price</a>. This 73% discount is an all-time low and brings professional-grade specifications to a price point where you’d normally find an entry-level machine with half the memory and storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5596/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Professional Workloads</h2>
<p>The base frequency of the AMD Ryzen 7 7730U is 2 GHz with <strong>up to 4.5 GHz turbo, 8 cores, and 16 threads for powerful computing</strong> that will make short work of even the most demanding applications. This multi-core architecture is great for running parallel workloads such as video encoding, 3D rendering, or virtual machines. With 16 threads, the processor can support twice as many simultaneous operations as it has physical cores, meaning smoother multitasking when you’re working with dozens of open browser tabs along with office and productivity programs in addition to background applications.</p>



<p>The 32GB of high-speed RAM includes generous headroom for memory-intensive workflows that would choke on the 8GB or 16GB found in most budget laptops. Professional software like Adobe Creative Suite, statistical analysis tools, or development environments utilizing multiple running containers all benefit from this expanded memory capacity. You can keep numerous applications active simultaneously without experiencing the slowdowns that occur when systems run out of physical RAM and resort to slower disk-based virtual memory.</p>



<p>Storage comes via a 1TB PCIe SSD which affords rapid boot times and near-instant application launches compared to traditional hard drives or even older SATA SSDs. PCIe solid-state drives connect directly to the motherboard through high-speed lanes that enable transfer rates often exceeding 3,000MB/s, meaning large file operations complete quickly rather than devolve into progress bar watching sessions.</p>
<p>The <strong>display is a 15.6-inch FHD touchscreen that operates at 1920×1080 with IPS technology</strong> so colors are accurate and viewing angles are wide. The micro-edge design minimizes the bezels around the screen to create a more immersive viewing experience and makes it feel larger than its actual diagonal measurement. Touch functionality adds another input method that feels natural for certain tasks like scrolling through long documents, zooming into images, or interacting with the touch-optimized interface elements under Windows 11.</p>
<p>For $799, this laptop is priced lower than many mid-range options, yet has specs typical of laptops costing between $1,500 and $2,000. The 73% discount places it in the unusual position of actually getting you legitimately premium components at budget pricing, not the other way around, where you pay premium prices for budget hardware.</p>
