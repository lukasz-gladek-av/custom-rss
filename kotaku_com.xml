            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Well, I didn‚Äôt have this on my 2025 bingo card, which is a thing I assume we all have. <a href="https://kotaku.com/mars-attacks-video-game-mars-attracts-theme-park-burton-1851629159">There‚Äôs a <em>Mars Attacks!</em> video game out this week on PC</a>, and more surprisingly, it‚Äôs a really fun, if somewhat rough around the edges, theme park management game that plays a lot like a sci-fi spin on <em>Zoo Tycoon</em> and <em>Two Point Hospital. </em></p> <p>Cleverly titled <em>Mars Attracts,</em> this newly released theme park management sim lets you abduct humans from throughout history and build a theme park around displaying them like animals while also experimenting on them in horrible ways for science. And also to provide entertainment to your depraved Martian guests. And after spending a few hours with <em>Mars Attracts,</em> I‚Äôm both excited to play more and also disturbed by how quickly I turned on humanity in the pursuit of building the coolest theme park on Mars.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/mars-attracts"><em>Mars Attracts</em></a> isn‚Äôt based on the ‚Äô90s <em>Mars Attacks</em> movie directly, but instead is based on the original trading cards that inspired Tim Burton‚Äôs cult classic film, so don‚Äôt expect Pierce Brosnan and Sarah Jessica Parker to pop up at any point. Instead, <em>Mars Attracts</em> uses the OG card art and lore as its foundation to build out a wild theme park management simulator. And all of the new in-game art created for<em> Mars Attracts</em> is fantastic, perfectly emulating the old look of the cards. I really want some of these loading screen and pause menu images printed out as big posters.</p>

  <p>So what do you do in <em>Mars Attracts</em>? Well, you build theme parks. But it‚Äôs not as simple as plopping down some paths, food stalls, trash cans, and rides, and calling it a day. The Martians in <em>Mars Attracts</em> are coming to your park to see different human beings from various points in history, like the Wild West and Ancient Rome. Through the use of time travel and UFOs, you send off aliens to go collect humans and items from a given time period, which you then place in exhibits. And while you have some humans collected, you might as well run experiments on them. Not only does this please many of your guests, but it also helps you earn the various research currencies needed to unlock upgrades and new things to build. It‚Äôs a lot more fun than researching new tech in other park builders. In those games, I don‚Äôt even get to torture and kill one single human, let alone dozens.</p> <p>Of course, the humans you collect aren‚Äôt going to be happy about this situation, so you‚Äôll need to make sure you keep their enclosure clean and filled with food troughs and water dispensers, and not poke and prod them too much. If a human gets too angry and wants to break out, they just might, and you‚Äôll need to call in security to stop them.</p>

 <p>And if you have an excess of human beings, you can also just dissect them and use their parts to build new kiosks and entertainment options for your guests. Want to provide your Martians with balloons made out of human lungs? You can do just that, once you‚Äôve killed enough humans. If this all sounds morbid and disgusting, don‚Äôt worry. <em>Mars Attracts</em> features a cartoonish and silly aesthetic that makes it easy to have a good time while torturing your human captives.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000626566" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626566"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626566">¬©</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Mars Attracts</em> is currently in early access on Steam, and while I didn‚Äôt experience any annoying bugs or crashes while building out my incredible parks across the game‚Äôs first few starting zones, I did notice some missing text and a lack of sound effects. There‚Äôs just a general sense that the game isn‚Äôt finished yet, which is exactly what I would expect from an early access indie game. I also felt like some parts of the in-game economy felt grindy, and it can be annoying managing supplies when it feels like your workers aren‚Äôt doing what you expect. So if you prefer your games to be more feature-complete, perfectly balanced, and‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶finished, then you might want to wait.</p> <p>For everyone else, if you love building out wacky hospitals in <em>Two Point</em> or building elaborate parks in <em>RollerCoaster Tycoon</em>, I‚Äôd definitely recommend<em> Mars Attracts</em>. It‚Äôs the weirdest theme park builder I‚Äôve played in a long time, but also a fantastic spin on the genre that sci-fi fans and <em>Mars Attacks</em> lovers will enjoy for hours and hours.</p>

              <p>The race to define what the brutal murder of right-wing podcaster Charlie Kirk last week means and why it happened has led a lot of people to say a lot of things. Some of those things, like blaming the sci-fi shooter <em>Halo</em> for fomenting class warfare, or suggesting the alleged shooter was <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-tyler-robinson-discord-reddit-memes-2000625746">radicalized by the ‚Äúmeme-ification‚Äù of the internet</a>, look increasingly like absurd, knee-jerk, and ill-informed reactions, as a recent report about the actual contents of one of the gaming Discord servers the suspect was active on suggests none of that.</p> <p>On Monday, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2025/09/15/charlie-kirk-shooter-suspect-discord-chat/"><em>The Washington Post</em> reported</a> that alleged gunman Tyler Robinson had admitted to the crime in a Discord message to friends last week. Yesterday, independent <a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/exclusive-leaked-messages-from-charlie">reporter Ken Klippenstein shared actual screenshots</a> of messages allegedly posted on the server, alongside an interview with some of its other members. According to his report, the Discord hangout was far from the hotbed of political radicalization some politicians and pundits have claimed it would be.</p> <p>According to Klippenstein, there were only a couple of mentions of either President Donald Trump or former President Joe Biden in the chat logs, and those were apolitical mentions of recent news events. ‚ÄúCat memes, weather updates, home improvement and the odd Garfield reference populate Robinson‚Äôs posts,‚Äù Klippenstein writes.</p>

 <p>‚ÄúObviously he‚Äôs okay with gay and trans people having a right to exist, but also believes in the Second Amendment,‚Äù an apparent childhood friend of Robinson‚Äôs told Klippenstein.&nbsp;‚ÄúTo all of us he just seemed like a simple guy who liked playing games like <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>,&nbsp;and <em>Helldivers 2</em>, loved to fish and loved to camp‚Ä¶it really did seem like that‚Äôs all he was about.‚Äù</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">üö® BREAKING NEWS: CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit have been called to testify in front of Congress.</p> <p>They will answer to the American people how their platforms have been used by RADICALS to advance POLITICAL VIOLENCE, including the assassination of Charlie Kirk. <a href="https://t.co/bNbgqSLeNq">pic.twitter.com/bNbgqSLeNq</a></p> <p>‚Äî Oversight Committee (@GOPoversight) <a href="https://twitter.com/GOPoversight/status/1968328735108800739?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This lack of an easily applicable, ready-made narrative about Kirk‚Äôs alleged murderer that would paint him has a politically aggrieved radical comes as those leading the national conversation, <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/kash-patel-testimony-senate-judiciary-charlie-kirk-assassination/">like FBI Director Kash Patel</a>, <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/charlie-kirk-conspiracy-theories-roil-maga-media-groyper">rush to ascribe motives</a>. ‚Äú[Gaming] can desensitize to the point where that person involved in these games looks at other people‚Ä¶and they‚Äôre not even human beings, they‚Äôre simply avatars,‚Äù former FBI profiler Dr. Mary Ellen O‚ÄôToole <a href="https://x.com/kenklippenstein/status/1967419550817042749">told Fox News this week</a>.</p>

 <p>According to charging documents filed by Utah County prosecutors on Tuesday, Robinson told his roommate in text messages that he allegedly killed Kirk because ‚ÄúI had enough of his hatred. Some hate can‚Äôt be negotiated out.‚Äù <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/16/us/text-message-tyler-robinson-roomate-vis">The prosecution‚Äôs evidence suggests</a> Robinson may have targeted Kirk specifically over transphobic comments he made in the past. But it also didn‚Äôt allude to any political radicalization fomented by online platforms like Discord and Reddit. That hasn‚Äôt stopped at least one high-profile politician from calling on the executives of those companies to testify before Congress about ‚Äúthe radicalization of online forum users.‚Äù</p> <p>‚ÄúThe politically motivated assassination of Charlie Kirk claimed the life of a husband, father, and American patriot. In the wake of this tragedy, and amid other acts of politically motivated violence, Congress has a duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence,‚Äù House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) <a href="https://oversight.house.gov/release/chairman-comer-invites-ceos-of-discord-steam-twitch-and-reddit-to-testify-on-radicalization-of-online-forum-users/">announced on Wednesday</a>. ‚ÄúTo prevent future radicalization and violence, the CEOs of Discord, Steam, Twitch, and Reddit must appear before the Oversight Committee and explain what actions they will take to ensure their platforms are not exploited for nefarious purposes.‚Äù</p> <p>The hearing is set to take place on October 8, 2025 and is the first time Discord in particular will have been called on to testify. Members of Tiktok, X, and Meta <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=twitch+other+companies+called+testify+congress&amp;sca_esv=c6620bc555597255&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifPkzG72RanLTFQQWJFtRCj0QoXIBg%3A1758129266918&amp;source=lnt&amp;tbs=cdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A9%2F3%2F2022%2Ccd_max%3A8%2F3%2F2025&amp;tbm=">were grilled last year</a> about online child safety concerns. A spokesperson for Discord has previously said there was ‚Äúno evidence that the suspect planned this incident or promoted violence on Discord.‚Äù</p>

              <p>Have you ever dreamed of playing <em>Halo</em> on an <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-an-original-xbox-easter-egg-thats-remained-hidden-1846926839">original Xbox</a>, but you didn‚Äôt want to use a big TV? And you also wanted to risk damaging your game disc and/or fingers in the process while holding a large technological monstrosity in your hands? Well, that‚Äôs a strange dream you have, buddy, but I got just the video for you.</p> <p>On September 16, as spotted by <em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/hardware/handhelds/now-i-can-take-steel-battalion-with-me-everywhere-hey-gamers-ive-found-your-xbox-handheld/">GamesRadar</a></em>, YouTuber, retro console enthusiast, and modder James Channel <a href="https://youtu.be/W3OK9A_RbSI">posted a new video</a> to his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Games_for_James">wonderful channel</a> all about his wild and wacky experience turning an OG Xbox into a portable handheld console in the most janky way possible. It‚Äôs a fantastic video that involves Channel getting shocked, ripping apart multiple electronic devices, and covering the entire beast in a bunch of duct tape. Here‚Äôs the video, which is admittedly 33 minutes long, but totally worth watching.</p>  <p>Something I really appreciate about this video is how committed the modder is to making sure this handheld Xbox looks and feels hacked together. It‚Äôs like a Frankenstein‚Äôs monster of a console, with pieces and parts from an old iPod dock crammed on top of an Xbox‚Äôs motherboard. And while it takes him a few attempts and a lot of tinkering, he does eventually pull it off and is able to play <em>Halo</em> in one of the wildest ways possible. It also seems very dangerous, as there is a DVD spinning incredibly fast just a few inches away from his fingers and face at all times.</p> <p>This monster of a thing even sports a relatively impressive 9 minutes and 40 seconds of battery life. That might not sound like a lot, but keep in mind this slapdash device relies on nearly 20-year-old batteries from an iPod dock. The fact that it can even run at all on just those ancient chemical husks is incredible. And if you were then wondering, ‚Äú<a href="https://kotaku.com/games/steel-battalion">Can this thing play <em>Steel Battalion</em></a>?‚Äù well, yes. <a href="https://youtu.be/W3OK9A_RbSI?t=1964">Yes, it can.</a></p>
