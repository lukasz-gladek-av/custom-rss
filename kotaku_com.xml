              <p><span>The </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>soundtrack</span></a><span> is going to dominate people’s year-end streaming roundups, and fans are hungry for more songs from its girl group. While there was a moment where we thought we might have gotten a new Huntr/x banger that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-huntrix-spotify-new-song-mazatlan-by-night-2000632680"><span>turned out to be a Spotify hack</span></a><span>, Netflix hasn’t put out any new music from the fictional K-pop group yet. What’s a Huntr/x fan to do other than listen to the soundtrack on loop? Well, Ejae, the singing voice of lead vocalist Rumi, has finally put out her own debut single, and yeah, the girl can sing even when she’s not slaying demons.</span></p> <p><span>“In Another World” is a ballad that sounds like something you’d hear over a Disney musical’s end credits. It’s definitely giving the late 2000s/early 2010s adult contemporary diva, along the lines of Leona Lewis and Adele, so don’t come expecting a Huntr/x-style banger here. All that said, the song is a vocal showcase for Ejae, who soars over its chorus as she sings of an estranged relationship that’s fallen through. Check it out here:</span></p>   <p><span>Ejae’s career trajectory has been inspiring to watch unfold as </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ success has put her in the spotlight. She began training to be a K-pop idol at a young age in 2003, although she wasn’t approved for a debut for over a decade. Ultimately, she discontinued her idol training to pursue a career as a songwriter. After working with groups like Red Velvet and&nbsp; Le Sserafim, she was brought onto </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span> to write songs and record demos, then was asked to be Rumi’s singing voice in the final film. And now, she’s got some of the biggest songs of 2025 and is becoming a household name and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-tonight-show-golden-performance-ejae-2000633180"><span>performing on late-night talk shows</span></a><span>. Add her to the list of later-in-life success stories that teach us to never give up on our dreams.</span></p>

              <p>Upgrading to a new business laptop shouldn’t mean breaking the bank, but it also doesn’t mean settling for something basic just to save money. Ideally, your work laptop should be powerful enough to handle your busiest days, plus support some weekend fun like gaming or streaming without slowing down.</p>
<p>HP offers some of the best options on the market for this, though the performance usually comes with a higher price tag. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4992/">Thankfully, that changes today. Amazon is currently offering a mind-boggling 75% discount on the 17.3-inch HP touchscreen laptop, bringing the price down to just $750.</a> Honestly, that’s what you’d pay for most entry-level machines on a normal day, and the offer doesn’t end here. You’re also getting a free accessory kit worth almost $200 with your purchase. The only catch? The discount ends soon, meaning you don’t have a lot of time left to grab it. Snag it for less while the offer is still available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4992/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Powerful Processor for Impressive Multitasking</h2>
<p>Starting with the performance, you’re getting an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U processor that’s made to support heavier applications and creative tasks without lags. Along with that, there’s 32GB of RAM to take care of multitasking. Whether your day requires you to hop between multiple programs at once, use a ton of different tabs simultaneously, or test your sanity with longer, never-ending spreadsheets, it’s all going to be possible. Storage-wise, you’re covered with a 1TB SSD that’s spacious enough to house all your essentials, plus also ensures faster boot times.</p>



<p>The large 17.3-inch display is much bigger than most other options in this range, and gives you plenty of screen real estate for work and play. Visuals stay lifelike in all lighting conditions, thanks to its anti-glare coating. You’ve also got a full-sized keyboard that’s quite comfortable to use – you won’t be left with a sore wrist at the end of a long work day.</p>
<p>This machine runs on Windows 11 Pro, which comes pre-installed. The operating system is one of the most user-friendly ones out there, and Copilot integration takes the experience even further. You’re going to have an AI assistant ready to help you 24/7. Need help with a math problem? Ask away. Figuring out how long to bake that cake? It’s got you covered. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4992/">Other freebies include a wireless mouse, a USB hub, a 128GB USB flash drive, and a 7-in-1 cleaning kit.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The AI arms race is currently eating up hundreds of billions of dollars in investment as companies compete over a technology whose exact benefits are still far from clear. Microsoft is at the center of that fight. How is the head of Microsoft gaming thinking about <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-ai-clockwork-revolution-brian-fargo-inxile-2000616038">fitting AI into development</a>? “Our AI use today is much more operational than it is in the creative space,” Phil Spencer said during a recent panel discussion.</p> <p>As reported <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-on-ai-use-much-more-operational-than-it-is-in-the-creative-space">by <em>IGN</em></a>, he was speaking at the Paley International Council Summit in Palo Alto, California on the topic of “Big Ideas, Small Games: Creativity Beyond the Blockbuster” with Double Fine studio head Tim Schafer <a href="https://kotaku.com/keeper-the-kotaku-review-xbox-game-pass-how-long-is-it-good-price-2000637702">following the release of <em>Keeper</em></a>. Microsoft has been pushing AI into all of its products and CEO Satya Nadella has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-15/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-on-his-ai-efforts-and-openai-partnership">bragged about</a> relying on multiple AI assistants throughout the day to run one of the biggest tech firms in the world.</p>

 <p>But it’s less clear how those tools are being used by rank-and-file employees within the company, <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-gen-ai-idxbox-layoffs-npc-chatgpt-1851785609">especially on the gaming side</a>.&nbsp;According to Spencer, Microsoft gaming’s biggest deployment of AI technology right now is in its platform moderation tools. The company <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/13/xbox-transparency-report-new-ai-solutions/">announced last year</a> that it’s been using AI tools to help flag and intercept offensive or spam-related communications on Xbox.</p>

 <p>“So we have AI that we use to make sure that the conversation and topics that are happening, and for protected child accounts and other things and who gets to talk to those accounts to those people, is locked down by parents or guardians who are setting those controls,” he said during yesterday’s panel. “That’s our primary use of AI inside of our organization today, which maybe isn’t the most glamorous use of AI, but it’s something that I fundamentally believe in.”</p>

 <p>When it comes to other applications on the player-facing front, Spencer suggested AI could also help with one of the biggest challenges in gaming right now: game discovery and curation. “It’s not in practice today, but is there a way for us to use discovery based on things that you’ve done in the past to surface the next thing that you might not know about that might be interesting to you?” he speculated.</p>

 <p>When it comes to game development, however, Spencer seemed to downplay any significant use of AI tools when it comes to things like creating concept art, programming code, or scripting dialogue.&nbsp;“On the creative side, I really leave it up to the teams,” the executive said. “I have found that creative teams will use tools that make their job easier when it makes their job easier, and any top-down mandate that ‘Thou must use a certain tool’…is not really a path to success. I look at the teams, and we make tools available, and I kind of let it organically percolate.”</p> <p>He continued,</p> <blockquote><p>On the production side, which I think is where a lot of people go…we don’t have any goals in our model for that to happen. I think more about the pace of creativity, maybe the number of things we can try and take risks on before we decide on our next opportunity. But our AI use today is much more operational than it is in the creative space.</p></blockquote> <p>That’s a far cry from the promises that some gaming company executives are making about how AI can help them drastically cut costs and ship games more quickly and efficiently. Last year, EA CEO Andrew Wilson said AI was at “<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-says-ai-is-the-very-core-of-its-business-what-does-that-mean">the very core</a>” of the <em>Madden</em> and <em>Battlefield</em> publisher’s business. That company is <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">now reportedly banking on an AI</a> revolution to help it service a new $20 billion loan as part of a private equity buyout led by Saudi Arabia.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-elite-series-2-core-controller-is-selling-fast-as-amazon-clears-out-stock-at-an-all-time-low-2000638568</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-elite-series-2-core-controller-is-selling-fast-as-amazon-clears-out-stock-at-an-all-time-low.1333879/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Xbox Elite Series 2 controller has a heftier feel, made from heavier materials to give you some real weight to hold onto in your hand when compared to the standard Xbox wireless controller. It’s also got a rubberized grip and short hair triggers. The thumbstick mobility can be adjusted to your exact preferences, plus you get a lot of swappable parts to truly cater to your playstyle. T<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4990/">hat normally retails for $180 (even though Amazon says its usually $200), but right now, the site has it one sale for just $153.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4990/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Customize Your Way of Play</h2>
<p>While you can get the white Elite Series 2 controller for the cheaper price of just $130, that only comes with the core controller plus a tool for thumbstick adjustment and a USB-C cable. The Xbox Elite Series 2 controller in black comes with the whole kit and caboodle. Along with the thumbstick tool and charging cable, you get a charging dock to place your controller in when you’re done playing. This will ensure you always are starting any gaming session at 100%.</p>
<p>You also receive a set of four back paddles which can be assigned to any button function. By default, they will be assigned to the face buttons of A, B, X, and Y. This any first person shooter play so much better. No more do you have to take your thumb off the right stick to jump or to reload or to slide or switch weapons. Just tap one of the paddles without giving up your aim.</p>



<p>On top of that, it comes with three pairs of additional thumbsticks in different styles. The default ones are similar to what you find on Xbox’s standard controller, with the concave center and grips along the edges. The first additional pair of sticks is just a backup of the standard pair. Then you also get a dome designed set of sticks as well as the standard style but taller. It felt weird at first, but I like using the short standard on the left stick but then the tall one on the right which allows for more precise movements while aiming.</p>
<p>Your last swappable piece is the additional d-pad which has the classic plus-sign design so you can switch between whichever of the two you prefer.</p>
<p>And then all those pieces not currently in use on your controller can hang back in the included carrying case. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4990/">This fits your Xbox Elite Series 2 controller plus all the little bits and bobs, making traveling with it to a friend’s house convenient.</a></p>
