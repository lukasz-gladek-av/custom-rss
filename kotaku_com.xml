              <p>Govee had great deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday, but those sales are over now. However the company <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5825/">just put this TV backlight (<em>3 Lite</em> model) on sale for a short time, bringing the price down to $58, down from $89</a>, which is the <strong>lowest price we’ve ever seen</strong>, matching the best Black Friday price. Amazon shows that 10% of stock has already moved, and these flash sales typically disappear fast once word gets out.</p>
<p>This lighting system fixes the problem of wanting immersive bias lighting that changes color with what’s on screen instead of just glowing a static color behind your TV. The camera-based sync technology<strong> reads what’s on your screen and projects those colors onto the wall behind your TV.</strong> This makes the room feel more inviting and makes movies and games more immersive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5825/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How Fish-Eye Correction Makes Sync More Accurate</h2>
<p>The camera on top of your TV records what’s on the screen and analyzes it in real time to<strong> figure out what colors should be on each part of the LED strip</strong>. Traditional ambient lighting systems have trouble being accurate because cameras distort the images they take, especially at the edges where fish-eye warping makes it hard to tell what color it is.</p>
<p>This <strong>model has built-in fish-eye correction</strong> which means that the camera applies inverse distortion to the image it takes before it analyzes colors. This means that the lighting matches what is happening on screen instead of showing vague approximations: You can see this more clearly in scenes with clear color zones, like a sunset on one side of the screen and dark shadows on the other.</p>



<p>The<strong> RGBICW LED setup has red, green, blue, independent cool white, and warm white chips</strong> in each lamp bead. This lets you choose from four different colors for each segment along the strip. This multi-chip design makes the system better at making whites and pastels than RGB-only strips, which make white by mixing red, green, and blue at full brightness. The separate white chips also let you use these lights as functional bias lighting with the right white temperatures when you’re not watching something that needs color sync. The <strong>11.8-foot length is long enough to cover 55-65 inch TVs</strong> with enough strip to run along three sides of the display which makes the wrap-around effect without the need for complicated multi-strip installations.</p>
<p>It takes about 15 to 20 minutes to set up: You just have to clean the back of your TV, stick the LED strip along the edges, put the camera on top of the display, and plug everything into the adapter that comes with it. To accurately detect colors, the camera needs to be able to see your whole screen clearly. So, you should place it in the middle and make sure that soundbars or other equipment don’t block it.</p>



<p>You can also<strong> control the lights through the Govee Home app if you have Wi-Fi</strong>: The app lets you choose from different scene modes, colors, and sync sensitivity settings that change how quickly the lights respond to changes on the screen. You can turn down the reactivity during fast-paced action scenes that would otherwise cause distracting strobing effects, or turn up the sensitivity for subtler content where you want even small color changes to show up in the ambient lighting.</p>
<p>In addition to screen sync, <strong>the system has several preset modes</strong>: These include music sync, which changes colors to the beat of the music, static colors for ambient lighting, and scene modes that are meant for certain moods or activities. In music mode, your phone’s microphone picks up beats and rhythms and makes lights that react to the sound in the room. These other modes make the strip useful for more than just watching movies.</p>
<p>This $31 discount is 34% off which means that premium TV bias lighting is now in the impulse-buy range, where you can try it without making a big financial commitment. For less than the cost of basic RGB strips that don’t have any sync features, you get camera-based screen sync with fish-eye correction, RGBICW color capabilities, and smart home integration.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ditch-your-ps5-slim-playstation-5-pro-at-new-record-low-if-you-want-to-play-at-pro-level-2000650592</link>
            <guid>1373902</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony extended Cyber Monday deals by a few extra days with <strong>discounts still active on the PS5 Pro</strong>, DualSense controllers, and PS VR headsets. If you want the <strong>ultimate PlayStation experience with Sony’s most powerful console</strong>, this is it, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/">currently sitting at $648 instead of the usual $749 in a record low deal</a>.</p>
<p>This pricing matters because the performance gap between the Pro and the standard PS5 Slim becomes impossible to ignore once you see games running at their maximum potential. The enhanced GPU, advanced ray tracing, and AI upscaling technology solve the compromises that force regular PS5 owners to choose between fidelity and performance modes in demanding titles.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How the Pro Changes the Way You Play Games</h2>
<p>The <strong>PS5 Pro has a GPU with 67% more compute units</strong> than the standard PS5 Slim, and it means that you get higher frame rates and more detailed graphics without having to change the quality settings. The PS5 Slim can only run games at 30 frames per second in fidelity mode, but the <strong>Pro can run them at 60 frames per second</strong> while keeping the same visual quality which means you don’t have to choose between smooth gameplay and beautiful graphics. You can see this right away in games like Spider-Man 2 or Horizon Forbidden West, where the Pro can handle densely populated cityscapes and complicated environments without the performance drops that sometimes happen on the base console during intense action scenes.</p>



<p>PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution uses machine learning to make lower-resolution images look almost like 4K: This is similar to how NVIDIA’s DLSS or AMD’s FSR work on PC graphics cards. The AI algorithm looks at each frame and adds detail that wasn’t there in the original render and makes the images sharper while keeping the frame rate high. This <strong>technology lets games render at 1440p or 1800p inside and output at 4K with clarity that rivals native 4K rendering</strong>. It also keeps the performance headroom needed for 60fps or higher refresh rates.</p>
<p>The PS5 Slim already has great capabilities but advanced ray tracing hardware makes reflections, shadows, and lighting calculations twice as fast. Instead of flat or wrong screen-space approximations, realistic reflections in puddles, windows, and metal surfaces show up with the right depth and clarity. Ray-traced implementations that take into account complex geometry and light sources make shadows that act like real-world physics instead of the harsh, simplified shadows that traditional rasterization makes.</p>



<p>The <strong>console still has great DualSense controller support, fast SSD loading times, and 3D audio processing</strong> which were all things that made the original PS5 so impressive when it came out. Games still load in seconds instead of minutes, and the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers still give players a physical experience that sets PlayStation exclusives apart from games on other platforms.</p>
<p>The base models of the Slim have 1TB or 825GB of storage, <strong>while the base models of the Slim have 2TB</strong>. This is important because modern games often take up more than 100GB of space so here you can keep twice as many games without having to deal with external drives or constantly deleting old games to make room for new ones.</p>
<p>This $101 discount brings the price of premium PlayStation games closer to the price of the base console, but the performance is still worth the difference. You’re getting a machine that doesn’t make you choose between fidelity and performance, doubles your storage space, and makes sure your setup will work with future games that will push hardware harder.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[AMD Quietly Offloads Ryzen 9 9950X via Amazon, Now at All-Time Low Long After Black Friday Ended]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amd-quietly-offloads-ryzen-9-9950x-via-amazon-now-at-all-time-low-long-after-black-friday-ended-2000650568</link>
            <guid>1373878</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The<strong> Ryzen 9 9950X is AMD’s best consumer processor</strong> and it has 16 cores and 32 threads which means it can handle both gaming and creative tasks at the same time. The good news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6218/">this chip is currently $529 on Amazon, which is $120 less than its normal price of $649 and this is the lowest price ever</a>, just a few days after Cyber Monday officially ended.</p>
<p>This processor changes everything for gamers who also stream, edit videos or run background apps while playing: It gets rid of the compromises that come with less powerful CPUs. The Zen 5 architecture can handle OBS encoding, Discord, Chrome tabs, and music streaming without breaking a sweat, and it can get frame rates over 100 FPS in demanding games.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6218/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>What 16 Cores Really Mean for Gaming</h2>
<p>Modern games increasingly use more CPU threads as developers optimize for console processors that pack 8 cores, which means high core count chips deliver better frame pacing and minimum FPS stability. The <strong>9950X handles game logic, AI calculations, and physics</strong> on some cores while dedicating others to background tasks that used to tank performance on 6-core or 8-core processors. This becomes crucial during intense multiplayer matches where you’re running anti-cheat software, voice chat, performance overlays, and possibly streaming software all at once.</p>



<p>The <strong>5.7 GHz max boost clock can reach the speeds that gaming workloads need</strong>, since most games still rely heavily on single-threaded performance even though they use multiple cores. AMD was able to reach these clock speeds by making changes to the architecture of Zen 5 that use less power and produce less heat than older generations. If you use a good cooling system and a motherboard that is made for overclocking, the unlocked multiplier lets you push frequencies even higher.</p>
<p>The 80 MB cache is made up of 64 MB of L3 cache and 16 MB of L2 cache: This makes a huge pool of memory on the chip that cuts down on how often the processor has to get data from slower system RAM. This cache hierarchy makes games with big open worlds or programs that work with huge datasets run much better because it keeps more information available at CPU speeds. The extra cache also speeds up the time it takes to compile code and assets that are used a lot, since they are kept close to the processing cores.</p>



<p>The<strong> fact that it supports DDR5-5600 memory means you can use the newest RAM technology </strong>which has more bandwidth than DDR4. However, the performance gains in gaming are not as big as they are in productivity workloads. The Socket AM5 platform supports <strong>PCIe 5.0 on motherboards</strong> that are compatible and this is most important right now for storage drives that can read at speeds of up to 14 GB/s: PCIe 5.0 has twice the bandwidth of previous versions, so future graphics cards will be able to use it.</p>
<p>This $120 discount makes flagship-level performance available at a price that competes with last-generation high-end chips, while also being much more efficient and powerful. You don’t have to make sacrifices or build separate systems for different tasks because this processor works well for both gaming and productivity. The value equation makes sense if you’re building a system meant to last 5-7 years through multiple GPU upgrades, since the CPU performance headroom ensures it won’t bottleneck future graphics cards or game engines.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-needs-to-hit-year-end-goals-goes-54-off-on-32-odyssey-curved-monitor-2000650598</link>
            <guid>1373854</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Not everyone needs a 57-inch ultrawide monitor costing $2,000 to get immersive gaming experiences that pull you into the action. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6097/">Samsung Odyssey G65B delivers serious performance at a record low of $369 instead of its usual $799</a>, and arrives post-Black Friday just in time for holiday shopping on Amazon. The 32-inch curved QHD display solves the problem of wanting competitive <strong>gaming features like 240Hz refresh and 1ms response</strong> without sacrificing visual quality or breaking the bank on extreme flagship models.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6097/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why These Specs Are Important When You Play</h2>
<p>The <strong>240Hz refresh rate updates the image 240 times per second</strong> which means that you see enemy movements, projectile trajectories, and changes in the environment four times faster than you would on a regular 60Hz display. In competitive shooters or fast-paced action games, being able to see an enemy 4ms sooner can mean the difference between getting the kill and losing it. When you add in the <strong>1ms gray-to-gray response time</strong>, the pixels change color so quickly that motion blur almost goes away, even when the camera pans quickly or the character moves quickly.</p>



<p>At 2560×1440, <strong>QHD resolution has 1.7 times more pixels than 1080p Full HD</strong> which makes text sharper, textures more detailed, and distant objects clearer without the performance hit that 4K needs. This resolution is perfect for gaming because it gives you much better picture quality while still keeping high frame rates on mid-range graphics cards. You can read small UI elements and see enemies from a distance without squinting. Also, games with complex environments show a lot more detail in character models, architecture, and foliage.</p>
<p>AMD FreeSync Premium Pro matches the refresh rate of your monitor with the frame output of your graphics card: This stops screen tearing, which happens when the display shows parts of two different frames at the same time. This adaptive sync technology also takes care of low frame rate compensation. This means that even if your GPU drops below the monitor’s minimum refresh range, you still get smooth frame delivery without any stuttering.</p>



<p>The DisplayHDR 600 certification means that the monitor can reach a peak brightness of 600 nits in HDR content which makes highlights stand out against darker backgrounds instead of the washed-out look that cheaper HDR monitors give. The wider range of contrast makes it easier to see enemies hiding in the dark or bright corners where standard dynamic range makes details look like pure black or white. Games that support HDR have more realistic lighting. For example, the sun glare feels strong, the fire glows in a way that makes sense, and you can still see things in the dark.</p>
<p>The 1000R curvature has a <strong>radius of 1000mm which matches the natural curve of human vision</strong>: This makes the edges of the screen feel closer to your eyes than flat displays. This gentle curve makes the distance between the center and edges of the screen less variable, which keeps the image quality the same across the whole panel.</p>
<p>This 54% off makes a high-end gaming monitor an affordable upgrade that costs less than what mid-range options usually cost. If you’ve been waiting for the right time to upgrade your display, this is a great deal.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-never-turned-off-black-friday-deal-on-galaxy-tab-s10-still-selling-at-all-time-low-price-2000650535</link>
            <guid>1373839</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><strong>Samsung’s Galaxy Tab S10+</strong> competes directly with iPad Pro models in the premium tablet space, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6216/">the 256GB model still available at the Black Friday record low of $749 instead of $999</a> because Amazon and Samsung haven’t pulled the deal yet. This is the <strong>best value for money you’ll find on a premium Android tablet right now</strong>, especially considering the included S Pen and Galaxy AI features that cost extra on competing devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6216/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How Galaxy AI Changes the Way You Work</h2>
<p>The <strong>AMOLED 2X display technology</strong> makes blacks darker and colors brighter than standard LCD panels. It also has brightness levels that can be seen in direct sunlight. The <strong>12.4-inch size</strong> gives you enough screen space to do two things at once or do detailed creative work without making it hard to hold or carry. The display <strong>supports a 120Hz refresh rate</strong>, which makes scrolling smooth and S Pen input quick, getting rid of the lag that makes cheaper stylus systems feel like they’re not connected to your hand movements. The colors are accurate enough for professional photo editing and design work, but you should still check the final output on calibrated displays before you publish it.</p>



<p>The <strong>S Pen that comes with the tablet attaches to the edge</strong> of the tablet with magnets and charges wirelessly when it is docked whch means you never have to worry about running out of battery or losing the stylus. The pen pressure sensitivity can tell the difference between more than 4,000 levels of force which lets you use shading techniques and line weight changes that are like those of traditional drawing tools. Palm rejection works well enough that you can write on the screen without accidentally touching it when you rest your hand on it. The pen latency stays low enough that the digital ink keeps up with your strokes in real time instead of having to catch up.</p>
<p>The <em>Sketch to Image</em> feature uses AI processing to figure out what you want and add detail, shading, and style to your rough drawings to make them look like finished works of art. This is very helpful for designers who want to quickly see how their ideas will look or for students who need to make graphics for a presentation without spending hours in complicated design software. You draw something simple with the <strong>S Pen, choose the AI enhancement option</strong>, and the tablet makes several improved versions based on what you drew. For most tasks, the processing happens on the device, so your notes and sketches don’t get sent to cloud servers for AI analysis.</p>



<p>With <em>Circle to Search</em> with Google, you can draw a circle around anything on the screen to highlight it and start a search right away without having to switch apps or copy text. This works perfectly when you’re reading articles, watching videos, or scrolling through social media and see something that makes you want to learn more. The feature can read text, pictures, and even things in pictures which makes research and fact-checking go more smoothly without having to switch between apps and search for things by hand.</p>



<p>The <strong>battery lasts for full workdays</strong> with a mix of activities like taking notes, making video calls, browsing the web, and streaming media. It usually lasts 10 to 12 hours before needing to be charged. The aluminum body feels high-end and is light enough to be used for long periods of time without feeling heavy. The build quality is strong enough to handle being carried around in bags every day without feeling fragile.</p>
<p>This $250 discount makes high-end Android tablets compete with mid-range iPad Pros. The value proposition is based on having professional-grade hardware and software tools that make you more productive and creative instead of just passively consuming content.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-liquidates-this-1tb-15-laptop-at-77-off-zero-profit-play-to-dump-year-end-inventory-2000650606</link>
            <guid>1373818</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Year-end hardware shopping delivers the best deals as manufacturers clear remaining inventory to hit annual sales targets before closing the books. This L<strong>enovo V15 G2 laptop</strong> is<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6219/"> currently at a record low of $599 instead of its typical $2,599 listing, available exclusively through Amazon’s stock</a> rather than Lenovo’s official site.</p>
<p>The configuration packs <strong>32GB DDR4 RAM, a 1TB PCIe SSD, and a 15.6-inch FHD display</strong> into a practical business and student laptop that handles everyday computing without breaking your budget. Over <strong>1,000 reviews average 4.5 stars</strong> as buyers discover this is solid value for general productivity work, web browsing, and multitasking.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6219/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Setup Works for Daily Work</h2>
<p>The 32GB of RAM is a lot for a budget laptop, which is unusual and it lets you keep dozens of browser tabs open along with Office apps, video conferencing software, and background programs without slowing down. Most cheap laptops come with 8GB or 16GB of RAM which means you have to close programs all the time or deal with lag when you switch between tasks.</p>



<p>The 1TB PCIe SSD has enough space for document libraries, photo collections, downloaded media, and application installations without needing external drives or constant cloud management. The PCIe interface makes load times faster than older SATA SSDs which means that Windows boots up in seconds and apps open right away instead of making you wait. The amount of space on the drive is important, especially for students who need to keep their textbooks, lecture recordings, and project files on their own computers, or for business users who need to keep client documents and presentations offline.</p>
<p>The 15.6-inch FHD screen has a resolution of 1920x1080px and makes text look clear enough for long periods of time without straining your eyes. The anti-glare coating also cuts down on reflections from windows or lights above you and the screen quality is good enough for work and media consumption – but it doesn’t pretend to be a display for making content with perfect color accuracy.<strong> Dolby Audio speakers make video calls sound clear</strong> and YouTube and Netflix sound good enough.</p>



<p><strong>Wi-Fi 6 support</strong> means faster wireless speeds and better performance in networks that are crowded with many devices trying to use the same bandwidth. The connectivity options cover practical needs: <strong>USB-A ports for older devices, USB-C ports for newer accessories and possible display output, HDMI ports for external monitors or projectors, and an Ethernet jack</strong> for wired connections when Wi-Fi isn’t available or isn’t reliable enough.</p>
<p>The <strong>Intel Celeron N4500 processor</strong> does a good job of handling basic computing tasks and uses very little power, which is good for battery life during classes or meetings when there aren’t any outlets nearby. This chip isn’t good for video editing, 3D rendering, or gaming beyond simple games, but it works fine for web browsing, document editing, video streaming, and communication software.</p>
<p>This $2,000 discount off the normal listing price makes a well-equipped laptop affordable while keeping specs that usually cost $1,000 to $1,200 elsewhere. You get twice as much RAM and storage as most other budget laptops, as well as modern connectivity standards that make the laptop last longer.</p>

              <p>Garmin kept its Black Friday pricing active on several models including <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6174/">this Forerunner 165 that’s still sitting at its all-time low of $199 instead of the usual $249</a>. This watch <strong>targets occasional and regular athletes</strong> who want serious training features without dropping a grand on the latest Fenix flagship model.</p>
<p>The compromise here hits perfectly for people who run a few times a week or mix various activities but don’t need ultra-endurance battery life or sapphire crystal displays. The bright AMOLED touchscreen combined with traditional buttons gives you the best of both interface worlds without forcing you to choose between touch convenience and physical control reliability.</p>

<h2>Why This Watch Is Good for Real Training Programs</h2>
<p>Instead of sticking to a strict schedule that doesn’t take into account how your body feels, <strong>the daily suggested workouts</strong> change based on how well you did and how quickly you recover. The watch looks at your training load, sleep quality, and heart rate variability to suggest workouts that will help you improve without overtraining. This is very helpful if you want to get better without hiring a personal trainer because the watch basically sets up your training based on sports science. With Garmin Coach integration, <strong>you can get structured training plans for races of certain distances, like 5K, 10K, or half marathons</strong>.</p>



<p>Training effect labels tell you exactly what each workout did for you, like whether it helped you build your base endurance, improve your aerobic capacity, or raise your anaerobic threshold. This feedback helps you figure out if you’re really getting closer to your goals or just running a lot of miles for no reason. Recovery time calculations tell you how long your body needs to rest before the next hard workout which stops people from making the mistake of doing too many hard workouts too close together and getting hurt or burned out. The<strong> morning report shows you your sleep quality, HRV status, training readiness, and the weather forecast</strong> all on one screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>AMOLED screen has bright colors and deep blacks</strong> that make it easy to read data in bright sunlight or dim indoor light. This is more important than you might think when you’re trying to keep your pace while running without stopping. In smartwatch mode, with heart rate monitoring, notifications, and daily tracking turned on, <strong>the battery lasts for 11 days</strong>. GPS mode uses up power faster, only lasting 19 hours per charge but that’s still enough for several marathon-distance runs or several weeks of normal training before you have to plug it in. The<strong> 43mm case size fits smaller wrists well</strong>&nbsp;but it’s still big enough that you can read the screen without squinting while you work out.</p>



<p><strong>Built-in GPS</strong> tracks your pace and distance without requiring phone connection, so you can leave your device at home for runs and still get accurate route mapping and performance data. Wrist-based heart rate monitors keep track of your heart rate all day and during workouts. However, they can have trouble with high-intensity interval training because quick changes in heart rate can confuse optical sensors. The <strong>watch has more than 25 activity profiles for running, cycling, swimming, HIIT</strong>, strength training, and other sports. Each profile has its own set of data fields and metrics that are relevant to that activity.</p>
<p><strong>With smart notifications</strong>, you can stay connected to your paired smartphone without having to check your phone all the time. Your wrist will show you incoming calls, texts, and app alerts. With Garmin Pay’s contactless payment support, you can get coffee or snacks after your run without having to carry cash or cards. Just make sure your bank supports the service. The watch has safety features like incident detection, which sends your location to emergency contacts if it detects a crash while you’re outside, and manual assistance requests, which you can use if you need help.</p>
<p>At $199, the Forerunner 165 is one of the best training watches because it has features that used to cost $400 or more and this $50 discount makes it even better. You’re getting adaptive training advice, recovery metrics, and full activity tracking in a package that doesn’t feel like a compromise compared to more expensive models.</p>
