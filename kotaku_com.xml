              <p>The Galaxy Buds 3 FE are a more affordable option to the their Buds 3 Pro counterpart, but what’s the real difference? first up is the drivers. The FE model employ just one 11mm driver in each earbud. With the Pro model, you get a dual-driver setup combining a 10.5mm dynamic driver with a 6.5 planar magnetic driver on each side. So as one would expect, you’ll get better sound on the Buds 3 Pro, but that’s not to say the FE model sound won’t be good.</p>
<p>Both sets of earbuds support active noise cancellation, but that on the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro is more robust—allowing you to fine tune the ANC strength based on environmental factors.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Like lots of canceled games, the more I hear about <em>Perfect Dark</em>, the cooler it sounds. Also is Tom Holland okay? And which Metal Gear should get the Unreal Engine 5 glow-up next? Face the new week with the latest edition of <em>Kotaku</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/morning-checkpoint">Morning Checkpoint</a> at your side. The daily roundup of gaming news and culture breezes you through some of the biggest headlines going around. I stayed up until 3 a.m. this morning reviewing video games because it’s that time of year. I’m very tired but not too tired to contemplate which movies would <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thegaychingy.bsky.social/post/3lze5vfxclk2q">make Carl’s top five in the Criterion closet</a>.</p> <h2>Some more <em>Perfect Dark</em> reboot details leak</h2> <p>Microsoft’s canceled Xbox exclusive <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-reportedly-cancels-that-cool-looking-perfect-dark-1851785531">might have been originally planned</a> as an episodic release. That’s according to a new <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/gameplay-details-concept-screens-cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot">report by<em> MP1st</em></a>. If accurate, that might have made the espionage shooter’s rollout similar to that of <em>Hitman</em> (2016). According to leaked development materials reviewed by the website, The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics were working on the game’s first robust vertical slice right up until it was canceled this summer.</p> <p>The report also details a planned Adrenaline System which would be a resource that let players pull off <a href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864"><em>Matrix</em>-like abilities</a> ranging from healing and increased damage to slowing down time for aiming and dodging bullets. Leaked concept art points to an “Eco Sci-Fi” version of Cairo, the setting of an early teaser, as being one of the locations to ship in the first episode of the game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-canceled-take-two-embracer-xbox-crystal-dynamics-2000622400"><em>Bloomberg</em> recently reported</a> that 2K Games was looking to takeover publishing but couldn’t work out a deal with Microsoft and Embracer over rights to the IP.</p>

 <h2>Tom Holland rushed to hospital after botched <em>Spider-Man</em> movie stunt</h2> <p>Tom Holland has been doing <a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-brand-new-day-4-mcu-suit-tom-holland-set-2000616006">cool stunts</a> in London while filming <i>Spider-Man: Brand New Day</i>, Unfortunately at least one of them didn’t go as planned and he’s now recovering. “We were called at 10.30am on Friday to attend to a patient who had sustained an injury at Leavesden Studios in Watford,” an East of England Ambulance Service spokesman told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/36792761/tom-holland-hospital-spider-man-stunt/"><em>The Sun</em></a> yesterday. “An ambulance was sent to the scene, and the patient was transported to hospital for further care.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/tom-holland-hospitalized-spider-man-brand-new-day-1236552019/">According to <em>Deadline</em></a>, Holland suffered a concussion and filming has been paused for a couple of days as a precaution. Hopefully, he can make a speedy recovery even with out the real Spidey’s mutant super healing.</p> <h2>Which <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> should get the remake treatment next?</h2> <p>A poll has been recently <a href="https://x.com/MGSMGN/status/1969354623007014979/photo/2">shared on X</a> which looks to be one Konami intends to send out after a <em>Metal Gear</em>-focused livestream later this week from TGS. The poll asks fans which other <em>Metal Gear </em>games they’d like to see remade, following the recent release of <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>. <em>MGS 2: Sons of Liberty</em> is the obvious choice, though I could see the case for <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> as well.<em> Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</em>, meanwhile, remains trapped on PS3, though fans suspect the <em>Master Collection Vol. 2</em>, whenever it’s ready, will finally port it to modern consoles.</p>

 <h2><em>Nintendo vs. Palworld</em> is currently a debate about mods</h2> <p><a href="https://gamesfray.com/gross-in-palworld-patent-case-nintendo-tells-japanese-judge-mods-should-not-count-as-prior-art-because-they-cant-run-without-underlying-games/">According to <em>Games Fray</em></a>, part of Pocket Pair’s defense in Nintendo’s patent lawsuit is that certain mechanics Nintendo claims as its own were already in use in other games, including versions modded by players. Nintendo is reportedly arguing that mods don’t count as “prior art” because they can’t exist or run separate from the game’s they were made for.</p>

 <h2><em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> nerfs nudity in Japan</h2> <p>The open-world zombie adventure is reportedly censoring certain depictions in Japan. The tweaks include changes to female zombies and the removal of all nudity, according to <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/09/19/157365.html"><em>Game Spark</em></a> (via<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dying-light-the-beast-is-the-latest-game-to-be-censored-in-japan/"><em> VGC</em></a>). “These changes have resulted in an overall tone down on violent scenes, while still allowing Japanese players to enjoy seamless co-op play with friends playing the overseas version.”</p>

 <h2><em>Tomb Raider</em> remaster patches out AI voice performance changes</h2> <p>The French version of <em>Tomb Raider 4-6 Remastered</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/lara-croft-tomb-raider-francoise-cadol-aspyr-remaster-2000624934">was accused</a> of using AI to alter an actor’s performance. Those accusations appear to have been well-founded now, because Aspyr has gone and removed the AI alterations from the game. “We’ve addressed this issue by removing all AI voiceover content, while retaining the improvements made in the previous update,” the studio <a href="https://support.aspyr.com/hc/en-us/articles/39710879443853-Tomb-Raider-IV-VI-Remastered-Hotfix-for-Patch-2">wrote announcing a surprise hotfix update</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-lawsuit-aspyr-patch/"><em>The Gamer</em></a>). “We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Please reach out to our customer support site with any issues.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149">Our big <em>Borderlands 4</em> review is here</a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-rival-shadow-vector-cream-vanilla-2000627156"><em>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</em> might be better than <em>Mario Kart World</em></a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-match-3-rpg-that-started-it-all-is-back-and-we-talk-to-its-legendary-creator-2000626834">The mastermind behind one of the best puzzle games ever talks about trying to bring back a classic</a></p> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <div> <p>Chrome Boba Fett and the little baby Yoda are here to help you forget all about Disney’s complicity in <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-fallon-colbert-stewart-trump-kirk-2000627249">a grim attack on free speech</a>. Out in less than nine months, <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu&nbsp;</em>now has its first trailer, and the next<em> Star Wars</em> movie looks both incredibly unnecessary and also lots of fun.</p> </div>  <p>The film stars Pedro Pascal as the Mandalorian bounty hunter, with his Force-sensitive sidekick Grogu looking as adorable as ever. Set after the TV series, the film finds the pair back in the galactic hotseat, navigating post-war tensions between the New Republic (Sigourney Weaver plays a colonel named Ward) and remnants of the Empire (Jonny Coyne plays an imperial warlord). Also Jabba the Hutt’s son Rotta is in the mix too.</p>  <p>Here’s a brief look:</p>   <p>The whole 90 seconds flashes by in an instant, but in addition to the aforementioned characters you can also catch a glimpse of some alien guy messing people up with an electrostaff and Grogu speeding around with some other cute god-knows-whats (paging <em>Star Wars</em> lore master Zack Zwiezen). But like I said at the top, it looks fun and not mired down in a bunch of <em>Star Wars</em> naval-gazing mythbuilding, which is a good a thing.</p> <p><em>The Mandalorian and Grogu </em>is directed by Jon Favreau and co-written by Favreau and Dave Filoni, and marks the first in a fresh slate of upcoming<em> Star Wars</em> movies for Disney. With everything else, including a new Jedi-centric tale with <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-new-jedi-order-writer-replaced-rey-delayed-1851747797">Daisy Ridley returning as Rey completely MIA</a>, it’ll either feel like the start of something new or the death knell for the current streaming-wars-burnout incarnation of the franchise. The movie hits theaters on May 22, 2026, and can’t come soon enough for a <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney-boycott-marvel-marisa-tomei-2000627135">company currently facing a boycott</a> from fans and celebrities over the Jimmy Kimmel controversy.</p>
