Instead of<em> Disco Elysium 2</em>, it’s a spy RPG still mostly shrouded in secrecy called <em>Project</em>&nbsp;<em>[C4]</em>, and one big question facing it is whether it will bear any resemblance to the studio’s previous work after years of internal upheaval and tumult. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195579" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="178" data-playlist="195579,196411,195891" data-current="195579"><div><p>This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21074.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In <em>[C4]</em> you play an Operant working for a corrupt global power in a world where the mind is a battlefield for geopolitical struggle and espionage. “More vulnerable and more powerful than the physical world, it can be erased, changed, reordered, and of course significantly altered through regular use of psychoactive substances amongst other means,” reads the press release from ZA/UM Studio. “Players must steel themselves with whatever comfort they can in order to survive the violent canvas of the real.”</p><p>Here’s the quick teaser released today which has some cool art and intriguing vibes but is light on substance. </p><p>The material was first presented to press in a scripted 10-minute presentation by <em>C4 </em>writers Jim Ashilevi (voice over direction on <em>Disco Elysium</em>) and Siim Sinamäe (additional writing on <em>Disco Elysium</em>). They confirmed that the studio has been working on the new project for about three years now and said one of the main things that will differentiate it from other RPGs is making failure “a joy in itself” rather than something players want to save-scum their way out of. The duo also cited John le Carré and his thriller<em> Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy</em> as one of the inspirations for the game, but didn’t share many specifics on what the game’s actually about or how it will play. </p><p>Most notably, the pair did not take questions and only vaguely referenced the ongoing issues facing ZA/UM, which is a very different studio than it was five years ago after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/disco-elysium-robert-kurvitz-suing-za-um-rpg-amazon-1849693328&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/disco-elysium-robert-kurvitz-suing-za-um-rpg-amazon-1849693328">layoffs, firings, and departures</a></span> of some of the core team that made <em>Disco Elysium</em>, including creator Robert Kurvitz, art director Aleksander Rostov, and writer Helen Hindpere. Amid dueling allegations of theft, fraud, and abuse by the founders and current studio leadership, several new indie teams popped up last year, each <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/disco-elysium-sequel-rpg-canceled-xxx-nightshade-1851670948?_gl=1*1vld52x*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MTY0MzIwMS40Ni4wLjE3NDE2NDMyMDQuNTcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/disco-elysium-sequel-rpg-canceled-xxx-nightshade-1851670948?_gl=1*1vld52x*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MTY0MzIwMS40Ni4wLjE3NDE2NDMyMDQuNTcuMC4w">claiming the mantle to creating the true <em>Disco Elysium</em> successor</a></span>.</p><p>“As with any artistic practice, attempts and failures have been a natural part of this process. Failing forward seems to be one of those things we here at ZA/UM excel at,” Ashilevi said during the <em>[C4]</em> presentation. The game, whatever it turns out to be, seems to thematically echo many of the studio’s troubles. “Betrayal is only possible in the presence of love,” Sinamäe said of the project’s spycraft storytelling. The team is planning to present more information about the upcoming game at GDC later this week. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But it also leaves plenty of questions. For example, how long does it take to finish <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>? Well, it’s something of a trick question, as the story mode is more of a prologue or tutorial for the grind to come!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,196394,194842" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h1412125"><a id=""></a><strong>How long does it take to beat Monster Hunter Wilds?</strong></h2><p>If you’re the type to rush through a game’s story—and in the case of <em>Monster Hunter</em>, I don’t blame you one bit—then you can finish <em>Wilds </em>in approximately <strong>20 to 30 hours</strong>, give or take. That was easy, eh? The whole campaign is split into two parts, each taking 12 to 15 hours to tackle. But again, that’s just the story! It’s just the opening flourish of the game! There’s still a whole expansive world to explore, monsters to hunt, crafting and upgrades to explore, side quests and challenges to tackle, and of course, the ever-present grind the series is known for.</p><p>Then, of course, there are achievements to consider. If you wish to 100 percent the game and show off a shiny Platinum trophy, expect to spend between <strong>60 to 80 hours</strong> to tackle everything <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> offers.</p><h2 id="h1412126"><a id=""></a><strong>What about top-level ranking tiers?</strong></h2><p>Once you complete the main story path of the game, you’ll unlock access to High Rank monsters and zones. Here, you can craft some of the game’s most potent weapons and armor sets, allowing you to contend with the more formidable beasts in the desert.</p><p>That’s cool and all, but what about Master Rank? In <em>Monster Hunter World</em> and <em>Rise</em>, Master Rank offered additional challenges that made the game even more of a grind, more difficult to master, but offered players the opportunity to show off their hunting prowess. Currently, Master Rank isn’t available in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, but we won’t say ‘never.’ This top-tier rank didn’t release in the past two titles until post-launch expansions hit the scene. Therefore, we suspect <em>Wilds </em>will follow the same path!</p><hr><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is available now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. If you’ve already finished the game, maybe it’s time to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suikoden-1-2-hd-remaster-how-long-to-beat-whats-new-1851768802&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suikoden-1-2-hd-remaster-how-long-to-beat-whats-new-1851768802">jump into <em>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster</em></a></span>, since we’ll be waiting until—at the very least—late this year or mid-2026 for an expansion.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
