              <p>One of the main things that’s distinguished Nintendo 64 clone the M64 from rival device the Analogue 3D, beyond being sold <a href="https://kotaku.com/m64-mario-kart-modretro-palmer-luckey-nintendo-64-1851786895">by an international arms dealer</a>, was its playful shape and colorful, translucent shell. But now Analogue has revealed its own translucent variants. There’s competition to see not just which device can run Nintendo 64 games the best but also which one looks the coolest. And not everyone’s happy about it.</p> <p>There are some other important differences between the M64 and Analogue 3D, however. Fully revealed over Black Friday weekend, ModRetro’s M64 is $200 compared to the $250 for the base Analogue 3D (matte black or white) and it features compatible controllers that are actually shaped like the old N64 ones (Analogue’s look like their existing 8Bitdo line-up). The other important difference, of course, is that the M64 isn’t shipping yet (there’s a <a href="https://modretro.com/pages/m64-green">waitlist you can sign-up for</a>). The Analogue 3D is already out.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The body is ready!  We can finally show the final design of the M64.  Three translucent colors are in manufacturing right now, more than a dozen on the way – goes on sale online and retail soon, we are releasing upcoming colors as easily swappable low-cost body kits! <a href="https://t.co/CnbTSKf7yd">https://t.co/CnbTSKf7yd</a></p> <p>— Palmer Luckey (@PalmerLuckey) <a href="https://twitter.com/PalmerLuckey/status/1994584120739950925?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But today, Analogue revealed the “Funtastic” variant of the 3D in “highly limited quantities.” This translucent version comes in eight different colors ranging from “Watermelon” magenta to see-through gold. Pre-orders go up on <a href="https://www.analogue.co/editions/3d-funtastic">December 10 at 11:00 a.m. ET,</a> and the Funtastic versions will cost $50 extra, rounding out the total price to $300. And that’s before adding on the new translucent controller variants which match the material and color of the consoles. These come separately at $45 each.</p>

 <p>Understandably, some people who’d already pre-ordered one of the existing Analogue 3D consoles in black or white are pissed off. “I just got mine, and now you drop these awesome colors?” wrote one owner. “Seriously? It feels like a slap in the face to early supporters. And yes, I’m reposting because your previous post disappeared.”</p>

 <p>Another wrote, “Why on earth didn’t you launch with this? instead, you announce it a few weeks after the 7 day return window for those who pre-ordered. what a convenient cash grab.” At least a few recent Analogue 3D purchasers say they’re going to try to get a refund anyway.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nah this is bs straight up. Delay console for nearly 2 years and pull a rug under us early adopters who waited patiently only to see you released funtastic colors nearly 2 weeks after everyone is getting their white and black units..</p> <p>— Kodaxx (@Kodaxx88) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kodaxx88/status/1998089537499881745?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It is an odd move for a boutique retro gaming company that often skirts the line between fan hype and hyperbolic marketing. Analogue has a record of releasing alternative color schemes for its hardware. The company’s earlier Pockets eventually came out with all sorts of versions that channeled different aesthetic eras of the Game Boy and Game Boy Advance. Those didn’t get announced immediately after the initial launch, however.</p> <p>Part of the issue might be the Analogue 3D’s repeated delays this year. It was supposed to launch much earlier than it did, with mysterious manufacturing and shipping challenges, including likely hiccups around the president’s trade war with China, gumming up the original timeline. If so, however, it’s still unclear why the announcement of the “Funtastic” variants wasn’t pushed back to compensate.</p>

              <p>Court documents from a false advertising lawsuit filed against Lucasfilm Games and Aspyr over the failure to integrate a previously promised and popular fan mod into the Switch port of<em> Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2</em> reveal something we didn’t know about: Lucasfilm was planning on making a<em> KOTOR 2</em> remake. And it might still be happening.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-gets-ps5-remake-1847646267">In 2021, Lucasfilm and Aspyr announced that a <em>Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic</em> remake</a> was in development. Then the RPG was <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-knights-republic-kotor-remake-ps5-canceled-1850885369">seemingly nuked from the internet in 2023, leading some to worry it was dead.</a> Despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saber-interactive-joins-development-of-star-wars-kotor-remake">co-developer Saber Interactive</a> saying the project was alive and well <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saber-interactive-ceo-says-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well">in 2024,</a> there has been mostly radio silence about the remake of one of the highest-reviewed <em>Star Wars</em> games ever made. And now, court docs indicate that its sequel was, and maybe still is, getting a similar remake.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/kotor-ii-restored-content-mod-dlc-switch-killed-disney">As reported by <em>GameFile</em> on December 8</a>, court documents involved in a false advertising lawsuit against Aspyr and Lucasfilm include the mention of a “Project Juliet,” which is confirmed in a deposition with <span dir="ltr" role="presentation"> Lucasfilm Games </span><span dir="ltr" role="presentation">vice president Douglas Reilly to be a<em> KOTOR 2</em> remake. As pointed out by <em>GameFile</em>, the Switch port of<em> KOTOR 2</em> was codenamed “Capulet.” Here’s what Riley had to say about the project: </span></p>

 <p>“Juliet was the code name for a project where we were going to do a full remake of <em>KOTOR 2</em>&nbsp;with modern art, modern gameplay, you know, keep the story and the characters and the general—the general content of <em>KOTOR 2</em>, but remake it for modern hardware and modern machines with updated graphics and all those kinds of things. It was something we were discussing with Aspyr.”</p>

 <p>When asked by a lawyer if the plan was to remake content featured in the fan-developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sith_Lords_Restored_Content_Modification"><em>KOTOR 2</em> Restored Content Mod</a>, Riley confirmed that was indeed the plan.</p> <p>Unfortunately, that’s all we got on this <em>KOTOR 2</em> remake. <em>GameFile’s</em> Stephen Totilo can’t confirm the status of the remake as of December 2025. The deposition cited above happened in March. At that time, Riley explained that the<em> KOTOR 2</em> remake was “<span dir="ltr" role="presentation">technically on the road map” but that the plan was to start with a remake of <em>KOTOR</em>, as previously announced. Riley also said that Aspyr is no longer working on either remake and instead Saber-owned Mad Head games was or is now handling development.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>All mentioned parties and companies were contacted by <em>GameFile</em>, but didn’t respond or declined to comment. That means that, for now at least, we don’t really know what happened to either remake. It sounds like they are both still happening in some form, but until Disney or Lucasfilm confirms either way, fans will be left waiting to find out more about what will happen to these remakes of two of the most popular <em>Star Wars</em> games ever made.</p>

            <guid>1376569</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>When all is said and done at the end of </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>’ two-hour runtime, Santa Ragione’s horror game feels remarkably unremarkable. The game has been caught in a shit storm of controversy after it was </span><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/santa-ragione-co-founder-pietro-righi-riva-on-horses-steam-and-possible-closure-of-the-studio"><span>banned from PC storefronts like Epic and Steam</span></a><span>, and the reasons for that ban are odd, considering the specific content the storefronts mention doesn’t seem to actually exist in the game. Santa Ragione says Valve refused to list </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>on its storefront due to scenes that “depict sexual conduct involving a minor,” but after playing through the game, I’m not sure what this is referring to. </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>isn’t for the faint of heart, but it’s also not…that.</span></p>  <p><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>is grotesque, unsubtle in its imagery, and underneath all the grit, grime, and gore, it is saying </span><i><span>something</span></i><span>. It’s just not anything really revolutionary. Its gruesome imagery paints a fairly straightforward image of the psychological damage of a forced puritanical lifestyle on the self and society, and even through its crude, PS2-style aesthetic, it gets its point across well enough. I just wonder how much we would be talking about it had it not been for Valve and Epic’s actions.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe I’m getting ahead of myself. I haven’t even talked about the minutiae of how </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>gets there, but that’s because all those details are less interesting than that hypothetical to me. </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>stars a young man named Anselmo who is sent off by his parents to work on a rural, out-of-the-way farm in a small town.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That sounds simple enough, until he meets the horses he’ll be taking care of, who are actually humans stripped naked and forced to wear horse masks while acting as if they are a herd of equine animals. You even ride on their shoulders a few times, much to your chagrin. But the disturbing imagery is gradually revealed to be a way for </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>to explore how the farmer’s stunted sexual growth and sex-negative upbringing have caused him to develop a psychosexual need to control others’ sexual behavior, while finding ways around the mental and physical shackles he’s put on himself.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000651444" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651444"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651444">© <span>Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure> <p><span>If nothing else, </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>gets this across pretty well, if unsubtly. The farmer comes from a backwater town in which sexual frustration is forced upon a civilization by a doctrine preaching that abstinence is close to godliness, and so his entire life has become fixated on something he wants but has been brainwashed into believing he’s not allowed to have. This man’s entire mental and sexual development has been shackled like a chastity belt, and so he has created an entire business and network supporting a farm in which he is able to force that same self-denial on any poor bastard found wandering near his land.</span></p> <p><span>A lot is being said about </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>’ use of graphic sexual imagery as the reason for its being banned on the most popular PC storefronts, </span><span>but even as it takes the cross between humanity’s self-imposed religious chains and its animalistic nature to their horrifying extreme, </span><span>I didn’t find it particularly gratuitous. It was exaggerated, meant to be evocative, and in some scenes, comically amplified, but that felt in line with the game’s wider aesthetic choices.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>isn’t a good game, and its technical presentation is particularly agonizing. It literally made me sick with its stuttering, choppy jank; it’s pretty ugly, and nearly everything about it looks and feels like the work of a team still getting its feet wet in Unity. Still, I’m willing to buy that the ugliness could be a deliberate aesthetic, as the ugly nature of its story is perhaps best captured in a crude, gross-out paint job. When people talk in </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>, they get unsettling close-ups as their lips flap, broken up by silent-film-style caption cards. Santa Ragione wants this game to feel gross, and it’s not just in the subject matter.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"The game your mom was worried about."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Santa Ragione Game Studio  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Horror game in which you tend to a farm while shit gets crazy.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>It communicates what it's trying to get across pretty well.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Actually made me motion sick it was so jittery, ugly but in an artistic way, probably.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PC</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>December 2</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>~2 hours</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>Every shot of </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>’ run-down farm is framed to make it look like a place lacking any real heart, soul, or love. It is a small space built solely for utility, and since it’s not a farm designed for taking care of animals, everything about it is small, cramped, hastily built, and only stores the titular horses and tools with no consideration for comfort or care. The fact that the game is just ugly to look at only helps Santa Ragione convey that feeling of emotional desolation. I can practically smell the god-awful shit-and-blood-stained farm through my computer as the sound of flies buzzing echoes through my headphones.</span></p> <p><span>My feelings on </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>largely boil down to “yeah, that was probably what they were going for, and it’s delivered in a clear, concise, and effectively crude manner.” I get what </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>is saying at any given moment, but I don’t find any of it particularly powerful. It’s striking, but is it </span><i><span>that </span></i><span>memorable? Is anything in this game that much more objectionable than your average Ari Aster film?</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000651445" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651445"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651445">© <span>Santa Ragione</span></figcaption></figure> <p><span>There is one moment that has received </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/horses-the-most-controversial-game-of-the-year-doesnt-live-up-to-the-hype/"><span>a fair bit of criticism</span></a><span>: a scene in which the farmer forces one horse to sexually assault another so he can watch, pounding on his chastity belt as it happens. This is certainly one of the more horrific moments in </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>, and most of the game’s worst moments are rooted in sexual violence of some kind. Much like everything else in </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>, I don’t feel like I have a grand takeaway from this moment’s inclusion beyond it communicates exactly what it’s trying to. I do disagree with the criticism that </span><i><span>Horses’ </span></i><span>use of sexual violence is just another point on a shock value scoreboard, because when the game portrays these disgusting acts of violence, I see how they flow back into its themes of sexual distortion and the psychological effects the farmer’s experiences have had on him. But a tall, dividing fence stands between comprehension and appreciation for its meditations on the matter.</span></p> <p><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>is fine. It’s not particularly trailblazing, but it knows what it’s trying to convey, and it uses a pretty concise visual metaphor to get it across. It is gross to look at, but I only really mind that when its jittery framerate makes me queasy. I don’t believe it is as distasteful as Epic or Steam does, and I still am surprised that something that feels mostly tame and along the lines of an A24 horror film has caused such controversy. If </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>didn’t expose anything we didn’t already know about the dangers of a sheltered, puritanical lifestyle, it at least unmasked Steam and Epic as cowardly companies that can’t be bothered to actually vet the work they’re barring from entry. I wish we could’ve had the conversation those bans sparked about a better game, but </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>, at the very least, is fine enough to have deserved better than being locked out in the rain.</span></p>
