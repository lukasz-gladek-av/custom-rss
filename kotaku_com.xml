              <p><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s story missions <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720">never arrived</a>, but the original had a few <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-pve-canceled-campaign-null-sector-2000641177">cooperative missions</a> that further explored the hero shooter’s world and heroes. One of these was called </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatchs-new-pve-event-is-its-best-yet-1825183663">Retribution</a>,</span></i><span> and it starred Reaper, Cassidy, Genji, and Moira as members of Blackwatch, Overwatch’s covert operatives arm. At the beginning of the mission, Reaper kills a man named Antonio Bartalotti, a criminal and member of the chaos-seeding Talon organization. This assassination sets up the mission players fight through, as well as the eventual downfall of the Overwatch organization, but as we learned today, over seven years later, it was also a canon event for </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s next hero, Vendetta.</span></p>  <p><span>Blizzard has released a new animated trailer titled La Lupa which shows Vendetta, a new, sword-wielding hero, fighting a massive Omnic in Colosseo to the tune of hundreds of less-than-adoring fans. In her voiceover, she’s talking to her Papa who taught her how to outsmart her opponents, whether that be in Chess or in a coliseum. Then the trailer reveals that her father was none other than Antonio. So now, after all those years, Vendetta has…a vendetta against the members of Blackwatch. That organization is defunct, though, so I guess she’s taking out all her frustrations on robots in the coliseum.</span></p> <p><span>We don’t see any gameplay of Vendetta in action, but she does seem to be one of the rare melee heroes in </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s roster. She’s built like a tank, so she might fall into that role, but we’ll know for sure soon since Blizzard is holding a trial run for the character from November 6 to December 1. Vendetta will officially join the roster in Season 20 on December 9.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The CEO of the studio behind </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><i><span>Helldivers 2</span></i></a><span>, the wildly successful third-person shooter that recently came to Xbox, weighed in on the video game industry’s increasing use of AI and how he believes it “actually makes gaming better.”</span></p> <p><span>As reported by </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-boss-argues-arc-raiders-ai-use-actually-makes-gaming-better-and-that-people-jump-to-extreme-takes-about-the-tech-surely-theres-a-middle-ground-here/"><i><span>GamesRadar</span></i></a><span>, Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Shams Jorjani was on an episode of </span><a href="https://youtu.be/AyVTlQR__ZU?si=JJHjmoQPGIj-Fb5v&amp;t=1561"><span>The Game Business Show</span></a><span> when the conversation shifted to the use of AI in game development. The host, Christopher Dring, brought up the “industry moment” around </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>, the recently released extraction shooter that’s been a breakout hit for developer Embark Studios, and the center of a conversation around using AI in game development.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For Jorjani, opinions on the controversial topic are too black and white. “Maybe, could it be, that reality is somewhere in the middle? Could it be?” he asked. He believes that, rather than developers using AI to “remove the stuff we don’t want to do,” people jump to “let’s never actually use AI, all AI is bad AI.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“We don’t put any AI in the games,” Jorjani says. “But if it can allow me to do my receipts faster, that’s more </span><i><span>Helldivers</span></i><span> for everyone.”</span></p> <p><span>It was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gen-ai-nexon-eurogamer-voices-2000643436"><span>recently revealed that Embark hired voice actors for </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i></a><span>, then used AI to flesh out in-game voice lines rather than having “someone come in every time we create a new line for the game,” according to an </span><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/generative-ai-use"><span>interview with </span><i><span>PCGamesN</span></i></a><span>. This sparked a heated debate about the use of AI in game development and even negatively </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review"><span>affected </span><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i><span>’s review of the game</span></a><span> (which awarded it two out of five stars).&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“I find that people jump to extreme takes,” Jorjani says of the response to </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>’ AI use. “I think it’s a very interesting use case that actually makes gaming better.”</span></p> <h2><b>The AI game development controversy continues</b></h2> <p><span>But as Dring brings up during the interview, Square Enix recently revealed it wants to eventually have 70 percent of its quality assurance work done by AI. QA work often serves as an entry-level role in game development, and this could be a huge hit to the industry’s workforce, which is one of the main points of contention people have with implementing AI.</span></p>

 <p><span>Junghun Lee, the CEO of Nexton Co. Ltd (which published </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>), said in a </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/"><span>November 12 interview</span></a><span> with </span><a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/10/159294.html"><span>Japanese gaming site </span><i><span>Gamespark</span></i></a> <span>that “</span><span>it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI.” But with the video game industry plagued with layoffs and studio closures, what does that mean for the future of its workforce?</span></p>

 <p><span>The ideological split is only widening. Brendan Green, the creator of the wildly successful battle royale </span><i><span>PUBG</span></i><span>, told </span><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i><span> he was “really heartened to see the community revolt against AI stuff.” </span><i><span>PUBG</span></i><span> is published by South Korean company Krafton, which </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation"><span>recently announced a massive “AI-first” mandate</span></a><span> for the entire company while also announcing the option for employees to voluntarily resign if they felt they were not in line with its “direction of change.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Elsewhere, </span><i><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </span></i><span>publisher Activision </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-art-activision-statement-blops7-steam-ps5-2000644397"><span>recently came under fire for using AI-generated content</span></a><span> for some of its artwork. “Like so many around the world, we use a variety of digital tools, including AI tools, to empower and support our teams to create the best gaming experiences possible for our players. Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios,” Activision told</span><i><span> Kotaku</span></i><span> on November 14.</span></p> <p><span>AI in game development seems to be here to stay, but just how it will be utilized going forward, and how developers, voice actors, and players will feel about it, remains to be seen.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Less than a decade after the original animated <em>Moana</em> hit theaters, Disney has released the first real trailer for its upcoming live-action remake, and folks, it doesn’t look great.</p> <p>On November 17, Disney released the first official teaser trailer for its live-action remake of <em>Moana</em>. Starring Catherine Lagaʻaia as the titular Moana and Dwayne Johnson reprising his role as demigod Maui, the remake appears to be a nearly shot-for-shot recreation of the original 2016 animated movie. Here’s the trailer:</p>  <p>I know this isn’t an original complaint, but it continues to be wild how many of <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-lion-king-the-little-mermaid-cinderella-1851767126">these live-action Disney remakes</a> barely look like live-action films at all. <em>Moana</em> might not be completely CG like the “live-action” <em>Lion King</em> remake, but boy howdy does a lot of this movie look like an Unreal Engine fan-game based on the original movie and not a film starring real people in real places. And when we do see real people, they almost look out of place.</p>

 <p>One scene in particular, involving Maui jumping off a cliff, looks so artificial and crappy that if you showed that to me without any context and said it was created by some AI tool, I’d probably believe you. And while some shots, like the one involving a whale and some boats, look better, I’m still not convinced this won’t be a mess. And making the chicken fully CG is boring and strange. Give me a real chicken, damn it!</p> <p>It was around this time last year that <a href="https://kotaku.com/snow-white-seven-dwarfs-trailer-cgi-ugly-bad-disney-1851712570">Disney fully revealed the <em>Snow White</em> remake and its horrific-looking dwarves.</a> That movie ended up being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_films#:~:text=nb%201%5D-,22,%5B22%5D,-23">a very expensive flop</a> for the Mickey Mouse company, <a href="https://kotaku.com/tangled-remake-canceled-paused-snow-white-disney-flop-1851774677">reportedly leading to at least one live-action film being shelved</a>. However, this year’s <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> remake was <a href="https://kotaku.com/lilo-stitch-remake-live-action-box-office-record-mi8-1851782470?_gl=1*8vfk2q*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA5NDQ3NTYkbzE1MCRnMSR0MTc1MDk1NTM2NiRqMTQkbDAkaDA.">a massive hit</a> for Disney, so I don’t expect the company to stop plundering its treasure trove of famous animated movies and <a href="https://kotaku.com/lilo-and-stitch-2-sequel-announced-teaser-disney-626-1851785144">turning them into live-action slop anytime soon</a>.&nbsp;We’ll see how well this new version of <em>Moana</em> does at the box office when it arrives in theaters on July 10, 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Call of Duty</em> players are seeing SBMM ghosts in<em> Black Ops 7</em>. Capcom reassures investors about <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>‘s day-one performance on PC. And Stalker 2 is getting a big upgrades on the eve of its one-year anniversary and arrival on PlayStation 5. Welcome to the latest edition of <del>Morning</del> Afternoon Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. The Game Awards 2025 nominees <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">have dropped</a> and <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is leading the way, including in the Best Indie Game category. It deserves a ton of accolades but <a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070">probably not that one</a>.</p> <h2>The next Xbox will take players’ game libraries beyond the console</h2> <p>That’s what Xbox president Sarah Bond indicated in a new interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P0bOAWNVR4">with <em>Fortune</em></a>. Here’s what she said:</p> <blockquote><p><span>We are working on our next-generation hardware. It’s going to be a powerful experience, and one that also enables people to take their library with them, and that’s what’s really important here as well, is that we know that while people want to play their library absolutely on the console, they also want to be able to play it on PC or stream it around the cloud.</span> <span>And so the Xbox experience starts with the console but then gives something to people that they can experience across all screens if they choose to, bringing their library, their community, their identity, and the store with them everywhere they go.</span></p></blockquote> <p>Does that mean the next Xbox will be a handheld? Will this portability come from a unified account across console and PC? Or is Microsoft relying on cloud computing and AI to make this all into a seamless experience? Whatever the solution, it will need to bring generations of backwards-compatible Xbox games along with it. Is this a big bet on Microsoft’s gaming future, or the last gasp as it pivots away from consumer tech more broadly?</p>

 <p>Bond <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-podcast-consoles-handheld-hardware-next-gen-1851261822">previously promised</a> the next-gen Xbox would be the biggest technological leap for its consoles yet.</p>  <h2>Capcom promises <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> won’t be as busted as <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> on PC</h2> <p>The question came up during the company’s <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1990370536753447333">latest investor briefing</a>, and the company&nbsp;explained why <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>‘ ongoing PC troubles shouldn’t be a problem for its next big blockbuster. “<em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> differs from <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> in terms of gameplay, system architecture, and network features,” the company <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_02.pdf">said</a>. “At present, we do not anticipate similar risks. We are developing the game to provide a smooth gaming experience across a wide range of PC specifications.”</p>

 <h2>It took zero days for <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> players to start complaining about SBMM again</h2> <p>Treyarch has tried to confirm, for what feels <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-blops-7-sbmm-muiltiplayer-matchmaking-2000633695">like the dozenth time</a>, how matchmaking works in the latest entry. “Quick Play uses the same Open Matchmaking, where skill is minimally considered,” the studio announced over the weekend. That’s led fans to focus on what exactly “minimally considered” means. Some feel the matchmaking isn’t as “open” as it felt during the beta. Others argue that’s because the beta was free and now the skill floor for launch, where people actually paid for the game, is higher. SBMM trutherism lives on.</p>

 <h2><em>City: Skylines 2</em> gets new developer with console port still MIA</h2> <p>“After more than a decade of successful collaboration across numerous titles that we’re both immensely proud of, Paradox Interactive and Colossal Order have mutually decided to pursue independent paths,” the publisher <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/">announced</a> on Monday. “The decision was made thoughtfully and in the interest of both teams – ensuring the strongest possible future for the <em>Cities: Skylines</em> franchise.”</p>

 <p>Colossal Order will handle a few more updates before the franchise is fully moved over to internal Paradox team Iceflake Studios. The shift comes after a terrible launch period for the sequel and has left fans wondering what the city builder’s future will be, from new expansions to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/cities-skylines-2-bloodlines-2-prison-architect-2-delay-1851668058">long-delayed arrival</a> of the console port. The game still sits at a rating of mixed on Steam.</p>

 <h2>A jumbo anniversary update should make <em>Stalker 2</em> better</h2> <p>The immersive shooter’s free <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/596291616874954993" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/596291616874954993" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/596291616874954993">patch 1.7</a> adds a new difficulty mode and tons of fixes and improvements to its “A-Life system” for how creature and human NPC AI functions in the environment. The result should be fewer dumb moments and more clever, emergent storytelling. Factions should also feel more lifelike. They can now “expand control over new territories” all by themselves. <em>Stalker 2</em> hits PS5 on November 20.</p> <h2>Steam founder Gabe Newell’s $500 million superyacht <a href="https://www.oceancoyacht.com/oceanco-delivers-leviathan/">has been delivered</a></h2> <p>It’s called the Leviathan. It has a gym, sauna, movie theater, and more. The 15 gaming PCs onboard are by far the least of its extravagances. That’s one way to celebrate the announcement of <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-controller-steamos-reaction-price-date-2000643563">a new PC gaming console</a>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-post-apocalypse-snorlax-pikachu-fuschia-2000644400">Fans think the new <em>Stardew Valley-style Pokémon</em> spin-off might take place after an apocalypse</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-7-campaign-coop-always-online-pause-co-op-xp-challenges-2000644358"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> won’t let you pause during the campaign&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-previews-trailer-ncps-companion-2000644368">Everyone’s concerned about<em> Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

              <p>If you’re planning to start a podcast, improve your livestreams, or just want to sound decent on Zoom calls, you need a high-quality microphone in your setup. Most high-end options on the market often sit above $100, but thanks to early Black Friday deals, that’s not the case today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5639/">You can currently grab the Logitech for Creators Blue Yeti USB microphone for just $85 on Amazon.</a> That’s after a nice $55 discount on its retail price of $140. This offer applies to the silver model, but the pink and blue versions are also discounted, going for $100 and $105, respectively.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5639/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Custom Patterns for Different Recording Needs</h2>
<p>This mic delivers Blue’s signature broadcast-quality sound with a custom three-capsule array. It delivers clear, powerful, yet balanced sound for gaming, streaming podcasts, and even your calls. You can choose between four preset patterns (cardioid, omni, bidirectional, and stereo) to record exactly the way you need for any setup. Filming a heart-to-heart for your YouTube family? Go with cardioid for focused audio. Hosting an interview? The bidirectional pattern should do the job well!</p>
<p>The mic also comes with onboard controls that let you quickly adjust the volume, pick a pattern, mute, and more right there from the microphone itself. This is especially great for when you need to take a quick break between recordings and don’t want to bother with complicated software settings. Just hit a button and you’re all set. To further fine-tune your recordings, you can use the Blue VO!CE program for editing them. This platform lets you add vocal effects, modulation, and sound samples, but you will need to install the Logitech G Hub to access it.</p>



<p>Setting everything up and getting started is simple. The plug-and-play setup means you can just hook it up to your PC or laptop via USB and start recording right away. Best of all, the desktop stand itself is adjustable, so you can always find the right angle to record without needing any extra accessories.</p>
<p>All-in-all, if you’ve been looking for a way to improve the sound quality of your recordings, this microphone can be a great addition to your setup. It’s not just easy to use, but also offers impressive sound and plenty of customization options without making things unnecessarily complicated. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5639/">Thanks to early Black Friday deals, you can grab it without paying the full $140 price.</a></p>

              <p>Black Friday weekend and Cyber Monday that follows historically have proven to be a good time of the year to make some tech upgrades to you home, whether that is a larger TV for the living room, a laptop to replace you’re old one that’s gotten slow, or perhaps something new for your kitchen countertop to take your meal prep up a notch. We’re still a couple weeks away from the biggest savings event of the year, but that hasn’t stopped some retailers and brands from cutting their prices early. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5638/">Amazon happens to have the Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus on sale for a good 44% off.</a> It normally goes for $180, but this steep discount ends up taking off $80, bringing the price you pay to an even $100 for a limited time.</p>

<p>That for the single camera. Amazon also has bundles of the Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus in packs of two, three, and four. The two-pack has come down by 38%, which saves it’s standard price down to $200 — so still ends up being $100 per camera. The three-pack and four-pack discounts, however, aren’t seeing a proportionally large enough discount to be worth it. Amazon has the three-pack for 11% off, which only brings it to $480 (or $160 per camera), and the four-pack going for 12% off, which brings it down to $630 (a little under $160 per camera).</p>
<p>So right now, if you intend to grab more than one the Ring Floodlight Cams, your best bet is adding a combination of multiple single or two-packs to your cart. Ignore the three-pack and four-pack entirely.</p>



<h2>Motion-activated LED Floodlights</h2>
<p>The Ring Floodlight Cam Wired Plus is a 1080p HD security camera designed for homes and businesses alike. They utilized motion-activated LED floodlights which can illuminate dark areas at night. This has multiple benefits. It allows the camera to capture better footage when it detects something present (working in unison with built-in Color Night Vision) and the lights just going on might be enough of a deterrent for any trespassers to turnaround. And if it’s just you coming home, it allows you to see your walkway up to your front door more easily in the dark without needing to pull out your phone’s flashlight.</p>
<p>You can check out a live view of what your camera sees right on your phone, tablet, or PC all from within the Ring app. It even can connect to Alexa so you can control security features using your voice, receive instant alerts, or pull up the video on your Echo Show.</p>
