              <p>Apple’s pricing strategy since Black Friday has been wild to watch with the AirPods Pro 3 dropping roughly $10 each week like clockwork. Yesterday <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">they were sitting at $209, and today they’ve hit $199, marking an all-time low</a> that you won’t find on Apple’s official site where they’re still listed at the full $249. <strong>Amazon’s exclusively offering this discount</strong> and makes it the perfect moment to grab wireless earbuds that pack hearing aid features, live translation, and heart rate sensing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why These Earbuds Are Worth the Hype</h2>
<p>Active noise cancellation <strong>cuts out up to twice as much unwanted nois</strong>e as the AirPods Pro 2 and makes a bubble of silence that works just as well on subway rides as it does in open offices where coworkers won’t stop talking. The new acoustic architecture changes how music sounds to your ears, the bass feels deeper without making the midrange sound muddy, and the clarity lets you hear each instrument in complex tracks. <strong>Vocals are so clear that it sounds like the host is talking directly to you in podcasts</strong> and audiobooks. Last but not least, <strong>spatial audio makes the soundstage three-dimensional</strong> and moves with your head.</p>



<p>Heart rate sensing lets you track your fitness right from your earbuds, keeping track of your pulse and calories burned during up to 50 different types of workouts without needing to wear an Apple Watch. You can use the Move ring, count your steps, and Workout Buddy, which is powered by Apple Intelligence and learns your habits and pushes you when you’re not working hard enough.<strong> Live Translation makes it possible to talk to people who speak different languages</strong> in real time and Apple Intelligence does all the hard work in the background: This one feature changes how you can travel and talk to friends and clients from other countries.</p>
<p>With ANC on, the battery lasts up to 8 hours on a single charge and with Transparency mode and the Hearing Aid feature on, the battery lasts up to 10 hours. The <strong>USB-C charging case lets you listen for more than 24 hours</strong> before you need to find an outlet. If you plug it in for just five minutes, it will charge quickly and give you about an hour of playback time<strong>. With five different ear tip sizes</strong>, you can finally find a fit that stays in place while you run or just listen to music.</p>



<p>The hearing health features are more advanced than what you’d find in regular earbuds and you can take a clinical-grade hearing test at home using guided tones and frequency sweeps. The Hearing Aid feature with automatic Conversation Boost makes voices louder in noisy places, so you can follow conversations at restaurants or family gatherings without having to ask people to repeat themselves all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth connections</strong> stay strong even in crowded places where wireless signals usually have trouble: Your iPhone, iPad, and Mac will automatically switch between them based on which one you’re using at the time. You can control playback, answer calls, and switch between noise cancellation modes on each earbud stem without having to look for your phone. With spatial audio and dynamic head tracking, movies and TV shows sound like they are coming from a personal surround sound system, and the sound moves naturally as you turn your head.</p>
<p>Right now, you can get Apple’s best earbuds for $199 instead of $249 which is the lowest price ever on Amazon. This is a great deal for features that used to only be found in medical devices and high-end headphones. With better noise cancellation, heart rate tracking, live translation, and real hearing aid features, you get tools that make your daily life better than just listening to music.</p>

              <p>Want a better cordless vacuum? There are tons on the market out there, with options that fit every budget. But one in particular caught our eye thanks to its significant discount and its performance alike: the Dyson V11 Origin Cordless Vacuum. Designed for anyone who wants strong cleaning power without dragging a heavy vacuum from room to room, it’s a lightweight powerhouse you might actually like using, believe it or not.</p>
<p>If that sounds like a holiday miracle, you know we’ve got you covered. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">You’ll need to shop Amazon to get the Dyson V11 Origin Cordless Vacuum, where it’s on sale for just $350, down from its usual price of $630</a>. That’s $280 off and a savings of 44% off. Not bad for a smaller, lightweight vacuum. And of course it’s a Dyson, so you can expect extra features and better craftsmanship along with the price tag.</p>

<h2>A powerful cordless vacuum built for all your everyday messes</h2>
<p>This model is more than just your average push-and-go vacuum, with features like intelligent suction and a LCD screen on the frame itself to give you real-time info while you clean. That includes giving you a heads up on its battery life down to the second, so you know exactly how much time you have left to clean. It also lets you know about any potential maintenance needs, which helps keep the vacuum performing at its best. This small detail makes a big difference, especially if you like knowing what’s going on with your appliances.</p>
<p>But really, all that to say its major feature is the fact that it’s cordless. Sure, there are tons of cordless vacuums out there. It’s just that this one has better maneuverability that going corless facilitates, so it’s easier to clean stairs, corners, and tight spaces. You can quickly grab it for a spill or mess without needing to plan around outlets. The vacuum converts into a handheld unit, making it simple to clean furniture, car interiors, shelves, and baseboards.</p>



<p>The filtration system can capture even the smallest of particles and dust, as well as germs. Thats super helpful for homes with pets or allergies. It traps debris inside the bin rather than releasing it back into the air, helping your home feel cleaner after you’re done vacuuming.</p>
<p>Battery life is solid for most households. You can clean several rooms on a single charge, and the vacuum is efficient enough to handle routine cleaning without constant recharging. The included wall mounted dock keeps it charged and ready, while also giving you a neat place to store attachments.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">There’s a lot to love about this vacuum, but in all honestly, we’re mostly attracted to the discount right now.</a> Whether you have a large house or a small apartment, this is an appliance you’ll want to use regularly, and it’ll make the money back for you in terms of time. Plus, you won’t have to keep buying new vacuums. Buy this one once, and you should be as good as done.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Marathon</em> might be the <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-shooter-best-vibrant-colorful-bungie-trailer-1850481359">most visually striking game Bungie’s ever made</a>, and the art director overseeing it won’t be there when the game ships. <em>Kotaku</em> has learned that veteran artist Joseph Cross recently decided to depart the studio. The move comes just months ahead of the extraction shooter’s new March 2026 release date.</p> <p>Evidence of Cross’ departure was first spotted earlier today <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-joseph-cross-stepped-down-marathon-franchise-art-director/">by <em>The Game Post</em></a>. His LinkedIn profile was recently updated to give his senior art director position at Bungie an end date of 2025, and his account on X no longer references the studio at all. He was a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/10263/7_Breaking-In---Joe-Cross">lead concept artist at Bungie</a> throughout the <em>Destiny</em> years and returned to the studio around 2020 to help shape the aesthetic for <em>Marathon</em>, the company’s newest multiplayer shooter.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Marathon Art Style (a short thread). First of all thanks to everyone for all the kind words and enthusiasm for the art style/direction in our announce trailer, it's been amazing to see. This was the result of many talented artists working together, with the support of an amazing <a href="https://t.co/ePPi41KA6c">pic.twitter.com/ePPi41KA6c</a></p> <p>— Joseph Cross (@josephacross) <a href="https://twitter.com/josephacross/status/1663415929043296257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2023</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Cross told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> that it was his decision to leave. “I’m super proud of the project and what the team accomplished over the last six years,” he said. He also recently shared a clip on X from <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-price-battle-pass-proximity-chat-2000653472">Bungie’s latest ViDoc showing how <em>Marathon </em>has evolved</a> following its delay after negative fan feedback from an alpha test earlier in the year.</p>

 <p>A number of tweaks were made to the extraction shooter, including adding proximity chat, a feature that’s become a cornerstone of breakout hit <em>Arc Raiders</em>. Originally set to launch back in September, <em>Marathon</em> is now coming early next year.</p> <p>The delay also followed fallout <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-art-alpha-gameplay-posters-antireal-1851780911">around allegations</a> that some visual decals in the game had been lifted from someone outside the studio. “[The] <i>Marathon</i> art issue has been resolved with Bungie and Sony Interactive Entertainment to my satisfaction,” <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-antireal-art-plagiarism-extraction-2000649685">the artist announced</a> earlier this month.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/esports-gamer-reportedly-leaves-hotel-room-a-horrible-mess-after-two-year-stay-2000654662</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>At a hotel in China that reportedly specializes in catering to gamers and esports competitors, staff claim to have found a disgusting mess left behind by a man who stayed there for two years.</p> <p><a href="https://www.the-sun.com/news/15653824/grim-video-hotel-guest-leaves-room-stomach-churning-mess/">As first reported by <em>The Sun</em></a> and then spotted by <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/entertainment/guest-from-hell-leaves-hotel-room-a-disgusting-mess-after-two-year-gaming-marathon-3296126/"><em>Dexerto</em></a>, a man believed to be an avid gamer checked out of his hotel room after two years. And during that time, it seems no cleaning staff had ever been allowed in because when employees entered the room, they discovered mountains of trash and a disgusting toilet surrounded by used toilet paper. <em>The Sun</em> reports that staff called the man a “guest from Hell.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Grim vid shows hotel guest from hell leave room in stomach-churning state <a href="https://t.co/GwT0sWJo2d">pic.twitter.com/GwT0sWJo2d</a></p> <p>— The Sun (@TheSun) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheSun/status/2001548703564226963?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Staff say a thick layer of brown grime had built up on the floor in the hotel room, and the gamer’s sparse furniture was buried in trash that, in some areas, was nearly three feet deep. During his two-year stint in the hotel, employees claim he rarely left the room, with staff telling the outlet that many didn’t know what he looked like because he spent so much time in his disgusting little gamer hole.</p>

 <p><em>The Sun’s</em> report sharing the details and photos of the hard-to-look-at hotel room mess doesn’t provide too many specific details about the location, the guest, or precisely when this happened. But I’ll never forget where I was when I first laid eyes on that toilet.</p> <p>It reportedly took three days to clean out the hotel room after the man left, and it will take more renovations and repairs to make the place rentable once more. The guest apparently still owes 10 days’ worth of fees, amounting to around $400. So the next time you look at your gamer room and feel gross about an empty can or a leftover wrapper, you can at least remind yourself that you aren’t as bad as the person behind this awful gamer-related hotel disaster. But still, pick that crap up.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite Leaker Wanted To ‘Ruin’ Harry Potter Surprise Because J.K. Rowling’s A Transphobe]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/fortnite-harry-potter-skins-leak-jk-rowling-transphobia-2000654659</link>
            <guid>1387681</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>’s crossover slop has now spread to engulf the Wizarding World as Epic’s inescapable battle royale is gearing up to add cosmetics based on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hogwarts-legacy-review-harry-potter-rowling-transphobia-1850127849"><i><span>Harry Potter</span></i></a><span>. The game has become such a worldwide phenomenon that there are plenty of leak accounts on social media routinely posting about upcoming collaborations, but the account that leaked the </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>skins had a different motive than simply informing people, as they have stated they “spoiled” the surprise in protest of it inclusion because of </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>author J.K. Rowling’s transphobic rhetoric.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Rowling has been a vocal figurehead in the fight against trans rights </span><a href="https://theweek.com/feature/1020838/jk-rowlings-transphobia-controversy-a-complete-timeline"><span>over the past few years</span></a><span>, and it’s made buying and supporting </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>and its various movies, video games, and spin-offs harder for fans and trans supporters, though it hasn’t stopped </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hogwarts-legacy-harry-potter-slytherin-house-jk-rowling-1850305177"><i><span>Hogwarts Legacy</span></i></a> <span>from racking up over </span><a href="https://x.com/HogwartsLegacy/status/2001336625847243153"><span>40 million sales</span></a><span> since its launch in 2023.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>So when it was confirmed that </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>content was coming to </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>, some fans of both </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> had to wrestle with whether or not they want to support the crossover, or the game more broadly. Fortnite Underground, a </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>leaker who </span><a href="https://x.com/FNBRunderground/status/2000583138209100108?s=20"><span>leaked the </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>collaboration</span></a><span>, has posted a lengthy explanation on X about why they chose to post about it ahead of its official announcement, saying they wanted to “ruin” the surprise in an act of protest and that </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>once “stood for what was right.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Most people won’t care,” they wrote. “These Outfits will probably sell pretty well, most people will be happy to see one of their favorite childhood franchises come to the game, and Epic Games and J.K. Rowling will make plenty of money.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But I’m not okay with that, and I hope you’re not okay with it either.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Opinion – I was the leaker who spoiled Harry Potter coming to <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fortnite?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Fortnite</a>. Here's why ⬇️ </p> <p>Last year, Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling claimed that Imane Khelif, a female boxer, was actually born as a man. There's just one issue: they weren't. There's been a sentiment around this… <a href="https://t.co/tzKv18jYeK">pic.twitter.com/tzKv18jYeK</a></p> <p>— Fortnite Underground (@FNBRunderground) <a href="https://twitter.com/FNBRunderground/status/2001447614466691338?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>Fortnite Underground signs off saying they wanted to spoil the collaboration in hopes that “less people would buy it,” but many of the responses argue that any kind of discussion promotes it in some way. Maybe their bringing attention to Rowling’s views could start some much-needed conversations in the </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> community, though you also have a bunch of transphobic nonsense in the replies, with people claiming they’ll buy the </span><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>cosmetics as a counter protest. Do yourself a favor and avoid the responses to their post.</span></p>
