              <p><span>I see so much slop on my </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tiktok-us-ban-supreme-court-date-bytedance-china-1851715772"><span>TikTok</span></a><span> feed these days that most of it doesn’t faze me. However, for the past week or so, I’ve seen ads promoting what are very clearly AI-generated Christmas ornaments featuring famous characters in situations that their respective IP holders would probably never approve of. I can’t unsee these horrors, so now, I’m making it your problem. You ever seen Belle from </span><i><span>Beauty and the Beast</span></i><span> making an ahegao face as she gets spanked over Beast’s knee? Do you know what the Grinch looks like on his knees, worshipping a mystery Grinch lady’s uncomfortably caked-up rear-end? Well, it’s too late to turn back now. Look at it:</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000627642" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627642"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627642">©Homacus</figcaption></figure> <p><span>These monstrosities come courtesy of </span><a href="https://homacus.com/collections/couple-ornaments"><span>Homacus</span></a><span>, a personalized gift shop that lets you print the names of yourself and your significant other on a “naughty” Christmas ornament featuring beloved characters like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-4-screenshots-mickey-sora-release-date-1851780809"><span>Mickey and Minnie Mouse</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/shrek-5-first-teaser-cast-zendaya-myers-diaz-trailer-1851766800"><span>Shrek and Fiona</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-dark-knight-arkham-new-game-2000618481"><span>Batman and Catwoman</span></a><span>, and many more that I doubt Disney, DC, and the numerous other rights holders signed off on. But hey, I’m open to being wrong, so I did reach out to Homacus for comment on the matter and will update the story if we hear back. Whatever the case, the company is very boldly paying for ads to make innocent bystanders like me very, very aware these ornaments exist. Think of all the poor bastards trying to scroll TikTok in peace who saw Jack Skellington tossing Sally’s salad. We already get enough psychic damage on the internet, and now we’re dealing with this?</span></p>   <p><span>The whole thing reeks of Facebook ad core shit that sites sell to boomers who think referencing anything sexual outside the bedroom is scandalous. It’s the type of pent-up sexual frustration that reminds you there are couples out there who rarely see each other naked, so having things like this hanging off their Christmas tree is as raunchy as it gets. I don’t care what debauchery is happening behind closed doors; just don’t make me look at </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-lava-chicken-jockey-easter-egg-game-1851786345"><i><span>Minecraft </span></i><span>creepers</span></a><span> smacking each other’s dumpies.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Despite a trade war and rising inflation, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-console-switch-horizon-zero-dawn-re-1848628507">three-year-old Steam Deck</a> hasn’t gone up in price yet. In fact, it just got a pretty major discount. The $400 LCD model will be 20 percent off for the 2025 fall Steam sale. That makes it significantly cheaper than just about every other current-gen gaming device on the market right now, including the 8-year-old Nintendo Switch. It also puts some needed pressure on new PC gaming handhelds launching this holiday.</p> <p>The Steam Deck 256GB LCD model will be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">$320 starting September 22</a>. That’s essentially what the refurbished model, currently out of stock, usually costs. The 512GB OLED model is still $550 and the 1TB OLED is still $650 (they come with slightly bigger screens, a higher refresh rate, and better battery life). This week-long discount leads into the Steam Autumn Sale which will kick off next week on September 29 and run until October 6.</p> <p>It’s not a bad deal at all for one of the most versatile gaming handhelds around. It might just be Valve clearing out old inventory as it phases out the older LCD models entirely, but it comes as every other platform squeezes players more and more at the checkout line. The Xbox Series X/S just got its second price hike this year, the PS5 all-digital is now $100 more than it was at launch, and even the original Switch recently went from $300 to $330. At this rate, it’s hard not to feel like the $450 Switch 2 might not be far behind.</p> <p>Then there’s the Steam Deck’s competition in the PC gaming handheld race. We still don’t know how much the new <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-price-pc-gaming-handheld-asus-pre-order-2000622751">Xbox Ally Rog</a> will be, even though it’s less than a month away from launch. And the Legion Go 2, which costs <a href="https://kotaku.com/legion-go-2-price-specs-madden-curse-eagles-2000623447">up to $1350 at the high end</a> ($1,479 for the 2TB model), is both incredibly expensive and incredibly hard-to-get. Lenovo took so many pre-orders <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LegionGo/comments/1nl3vxj/now_there_cancelling_preorders/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">it’s already canceling some</a>. That all might be great for “<a href="https://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/news/2045631.html">enthusiast gamers</a>” but it’s not likely to actually help grow the overall market for PC gaming or handhelds. There’s only an estimated <a href="https://substack.com/redirect/d49e77d2-93bb-48ce-b01b-168e092a9257?j=eyJ1IjoiN293Z2UifQ.yUVZMKoNk2BqBF9tq3iEKEd7X3capQ_E9zpEziCzGhc">5 to 7 million Steam Decks</a> out there in the world right now, and it’s by far the best-selling portable not made by Nintendo.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nobody-told-me-one-of-the-biggest-games-on-the-planet-is-super-horny.1304676/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Sometimes, in this line of work, a game’s name will pass over your feeds multiple times before you ever actually see a frame of footage from it. That is what happened to me with </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace</span></i><span>, Papergames’ 2024 dating sim, which apparently has over </span><a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/life/virtual-romance-real-money-why-some-sporeans-spend-up-to-4-figures-to-find-love-in-deepspace"><span>50 million players worldwide</span></a><span>. The otome game has always been a massive success, but with each update, another wave of buckwild clips starts spreading around the internet. Finally, this morning, I had my first run-in with </span><a href="https://x.com/micheogyal21/status/1969965447274717448"><span>a </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace </span></i><span>scene</span></a><span> so confounding and horny that I had to look into it further.</span></p> <p><i><span>Love and Deepspace</span></i><span> has a surprisingly complex science fiction story in which the main character, a woman named and customized by the player, is a “deepspace hunter” who fights creatures called Wanderers, but she also, unbeknownst to her, has been reincarnated multiple times. In all these previous lives, she has met the game’s five love interests, and unlocking memories from those past iterations is one of the biggest draws of the game because they not only delve into the game’s broader mysteries, but they’re also, well, interactive.</span></p>  <p><span>Just taking a cursory look at some of the romance scenes, it’s easy to see why </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace </span></i><span>has taken off the way it has. It’s angsty, sexy (if a bit awkward), and it has the same tendency toward melodrama that you might find in a soap opera or a romance novel. People love to date digital men who fulfill an otherworldly fantasy that real men can’t. It’s why </span><i><span>Twilight </span></i><span>still has the cultural cache it does, despite having been out of the limelight for over a decade. That being said, even as a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-romance-sex-scene-bear-shadowheart-gale-1850771533"><span>well-documented lover of digital men</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-sex-romance-scene-neve-taash-1851696476"><span>romance</span></a><span>, I don’t think I have the patience for some of </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace</span></i><span>’s gacha nonsense, which seems even more convoluted than that in your average gacha game. But even if I’m not playing it, I can still go snooping around YouTube and TikTok to see what all 50 million people who are playing this game are fawning over. Specifically, I needed to find out what the hell was up with this sex scene in which one of the lover boys, Zayne, says, “Feel this and remember what I’m giving you” as he’s on top of the player character.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">FEEL THIS POWER OF ANNIHILATION HE SAID, ANNIHILATE MA KITTY [zayne new myth god of annihilation] <a href="https://t.co/ATSKlGpwaY">pic.twitter.com/ATSKlGpwaY</a></p> <p>— 𝒔𝒖𝒛𝒖 (@pinkcrispss) <a href="https://twitter.com/pinkcrispss/status/1969964067986268598?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The scene is from a new trailer for the “Edge of Continuum” event that will begin on September 25. Edge of Continuum features new scenes with a “God of Annihilation” version of Zayne, depicting one of the protagonist’s many lives alongside him. And damn, the trailer is enough to get someone hot and bothered.</span></p>  <p><span>I’m surprised at how much story the trailer gives away, but nobody in the comments seems to be that mad about it, considering what they also get to see, which is basically the beginnings of a fantasy-themed softcore porn starring Zayne. Happy for y’all, and I have nothing but respect for those of you who can fight your way through the gacha nonsense to reach these scenes. Hopefully, I’ve done enough research for writing this that the algorithm starts showing me more of this shit so I can enjoy the fruits of your labor.</span></p>
