              <p>Every big game studio is currently trying to figure out if genAI tools are the real deal and how they can be used to help make games more quickly and efficiently. <a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-6-is-powered-by-new-version-of-creation-engine-starfield-classic-rpg-2000670744"><em>The </em><em>Elder Scrolls 6</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/every-time-todd-howard-has-talked-about-fallout-5-2000655749"><em>Fallout 5</em> director Todd Howard</a> recently pushed back against suggestions that the LLM boom is just a “fad” but said that just where and how AI might be implemented into the game development pipeline is still far from clear.</p> <p>“It’s certainly not a fad,” he said in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sX4rKpB97L4">February 18 interview</a> with <em>Kinda Funny Games</em>. “I think the AI answer now becomes ‘ask me in six months,’ right? It changes so much what you’re seeing out there. For us, we’re being incredibly cautious.” He confirmed that Bethesda is experimenting with AI for data-heavy tasks but keeping it out of the creative department, at least for now.</p>

 <p id="fb96c106-9d87-45f4-8b31-83048e55af79-0">“We can’t ignore it, in terms of it’s coming, it’s changing, every few months there’s a new model, particularly on the tech side with code or productivity or other things,” Howard said, adding, “it can help us get better at some big data tasks that just take us a lot of time, that we wish were done now so we can move onto the creative stuff.”</p> <p>At the same time, the veteran RPG designer confirmed AI isn’t being used to create anything that goes into Bethesda’s games. He didn’t get into the nitty-gritty about whether it’s being used for concept art references or placeholder text, but did suggest the company doesn’t see the technology as a potential replacement for human-made art.</p>

 <p>“We’re not using it to generate anything,” Howard said. “I think there’s an element of artistic intention that is essential to what we do and what others do. And if you look across things outside of AI, go back a hundred years, this idea of craftsmen, I still think craftsmen, and that handcrafted human intention, is what makes things special, and that’s where we want to be.”</p>

 <p>Speaking in generalities is one way to avoid <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-gen-ai-larian-bg3-reddit-ama-2000658429">the hot water some game company leaders have gotten into</a> by embracing AI experimentation. Some evangelists are predicting computer gods and mass unemployment by 2030. My only hope is we’re playing <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> by then.</p>

 <p><span>“Please help Ludovic, who is a wonderful and kind person that makes the world a better place. America is better with him here,” Hazlewood writes.</span></p> <p><span>Details are scarce on exactly when, where, and how Mbock was detained. According to </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/samred.com/post/3mf6olxcfic23"><span>a post on Bluesky</span></a><span> from writer Sam Machkovech, Mbock emigrated from Cameroon and has lived in the U.S. for “more than half his life, having graduated from a MD high school in 2006.” As news of Mbock’s situation spread, the fighting game community and his teammates in The Hiero Group have been sharing the GFM and pleading with the public for financial support.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguard-content-update-mode-servers-2000671282</link>
            <guid>1440310</guid>

              <p>If you, like me, have been keeping up with<em> Highguard</em>, well, there’s good news. Despite last week’s studio layoffs and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-update-roadmap-servers-discord-2000670633">radio silence afterwards</a>, Wildlight Entertainment’s hero shooter has snuck out a new content drop. It includes a new map and raiding item, as well as new mounts that look like <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>‘ Owlbears. But the real pocket of hope is a new mode the developers are teasing based around what <em>Highguard</em> does best: raids.</p> <p>“This patch is purely content focused, with a brand new Base and a powerful new Raid Tool added to the game, along with new offerings in the Store,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4128260/view/518613150889673564">read the patch notes</a> on Steam. “We are also working on next week’s patch, which we aim to bring a new game mode focused on the Raid experience, as well as some balance adjustments to weapons, among other things.”</p> <p>The “Raid experience,” for folks who bounced off <em>Highguard</em> at launch or haven’t given it a try, is when one team is breaching a base and trying to plant bombs on objectives to blow it up. There’s a bit of <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> sprinkled in with destructible walls and gadgets that assist with breaching, including zip-lines you can shoot out from a siege tower to quickly get behind enemy lines. It’s usually the best part of any match and is where the real promise of <em>Highguard</em> begins to break through. A new mode that serves that up in a more concentrated form could work really well.</p> <p>Wildlight still hasn’t given an update on just how the old content roadmap is being modified or scrapped, but that new mode is supposed to arrive next week. In the meantime, however, this week’s patch will add the Cloudbreach map which takes place at the launchpad for a giant airship, and the Lockpick, a new item that lets you shoot a dart at doors and windows to take control of them away from the enemy during raids. A purple variant will even add an electric shock that zaps enemies nearby. Plus there’s new Moonbruin Mounts which look cool, though good luck <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192">getting anyone to spend money</a> on <em>Highguard</em> right now.</p>
