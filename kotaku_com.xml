              <p>There are so many great games out there to play but so little space on the Nintendo Switch to download them all. The system’s built-in capacity fills up quickly, especially if you prefer digital purchases. Fortunately, expanding your available space is not only possible, but simple, affordable, and officially supported. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6239/">Samsung’s microSDXC memory card, designed specifically for the Nintendo Switch family of systems, is currently part of a limited-time sale at Amazon.</a> The 1TB model, normally priced at $122, has dropped to just $85, giving players a substantial 30% discount on one of the best storage upgrades available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6239/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="772" data-end="824">Support a Massive Library of Nintendo Switch Games</h2>
<p data-start="826" data-end="1187">If you’ve owned a Switch for a decent length of time, you’ve likely hit your storage limit. Even the Nintendo Switch OLED model, released in 2021, includes only 64GB of internal storage. The original 2017 Switch offers just 32GB, and with a portion of that dedicated to essential system files, you really have only about 25GB free for games.</p>
<p data-start="1189" data-end="1601">To put that into perspective, <em data-start="1219" data-end="1262">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> comes in just over 16GB. That’s a reasonable file size compared to blockbuster games on other platforms, but on a Switch, it takes up a significant chunk of your available storage all by itself. Two or three larger games can easily fill an entire console, forcing you to constantly delete and redownload titles as you want to revisit.</p>
<p data-start="1603" data-end="2132">This is why a large-capacity microSD card is almost mandatory. By adding the Samsung microSDXC card, you expand your Switch’s storage by up to 1TB. That’s more more than 30 times the internal space of the base model system. With that much room, you can download huge first-party adventures, tons of indie favorites, and even bulky third-party releases without worrying about shuffling files around. For most players, it’s enough space to last for years.</p>


<p data-start="2134" data-end="2704">The Samsung 1TB microSDXC card delivers read and write speeds of up to 180 MB/s, which is more than sufficient for the Nintendo Switch. It’s reliable, fast, and optimized for smooth performance while launching games or transferring data.</p>
<p data-start="2134" data-end="2704">And we haven’t even talked about the best part yet. This SD card has Shadow the Hedgehod on it. This whole lineup of Samsung microSDs features a Sonic character. The 128GB model is marked red with Knuckles, the 256GB one marked orange for Tails, and the 512GB card is accented blue with Sonic. And then at the full 1TB, we have the ultimate lifeform himself in black—Shadow the Hedgehog.</p>
<p data-start="2134" data-end="2704">It’s inherently very silly to me to put anything remarkable on the outside of a microSD card designed for the Nintendo Switch. That’s mainly because you’ll look at it once, pop it into your console, then never look at it again. I guess you can rest easy knowing Shadow is looking after your digital copies of <em>Super Mario RPG</em> and <em>Snipperclips</em>.</p>
<p data-start="2706" data-end="3132">Do note that this microSD card is&nbsp;<strong>not compatible</strong> with the newly released Nintendo Switch 2. The new console requires faster read and write speeds that you can find on an express microSD. This particular lineup of microSD cards are, however, still compatible on any of the first generation of Nintendo Switch consoles. This includes the Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo Switch Lite, and the Nintendo Switch OLED.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a> starts with a bang, but it didn’t really impress me much. However, everything changed once I reached the game’s first real playground, a Giger-esque otherworldly factory filled with robots, puzzles, electrical dangers, and a cool motorcycle.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/fans-who-pre-ordered-metroid-prime-4-six-years-ago-have-seen-their-entire-lives-change-2000645936">Nearly a decade after it was first teased</a> and 18 years after <em>Metroid Prime 3,</em> Retro and Nintendo have finally released <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> for Switch and Switch 2. Over here at <em>Kotaku</em>, we didn’t get an early copy of the sci-fi action adventure FPS like many other sites. So I’ve been playing it today on Switch 2, taking my first power-suited steps into this latest entry in the beloved <em>Metroid Prime</em> series. Two things struck me right out of the gate while playing <em>Prime 4:</em> This game looks really nice. And the opening hour is meh.</p>

  <p><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> is a gorgeous game, even if <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-graphics-comparison-switch-2-ugly-2000650585">some online don’t think it looks realistic or detailed enough</a>. What Retro has pulled off here is at times stunning and always runs at a flawless 120FPS at a crisp resolution, too. It might not be as sharp as something like <em>Black Ops 7</em> running on a PS5 Pro or as detailed as<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> on a Series X, but <em>Prime 4</em> nails it where it matters, using art style and smart graphical tricks to create something that looks wonderful on my big dumb 4K 120hz television.</p>

 <p>I especially love the lighting and <em>Prime 4</em>‘s HDR implementation, with dark areas not looking washed out and bright lights popping off the screen. It’s easily the best-looking Switch 2 game around.</p> <p>However, visuals weren’t enough to win me over during <em>Prime 4</em>‘s first hour. The game starts off with an action-packed tutorial and then a slow exploration of an alien world, where you meet a very annoying Galactic Federation soldier who, along with the game itself, practically holds Samus’ hand through most of the first part of <em>Prime 4</em>. It’s not bad, per se, but I wasn’t excited to play more. Thankfully, you ditch that annoying dude and set off to visit the game’s first real area, Volt Forge.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650677" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650677"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650677">©Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This is where <em>Prime 4</em> gets <em>really</em> good. I won’t spoil too much, as it’s an experience I don’t want to ruin for anyone. But what makes Volt Forge so excellent is how it blends everything great about <em>Metroid Prime</em> into one haunting and large level. There are boss fights that utilize your various tools and weapons. It has puzzles that feel just challenging enough that solving them is satisfying, but not so annoying as to be a brick wall. And some incredible music, too. And to my surprise, Volt Forge even gets a bit creepy at points. Don’t expect jump scares or worry that <em>Prime 4</em> is a horror game; it never goes that far, but I enjoyed the change in pace from the opening level.</p>

 <p>Maybe the most unexpected part of Volt Forge is that it reminds me of <em>Titanfall 2</em> and <a href="https://youtu.be/A2W0LfUXFQo?t=1740">that game’s much-praised level set inside a large factory</a>. Again, I won’t spoil exactly what happens in Volt Forge that reminded me of that level from Repsawn’s excellent sci-fi mech shooter, just know that the factory Samus is exploring is far from broken down. So you might want to be careful.</p> <p>And at the very end of Volt Forge, you unlock <em>Prime 4</em>‘s motorcycle, which handles fine enough and feels great to drive. I have no idea if the rest of the game will match Volt Forge’s quality or if I’ll enjoy the more open-ended hub desert where the motorcycle is primarily used. It’s possible that everything after this will be terrible. For now, though, <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> was able to overcome its so-so opening hour and win me over with a creepy and dangerous trip through an alien factory.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-holds-star-wars-jango-fetts-starship-at-its-black-friday-low-to-move-holiday-stock-2000650845</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGOs are fun to build on your own, and even more enjoyable when doing it with friends. If you’re a fan of the galaxy far, far away or have a little one who just can’t seem to stop talking about the identity and origin of Supreme Leader Snoke, there’s a way to bring an important part of Star Wars to your living room this holiday season.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6238/">The LEGO Star Wars: Attack of the Clones Jango Fett’s Starshipset, which usually goes for around $70, just dropped to $56 at Amazon</a>. That’s after the retailer slashed 20% off its retail tag, making the purchase quite affordable. The offer can be grabbed by both Prime and non-Prime members. Even better, all shoppers get to enjoy free delivery with their purchase, so there are no extra costs to worry about. However, we highly recommend getting your orders in quickly because the holiday rush is in full swing, and deals are moving fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6238/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great for All Ages</h2>
<p>The set is made for ages 9 and up, and comes with a total of 707 pieces. It’s not massive, which is great if you’re planning to grab it for kids and don’t want to overwhelm them with a large project. It’s going to be one of those fun sets that can be brought to life by dedicating just a few hours during the weekend. Since the holiday season is upon us, everyone in the family can join in; maybe by the fireplace with some hot chocolate. Play the Star Wars theme song in the background to get in the feels!</p>
<p>You’ll be building Jango Fett (with dual blasters and jetpack), who is <em>a simple man trying to make his way in the universe</em>, young Boba Fett learning all about family trade, and tall Kaminoan Lama Su minifigures, plus the stunning starship. The attention to detail on the starship is incredible, since it features authentic rotating wings, four stud shooters, and a seismic charge-dropping function for some cool, explosive escapes just in the asteroid chase scene. There’s also an opening cockpit for two minifigures to jump in for some adventures across the Outer Rim, as well as a mobile service cart with ammunition storage. The latter doubles as a display stand.</p>



<p>Once built, the starship is going to measure over 3.5 in. (9 cm) high, 8 in. (21 cm) long, and 8.5 in. (21 cm) wide. It’s going to look stunning on its own, but you can always pair it with others in the LEGO Star Wars collection for a bigger setup that spans multiple star systems. The set also comes with a detailed instruction book that’s going to take younger fans through each step one by one. It’s quite easy to follow, so kids will be able to build on their own. For even more assistance, you can install the LEGO Builder app, which offers digital, 3D instructions. Kids can zoom in from every angle, track their progress, and save sets. The app also makes it easy to build with friends. In this mode, it divides tasks between everyone on board, so everyone can complete their own.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6238/">The current discount brings the price of the starship model to just $56. You’re saving a nice 20% on a set any Star Wars fan is going to love and cherish.</a> If you like it, don’t wait too long to grab it. Once the discount is gone, we can’t say whether it will be back anytime soon.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-m4-mac-mini-price-drop-post-black-friday-holiday-windows-mini-pc-deals-2000650662</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="140" data-end="945">Laptops often get more praise than they deserve. While they’re convenient for mobility, nothing quite compares to a well-designed desk setup with large monitors, a responsive mechanical keyboard, and the comfort of a dedicated workspace. Such an environment not only boosts productivity but also creates a place you’ll genuinely enjoy returning to whenever it’s time to focus. One of the best ways to power a setup like this is with the Apple Mac Mini. Despite being a desktop machine, it’s still compact enough to take with you when needed. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">Even better, the 2024 version of Apple’s compact desktop is currently discounted by 17% on Amazon, dropping the price from $599 to $499.</a> If you’ve been considering an upgrade, this is an ideal moment to treat yourself while saving a whole $100.</p>
<p data-start="947" data-end="1618">The discounted model is the 2024 Apple Mac Mini equipped with Apple’s M4 chip, which features a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU. The device is sold in 256 GB and 512 GB variants, although the higher-capacity version is currently selling for over $700. Alongside that storage, the system includes 16 GB of RAM. The M4 processor is the star of the show here, giving this compact desktop a tremendous performance boost. Apple claims it can operate up to 13 times faster than the fastest Intel-based Mac Mini. That makes the machine suitable for everyday productivity as well as demanding creative tasks like photo or video editing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="1620" data-end="2060">In terms of connectivity, the 2024 Mac Mini packs a generous selection of ports and wireless options. You’ll find three Thunderbolt 4 ports, two USB-C ports, HDMI, and Gigabit Ethernet, along with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 for fast and stable wireless connections. Apple may have phased out the headphone jack on the iPhone years ago, but it remains present on the Mac Mini, giving you the convenience of wired audio whenever you want it.</p>
<p data-start="2062" data-end="2748">The desktop comes loaded with macOS 15.1 Sequoia, which continues Apple’s emphasis on privacy and security. It includes an upgraded Secure Enclave to help safeguard your personal data and system integrity. MacOS supports a wide variety of software, from productivity essentials to creative tools. You can use the full Microsoft 365 suite, Adobe Creative Cloud applications, Zoom, and thousands of other programs. In fact, the App Store offers more than 15,000 apps, many of which are optimized specifically for the M4 chip.</p>


<h2>Better With Apple Accessories</h2>
<p data-start="2750" data-end="3035">To enhance your experience even further, you can pair the Mac Mini with other Apple accessories. It works seamlessly with the Apple Studio Display and integrates perfectly with peripherals like the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, offering a smooth and cohesive setup across your devices.</p>
<p data-start="3037" data-end="3278"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">For a short time, Amazon is selling the 2024 Mac Mini with the M4 chip for $499, an even $100 reduction from its standard price.</a> AppleCare+ isn’t included, but you can add three years of coverage for a combined total of $588—that’s at a $120 discount.</p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>According to a report by&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-wins-the-warner-bros-discovery-bidding-war-enters-exclusive-deal-talks/">TheWrap</a> </em>and <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros">now Netflix itself</a>, Netflix is now entering exclusive talks to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, having outbid other competitors for the&nbsp;<em>Batman</em>-owning megacorp. If the deal goes through, rumored to be at $30 a share, it would mean the streaming giant would own everything from HBO to DC comics, including all your favorite Lego and <em>Batman</em> games.</p> <p>Warner Bros. boss David Zaslav has been making it clear he wants to sell the company for a good while now, but holding out for a big exit. In October this year he <a href="https://kotaku.com/holy-monopoly-batman-warner-bros-reportedly-reject-a-buyout-bid-from-paramount-2000634581">turned down a bid from Paramount</a> said to be at $20 a share, with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-12/warner-bros-is-said-to-rebuff-paramount-takeover-approach"><em>Bloomberg</em> claiming</a> the CEO was holding out for 50 percent higher. That valuation seemed crazy, and it was assumed that Paramount came in much lower to test the waters, with the expectation of either a $25 per share bid to follow, or more hostile takeover moves. However, instead, it seems Netflix has swooped in close enough to that $30 offer, working out to a price of $82.7 billion, and thus won the war. Should things go to Netflix and Warners’ plans, the purchase should be complete by the end of 2026.</p>

 <h2>What are the implications of this deal?</h2> <p>If the deal goes through, this would mean streaming giant Netflix would own one of its big rivals, HBO Max, and presumably look to merge the two services. It would also own Warner’s entire movie business including New Line Cinema, all of DC Entertainement, the Discovery network of channels, and multiple networks like CNN, TBS, TNT and the Cartoon Network. And, of course, Warner Bros. Games.</p>

 <p>In a normal universe, this would be the sort of deal that would be tangled in monopolistic concerns for years to come, as people questioned the unparalleled power this could offer Netflix over multiple industries. However, given other recent mergers that have taken place after, um, payments made to the Trump orbit, what might happen is anyone’s guess. However, earlier talk last month of the potential deal between Netflix and Warner <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-warner-bros-bid-antitrust-concerns-darrell-issa-letter/">resulted in antitrust concerns being raised</a>, and certainly there will be a lot of fight from those concerned how the deal could affect Hollywood.</p>

 <p>Yet, at the same time, Paramount was allowed to merge with Skydance and Disney was allowed to buy Fox, so Netflix has plenty of precedent to argue from. As it happens, it could be Paramount that objects the loudest to the Netflix deal, given how it and so many others had assumed it would get Warner eventually, and the company is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/04/paramount-questions-warner-bros-discovery-sale-process-letter.html">already questioning the “fairness and adequacy”</a> of the process. A Warner attorney wrote, “It has become increasingly clear, through media reporting and otherwise, that WBD appears to have abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process, thereby abdicating its duties to stockholders, and embarked on a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder.”</p>

 <h2>A messy breakup for gaming?</h2> <p>The Netflix deal also makes another aspect of Warner Bros. Discovery more interesting. <a href="https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-separate-two-leading-media-companies">Zaslav had appeared determined to break up the company</a> such that its linear cable channel businesses would be separated from the rest, and then that loss-making sector take all the company’s debt with it. Because that’s legal I guess. This is something Paramount was trying to prevent with its purchase attempt, however, according to a press release put out by Netflix, the intention is to buy Warner Bros. <em>after</em> Zaslav’s division, seeing the profitless cable channels become a new company called Discovery Global and not be part of the sale.</p>

 <p>Netflix’s co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in the press release,</p> <blockquote><p><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">“By combining Warner Bros.’ incredible library of shows and movies—from timeless classics like </span><em><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">Casablanca </span></em><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">and </span><em><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">Citizen Kane </span></em><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">to modern favorites like </span><em><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">Harry Potter</span></em><span data-darkreader-inline-color=""> and </span><em><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">Friends</span></em><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">—with our culture-defining titles like<em> S</em></span><em><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">tranger Things</span></em><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">, </span><em><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">KPop Demon Hunters</span></em><span data-darkreader-inline-color=""> and </span><em><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">Squid Game</span></em><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">, we’ll be able to do that even better. Together, we can give audiences more of what they love and help define the next century of storytelling.”</span></p></blockquote> <p>At the same time, the deal could be very concerning for games players, given <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-gaming-hades-monument-vally-golden-idol-braid-1851785038">Netflix’s very clear backward step from anything other than mobile gaming</a>. Its owning the studios that develop the <em>Arkham</em> and&nbsp;<em>Lego</em> games could mean bad times for console players if the pattern continues.</p>

 <p>There’s obviously a lot of fighting to come, and presumably some hefty legal challenges from those who feel dropped at the altar, let alone the antitrust maneuvers. But given [broad sweeping gesture], it won’t be in the least bit surprising to see it happening sooner rather than later.</p> <p><strong>Updated: 12/05/2025, 8:35 a.m. ET:</strong> Updated the post above to add details from Netflix’s press release, including the money involved.</p>
