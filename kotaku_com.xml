              <p>Nintendo Switch users squint at the 7-inch handheld screen for hours on end and lose important visual details and straining their eyes in marathon gaming sessions. <strong>Portable monitors solve that by turning handheld consoles into proper gaming rigs</strong> wherever you go and acting as secondary displays for laptop productivity.</p>
<p>This<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5381/"> 15.6-inch monitor gets 1080p resolution in an ultra-thin frame, now sitting at $49 instead of the usual $59 price tag</a>. That pricing undercuts budget gaming controllers but offers functionality that fundamentally shifts how you work and play on the go. The <strong>monitor itself weighs just 1.43 pounds</strong> with a built-in kickstand and makes it truly portable rather than another heavy accessory collecting dust at home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5381/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD IPS Display with 178-Degree Viewing Angles</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch display supports 1920 x 1080 with IPS panel technology</strong> that keeps color and brightness accurate from extreme angles up to 178 degrees. You can position the monitor off to the side when giving presentations or working collaboratively, and colors won’t shift or contrast degrade for viewers at an angle. The designation of an IPS A-grade panel indicates even better panel selection with fewer dead pixels and more consistent backlighting than that found on less-costly panels.<strong> HDR support</strong> will extend the dynamic range in content that supports the feature, brightening highlights and deepening shadows to a more life-like image reproduction.</p>
<p><strong>Low blue light mode</strong> reduces eye strain during extended viewing by filtering out harmful blue wavelengths that contribute to fatigue and sleep disruption. That matters during marathon gaming sessions or situations at work when you’re staring at screens all day for eight-plus hours. The screen also comes with a matte anti-glare coating diffusing any reflections from overhead lights or windows and keeps the screen visible under bright conditions where glossy displays become mirrors. <strong>Response time sits around 5ms</strong> and keeps everything smooth for casual gaming and video playback.</p>



<p><strong>Dual USB-C ports</strong> provide both power and video signal over a single cable when connected to supported devices. Newer laptops using Thunderbolt 3.0, Thunderbolt 4.0, or USB 3.1 Type-C with DisplayPort Alt Mode transmit video over USB-C and removes the need for a separate power adapter or video cables. The second USB-C port acts as a dedicated power input for those devices that cannot supply enough power over their USB-C ports. Additionally,<strong> a Mini HDMI port</strong> is available for older laptops, desktops, and game consoles that depend on traditional video outputs.</p>
<p><strong>The Nintendo Switch connects through USB-C</strong> when the unit is docked or via Mini HDMI with an adapter, and it upgrades instantly from a 7-inch handheld screen to a proper 15.6-inch display. PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series consoles all connect via HDMI, making the portable monitor a dedicated gaming display for bedrooms or travel.</p>



<p>It has dual built-in speakers along the bottom edge and offers stereo sound that is much clearer and louder than laptop speakers. The audio quality remains adequate for video calling, casual gaming and streaming content, though serious gaming or music listening could benefit with headphones or external speakers. The volume controls sit on the side panel alongside power and menu buttons for adjusting brightness and contrast and selecting between inputs.</p>
<p>The monitor <strong>does not rely on external power adapters in the case of devices</strong> that supply sufficient USB-C power when connected. This ensures cable simplicity during travels. In the event of low-power devices, connecting the second USB-C to a power source becomes necessary-an addition of one more cable to your setup. Power consumption remains less than 10 watts during normal use, hence drawing little power from the connected laptops or power banks.</p>
<p>You pay less than most budget game controllers for a full 1080p display that expands your gaming and productivity capabilities at $49. Most competing 15.6-inch portable monitorsbetween $120 to $200 with similar specs which makes this sale drop the price to buy levels.</p>

              <p>The cost of gaming is too damn high. Seriously, these machines just keep going up in price and every year it feels like we’re getting closer to $90-$100 games. Keeping an eye on sales is essential these days, and thankfully, if you’re in the market for a PS5, you can save a full Benjamin on the cost of a new one thanks to <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-friday-2025-ps5-discount-sale-pro-2000644002">Sony’s Black Friday 2025 deal</a>.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-review-one-year-later-worth-it-price-4k-games-2000642988">One Year Later, I’ve Forgotten I Even Own A PS5 Pro</a></p> <p>Black Friday, the most sacrosanct of consumerist holidays, will see Sony offer a suite of PS5 bundles, as well as a flat $100 discount on PS5 Digital Edition, the disc-based version, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-review-one-year-later-worth-it-price-4k-games-2000642988">the PS5 Pro</a>. Sony has outlined the specifics of the deals over on its official <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/18/playstations-black-friday-deals-2025/">PlayStation blog</a>. Console savings include:</p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1">The PS5 Digital Edition 825GB – Fortnite Flowering Chaos Bundle will be available at a recommended retail price of $399.99 USD and the PS5 Console 1TB – Fortnite Flowering Chaos Bundle will be available at a recommended retail price of $449.99. The bundle offerings feature PlayStation-exclusive in-game content** and 1,000 V-Bucks.</li> <li aria-level="1">In select regions, players can also save $100USD on PS5 consoles and $100 USD on PS5 Digital Edition consoles.*</li> <li aria-level="1">Gamers looking for the most visually impressive PS5 gaming experience can also save $100 USD on PS5 Pro consoles.*</li> </ul> <p>But that’s not all. Sony is also taking $100 off of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps-vr2-ps5-sony-oculus-meta-quest-valve-index-alyx-1850121563">PS VR2</a> (which you can also use on a PC with the right adapter, I might add).

That or I’m gonna get creative with a soldering iron (which might end up being a wildly more expensive indulgence).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! The time is [Redacted] and welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily roundup of interesting news, shit you might care about, and [Redacted]. We hope you enjoy your visit and get to learn more about Valve’s newly revealed Steam Machines, <em>Roblox</em> face-scanning tech, [Redacted], and Shroud’s problems with the Game Awards. And remember, please don’t [Redacted] or you might [Redacted]. Have a great day!</p>  <p>Popular video game streamer and <a href="https://kotaku.com/spectre-divide-shroud-refunds-season-1-shutting-down-1851769661">content creator Shroud</a> is a big fan of this year’s excellent extraction shooter <em>Arc Raiders.</em> And he’s not, apparently, a fan of the Game Awards snubbing the game for its Game of the Year award.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-world-is-just-not-ready-for-ai-in-video-games-shroud-accuses-the-game-awards-of-being-rigged-following-arc-raiders-goty-snub">As reported by <em>IGN</em>,</a> in a recent Twitch stream, Shroud watched the Game Awards nominees being announced and, upon seeing that<em> Arc Raiders</em> wasn’t in the running for the big GOTY award, expressed disappointment, saying, “The world is just not ready for AI in video games, not yet. They’re just not ready. But, hey, at least they nominated it for something. I genuinely thought they wouldn’t nominate it for anything because they were scared to get backlash. But at least they nominated it for something, so that’s good.” He then stated: “Once again, another year, another rigged year. That’s crazy.” Even before the nominees were revealed, <a href="https://x.com/shroud/status/1990460220020240848">he was claiming the show might be rigged.&nbsp;</a></p>

 <p>It’s a bit odd to suggest the world isn’t ready for <em>Arc Raiders</em>, considering it’s one of the most-played games on Steam right now and has received heaps of critical praise. And there is zero evidence that the Game Awards this year or any previous year are rigged. The awards are voted on by a panel of members of the games media and influencers. <em>IGN </em>reports that later in the stream, &nbsp;Shroud expressed disappointment at the possibility of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> winning, asking “who the fuck is playing” the Switch 2 platformer.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Roblox</em> rolls out age verification via face scanning</strong></h2> <p>Prepare to have your face scanned before playing <em>Roblox</em>. The extremely popular online free-to-play game has started <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/roblox-begins-rolling-out-age-checks-using-facial-age-estimation-technology">rolling out a voluntary face-scanning system</a> that will be used to check a player’s age and limit the ability for kids and adults to communicate. For now, you won’t need to verify your age by scanning your face with the <em>Roblox</em> app to play experiences online, but certain chat features will be locked behind the new process. And next year, age verification via a face scan will be required globally for all players to access the game at all. The company promises that it will delete all images and videos “immediately after processing.”</p>

 <h2><strong><em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> balloons will be included in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000645171" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000645171"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000645171">©Macy’s / Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p>Netflix’s hit animated movie <em>KPop Demon Hunters </em>continues to take over the world. Two characters from the cartoon, Derpy Tiger and Sussie, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/harry-potter-goblet-of-fire-movie-20-anniversary-voldemort-better-book/?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;taid=691c910e43e91a00019ec3e1&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bluesky">will be featured in the annual parade’s 99th installment next week as large, colorful balloons</a>. I’ve still not seen the movie yet, so I don’t have much to add beyond the fact that the balloons look cool and oh god it’s almost Thanksgiving and I have done zero Christmas shopping or planning.</p>

 <h2><strong>Close to a decade after launch, Epic finally adds gifting to its store</strong></h2> <p>Seven years after launch, the Epic Game Store has finally added the ability to gift games to other players on the platform, a feature Valve’s Steam store has supported for years now. <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/gifting-now-available-on-egs">According to a blog post</a> about the new feature, players can now buy and send games directly to people on their Epic friends lists. Gifted games can only be sent to friends and they must not own the game already. If they decline it, you get a full refund.</p>

 <h2><strong>Steam Machines are more powerful than 70 percent of PCs that use Steam</strong></h2> <p>Valve’s recently announced Steam Machine, a console-like PC device for your TV, is supposedly more powerful than the majority of computers using Steam in 2025. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-pcs/valve-says-the-steam-machine-is-better-than-what-70-percent-of-pc-gamers-have-at-home-a-convenient-reminder-that-not-all-gaming-pcs-are-monster-rigs/">That’s according to Valve, as spotted by <em>PC Gamer.</em></a> In a recent video from Tested, the channel talked to Valve engineers who explained that for most Steam users, the upcoming Steam Machine will be an upgrade.</p>

 <p>“Another thing that we actually looked at is the Steam Hardware Survey,” said Valve. “Basically, that just gives us a good benchmark of where people’s home devices are at in terms of performance. And the Steam Machine is equal or better than 70 percent of what people have at home.”</p> <p>A good reminder that most people playing PC games aren’t running powerful rigs with cutting-edge tech, but are instead rocking budget builds with older, less powerful parts. So if the Steam Machine is priced smartly, it could be a big hit for those gamers looking to upgrade.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">Please stop cancelling Yoko Taro’s games</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">And here are your Game Awards 2025 nominees</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/escape-from-tarkov-steam-1-0-unheard-edition-2000644941">Everybody is mad about <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> on Steam</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <title><![CDATA[This AirTag 4-Pack Deal Makes Each Tag Feel Practically Free, Apple’s Clearing Stock Early to Avoid the Black Friday Rush]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-drops-the-apple-airtag-4-pack-to-just-65-each-going-for-16-today-2000644835</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-airtag-4-pack-deal-makes-each-tag-feel-practically-free-apple%E2%80%99s-clearing-stock-early-to-avoid-the-black-friday-rush.1356994/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Losing track of your items, especially when you’re on the go, is never fun. AirTags are a great way to always keep an eye on the whereabouts of your essentials. But since most of us have more than one thing worth keeping tabs on, getting just a single AirTag might not cut it. Thankfully, Amazon is making it easier to snap a few without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">Right now, the retailer is offering the Apple AirTag 4-Pack for just $65, which is a 34% discount from its original price.</a> That brings it down to around $16 per AirTag, which is practically a steal considering the peace of mind these bring. The deal is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but we can’t say how long it will last. It’s best to get your orders in before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ways to Track Your Essentials</h2>
<p>An AirTag is a coin-like gadget that you can attach to your essentials in multiple ways. You can use an AirTag accessory (like a keychain or loop) to hook it onto your keys or luggage, and even just slide one in your wallet or backpack. Activating these is quite straightforward; just remove the battery tab from the AirTag, bring it closer to your iPhone or iPad, and tap Connect on the prompt that appears. Follow the on-screen instructions to register the AirTag to your Apple ID, and you will be all set!</p>
<p>Once you’re done setting things up, you can use the Find My app to locate your essentials. The Precision Finding features lead you right to your nearby AirTag, and the app even lets you trigger a sound from the built-in speaker to help you find it. For items that are further away, the Find My network can help pinpoint their location anonymously.</p>



<p>Still can’t seem to find your valuables? You can also put an AirTag in Lost Mode, which sends you a notification as soon as it detects the AirTag. You can even share the tag with up to five people, or provide its details to a third party (like an airline) to help recover lost luggage.</p>
<p>The replaceable battery lasts up to a year. AirTags are also IP67 water and dust-resistant, meaning these tiny but mighty gadgets can survive not-so-ideal weather conditions well. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">This deal brings the price down of this 4-pack bundle to just $65, after a nice $34 discount, which makes the purchase much more affordable.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-phantasmal-flames-charizard-chase-card-2000645074</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/every-chase-card-in-pok%C3%A9mon-tcg%E2%80%99s-phantasmal-flames-including-that-charizard.1356928/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The latest set in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771">controversy-embroiled</a>&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG</em>, Phantasmal Flames, is now out. And, as is becoming traditional for a November release, contains a brand new Charizard card that’s going to drive even more people (and scalpers) to the hobby. In this case, it’s the beloved Mega Charizard X, the gigantic blue variant appearing in both a stunning Special Illustration Rare <em>and</em> in one of the new-fangled gold foils. And yes, both are already fetching ridiculous prices. But in a stark change, they’re the only two that are.</p> <p>I’m pleased to report that once again, if you’re actually able to find any packs to buy, Phantasmal Flames <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-pull-rates-2000629165">continues Mega Evolution’s new-found generosity</a> when it comes to pull rates. Of the 55 packs we were kindly sent by The Pokémon Company, I pulled an extraordinary 24 ex or better cards, of which 13 were full art or better. Compared to the three year run of <em>Scarlet &amp; Violet</em> sets, this is a dramatic improvement, with pretty much a 50:50 chance of not getting what is derogatively known as a “dud pack.” (For those wanting to play the game, there’s no such thing as a dud pack, and of course it’s these people who are most hurt by the current <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">year-long period of scarcity</a>.)</p>

 <p>However, the cost of this does very much appear to be the pull rates on Special Illustration Rares. As with Mega Evolution, Phantasmal Flames has made these most desirable cards extraordinarily unlikely to appear, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-gold-cards-pull-rate-2000630564">the new iteration of gold foils proving farcically rare</a>. With Mega Evolutions, this drove prices to new, all-time highs, but in the first few days of Phantasmal Flames things don’t appear to be nearly so out of control. The Charizards are, of course, outrageously priced at $600 and $800 each, but we then see a <em>massive</em> drop for third place, with Dawn’s SIR going for $60. That’s a&nbsp;<em>very</em> normal price for an SIR, and in a pretty small set with only five of them to find, it suggests that people are simply ripping packs for the Zards and caring about little else.</p>

 <p>That becomes even more stark when you notice that fourth place goes to Mega Charizard X ex again, but this time in its much more common Ultra Rare form (I pulled one of these, as it happens) at around $57, the other four SIRs following for as little as $30. (Yes, $30 for a piece of cardboard remains ridiculous, but then I just spent&nbsp;<em>way</em> more than that on the Crown Zenith Leafeon VSTAR, so who am I to talk?)</p>

 <p>Is this a good sign that cards like the Mega Sharpedo ex and Rotom ex SIRs aren’t going for megabucks? Or is it, and I do worry it’s this, that the SIRs in Phantasmal Flames just aren’t that appealing? The art is wonderful on both of those examples, but Sharpedo is rarely at the top of anyone’s favorite Pokémon list, and there really are a lot of pretty Rotom cards already. Then there’s the complete mess of the Mega Lopunny ex (see the card in the gallery), and, well, that’s all of them. The more common (and thus always cheaper) Illustration Rares are where the truly wonderful art appears in this set, with a stunning Zacian, Piplup, Flygon, Wooper, Togedemaru, Ludicolo and Ambipom to find, most of them selling during the peak price of the opening week for under $10! Meowth is the only one of the IRs that’s caught on at around $30 (with Piplup managing an impressive $19).</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-cards-price-mega-lucario-gardevoir-hyper-rare-2000633650">Compare this with Mega Evolution</a>, where the tenth highest priced card was going for $50, and the SIRs fetching around $300 each, and it’s a striking shift. So, with all that said, click on for the cards you want to chase if you’re looking for value in Phantasmal Flames, but know that if you’re after the cards to play in a deck, most can be picked up in their basic form for under a dollar. (Even Mega Charizard X ex’s regular form “only” fetches about $5.) Again,&nbsp;<em>if</em> you can actually find packs to open.</p>

Solid-state drives (SSDs) eliminate mechanical parts entirely, using flash memory that reads and writes data at speeds ten times faster than traditional HDDs.</p>
<p>The SanDisk 2TB Extreme portable SSD delivers <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4826/">NVMe performance in a pocket-sized package, now sitting at $162 instead of the usual $209 price tag.</a> This marks an <strong>all-time low</strong> for this capacity, with Amazon wanting to clear inventory before Black Friday ends.</p>

<h2>1,050MB/s Read Speeds</h2>
<p>This SanDisk SSD pushes <strong>read speeds up to 1,050MB/s and write speeds of about 1,000MB/s over its USB 3.2 Gen 2 connection</strong>. These numbers are indicative of real performance you can expect to see in the real world when transferring files, not some theoretical maximum that never materializes. A 4K movie file of roughly 25GB copies in about 25 seconds and that same transfer takes over three minutes on external hard drives.</p>
<p>Inside the drive,<strong> NVMe technology delivers this performance by using direct PCIe lanes</strong> rather than the SATA bottleneck that constrains older SSDs. The controller manages data efficiently, maintaining consistent speeds even during sustained transfers that would cause cheaper drives to throttle. This you’ll notice most when backing up large folders or copying entire game libraries, as the speeds keep steady rather than starting fast and degrading over time.</p>



<p>Two terabytes stores around <strong>500 hours of 1080p video, 200,000 high-resolution photos, or 20 modern AAA game installs</strong>. This tier makes sense for video editors who are working with 4K footage, photographers who have large RAW libraries they’re managing, and gamers who simply refuse to uninstall old titles. The drive serves as a Time Machine backup target for Mac users or a Windows backup destination and SSD speeds mean your automated backups will finish faster without stressing your system. External game storage works flawlessly with both the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles, from storing games on the drive to <strong>playing titles directly from it</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>IP65 water and dust resistance</strong> means complete dust ingress protection and protection against water jets from any direction. The rating means the drive survives rain exposure, dusty environments, or even an accidental spill without immediately destroying your data. You can casually throw it in a backpack with water bottles, do shoots outdoors, or work in construction sites without constant anxiety about the environmental damage it may cause.</p>



<p>The USB-C connectivity works with modern laptops, tablets, and phones via the<strong> provided USB-C to USB-C cable</strong>. A USB-C to USB-A adapter is included in the box to connect to older computers that have traditional USB ports. The drive pulls its power directly from the USB connection with no need for separate power adapters, which keeps true plug-and-play simplicity across devices.</p>
<p>The drives come formatted as exFAT, which works<strong> universally across Windows, Mac, and Linux without reformatting</strong>. You can reformat to NTFS for Windows-specific use or APFS for Mac-optimized performance if the need calls for it. Operating temperature ranges from 0°C to 45°C during active use, covering most environments you’d realistically use the drive in. Non-operating storage tolerance goes from -20°C to 85°C.</p>
<p>You’re paying here about $0.08 per gigabyte at $162 for real NVMe speeds and a rugged build. Samsung, Crucial, and WD portable SSDs with similar specifications often sell between $200 and $300.</p>
