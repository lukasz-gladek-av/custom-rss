              <p>Millions of votes later, <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> has officially taken home Steam’s Game of the Year award for 2025. It’s the highest-profile prize yet for the excellent Metroidvania Soulslike after it repeatedly <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">lost out to <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> at recent events like the Game Awards. The game is finally getting its much-deserved flowers just as Valve’s storefront cracked an all-time concurrent player peak to kick off 2026.</p> <p>In addition to <em>Clair Obscur</em>, <em>Silksong</em> was also up against <em>Arc Raiders</em>, <em>Dispatch</em>, and <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 </em>for Steam’s GOTY, so winning is no small feat. It’s also been the platform’s best-selling game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-was-steams-best-selling-game-over-the-holiday-period">throughout the holiday season</a> and continues to set new concurrent player records on PC. Over the weekend <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/1808500">it cracked 450,000</a>.</p>

 <p>Here are the rest of the 2025 Steam Awards winners:</p> <ul> <li>VR Game of the Year: <em><strong>The Midnight Walk </strong></em></li> <li>Labor of Love: <em><strong>Baldur’s Gate 3 </strong></em></li> <li>Best Game on Steam Deck: <em><strong>Hades 2 </strong></em></li> <li>Better with Friends: <em><strong>Peak </strong></em></li> <li>Outstanding Visual Style: <em><strong>Silent Hill f </strong></em></li> <li>Most Innovative Gameplay: <em><strong>Arc Raiders </strong></em></li> <li>Best Game You Suck At: <strong><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em></strong></li> <li>Best Soundtrack: <strong><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em></strong></li> <li>Outstanding Story-Rich Game: <strong><em>Dispatch </em></strong></li> <li>Sit Back and Relax: <strong><em>RV There Yet</em></strong></li> </ul> <p>Are the Steam Awards, where the winners are determined entirely based on user votes, basically a popularity contest? Yes. Could you have predicted most of these winners ahead of time? Probably! But it’s also neat to see so many great games given their flowers across unique categories in which they are unquestionably very deserving of praise.</p>

 <p>The results are certainly more interesting than those at this year’s Game Awards, where <em>Clair Obscur</em> swept and<em> Silksong</em> didn’t even nab the Player’s Voice award. That went to free-to-play gacha action-RPG <em>Wuthering Waves</em>. The Steam Awards are also by far the biggest community-voted prize in gaming. Anyone with an eligible Steam account can participate and the platform recently boasted a new record player peak of 41,746,984. Is it <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/roblox/roblox-smashes-concurrent-user-record-thanks-to-war-between-two-games-3242035/">catching up to<em> Roblox</em></a> any time soon? Doubtful. But it’s good news for everyone trying to actually make and sell games on Valve’s storefront.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663</link>
            <guid>1397329</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>You know, to some degree, I gotta feel for the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>creators</span></a><span>. Matt and Ross Duffer just wrapped up a decade-long streaming phenomenon that has certainly received a fair bit of praise from critics and fans over the years but, with its finale, has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-coming-out-scene-will-byers-season-5-2000655961"><span>absolutely flopped in the eyes of some very loud viewers</span></a><span> who weren’t pleased with how the show wrapped up. And now those creators have to do a press tour in which everything they say is picked apart by people ready to tear them to shreds for a final season they feel didn’t land. So I guess it’s not too surprising that Matt Duffer maybe regrets doing postmortem interviews at all, though I’m surprised he said that out loud and on the record.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoyIdbhGg-E"><span>Josh Horowitz</span></a><span>, both Duffers talked for about an hour about the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>finale, and at roughly the 25-minute mark, while the two are talking about soliciting input from actors about how they saw their characters ending up, , Matt asks, “Did Maya (Hawke) want to die, Ross, or am I making that up?” to which Ross responds that he might be making that up. Horowitz asks why he would have fabricated such a thing, and then Matt admits that he’s not been happy with how these interviews have been going, saying his brain is “fried.”</span></p>

  <p><span>“I really shouldn’t have done any of these postmortem interviews,” he said. “I’m not in a good place. Like, why the hell we did any of them yesterday is beyond me. I’m like, fried. I’m getting over the flu, you know. So anyone mad at any answers we gave yesterday, just give me a break. cut me some slack.”</span></p>

 <p><span>I get it. As someone who has interviewed many creatives who are dealing with an onslaught of questions from several journalists in rapid succession, I know it can be exhausting work. At a certain point it’s entirely possible that the mental spend becomes enough of a burden, you start being less practiced with your responses. And given the nature of </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>and the fandom around it, the interviews the Duffers have been doing have spent a lot of time on fan theories and unanswered questions, with the Duffer brothers readily handing out answers.</span></p>

 <p><span>Unsatisfied fans are hanging onto these interviews as if they’re going to possibly </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-5-bad-dialogue-clips-video-will-mike-2000651378"><span>redeem </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i></a><span> or at least give them closure on some threads the show seemed incapable or unwilling to make good on. Several of the interviews the two have given since the show ended have only stirred the pot further, and some fans are hopping on Matt Duffer’s comments and interpreting them as just the latest evidence that they are justified in feeling that the bros didn’t approach the finale with the proper care and forethought.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>New year, fresh start. You’ve tired of breathing potentially unclean air at home? You don’t have to resign yourself to a life of allergens and pollen and dust, not on our watch. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6664/">Amazon has reduced the price of the BLUEAIR Air Purifiers to $159.99, from its original price of $229.99.</a> This is a $70 discount, or approximately a 30% savings.</p>
<p>BLUEAIR Air Purifiers can help you remove pollen, pet dander, smoke and many other airborne particles through its HEPA filtration system. It’s the perfect home option for getting rid of all those pesky allergens in your house that make you wake up sniffling, affect your asthma, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6664/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An air purifier that takes cleaning your air seriously</h2>
<p>This particular unit goes way beyond the ones you’d find at stores like Target or Walmart, with a markedly improved filtration system that can get down to the nitty gritty and rid small to large areas of those little nasties you’re breathing in every day.</p>
<p>Plus, replacing the filter is super simple. When it is time to replace the filter, the unit alerts you so you can easily replace it. Replacing the filter regularly keeps the unit performing optimally by allowing the air purifier to continue to draw in particles efficiently.</p>



<p>If you’re running one of these air purifiers, you can feel a bit better about doing your part to breathe easily and not worry about doing much harm to the environment. There are several ways having unclean air in your home can adversely affect your health, from dredging up asthma issues you might not be aware you have to aggravating sicknesses that could be floating around.</p>
<p>You may not realize it, but there are so many particulates floating around at any time in your home that it can be difficult to cleanse everything. It’s a good idea to do so, however, as breathing in pathogens, allergens, and even pet dander is hard on the respiratory system. You also never know what kind of potential germs are floating around your home, possibly getting you sick.</p>
<p>Let’s recap. With their efficient filtration, quiet operation, and easy maintenance, the BLUEAIR Air Purifiers help to give you a cleaner home environment for you and your family. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6664/">For this lowest price (30% off), you definitely don’t want to miss out, either.</a> You’re likely dealing with a dusty room or home as it is, so get something that’s actually affordable to give your home surroundings a fighting chance at improving the air inside. When you’re relaxing on the couch at home instead of struggling with allergies, you’ll see how good of an idea this buy is.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-tuf-27-gaming-monitor-drops-to-all-time-low-to-compete-with-samsung-odyssey-2000656520</link>
            <guid>1397254</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Want to add a new monitor to your technology arsenal? Whether you are a serious gamer or someone looking into serious gaming, a good gaming monitor is a key part of your arsenal. We’ve found one that you can both save a significant amount of money on and also experience some fantastically deep immersion with.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5755/">Thanks to Amazon, you can pick up the ASUS TUF Gaming 27” 1440P HDR Monitor for only $179 which is a $70 discount (28% off) compared to the monitors’ normal price of $249.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5755/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A hardy monitor that’s great for any home office or gaming setup</h2>
<p>The ASUS TUF Gaming 27” 1440P HDR Monitor combines a 27” QHD (2560 x 1440) Fast IPS panel with a super-fast 180Hz refresh rate into a monitor designed to bring a high level of smoothness and clarity to your gaming action. A 1ms gray-to-gray response time along with support for HDR visuals help to ensure your games remain clear even as the action increases. Adaptive sync technology can help eliminate stuttering or tearing while maintaining a smooth frame pace so you don’t have to worry about a sluggish picture.</p>
<p>This monitor also has FreeSync Premium and G-Sync compatibility to allow your graphics card to match frame output to the panel’s refresh rate. ASUS’ Extreme Low Motion Blur Sync is a feature that combines with variable refresh rate technology by utilizing backlight strobe to eliminate ghosting while maintaining smooth motion. The result is a clearer picture of fast moving objects, detailed game worlds, and detailed HUD elements when you are panning or tracking around in-game.</p>



<p>The Fast IPS panel used in the monitor can cover 130% of the sRGB color space and support HDR10 content. That means you’ll get brighter highlights, darker shadows, and more vivid colors than a standard SDR monitor. The 2560 x 1440 native resolution also gives more real estate than 1080p.</p>
<p>ASUS also includes GamePlus and GameVisual preset modes, which let you switch between different visual profiles and on-screen overlays optimized for the type of content you are viewing. Using DisplayWidget Center allows you to access and control monitor settings from your computer rather than having to go back and forth switching between on-screen menu options and physically adjusting monitor controls.</p>
<p>When taken together, these specifications combine to make a 27-inch gaming monitor that offers a balance of high-quality QHD resolution, ultra-high refresh rates and helpful customization capabilities at a price that won’t break the bank. So if you’re truly looking for quality that you don’t have to compromise on, this might very well be the monitor you add to your setup. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5755/">At the very least, grab it while it’s discounted because someone in your brood may want it other than you.</a></p>

            <guid>1397224</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Would Microsoft secretly be happier if people stopped buying the Xbox entirely? Would you risk breaking a $2,000 Samsung Galaxy Z Fold to chase a high score? And why was <em>League of Legends</em> unplayable for so many people over the weekend? You’ve stumbled onto another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>Welcome to the first full week of 2026, where I am obsessed with the idea that the first act in <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> might have been even longer. Creative director Igor Sarzyński <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/srznsk.bsky.social/post/3mbokwdsals27">explains why that would have been a terrible idea</a>. “It’s like saying we should spend more time on Tatooine with farmer Luke before he got involved with all this Jedi stuff.” RIP Jackie.</p>

 <h2>Not selling Xboxes must be intentional at this point</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sales of Xbox consoles were down 39% in the UK during 2025, making it comfortably the worst year on record for Xbox consoles. With the return of favourite Xbox franchises in 2026, might things improve this year?</p> <p>— Christopher Dring (@Chris_Dring) <a href="https://twitter.com/Chris_Dring/status/2007156688923836635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 2, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>The Game Business</em>‘ Chris Dring reports that 2025 was “comfortably the worst year on record for Xbox” console sales in the UK. They were down nearly 40 percent from the year prior, which was already far from stellar. I’m not sure how to square Microsoft’s seemingly complete abdication of hardware sales less than five years into the current generation with its promise to continue making consoles in the future.</p>

 <h2><em>League of Legends</em> was completely unplayable yesterday and the reason is very stupid</h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1q4ao9r/per_vandiril_apparently_the_login_issues_were/">According to YouTuber Vandiril</a>, Riot Games forgot to renew the client security certificate for the hit MOBA game. There was a workaround, however. All players had to do to get back into the game was reset their system clock. Maybe it was just the Nexus’ way of telling fans it was time to take a break.</p>

 <h2>Finally, a <em>Flappy Bird</em> made just for folding phones</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Phone companies: We've tested our hinge mechanism for 200,000 folds, so that should cover 5 years of use</p> <p>Users: <a href="https://t.co/jRzjFWB2Hk">https://t.co/jRzjFWB2Hk</a></p> <p>— Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) <a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/2007546884794249262?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 3, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Foldy Bird</em> requires you to physically fold your super-expensive phone over and over again to keep the bird flying through the familiar <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>-style environment. How neat! I still don’t want one.</p>

 <h2>Sega co-founder David Rosen has passed away</h2>   <p>Rosen was integral to the company’s amusement game operation, including the push into coin-operated arcade games like <em>Periscope</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Monaco GP</em>, <a href="https://www.replaymag.com/segas-dave-rosen-passes-on-christmas-day-in-l-a/"><em>RePlay Magazine</em> reports</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> originally began with a cut chapter starring Ashley</h2> <p>That’s according to modder Michael “Thekempy” Kemp who combed the game’s files and restored the lost content. “It would have started with Ashley in the woods at night,” Thekempy explained <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nXI-MrzgZXU?autoplay=1">in a recent video</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-4-remake-cut-an-entire-opening-chapter-that-starred-ashley"><em>Eurogamer</em></a>). “She stumbles upon Los Illuminados in the middle of performing a ritual sacrifice.”</p>

 <h2>Brandon Sanderson’s <em>Mistborn</em> books could become a video game</h2> <p>The prolific fantasy author said multiple AAA game companies have expressed interest in his latest “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nOe7VV5T-hw">State of Sanderson</a>” video (via <em><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/mistborn/brandon-sanderson-mistborn-game">PCGamesN</a></em>). “I’m trying to do things differently this time, in order to retain control of my videogame rights,” he told fans. “I already have interest from some major players in the videogame industry, who I like a lot. So, if you are a decision-maker at a triple-A studio or a major independent, and you’ve always wanted to make a <em>Mistborn</em> or <em>Stormlight</em> game, you would want to contact my reps now.” If someone bites, maybe we’ll see the actual game by 2032.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-donut-smp-server-farm-notch-2000656412">The 10-year journey to falling back in love with <em>Minecraft</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-ai-slop-satya-nadella-2000656473">Microsoft wants you to move beyond calling it AI slop</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-racer-revenge-ps4-ps5-port-hacker-limited-run-2000656482">An obscure<em> Star Wars</em> game is more expensive than ever thanks to a rumored PS5 hack</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

              <p>Just <a href="https://kotaku.com/rainbow-6-siege-hack-billions-dollars-renown-credits-2000655909">a week after&nbsp;Ubisoft finished picking up the pieces</a> of a major <em>Rainbow 6 Siege</em> hack that saw billions of dollars of in-game money handed out to players, the game is in chaos all over again. This time, as spotted by&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/rainbow-six-siege-ubisoft-hacking-report-bans/">TheGamer</a></em>, the alleged infiltrators are issuing illegitimate bans to players. Bans that last for 67 days. Do you see what they did there?</p> <p>On December 27, hackers got into&nbsp;<em>Rainbow 6 Siege</em> and caused all manner of mischief, primarily distributing vast amounts of in-game money, super-expensive items and weapon skins, forcing the game offline as the servers were rolled back to before the attack. At the same time, the game’s Marketplace was taken offline while the team investigated what had gone wrong.</p>

 <p>Now, barely a week later, a new attack is seeing players reporting their accounts are being banned under the category of “Harassment Offense,” with the bans lasting a&nbsp;<em>hilarious</em> 67 days. This became much more widely known once high-profile streamer VarsityGaming found out he was a target of the meme-driven ban <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aenRJudI-bI">during a recent broadcast</a>.</p>

  <p>At the time of writing Ubisoft has not posted to any of its social media accounts to acknowledge the issue on this occasion, despite seemingly being aware of the incident since Sunday, January 4. In fact, <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game">the official X account</a> hasn’t been updated since December 29, when it posted to say queue times were reducing following issues after the previous rollback. There has also been no word from Ubisoft regarding the last attack and the current state of the Marketplace.</p>

 <p>When we asked for further details regarding that previous attack, especially regarding whether Ubisoft knew if the attacks had compromised any player accounts, the company only said, “We’re still investigating what’s happened and can only direct you to the official X account for the game for updates at this time.” That would be the official X account that hasn’t been posted to since.</p>

 <p>At the time of writing,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/status"><em>R6</em> is offline once again</a>, with all formats listing “Degraded” or “Outage” across the board.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000656650" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656650"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656650">© Ubisoft / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>As I suggested <a href="https://kotaku.com/rainbow-6-siege-hack-billions-dollars-renown-credits-2000655909">last week</a>, silence is the&nbsp;<em>worst</em> possible response to such incidents, allowing rumors to spread wildly across X and Reddit. Yet again, the unsubstantiated claim that the <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> source code has been stolen is being circulated around online and accepted by some players as fact. Last time there was delayed communication, it was during the winter break period. This time, five days into the New Year, there’s still been complete silence. The void has allowed a lot of players to vent their frustration through cynical gags.</p>

   <p>This potentially suggests that whatever means the hackers used to get into <em>Siege</em>‘s servers last time around has yet to be plugged, which raises further questions about the game’s overall security and whether players’ account information has been affected. Ubisoft has not yet responded to follow-up requests for comment.</p>

 <p>Either way, an extended series of outages like this is bad news for Ubisoft during such a financially peculiar time, especially after <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/ubisoft-sales-miss-forecasts-as-rainbow-six-siege-glitch-takes-toll-fd2a6519">a previous&nbsp;<em>R6</em> issue significantly harmed earning predictions</a> in mid-2025.</p>
