Well, twice. It’s that often. <em>Tails of Iron 2</em> ensures that your rodent power fantasy can be played out in all its gory glory in this animal-slaying sequel. If you’re interested in this second outing from developer Odd Bug Studio, you’re probably wondering how much of your life is going to be devoted to it. Here’s how long it takes to beat <em>Tails of Iron 2</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195301" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Brutal Gothic Metroidvania Is Shaping up To Be Something Special" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="111" data-playlist="195301,196773,195734" data-current="195301"><div><p>This Brutal Gothic Metroidvania Is Shaping up To Be Something Special</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20762.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h1694"><a id=""></a><strong>How long does it take to beat <em>Tails of Iron 2</em>?</strong></h2><p><em>Tails of Iron 2</em> is that rarer beast: a shorter soulslike. While some may prefer a game that’ll take over your life for the foreseeable, there are many others who just want something they can finish. If your main goal is to mainline to reach the credits of <em>Tales of Iron 2</em>, you can expect it to come in at around <strong>10-12 hours</strong> on its normal “Tails of Iron” difficulty. This makes it reasonably longer than the original game, which could be beaten in about 8 hours.</p><p>Of course, there are also easier and harder difficulties, named “Fairy Tale” and “Bloody Whiskers”, respectively. Depending on which of these you may opt for, your playtime is almost certain to be reduced or extended to some capacity.</p><p>However, as with any soulslike experience, there is more meat on the bones of <em>Tails of Iron 2</em> if you wish to see it. You can go for full completion to snag all trophies or achievements, which will require you to engage with all of the game’s content, including completing all of the hunts, collecting all of the tarot cards, and defeating a certain number of different enemy types.</p><p>If you aim to 100 percent <em>Tails of Iron 2</em>, you can expect your total playtime to land between <strong>15 and 20 hours</strong>. That may not sound like a lot for a soulslike game (especially if you’re used to massive adventures like <em>Elden Ring</em>), but it’s pretty solid for an indie side-scroller that only runs $25.</p><hr><p><em>Tails of Iron 2</em> is available now on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Unlike <em>Pokémon Go</em>, an augmented reality game meant to be played by groups of people wandering outside looking for whimsical creatures, the board game adaptation is mainly a cleverly designed solo skinner box for watching numbers go up as players accrue wealth and real estate. Scopely, which also operates <em>Marvel Strike Force</em> and <em>Star Fleet Strike Command</em>, was purchased by Savvy back in 2023 for nearly $5 billion as the investment company becomes a growing player in the world of games. </p><p>Despite <em>Pokémon Go</em> becoming a household name since its launch back in 2016, Niantic, which grew out of an internal Google startup, has struggled to replicate that success across other franchises and genres. <em>Harry Potter: Wizards Unite</em> arrived in 2019 and shut down just a few years later, while <em>Pikmin Bloom</em> and <em>Monster Hunter Now</em>, despite being fun mobile games, never took off in the same way. It’s unclear what would happen with those under Savvy management. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That isn’t to say it’s pointless. <strong>You <em>can</em> feasibly defeat Lu Bu when you first see him, and it has a significant effect on the rest of the level if you manage to pull it off</strong>. But no matter how you slice it, the only real reason you should fight Lu Bu early on is the satisfaction of telling everyone you meet that you did it.</p><p>There is a bit more to all of this, though.

You’re quite silly to try. But since you’re here, if you want to fight Lu Bu come hell or high water, here are a few tips to help you claim victory:</p><p>1: All of Lu Bu’s attacks have elaborate telegraphs. For example, it’s impossible to miss when he jumps into the air and gets ready to use his dive attack, and the timing to perfect dodge it is the same every time. Conversely, Lu Bu leaves himself open after he finishes his attacks, which gives you windows to start piling on damage before you need to watch out for his next move.</p><p>2: You might get tripped up by Lu Bu’s two unique attacks that start with him swinging his halberd in front of him. Normally, he’ll attack twice in a row, so the safest move is to dodge away to avoid the second attack. However, if he glows red, he’ll only take a single swing. Use this to your advantage.</p><p>3: Lu Bu’s most difficult attack to dodge is his bow and arrow move. Lu Bu will attack twice in a wide-reaching cone in front of him, and after a delay he’ll launch one final attack at you. Since you can stagger Lu Bu during this attack, you’ll ideally want to use a skill like Palm Strike so you don’t have to worry about dodging at all. However, if that’s not possible, using a quick special move (like Palm Strike, actually) after you dodge the first strike will interrupt the dodge roll animation, allowing you to immediately dodge the second part of the attack. From there, Lu Bu will finish the attack about 2.5 seconds later.</p><p>If you’d like a visual aid, an especially handsome writer uploaded his first clear of this fight on Hero difficulty, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/dynasty-warriors-origins-goaded-me-into-spending-an-hour-trying-to-beat-lu-bu-then-gave-me-nothing-for-winning-and-i-loved-it/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/dynasty-warriors-origins-goaded-me-into-spending-an-hour-trying-to-beat-lu-bu-then-gave-me-nothing-for-winning-and-i-loved-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as seen on PC Gamer</a></span>. You can check out the video for yourself below:</p><h2 id="h1692"><a id=""></a><strong>What happens if you defeat Lu Bu?</strong></h2><p>If you defeat Lu Bu in the Assassination of Dong Zhuo mission, both Lu Bu and Cao Cao will react to your surprising strength. Lu Bu will retreat, and the entire enemy army will suffer a huge morale loss that will make the rest of the mission a total cakewalk. In other words, you take on a huge challenge at the start to make the rest of the mission easier.</p><p>This is true of Lu Bu’s second appearance in Chapter 2 during the Battle of Hulao Gate mission. Normally, Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei will hold off Lu Bu shortly after he appears. However, if you defeat Lu Bu here, Liu Bei’s party can rejoin the main battle and you won’t have to worry about how long they can fend off the beast of a man. So, again, a huge challenge so you can make the rest of the mission easier.</p><figure id="" data-id="8ac66eb86200cb93385d014610fd28b0" data-recommend-id="image://8ac66eb86200cb93385d014610fd28b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from Dynasty Warriors Origins.

This will only ding on <em>this </em>mission specifically, so beating Lu Bu during the Assassination of Dong Zhuo mission <strong>will not</strong> unlock it.</p><p>That said, <strong>not only can you go back to this mission during the postgame of <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>, you’ll need to beat Lu Bu here on a postgame-exclusive difficulty setting to unlock one of the strongest weapons in the game</strong>.</p><hr><p>While there aren’t compelling rewards for beating Lu Bu early on beyond the sheer satisfaction and achivement, it is a good opportunity to get some practice in against him. You <em>will </em>have to fight Lu Bu later on, and these earlier appearances have simpler movesets that you can study and learn. This will make future Lu Bu encounters go a little smoother, since you can focus on dodging the stuff you’ve memorized while you pay attention to the new tricks he has up his sleeve. You can also choose to lower the difficulty or level up if Lu Bu is giving you trouble too, so play your way and don’t stress out about missing anything important!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
