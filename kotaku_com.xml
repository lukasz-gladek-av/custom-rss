              <p>Don’t worry, podracing fans. While <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer’</em>s debut trailer didn’t feature any podracers, the iconic fast-moving space chariots will be a part of the full game.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/former-burnout-devs-star-wars-racing-game-galactic-racer-2000652809">Announced last year at the Game Awards</a>, <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> is an upcoming racing game set in that galaxy far, far away. <em>Galactic Racer</em> is being developed by some former <em>Burnout</em> devs at Fuse Games, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-criterion-leaders-set-up-new-aaa-games-studio-fuse-games">a new studio created in 2023</a>. The game looks awesome and features Sebulba at the very end of its teaser trailer. However, there was not a single podracing vehicle to be seen in that first teaser, which had fans like me worried that we wouldn’t get to recreate the best part of 1999’s <em>The Phantom Menace,</em> aka the podracing scene. Thankfully, there will indeed be podracers in <em>Galactic Racer.&nbsp;</em></p> <p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/the-outer-rim-is-your-highway-in-star-wars-galactic-racer-but-its-more-than-burnout-in-space-you-cant-make-a-star-wars-racing-experience-and-not-have-podracing/">In a recent interview with <em>Gamesradar</em>,</a> &nbsp;Fuse Games CEO and co-founder Matt Webster told the outlet that yes, of course podracing will be a part of the studio’s <em>Star Wars</em> racing game.</p>  <p id="6d1737fa-b5a4-42f5-8eb9-7604d114ba62">“You can’t really make a <em>Star Wars</em> racing experience and not have podracing, can you?” said Webster. “The core fantasy of the game is becoming an elite racing pilot in the Galactic League, and podracing is a pinnacle of speed and racing in the <em>Star Wars</em> galaxy.”</p>

 <p>“However, when we set out to create <em>Galactic Racer,</em> we wanted to do more – to lean into multiple vehicle types and multiple expressions of speed to give players a breadth of experiences. <em>Galactic Racer</em> offers players the ability to pilot vehicles they know and love, alongside ones they won’t have experienced before, across a range of solo and multiplayer modes.”</p> <p>More good news: <em>Galactic Racer</em> will feature the option to drive around in first-person, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-star-wars-episode-i-racer-remaster-is-a-little-ugl-1844206400">which is my preferred way to play podracing games</a>.&nbsp;Now, I just need Webster or someone else at Fuse Games to confirm the Boonta Eve Classic race course featured in past podracing games, like<em> Star Wars Racer’s Revenge,</em> will be playable in <em>Galactic Racer</em>, and I’ll be a happy wookkiee when the game arrives on consoles and PC later this year.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/crunchyroll-price-increase-us-fan-tier-march-streaming-anime-2000665126</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Bad news for anime fans: Popular streaming service Crunchyroll has announced another price increase across all of its tiers, including its cheapest “Fan Tier.” Subscribers will have to pay between $12 and $24 extra a year starting next month. Just one of many services that’s getting more and more expensive.</p> <p>On February 2, <a href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/announcements/2026/2/2/crunchyroll-updates-membership-pricing-to-give-fans-more-of-what-they-love">Crunchyroll announced</a> that all three of its streaming tiers ( Fan, Mega Fan, and Ultimate Fan) are getting price increases in the United States on March 4. Here’s what’s changing:</p> <ul> <li>Fan Tier – $9 a month (was $8)</li> <li>Mega Fan Tier – $14 a month (was $12)</li> <li>Ultimate Fan Tier – $18 a month (was $16)</li> </ul> <p>According to Crunchyroll, this is the first time since 2019 that the anime-on-demand service has raised the price of the Fan tier in the U.S. <a href="https://kotaku.com/crunchyroll-price-increase-mega-ultimate-fan-tiers-1851449985">Last time the service raised prices</a> in 2024, the increase didn’t affect the cheapest option, the Fan tier. But that’s not the case this time with next month’s price hike.</p>

 <h2>Why Crunchyroll’s price is going up in March</h2> <p>In an effort to help explain the price increase, Crunchyroll listed some features it’s working on adding or has already recently added to the service. These include profiles for teens, the ability to skip intros and credits, and support for multiple profiles.</p> <p>That’s nice, and I imagine Crunchyroll subscribers have been wanting some of these features for a bit now and are happy to have them or to be getting them in the near future. It doesn’t change that these days it feels like every app, service, subscription, and website is going up in price while not really offering much in exchange.</p>

 <p>Ubisoft recently announced it is raising prices on <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-big-shake-up-just-dance-price-increase-fans-screwed-2000663578">Just Dance’</a></em>s streaming service. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604">Xbox Game Pass</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-price-increase-ps-plus-canada-mexico-ps5-tariffs-1851776655">PlayStation Plus keep going up</a>. PC parts and <a href="https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448">other tech</a> are<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-10-biggest-gaming-disappointments-worst-news-game-key-cards-gta-6-delay-2000655356#:~:text=Playing%20Video%20Games%20Is%20Becoming%20A%20Very%20Expensive%20Hobby"> getting pricier and pricier.</a> In January, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/carlquintanilla.bsky.social/post/3mdvoguff622z">new data showed</a> that the cost of items sold online has reached a higher point in the past month that at any time in the last 12 years. Welcome to the future: It costs a lot to own anything and just about as much to rent or stream it. Thanks, AI hyperscalers, greedy execs, and tariffs.</p>

              <p><span>The largest manga piracy site in the world, BATO.TO, and “approximately 60 related sites” have been shut down, following a joint operation between the Shanghai Public Security Bureau of China and Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.</span></p> <p><span>As spotted by </span><a href="https://news.web.nhk/newsweb/na/na-k10015037931000"><i><span>NHK</span></i></a><span>, this news comes </span><a href="https://coda-cj.jp/en/news/830/"><span>via a report</span></a><span> from the Japanese Content Overseas Distribution Organisation, also known as CODA, indicating that the home of a man “alleged to have operated the world’s largest manga piracy site” had been searched. Although the suspect in question, who was arrested on suspicion of copyright infringement, was detained on November 19, 2025, CODA’s report states that the BATO group of sites “continued limited operation” until January 19, at which point they confirmed that “all 60” of BATO.TO sites had shut down.</span></p>

 <p><span>The statement notes that the 60 sites combined pulled in an estimated 350 million visits in May 2025 alone, and alleges that the “resulting economic impact” supposedly “amounts to approximately 770 billion yen.” That’s just shy of 5 billion USD.</span></p> <p><span>This absurdly large loss matches up with a </span><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/piracy-of-japanese-games-and-anime-has-tripled-over-the-past-3-years-government-acknowledges-need-to-expand-legitimate-global-distribution-channels/"><span>recently published report</span></a><span> from Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which estimated that Japanese anime, manga, and video game piracy resulted in 5.7 trillion yen (roughly 37 billion USD) of damage in 2025. </span><span>CODA states that their investigation “was initiated following requests from Japanese publishers,” including several prominent video game publishers such as Square Enix and Kadokawa Corporation, the latter of whom entered into a “strategic capital and business alliance” with Sony </span><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sony-to-become-largest-shareholder-of-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-corporation"><span>in December 2024</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>CODA also states that China Literature Limited, a subsidiary of Tencent Holdings, cooperated with the investigation “as part of its international collaboration efforts to strengthen the effectiveness of anti-piracy measures.”</span></p> <p><span>Funnily enough, the official BATO.TO mod team noted on the r/Batoto subreddit that a new clone of the site popped up on January 20, a day after “the closure of all 60 sites had been confirmed” by CODA. The original BATO.TO mod team notes in their post that they “have not been in contact with the original developers, have not been notified that the new site is legitimate, and cannot confirm any claims circulating online.”</span></p>

              <p><span>Mark Gerhard, the co-CEO of </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>developer Build a Rocket Boy, has issued a “formal cease and desist demand” against YouTuber Cyber Boi in the official </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>Discord server, accusing him of “media manipulation, espionage, [and] sabotage,” and of “interference targeting” Build a Rocket Boy.</span></p> <p><span>Gerhard’s message was posted in Discord roughly 18 minutes after Cyber Boi released a video titled “Leslie Benzies is in the Epstein Files,” which the YouTuber says he later removed over the threat of “escalated legal action.” Prior to directing </span><i><span>MindsEye</span></i><span>, Benzies was a longtime producer at Rockstar Games on the </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span> series, ultimately leaving in 2016 after two decades at the company.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>On January 30, the Department of Justice released more than 3 million new files related to convicted child sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The newly released files contained several revelations, such as the fact that Epstein emailed 4chan links containing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jeffrey-epstein-five-nights-at-freddys-porn-via-4chan-links-emails-show-2000664667"><i><span>Five Nights at Freddy’s</span></i><span> porn</span></a><span> to his ex-girlfriend and that he was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/emails-reveal-jeffrey-epstein-was-banned-from-xbox-live-2000664660"><span>banned from Xbox Live</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p>As reported by <i><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/leslie-benzies-accused-sexual-assault-in-epstein-files/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Insider Gaming</a></i>, the new batch of Epstein files also included a reference to Leslie Benzies, founder and co-CEO of Build a Rocket Boy and former president of Rockstar North.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000665110" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665110"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665110">Discord / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>On January 31 </span><a href="https://imgbox.com/hv7Asive"><span>at 8:44 a.m. ET</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>content creator Cyber Boi released a video discussing the details of an Epstein victim’s alleged encounter with Benzies. On the same day, </span><a href="https://imgbox.com/G99XP2Dx"><span>at 9:02 a.m. ET</span></a><span>, Mark Gerhard, co-CEO of Build a Rocket Boy, issued this “cease and desist” notice in the official </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>Discord server, and tagged Cyber Boi’s official Discord account in the message.</span></p>

 <p><span>Users on Cyber Boi’s official Discord server noticed that the video in question had disappeared at roughly 9:37 a.m. ET. As Cyber Boi </span><a href="https://imgbox.com/I3uZXBMt"><span>later clarified</span></a><span>, “I took it down, they threatened legal action. Can’t be arsed with the drama of it all.” Several of Cyber Boi’s other videos were also taken down from his channel, including one in which he interviewed a disgruntled former member of Build a Rocket Boy’s development team.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Mark Gerhard was also at the center of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/leslie-benzies-ex-gta-producer-mindseye-fail-saboteurs-1851785617"><span>another </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>Discord server drama</span></a><span> back in May 2025, when he stated that there was a “concerted effort” by some unknown figure to spread negative rumours about the game, and that he believed “there are bot farms posting negative comments and dislikes.”</span></p> <p><span>Gerhard and Benzies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.&nbsp;</span></p>
