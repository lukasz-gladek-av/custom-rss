I think we increased production runs on it 4x pre-release. It was substantially by many, many very high double-digit percentages ahead of any other production run we’ve ever done, and we left the market wanting more.”</p><p>That might come as a surprise to fans who have struggled to find <em>MTG</em> booster packs and Commander decks for the <em>Final Fantasy</em> set, with stock selling out during advance pre-order periods and then being marked up over MSRP at some locations by the time it hit store shelves. But critics who sometimes claim that Wizards of the Coast artificially limits supply to drive hype and engagement should be happy to know that the company intends to keep selling new <em>Final Fantasy </em>stock for a while yet. </p><p>“Our expectation is there’s going to be a nice long tail of backlist for the product. Likewise, we’re still selling <em>Lord of the Rings</em> product today,” Cocks said. “So even though we hit $200 million in December of ‘22 for<em> Lord of the Rings</em>, we sold a substantial percentage of that in the several years following and we expect <em>Final Fantasy</em> to be no different. It’s partially what’s powering our backlist, which already in, like, five and a half months in the year did more than we’ve ever done in any year prior.” Hasbro chief financial officer Gina Goetter added, “We’re continuing to produce this set. We think the set itself is going to have a huge long tail.” </p><p>While the rarest and most expensive cards in the set were only available in Collector Boosters, the initial print run of which is basically all sold out, regular cards in the set will continue to become available and hopefully drive down prices on some of the more sought-after standard cards. One of those is Vivi Ornitier, a mythic Legendary Creature from<em> Final Fantasy IX</em>. It’s a powerful card that synergizes well with lots of mana-hungry, spell-based decks and has been hovering around $45 for weeks now. Other examples include Knights of the Round and Bahamut summons. Unlike with standard <em>MTG</em> sets, fan interest in the cards for their own sakes, combined with their limited availability, is currently fueling <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/golden-chocobo-mtg-final-fantasy-price-foil-restock-1851784836&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/golden-chocobo-mtg-final-fantasy-price-foil-restock-1851784836">a particularly brutal reseller market for collectors</a></span>. </p><p>One upside is that those who just want to have fun playing with the cards can collect them much more cheaply in<em> Magic The Gathering Arena</em>, the video game adaptation for PC and mobile. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-4-d-d-mtg-arena-commander-g-i-joe-1851703869&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-4-d-d-mtg-arena-commander-g-i-joe-1851703869">It’s due for an update at some point in the future</a></span>, though Cocks also noted that the app only accounts for a small slice of the current fanbase. “Only 15-or-so percent of the player base plays on something like <em>Arena</em>,” he said. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-mtg-magic-gathering-vivi-stock-1851786817]]></content:encoded>

Monolith Soft’s flagship RPG series has consistently pushed the limits of Nintendo’s hardware, cramming massive and lush worlds into hardware that’s roughly a generation behind the home console competition. The results are typically impressive, if not a bit compromised. <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em> in particular could suffer from some dips in image quality due to dynamic resolution scaling, and performance wouldn’t necessarily hold at 30 FPS either.</p><p>I’m not 100% sure these issues are <em>totally </em>smoothed over after watching <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 2</em> run on my Switch 2 with my naked eye, but they’re at least greatly minimized. Overall, the experience is just better on the new hardware. The resolution doesn’t appear to dip in the game’s usual trouble spots, and the frame rate didn’t take noticeable hits either. I do hope the <em>Xenoblade</em> series can get proper Switch 2 upgrades, as the game could clearly look way sharper if it wasn’t capped at such a low resolution (especially in handheld mode).

That said, the remake of the game <em>is</em>, and it didn’t always hold at a 60 FPS throughout its runtime on the original Switch. This is most noticeable in the game’s opening, but you can feel the occasional slowdown elsewhere too.</p><p>Fortunately, the Switch 2 smooths over these trouble spots effortlessly. Between the remaster of <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door </em>and the all new <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>, the past few years have been great for <em>Mario </em>RPG fans. That latter title benefits from the Switch 2 hardware too! If you’ve never tried these quirky adventures, you’re in for a treat whether you’re a casual gamer or a hardcore RPG nut.</p><h2 id="h579740"><a id=""></a>5: <em>Bayonetta 3</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="bdda8603fb00605e4e0d7511a7755052" data-recommend-id="image://bdda8603fb00605e4e0d7511a7755052" data-format="jpg" data-width="2550" data-height="1434" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A promotional screenshot of Bayonetta 3.

However, in a fast-paced action game like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bayonetta-3-review-ending-luka-jeanne-nintendo-switch-1849735230&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bayonetta-3-review-ending-luka-jeanne-nintendo-switch-1849735230"><em>Bayonetta 3</em></a></span>, you’ll <em>really </em>feel the difference that extra frames can offer. On the original Switch, <em>Bayonetta 3 </em>generally targeted 60 FPS but usually didn’t hit it. Instead, the game would hover in the 50 FPS range and could drop <em>way </em>lower during certain attack animations. It’s not unplayable by any means, but obviously there’s room for improvement.</p><p>Which is <em>exactly </em>what <em>Bayonetta 3</em> on the Switch 2 serves up. Not only do you get those smooth 60-FPS graphics (where it’s possible in the game), but the Switch 2 even fixes some audio desync bugs that could pop up in the original sometimes. Load times are way faster too. If we weren’t limiting this list to Switch-exclusive games, <em>Bayonetta 3</em> would still be one of the most improved games on Nintendo’s next generation hardware.</p><p>As was the case with <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>, it would still be nice for <em>Bayonetta 3</em> to get a proper Switch 2 upgrade. If nothing else, the visuals would pop if the resolution was raised, especially in handheld mode. But even if that never comes to pass, there’s no denying that <em>Bayonetta 3</em> is better than it’s ever been before.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-games-run-better-upgrade-bayonetta-hyrule-xeno-1851786809]]></content:encoded>

Signing up in 2020, she said the relationship was ideal since it allowed her to maintain her privacy and focus on streaming as Ironmouse while the agency handled the business side of things. That seemed to go fine until recently, when VShojo allegedly stopped paying out funds it owed to the Vtuber and the charities she had supported. </p><p>“I believe that I am owed a significant amount of funds which I have not been paid,” Ironmouse said. “And most importantly, the Immune Deficiency Foundation is owed over half a million dollars from VShojo. I really wish that I could tell you more, but right now I have been advised to wait for legal proceedings.

Ironmouse said she’s helped raise over $4 million for the organization over the years, with last year’s subathon expected to donate an additional $515,000 in money paid directly by fans through Twitch. While that money has allegedly never been paid out, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://tiltify.com/@ironmouse/ironmouse&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://tiltify.com/@ironmouse/ironmouse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new Tiltify campaign</a></span> with a goal of $1 million for the foundation has already raised over $850,000. </p><p>VShojo did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p>Ironmouse isn’t the only Vtuber currently speaking out against the agency. “I have been lied to from the company a lot about the situation,” Vtuber Kson <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/cBxw80mZoWI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/cBxw80mZoWI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently said</a></span>. “My payments stopped last September.

Users will be notified of their involvement via email and can opt in or out of the beta. One big feature being added in the update is the ability to have your PS5 controller sync up to multiple devices and switch between them quickly, no resyncing needed. It’s a nifty feature present on current-gen Xbox controllers and will make it easy to use your PS5 gamepad wirelessly on both your PC and console. But the more interesting news is an upcoming PS5 feature Sony is calling “Power Saver.” </p><p>Power Saver won’t be active in the beta, but will go live for everyone in the future. If users turn the optional feature on, the PS5 console will “scale back performance” while playing certain games in order to lower its power consumption. If games don’t support the feature, it won’t kick in. </p><p>Sony doesn’t go into great detail about what “scale back performance” means, but it does mention in some small print text at the bottom of the post that Power Saver won’t support VR games and that some “gameplay features may be limited.” To me, that seems to imply that you won’t be able to run some games at higher framerates when using Power Saver. And because VR demands high framerates to work, that would make Power Saver unusable. I also wonder if we might see some games turn off raytracing or other intense visual options when Power Saver is activated. </p><p>“At [Sony Interactive Entertainment], we are committed to Sony’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/csr/eco/RoadToZero/gm_en.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/csr/eco/RoadToZero/gm_en.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">‘Road to Zero’ environmental plan</a></span>, launched in 2010, which includes achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2040,” said Sony in the blog post. “We are always exploring how we can contribute to these goals through our products and services.”</p><p>Sony says it will share more details in the near future about Power Saver mode and how it will impact games as we get closer to the option going live. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ps5-feature-power-saver-limit-performance-beta-update-1851786790]]></content:encoded>

However, while some rewards were rebalanced to be more in-line with the Chinese version, the patch doesn’t do anything on top of that to compensate for the accelerated schedule, nor does it implement higher chances to pull rare characters in the game’s gacha systems. A major point of contention is that characters are not being added to standard banner (basically the baseline pool of characters you can get when rolling for new Phantom Thieves to add to your party) until they have been in the game for six months. According to the stream, this is because the team wants to “act out of consideration for players” who use premium currency to acquire highly sought after characters, which fans have interpreted as the team saying they want to continue to incentivize players to pay up if they want a better chance of getting those characters.</p><p>“Straight up ‘we only care about people who spend money,’” nightoftheghouls <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1m78qnk/truly_a_do_you_not_have_phonesor_surprise/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1m78qnk/truly_a_do_you_not_have_phonesor_surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on Reddit</a></span>. “You aren’t supposed to say the quiet part out loud guys.”</p><p>What remains to be seen is if this will be standard procedure for the game moving forward, or if it’s just being applied to some characters released in the game’s first month while the devs continue to adjust its monetization and release roadmap. Fans worry this might make the game a bigger money and time investment while the accelerated rollout is still in place, and create a grindier game with less payoff.</p><p>“So now not only do we have an insane release pace of new characters, we will not be able to get any of the ‘Standard’ characters going forward until at least 5 months from now?” N0tZekken <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1m783mr/the_12_livestream_didnt_tackle_any_real_problem/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/personaphantomx/comments/1m783mr/the_12_livestream_didnt_tackle_any_real_problem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote in another Reddit thread</a></span>. “Keep in mind that they can actually pull it off for every new character, and they could actually make it worse. What’s preventing them from increasing this to a year if sales are not satisfactory? Wouldn’t be the first time we’ve been lied to in the face by Sega/Atlus.”</p><p>The comments on the live stream VOD are filled with similar disappointment, with several viewers expressing the idea that if the game were to just roll out exactly as it did in China, many of their issues would be fixed. But for now, non-Chinese players are dealing with an accelerated, FOMO-driven game that’s been changed in ways that offer no real benefit. Well, none for players, at least. Atlus stands to gain a lot by forcing players into situations where spending real-world money is the easiest fix. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/persona-5-phantom-x-livestream-marian-review-bomb-gacha-1851786799]]></content:encoded>
