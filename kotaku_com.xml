            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re in the market for a new laptop, be it your a student, a small business owner, or just someone who’d like to access the internet on something other than your phone, turn your attention to this Dell Inspiron 15. It’s got touchscreen controls and comes with some free accessories. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4301/">Amazon has it listed at $3,000, but is currently marked down to just $880. That’s a whopping 71% discount equating to a savings of $2,120</a>. That sounds too good to be true?</p>
<p>Well, before you get too excited, most things that sound too good to be true generally are. If we look at the price history of this laptop bundle, it’s only been listed on Amazon for about a month. After just a few days, it shot down in price to $900, back up to full price for one day, then dropped again to where it is now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4301/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>So what’s going on here? Some sellers like to artificially inflate the list price and then immediately mark it down so it get that big red shiny button that says “Limited time deal” next to a huge percentage discount. Truthfully, when looking at the specs of this computer, it’s not worth nearly $3,000. The discounted price is way more reasonable for what your getting, even when considering the bonus gifts.</p>
<p>What we have here is a 15.6-inch laptop from Dell with a touchscreen display, allowing you to operate it like either a laptop or a tablet. It displays in 1080p HD. The machine is powered by an Intel 10-core i5 processor with an integrated graphics card. It’s packed with 64GB of RAM plus a full 2TB of storage on its SSD. It comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro.</p>



<p>As far as connectivity is concerned, the Dell Inspiron 15 is equipped with a USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C port, one USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A port, and a standard USB 2.0 Type-A port. You can also connect an SD card through the SD card reader to either expand your storage or access camera photos. The HDMI 1.4 slot allows you to connect to a second display. Plus, you get a headphone jack.</p>
<h2>Bonus Gifts</h2>
<p>The seller has thrown in some extra goodies you may find useful to you. With the laptop, you’ll also get a set of webcam covers, a cleaning cloth, and USB port covers. Those are just meh in my opinion, but it does also come with a laptop sleeve, a USB flash drive. and a stylus pen for the touchscreen. Those you might actually end up using.</p>

              <p>It’s fun to dive into LEGO Star Wars or Harry Potter sets but once they’re built, many people hesitate to actually play with them. They often feel more like display pieces than toys. That’s why every LEGO fan should have a brick box filled with hundreds of colorful pieces: It’s the foundation for pure creativity, letting you build, rebuild, and invent completely new ideas without limits.</p>
<p>Right now, Amazon is offering the LEGO “medium” brick box at its lowest price ever: I<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4299/">nstead of paying the usual $34, you can get it for just $17</a>, which is two times cheaper than on the official LEGO site where it’s still full price. And if you want to go bigger, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4300/">a larger 790‑piece brick box is also on sale at Amazon for just $39 instead of $59</a>.</p>

<h2>Endless Possibilities for Play and Imagination</h2>
<p>What is so special about this brick box is that it gets at the very essence of LEGO: <strong>open-ended building</strong>. With 484 pieces in 35 colors for the medium size and 790 pieces for the large box, you’ve got everything you need to get your imagination going, from windows and toy eyes to tires with wheel rims, perfect for cars, trains, or whatever your imagination comes up with. Even the green baseplate, well over 3 by 6 inches in size, is included, giving young children (and let’s be honest here, adults as well) a firm base upon which to build.</p>



<p>And it’s not all about chucking bricks around willy-nilly. The variety of pieces in this box enables kids to craft small animals like the tiger figure that is provided, motor vehicles with movable wheels, or even small houses with window cutouts. This assortment has been designed by LEGO to be compatible with their other sets so you’re not locked into one theme. You can add these pieces to any LEGO world you currently have, opening up possibilities without limit. That’s a <strong>big reason why this set gets a 4.8 rating out of 5 from more than 53,000 customers repeatedly</strong>.</p>
<p>Once the playtime entertainment is over, the entire set goes into storage <strong>within the durable storage box</strong>. Instead of bricks everywhere on the living room floor or on the way, the box is a great storage system. That small feature makes it so much less trouble for adults but it also increases the chances for kids to put their creations away and transport the box with them wherever they go.</p>
<p>For kids, having a creative brick box at home encourages hours of <strong>screen-free creativity play</strong>. It’s the type of toy that can grow up with children and it’s just as fun for grown-ups who are wanting to sit down and build something stress-free.</p>
<p>Since you’re paying half the amount charged on LEGO’s own site, now is the time to grab them while these record-low deals last.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagate-4tb-hard-drive-selling-for-pennies-only-0-02-per-gb-for-lifetime-safe-storage-2000628672</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate-4tb-hard-drive-selling-for-pennies-only-0-02-per-gb-for-lifetime-safe-storage.1308426/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s no argument really: offline storage remains far more reliable and personal than spending month after month on cloud subscriptions. With cloud services such as Google Drive at around $10 a month for 2TB each and every month, the expense adds up quickly.</p>
<p>An external hard drive like this Seagate 4TB HDD does away with that problem at one stroke: Right now,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3869/"> it’s an all-time low price on Amazon for $99 instead of its normal $124, so you’re paying just $0.02 per gigabyte for storage for life</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3869/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Drive Is a Smart Buy</h2>
<p>The Seagate hard drive is simple to describe but does all the right things. Behind the scenes, it <strong>relies on a USB 3.0 port which offers fast transfer speeds, and it’s plug‑and‑play</strong> compatible with Windows laptops and desktops as well as Macs. You don’t have to deal with any time-consuming setup or format processes and it allows you to start dragging and dropping files in mere minutes. Beyond computers, it gets along with gaming consoles like Xbox and PlayStation which gives you an easy way of expanding game storage without needing to replace main drives.</p>



<p>With 4TB capacity, you can store years of photos, home videos, your entire music collection and still have plenty to spare for work documents or even entire game collections. For console players, that might translate to over 100 modern games in a single device without having to erase older games constantly as the new ones are added.</p>
<p><strong>And then consider the long-term cost advantage</strong>: Paying around $10 per month for 2TB of online cloud storage (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-cloud-storage">check out a guide here</a>) means within twelve months you’ve paid more than this 4TB Seagate drive costs. <strong>With the physical drive, you’re only paying for it once</strong>. And on top of that, you retain full ownership of your files, with no worry about renewal subscriptions, cost hikes, or company closures.</p>
<p>Saving documents offline on a hard drive keeps sensitive data away from online threats: Your private photos, finances, or personal archives aren’t floating around in a cloud storage facility that you don’t fully control with the Seagate hard drive. And if the drive does fail, Seagate offers a one‑year Rescue Data Recovery Service, so you’ve got another safeguard against mishaps or unexpected failure.</p>
<p>Currently selling for $99, this Seagate 4TB external hard drive is one of those deals the more you consider it. If you’re tired of having to keep free plans restricted or raising the cost of subscriptions, paying only $0.02 per GB for lifetime storage is a great opportunity.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/surface-laptop-256gb-snapdragon-x-plus-just-took-a-big-price-cut-microsoft-is-going-all-in-2000628252</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/surface-laptop-256gb-snapdragon-x-plus-just-took-a-big-price-cut-microsoft-is-going-all-in.1308423/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft is perhaps best known for its Surface <em>Pro</em> tablets which compete directly with the iPad Pro but its Surface laptop line has been the best way to experience Windows at its finest. If what you need is a thin, light notebook with full Windows 11, current AI-capable Copilot capabilities and good performance, this is an extremely tempting option. The most affordable model with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Plus processor and 256GB storage has now hit an all-time low cost on Amazon: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4298/">It costs $859, a discount from its initial price of $999</a>, which is fantastic considering it was launched less than a year ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4298/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Laptop for the AI Era</h2>
<p>The Surface laptop was designed by Microsoft as part of their <strong>new Copilot+ PC series infused with AI functionality</strong> that brings real-world benefits to routine computing. This model currently on sale at Amazon comes with the Snapdragon X Plus 10-core processor at its core, paired with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. This provides it with a speed where productivity applications and creative burdens are easy, and yet still hold up in terms of power efficiency.</p>



<p>One of the real benefits here is in how the Copilot feature affects everyday life: Recall lets you simply locate documents, e-mails or web pages by backtracking through an activity timeline. With video calls or meetings, Windows Studio Effects powered by Copilot help you declutter your room through noise suppression, better lighting, and a blurred background, which is a lifesaver if meetings extend throughout the day. You <strong>can even read real-time subtitles in 44 languages</strong> while streaming or on a call which makes international communication a seamless process.</p>
<p>Battery life is also a department where this Microsoft laptop takes the lead: With <strong>a 20-hour charge time</strong>, it’s designed to last you all day and more without needing to be plugged in. That’s convenient enough to take with you to work or even on a trip without constantly needing to find plugs to recharge. The paper-thin measurements and 13.8-inch touchscreen screen cap it off, giving you a slim and modern design that still gives you plenty of screen space to do your multitasking. Bright HDR technology ensures clarity whether you’re watching shows.</p>
<p>What also makes this deal noteworthy is how early it comes: The Snapdragon X Plus-based Surface Laptop only entered the market in late 2024, yet we’re already seeing its price dip far below the $1,000 mark.</p>
