            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Popular comedy streaming service and website Dropout, formerly known as College Humor, has become more and more famous online thanks in large part to <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-changer-deja-vu-video-game-dropout-tv-1851449932">its hit show <em>Game Changer</em></a><em>. </em>The series, hosted by Dropout CEO Sam Reich, features comedians playing different, <a href="https://x.com/samreich/status/1953123165384917352">often complex, devious, and hilarious games</a> each episode. It’s a great concept for a show, and I wondered if Dropout would ever make a video game version of its viral sensation. The answer: Yeah, probably!</p> <p>I recently sat down and chatted with Reich as part of a larger interview about <em>Game Change</em>r and how the different games are designed, playtested, and balanced. And during that interview, which will be up at a later date, I had to ask if Reich and others at Dropout had ever contemplated a video game version of any of the streaming service’s shows.</p> <p>“Yeah, for sure,” said Reich during our Zoom interview. He clarified that it would likely be a game based on <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-internet-reacts-to-critical-roles-big-shakeup-2000614488"><em>Dimension 20,</em> the service’s super-popular D&amp;D series</a>, or one based on <em>Game Changer.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>“I think that we would be into that and we’ve talked about it,” explained the Dropout CEO and<em> Game Changer</em> host. “And I think it’s like, at this point, it’s honestly more than anything else, just like a bandwidth issue, which is if we’re going to do it, we want it to feel like us, which means we need to work on it. We’re not going to farm the IP out to some third party. We want it to feel personal. And it needs to be something, therefore, that we’re excited enough about and feels differentiated enough from what’s out there that it feels worth our time.”</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Game Changer Season 7 Trailer [Dropout Exclusive Series]" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1eu0nZh9rfw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>He also admitted that another big barrier to Dropout developing something is just how expensive games are to create and how long it takes to make them.</p> <p>When I asked if Reich had <em>really</em> thought about this much and had some ideas for a <em>Game Changer</em> game, or if it was just a far-off fantasy that might happen, he confirmed that they “definitely have ideas” of what a Dropout game would be, and they are working toward making one.</p> <p>“Part of wanting to develop more of that competency was releasing all of those <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/dejavu-by-dropout-dot-tv">little web games</a> [featured in <em>Game Changer</em>],” said Reich. “Let’s start dabbling, you know, and like, see if we can speak this language at all.”</p> <p>In our interview, Reich sounded very confident that a <em>Game Changer</em> game is coming…one day, adding: “So I would say we probably will do one. And it’s just a question of what and when.”</p> <p><em>Game Changer’</em>s season 7 finale airs exclusively on Dropout on August 11.</p> </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/game-changer-dropout-video-game-sam-reich-interview-dimension-20-2000616708]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Originally released as part of <i>Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence</i>, an augmented version of <i>Snake Eater</i> that hit PS2 the following year, <i>Metal Gear Online</i> was a strange beast. The online take on <i>MGS</i>’ stealth gameplay would receive a few other iterations, with one accompanying <i>Metal Gear Solid 4</i>, another a part of the PSP titles <i>Portable Ops</i> and <i>Peace Walker</i>, and lastly with <i>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</i>. (Let’s not talk about <a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-survive-the-kotaku-review-1823584276"><i>Survive</i></a>. It doesn’t count.) For me, <i>MGO</i> was at its best in the version that accompanied <i>MGS4</i>, but in all the iterations I played, <i>MGO</i> remained something special, a celebration of <i>MGS</i>’ tendency to be a little goofy and, of course, an engaging multiplayer stealth game when it (and the players) wanted it to be.</p> <p><i>MGO</i> arguably ushered in a new perspective for <i>Metal Gear</i> as it forced the series to adopt a now-standard moveable 3D camera that pivots around the character. Prior to its release, <i>MGS</i> used fixed camera angles, usually in a top-down or isometric perspective. That perspective wasn’t ideal for a multiplayer game. At the same time, <i>MGS</i> is far from a fast-paced shooter. It’s slower, encouraging a more methodical approach even if you’re responding to threats with lethal force. And that’s one aspect that made both traditional, single-player <i>MGS</i> and its online offshoots so special. Some modes of <i>MGO</i> encouraged a relatively hectic play style. Others, meanwhile, were almost entirely about stealth. Take “Sneaking MIssion,” in which one player would take on the role of Snake as he stealthfully tried to knock out and steal dog tags from other players. Trying to stay hidden from actual flesh-and-blood players offered a kind of thrill that was quite distinct from what you’d get in the single-player games.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="MGO2 PC (2023): SNEAKING MISSION WINS #1" src="about:blank" width="1227" height="690" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e7f3K0eKi8c"></iframe></p> <p>Naturally, being a <i>Metal Gear </i>game, cardboard boxes, naughty magazines, exaggerated death screams, the ability to play as characters from the series, and more made the game feel like an appropriately absurd celebration of what so many of us love about these games. <i>MGS</i>’ charm was and is never about one singular thing. It’s the sum of all of its wildly eccentric parts. That carried through in the various online modes it received over the years. I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/DRuouKk3TiY">just look at this nonsense</a>. Where else would you see something like this?</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Goodbye Metal Gear Online 2" src="about:blank" width="1227" height="690" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DRuouKk3TiY"></iframe></p> <p>Modders have recently made incredible strides <a href="https://mgo2pc.com/">in their efforts</a> to <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqyQtjok9Qk">resurrect the <i>MGS4</i> iteration of <i>Metal Gear Online </i>on PC</a>, so this experience is not totally lost to time. And technically you can still play <i>MGSV</i>’s online mode, though every time I’ve tried recently, I spend more time waiting for a match than I do playing. I also never cared for its class-based character selection.</p> <p><i>Metal Gear Online</i> is due to return later this year though. “Fox Hunt” is expected to launch in the fall as a part of the upcoming remake of <i>MGS3</i>, <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i>. Not a whole lot about this mode is known right now, though <a href="https://www.konami.com/mg/mgs3r/foxhunt/us/en/">the game’s dedicated page promises</a> “hide-and-seek based” gameplay “that utilizes the central elements of the base game–camouflage and survival.”</p> <p><i>MGO</i> was always a niche experience, of interest to only the most passionate of us <i>MGS</i> dorks. Hopefully Fox Hunt will provide new, quirky experiences that’ll satisfy this discerning crowd of stealth fans.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/guy-who-wants-to-turn-his-viral-ai-art-into-a-game-explains-why-he%E2%80%99s-not-using-ai-to-do-it.1266015/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>A software engineer who goes by Desimulate on X recently posted <a href="https://x.com/de5imulate/status/1947024682118488116">a five-second clip of AI-generated pixel art</a> that went viral. Think your favorite Instagram pixel artist recreating <em>Daggerfall</em> with wild parallax scrolling effects. It was such a hit on Elon Musk’s Grok-infested social media platform that Desimulate decided to try and actually make the game the five-second clip would be from. But he’s not using AI to do it. Why? “Well, right now, the tools aren’t really good enough.”</p> <p>That’s what he told Ryan K. Rigney in the latest edition of the <a href="https://www.pushtotalk.gg/p/behind-the-three-letter-tweet-that-pissed-off-the-entire-games-industry"><em>Push to Talk</em> newsletter</a>. Desimulate said the viral post was the result of working very closely with Midjourney, using lots of specific reference art to try and hone the outputs while also trying to spur them into generating something new. “I just got obsessed with making something unique, and that post was the epitome of that for me. And it kind of came out of nowhere,” he told Rigney.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="und" dir="ltr">omw <a href="https://t.co/eCiTOrjtzC">pic.twitter.com/eCiTOrjtzC</a></p> <p>— Desimulate (@de5imulate) <a href="https://twitter.com/de5imulate/status/1947024682118488116?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-ai-clockwork-revolution-brian-fargo-inxile-2000616038">But while AI can generate a five-second clip</a>, it’s nowhere near being able to generate an actual game based on it, let alone one as ambitious as an open-world fantasy RPG with extremely detailed pixel art. “The meshes are probably good enough to make a basic game,” he explains. “Something small. But this is a game that is kind of demanding, right? It’s going to be a real fantasy RPG. So at the end of the day, it’s going to have to be performant. The 3D generation stuff right now…the meshes are just not up to snuff. They are way too many triangles, polygons, and a lot of them kind of get messed up. And so it actually ends up taking more time to clean them than it would to just, like, start from the beginning. So we just use it as a visual reference.”</p>

 <p>Desimulate is not a game developer. Neither am I. So I can’t tell you whether he’s making any sense. But I can tell you that he’s now trying to hire people who are game developers to turn his viral AI GIF into a game. I’ve encountered many a video game Kickstarter with vertical slices from people who have actually shipped games before that never came close to panning out. If I was a Polymarket guy, which I am definitely not, this is not the horse I’d be picking.</p> <p>But I do think the interview provides a fascinating and useful look into the allure of AI tools like Midjourney and what people think they’re doing when they work with them. It’s clear Desimulate feels like he has ownership over what the machine spit out, even though his contribution to it is a rounding error in the grand scheme of things like training data. Rigney asked why he’s the one to make the game imagined by the people upvoting his post. Here’s what he said:</p> <p>“I’ve got the vision, and everything starts with that vision. I’ve got the passion to make it happen. In two weeks, I’ve interviewed 40-plus people, brought a real team together of real game devs, started building, designing the game, and we’ve made a ton of progress. Obviously everything is in an R&amp;D state. But I am committed to making it happen.”</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-open-beta-revive-medic-help-me-ea-fps-ps5-2000616628"><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s open beta</a> launched less than 24 hours ago across consoles and PC. And already, there are numerous videos floating around that show players using cheating software that gives them an unfair advantage. This has led to a firestorm online as many PC players are upset about being forced to jump through hoops to use Secure Boot, tech designed to limit malicious activity, yet cheaters are already infesting <a href="https://kotaku.com/7-new-things-weve-learned-about-battlefield-6-multiplayer-2000616043"><em>BF6</em>‘s beta</a>.</p> <p>On August 6, the highly anticipated <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> open beta went live…if you had an early access code. Yeah, not really an open beta, but whatever. And despite EA devoting a lot of resources to preventing players from cheating, including the required use of Secure Boot, <a href="https://x.com/10IQGaming/status/1953781723592048760">players began sharing videos online</a> of what appear to be people playing the beta while using wallhacks and other cheats that reveal information about enemy players that shouldn’t be available. <a href="https://x.com/vaccoin/status/1953805256195793383">One video</a> I found featured a montage, complete with music, of what appears to be one person killing dozens and dozens of other players across various matches and maps in the <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">All first-person shooters, like Counter-Strike 2, are affected by cheating ⚠️</p> <p>Despite Anti-Cheat announcements, Battlefield 6 has been affected since day one 🚫 <a href="https://t.co/cwxLPanq2N">pic.twitter.com/cwxLPanq2N</a></p> <p>— CS2 Vaccoin (@vaccoin) <a href="https://twitter.com/vaccoin/status/1953805256195793383?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://x.com/ItsHapa/status/1953515565084967379">Another video</a> of what appears to be a <em>BF6</em> open beta cheater has racked up nearly seven million views on Twitter. The video’s popularity and the huge response to it were big enough to attract the attention of <em>Battlefield</em> producer Alexia Christofi, <a href="https://x.com/Lex_mate/status/1953572607074202062">who replied and explained</a> that the team was aware of the cheating and that she believed the player in the clip had already been banned.&nbsp; So far, the cheating appears to be only on PC, though because of crossplay, these cheaters can play against Xbox and PS5 users.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted EA about the cheating seen in the videos and asked for more information on the situation.</p> <p>Of course, there’s no way to completely stop people from cheating in a video game that can be downloaded locally to a PC or console. But what is angering many players online is that <em>Battlefield 6</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/720007/call-of-duty-pc-anti-cheat-secure-boot-windows-black-ops-7">like the upcoming <em>Call of Duty Black Ops 7</em></a>, requires PC users to use Secure Boot. This is a relatively new technology that helps prevent malicious software from booting up on a Windows PC. <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-05">Here’s how Activision describes the tech</a>: “Secure Boot makes sure a PC can only load trusted software when Windows starts.”</p> <p>The problem is that on some older setups, Secure Boot requires users to screw around with their BIOS, which can cause a lot of damage to a PC if done incorrectly. I mean, look at <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/articles/technical-issues/secure-boot/">EA’s support page about Secure Boot</a> and the steps needed just to see if the feature is active or not on your computer, and you can see why it’s giving a lot of players trouble. And even if it does work, it’s a lot of hoops to jump through, and the end result is that people are still cheating. <em>BF6</em> isn’t even out yet, just in open beta, and cheaters have, in less than 48 hours, gotten wallhacks working in the game. You can understand why some players are royally upset about the whole situation.</p>

 <p>Vince Zampella, the head of Battlefield Studios, was asked about anti-cheat last week and <a href="https://youtu.be/MAA7X9J-Y8Q?t=831">said that until the “day we die, we will be fighting” cheaters</a>.</p> <p>“It’s a weird one, because you don’t want to talk about what you’re doing,” said Zampella in an interview with Gaming Interviews on YouTube. “It gives people that are trying to cheat a head start against you. It’s a huge thing in the industry, in gaming. It’s a constant arms race that we’re always putting a lot of effort into, know that. It’s something that we would stamp out completely if we could, it’s just an arms race. To the day we die, we will be fighting it.”</p>

 <p><em><strong>Updated: 8/8/2025, 4:40 p.m. ET:</strong> </em><a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-6-beta-feedback-en/battlefield-6-update-on-secure-boot--cheats/12439803">EA has published a forum post</a> detailing its efforts to combat cheating in the <em>BF6</em> open beta. The company explained that Secure Boot isn’t and was never intended to be a “silver bullet” against cheating in the game. It’s just part of a larger effort to combat naughty players. EA also claims to have prevented over 300,000 attempts to cheat or tamper with <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s open beta, and it’s received over 100,000 reports of players who might be cheating. They are now working to remove those players who are actually cheating.</p> <p>“Anti-Cheat isn’t one and done,” explained an EA rep. “It’s an ever-evolving battlefield, and what has worked for us previously or in different games doesn’t always work in all of them. I hope this helps, and please keep the reports coming in – we’ll continue cleaning up the cheaters so you can have a fair game.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>I had a <i>good</i> time with <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-doom-dark-ages-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-game-pass-1851779839"><i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i></a> this year. Maybe it even peaked at “great” a few times. I can’t say I remember much of the story, which was a major focus of this new <i>Doom</i>, but I did have a solid 20 or so hours blasting demons and cranking up the difficulty as high as it could go. And now a new update has arrived that amps things up even further with <i>The Dark Ages</i>’ take on the Ripatorium.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-doom-dark-ages-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-game-pass-1851779839"><i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i>: The <i>Kotaku</i> Review</a></p> <p>The Ripatorium showed up in 2020’s <i>Doom Eternal</i>, though then it was a part of the game’s campaign and you’d have to reload a specific checkpoint if you wanted to grind it for fun or practice. <i>The Dark Ages</i>, however, reintroduces the concept as a test of your wits and fortitude that you can play as many times as you want—there’s even an endless mode if you really just want to dig in and refuse to let go. You can select up to 60 enemies from <i>The Dark Ages</i> to do battle with and it’s a ton of fun—but don’t be surprised if you end up in over your head at first.</p> <p>On my first run through the Ripatorium, I maxed out all 60 enemy slots, half of which were fodder to keep my ammo reserves up. The rest were chosen at random from whatever looked the most intimidating. That was a bad idea, as I’d soon discover, since it turns out my <i>Dark Ages</i> skills are quite rusty. That said, having several of <i>Dark Ages</i>’ biggest baddies all rush you at once is not only hilarious, it’s the kind of challenge that will call me to my ruin before I show them who’s really in charge here (me, the answer is me…eventually).</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000616695" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616695"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616695">Look, I’m really out of practice, okay? | © Gif: id Software / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i>The Dark Ages</i> offers up a nice set of modular options that let you fine-tune the game’s difficulty, and the update introduces some new ones, such as limits to how many Max Life Sigils you can have at any time, and a slider for Parry &amp; Melee Slow Motion. You can <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-the-dark-ages-update-2-release-notes">read the full update notes here</a>.</p> <p>The Ripatorium may have shut my cocky ass down at first, but it’s nice to have a reason to jump back into <i>The Dark Ages</i>’ neat guns-and-shield gameplay. And currently it says “Ripatorium 1.0” in the main menu, so hopefully we’ll see some nice additions to this endless mode of carnage in the future.</p>
