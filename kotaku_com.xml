The 2001 Dreamcast game introduced a new brooding antihero in Shadow the Hedgehog, and expanded the <em>Sonic </em>mythos into some dark territory. <em>Sonic 3 </em>isn’t a one-to-one retelling of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, however. After two movies and a TV show, the live-action series has its own established lore, so the third film makes some pretty big changes to the original storyline while still keeping the darker tone and themes of <em>Sonic Adventure 2 </em>intact. Well, when it’s not doing the corny dance breaks and cheesy one-liners, at least. If you’ve never played <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, you might be curious just what was changed for the big screen, so here are a few of the major differences between <em>Sonic 3 </em>and <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>. Spoilers ahead!</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="65098a80c28f4c4fda0e89cde63daa0c" data-recommend-id="image://65098a80c28f4c4fda0e89cde63daa0c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rouge flies through the White Space holding a Chaos Emerald." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rouge flies through the White Space holding a Chaos Emerald." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="65098a80c28f4c4fda0e89cde63daa0c" data-recommend-id="image://65098a80c28f4c4fda0e89cde63daa0c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rouge flies through the White Space holding a Chaos Emerald." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The most glaring difference between <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>and <em>Sonic Adventure 2 </em>is the absence of Rouge the Bat. The Dreamcast game had two dueling stories: Hero and Dark. The Hero story followed Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles as they attempted to thwart Eggman’s latest plan to rule the world, while the Dark side followed Eggman’s story alongside those of two new companions: the Ultimate Lifeform Shadow the Hedgehog, and a double agent government spy named Rouge the Bat. Rouge has yet to appear in the live-action universe, but she acts as Knuckles’ rival and Shadow’s teammate in the video game continuity. Elements of her story in <em>Sonic Adventure 2 </em>still exist in <em>Sonic 3</em>, with the heist segment in the second act an obvious stand-in for her level Security Hall, but there’s no sign of the treasure hunter in the movie itself.</p><p>There have been reports that Paramount plans to give Shadow his own spin-off, and since Rouge didn’t show up in the movie based on her debut game, this would be the most logical place for her to appear next.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5efc87715f6ced88da8582e0b2fe71a5" data-recommend-id="image://5efc87715f6ced88da8582e0b2fe71a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Doom looms over Shadow as he clutches his head in pain." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Black Doom looms over Shadow as he clutches his head in pain." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5efc87715f6ced88da8582e0b2fe71a5" data-recommend-id="image://5efc87715f6ced88da8582e0b2fe71a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Doom looms over Shadow as he clutches his head in pain." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The <em>Sonic </em>movies have established that the speedy anthropomorphic animals saving the world are aliens from other planets. It was eventually revealed in <em>Shadow the Hedgehog</em> that Shadow has some alien DNA in him in the games, but he was initially presented as a creation made by humans when he debuted in <em>Sonic Adventure 2. Sonic 3</em> fully commits to the alien backstory, revealing that he was found 50 years before the events of the film when a mysterious meteor landed on Earth. The GUN forces who investigated found Shadow inside and began running experiments on him in a hidden facility on Earth, rather than the Space Colony Ark orbiting the planet seen in the games.</p><p>Shadow’s backstory in the games is a bit more complicated, to the point where I’m not surprised they simplified it for the film’s shorter run time. In <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, Shadow is revealed as an invention by Gerald Robotnik, Eggman’s grandfather. The hedgehog was meant to be the Ultimate Lifeform, capable of unlocking the key to immortality. In <em>Shadow the Hedgehog</em>, it’s revealed that, in desperation, Gerald made a deal with an alien despot called Black Doom, who used his own DNA to help the professor finalize Shadow’s creation. In return for Black Doom’s help, Shadow would assist the Black Arms alien invaders take over the world. Shadow doesn’t know where he came from in <em>Sonic 3</em>, so it’s still possible that the Black Arms will play a role in a future film as his origins are revealed, but Gerald Robotnik didn’t create him in this continuity; he merely led the project that researched him after he fell to Earth. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9540781f611ef30f8f01c93bfddc0a44" data-recommend-id="image://9540781f611ef30f8f01c93bfddc0a44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow holds a collapsed Maria." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow holds a collapsed Maria." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9540781f611ef30f8f01c93bfddc0a44" data-recommend-id="image://9540781f611ef30f8f01c93bfddc0a44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow holds a collapsed Maria." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In the games, Gerald was deeply invested in finding the key to immortality because his granddaughter, Maria Robotnik, had a terminal illness called Neuro-Immune Deficiency Syndrome. This led to the creation of Shadow and his prototype called the Biolizard, immortal creatures made with the hope that they could help facilitate similar breakthroughs for humanity. However, Maria seems to be a perfectly healthy kid in <em>Sonic 3</em>. I suppose, since Gerald isn’t creating Shadow in this timeline, there was no need to include her sickness as a motivator for his research. The sibling-like relationship between Maria and Shadow still hits many of the same notes, however. In both continuities, the two become inseparable friends that bond even as Shadow is being subject to experiments every day. Eventually, Maria’s death at the hands of GUN agents leads Shadow to try to destroy the world in both the games and the movies, but she lived her life as a healthy young girl in the films.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b326d2909261b2ecf17955b7cafd0fe5" data-recommend-id="image://b326d2909261b2ecf17955b7cafd0fe5" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Maria prepares to send Shadow to Earth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Maria prepares to send Shadow to Earth." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b326d2909261b2ecf17955b7cafd0fe5" data-recommend-id="image://b326d2909261b2ecf17955b7cafd0fe5" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Maria prepares to send Shadow to Earth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Though Maria <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-shadow-maria-death-actor-1851227374&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-shadow-maria-death-actor-1851227374">does reach a tragic end</a></span> in <em>Sonic 3</em>, her death is slightly different than it is in the source material. In most versions of the story, whether that be the games, anime, or comics, Maria is shot by GUN agents. In the live-action universe, Maria is nearly shot as she and Shadow attempt to make their escape after GUN shuts down the project and puts Shadow into stasis. However, the GUN agent that had her in his sights is interrupted by Commander Walters, who gets into a scrap with the shooter, leading to a shot being fired into a tank containing deposits of Shadow’s Chaos energy, setting off an explosion that results in Maria’s death. I imagine Paramount didn’t want to put a scene of a child being shot by the military in its widely distributed feature film, though elements of the original scene remain, as her death was still caused by GUN shutting down the project and attempting to eliminate loose ends.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8da3290370560ee21a9f062550dea511" data-recommend-id="image://8da3290370560ee21a9f062550dea511" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gerald is shown wearing a white lab coat and red shirt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gerald is shown wearing a white lab coat and red shirt." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8da3290370560ee21a9f062550dea511" data-recommend-id="image://8da3290370560ee21a9f062550dea511" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gerald is shown wearing a white lab coat and red shirt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Jim Carrey plays two Robotniks in <em>Sonic 3</em>. The eccentric mad scientist Ivo “Eggman” Robotnik who he’s played in every movie thus far, and his grandfather Gerald Robotnik. In <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, Gerald was long dead and had brainwashed Shadow to carry out his revenge-fueled plan to destroy the world in his absence. The movie version of Gerald is still alive, and able to manipulate Shadow and his grandson into doing his bidding. Eggman has gone his whole life without family, so he’s more than happy to help out his grandfather to make up for lost time, and Shadow’s grief for Maria is so strong, he’ll do anything if he’s told it will be in her honor.</p><p>Gerald dies at the end of the movie, though it’s in a much different way than he dies in the games. Eggman kills Gerald in a frankly anticlimactic fight inside the Eclipse Cannon space station, where in the games he’s killed by a firing squad after his descent into madness.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ea11b66ea6e95e76b7aa9b1dec706a42" data-recommend-id="image://ea11b66ea6e95e76b7aa9b1dec706a42" data-format="jpg" data-width="1041" data-height="586" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Amy approaches Shadow as he looks down at Earth from the Ark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Amy approaches Shadow as he looks down at Earth from the Ark." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ea11b66ea6e95e76b7aa9b1dec706a42" data-recommend-id="image://ea11b66ea6e95e76b7aa9b1dec706a42" data-format="jpg" data-width="1041" data-height="586" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Amy approaches Shadow as he looks down at Earth from the Ark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Rouge is one big character who doesn’t appear in the film’s main story, but there’s another key player who doesn’t show up when they do in the games: Amy Rose.

Since Amy’s not around and Shadow isn’t brainwashed, his turn from villain to hero comes from a different source: Sonic. After the two enter their super forms and beat each other senseless, Sonic comes to his senses and has a heart-to-heart with his rival about the futile nature of revenge, eventually reminding Shadow that even if Maria is gone, his love for her still lives on, leading to the sick as hell team-up as the hedgehogs save the day.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9cf0e4a01b85c2802f767f4b400025d0" data-recommend-id="image://9cf0e4a01b85c2802f767f4b400025d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="2068" data-height="1159" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow looks up at a broken Moon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow looks up at a broken Moon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9cf0e4a01b85c2802f767f4b400025d0" data-recommend-id="image://9cf0e4a01b85c2802f767f4b400025d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="2068" data-height="1159" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow looks up at a broken Moon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, Eggman and Shadow use the Eclipse Cannon, a superweapon developed by Gerald Robotnik, to destroy part of the moon.

In <em>Sonic 3</em>, however, our heroes divert its aim away from Earth, so instead of a direct hit on the moon, the cannon slices off the southern end. It looks like the world is just gonna let it stay that way, too, as you can see the severed section hanging out in the moon’s orbit in the post-credits scene.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bc4131dd1d71b69a9f5aa85d2258f5bc" data-recommend-id="image://bc4131dd1d71b69a9f5aa85d2258f5bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Biolizard thrashes in anger." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Biolizard thrashes in anger." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bc4131dd1d71b69a9f5aa85d2258f5bc" data-recommend-id="image://bc4131dd1d71b69a9f5aa85d2258f5bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Biolizard thrashes in anger." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> In the final few minutes of the film, Sonic and Shadow team up, use the Master Emerald to take on their super forms, and save the world from cataclysmic destruction. This also occurs in <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, but while the movies have the two face an army of Gerald’s robots, the speedy hedgehogs fight something else as a final boss in the game. As a last-ditch effort to destroy the world, The Biolizard, the prototype for the Ultimate Lifeform, fuses with the Space Colony Ark and attempts to keep it on a collision course toward the planet. The Biolizard isn’t mentioned in the movie and seemingly doesn’t exist in the film universe, so while the final battle still has most of the elements that matter, our heroes are squarely focused on fighting Gerald in the climax. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f863e598b765167c90669747add4e6aa" data-recommend-id="image://f863e598b765167c90669747add4e6aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eggman touches one of Sonic's quills to his tongue." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eggman touches one of Sonic's quills to his tongue." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f863e598b765167c90669747add4e6aa" data-recommend-id="image://f863e598b765167c90669747add4e6aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eggman touches one of Sonic's quills to his tongue." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>After our heroes divert the Eclipse Cannon from Earth, the facility becomes unstable and self-destructs. To prevent the explosion from contaminating Earth’s atmosphere, Eggman and Shadow sacrifice themselves to move it away from the planet. Shadow was presumed dead at the end of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, but was revealed to have survived in <em>Sonic Heroes</em>. Eggman, meanwhile, survives the events of the Dreamcast game and lives to bother Sonic and his friends another day. If Carrey’s version of the series villain is well and truly dead (there’s no tease of his survival like there was at the end of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em>), then that’ll be one of the biggest deviations <em>Sonic 3 </em>makes from the source material.</p><p>It’s still unclear how the movies will go on without him, but given the sendoff the character got, it would feel cheap to bring him back.

The 2024 release calendar was spotty at best, and even some of the more notable games that did come to the handheld hybrid, of which there were strikingly few, struggled to run on the nearly eight-year-old tech. Eight years, incidentally, is almost the stretch of time between the launch of the SNES and the PlayStation 2. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,195670,196698" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Nintendo has found a way to keep the Switch alive—just barely—heading into 2025, but this year mostly felt like being in line at the DMV, waiting for a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-reveal-release-date-reddit-1851725408&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-reveal-release-date-reddit-1851725408">glimpse of the Switch 2</a></span> only for the office to close just before you got called to the front desk. While everyone else was focused on the future, Nintendo was stubbornly attached to the Switch’s present, going so far as to wage an all-out war on Switch emulation enthusiasts and ROM pirates alike to stop the platform from completely transforming into a hacker’s paradise.</p><p> 2024 was most notable for what we didn’t see or get than for any actual moves or announcements Nintendo made. No news about the Switch 2, other than it will be revealed in the next few months and will be backwards compatible with the existing one. No major <em>Mario</em> or <em>Zelda</em> game; instead we got two great but flawed smaller spin-offs from those franchises. No major changes to the Switch itself, as best evidenced by how much of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-eshop-switch-slop-clones-unpacking-scam-ai-art-1851722248&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-eshop-switch-slop-clones-unpacking-scam-ai-art-1851722248">a laggy slopfest the eShop still is</a></span>. Not even a price drop for the $300 portable gaming tablet from 2017. </p><p>Instead, the Switch’s 2024 was best spent continuing to play the best indie releases around, almost all of which came to Switch. It was also a good year to continue exploring in <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> which, almost two years later, is still the system’s most ambitious and sprawling achievement. Anyone getting a Switch for the first time this holiday season ahead of the Switch 2 announcement might elicit pity, if not for the fact that Nintendo’s current console still has one of the best catalogs ever assembled in the history of gaming. </p><h2 id="h458239"><a id=""></a>The Hardware</h2><p>What’s left to say about the Nintendo Switch? The promise it offers of gaming on the go or on a big display is as compelling as ever, though its ability to truly deliver a smooth and seamless gaming experience has eroded  with time. The difference between how even mid-range to smaller games perform on Switch versus other platforms like PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC has only continued to grow. Framerate hiccups, visual detail, and loading times have all gotten worse, while rival portables like the Steam Deck and Asus Rog Ally offer fewer tradeoffs at a slightly higher price, at least when it comes to third-party ports and indie releases. </p><figure id="" data-id="83d3fbca6fe9591536240ef0931d01c1" data-recommend-id="image://83d3fbca6fe9591536240ef0931d01c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1003" data-height="564" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An alarm clock sits on a table.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And whither the Switch 2? Nintendo’s much-speculated-about successor has yet to be revealed but, if an ongoing torrent of alleged leaks are to be taken seriously, appears to be a more straightforward upgrade to the existing hardware than Nintendo’s done in quite some time. Whatever gimmicks it may offer, like magnetized Joy-Con that stick to the side of the screen rather than sliding on, don’t seem to be central to the pitch of the new console. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-images-leaks-ai-fake-reddit-1851729048&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-images-leaks-ai-fake-reddit-1851729048">It might even be called the Nintendo Switch 2</a></span>.</p><p>I’m not supposed to be spending this section on the state of the current Switch writing about the future one, but it’s a more accurate depiction of what most of 2024 has felt like for current Switch owners: pinning for what’s behind the red curtain as we growing increasingly impatient and frustrated with what’s already in our hands. As for things Nintendo actually did announce this year, there was a clock. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-alarmo-preorder-scalpers-bed-1851670175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-alarmo-preorder-scalpers-bed-1851670175">It’s called Alarmo</a></span> and it uses motion sensors to serenade users with video game music. Reviewers got their hands on it early but the actual thing won’t ship until early 2025. Fans did get a gold, Zelda-themed Switch Lite this year. It’s probably the best-looking special edition one yet. </p><h2 id="h458240"><a id=""></a>The Software</h2><p>Although the Switch hardware is hanging on by the skin of its teeth, the UI, interface, and general feel of actually navigating the home screen, eShop, and app-only features has grown increasingly grim. It’s sluggish, poorly optimized, and messy. The sleekness of the central row of tiles belies a stark lack of options when it comes to customization or getting any kind of meaningful information about your system, games, or the wider Nintendo ecosystem at a quick glance. </p><p>The eShop is a special point of pain. I quietly sigh every time I have to open the store to go and buy a game, check what’s on sale, or try to see what just came out. It feels like it takes a minor marathon for the store to boot up, and then even longer for the actual parts of it to individually load. Finally getting into the shop is just the start of the headaches, with shovelware and cheap rip-offs of famous games crammed throughout the catalog as you scroll. It’s not great, and it doesn’t help that Nintendo has seemed very unresponsive to the legitimate issues with it. It’s an ominous sign for how the digital purchasing experience may or may not end up changing when it comes to the Switch 2.</p><figure id="" data-id="2a652cf54674939b3eac957f64b47040" data-recommend-id="image://2a652cf54674939b3eac957f64b47040" data-format="png" data-width="859" data-height="631" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows eShop scams.

A parade of Game Boy Advance classics added throughout 2024 included<em> Golden Sun 1</em> and <em>2</em>, <em>F-Zero: Maximum Velocity</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past </em>and <em>Four Swords</em>, and<em> Metroid Zero Mission</em>. <em>Mother 3 </em>even came to the service, though only in Japan. An eclectic batch of retro games joined the rest of the catalog as well, from <em>Super R-Type </em>on SNES to <em>Vectorman</em> on Sega Genesis. Xbox Game Studios brought over a bunch of games like<em> Killer Instinct</em> and <em>Perfect Dark</em>. And the original Game Boy library was inundated with<em> Mega Man</em> and <em>Donkey Kong Country</em> games.</p><figure id="" data-id="79dcf79bd120dd1b0c388ba3da9cb6ec" data-recommend-id="image://79dcf79bd120dd1b0c388ba3da9cb6ec" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Samus fights a giant alien.

A big appeal of the Expansion Pack was access to new DLCs like the additional <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe </em>courses, but as Nintendo first-party releases have stalled and its online multiplayer games get quickly abandoned, that particular perk has languished. It’s also still a major blow to Nintendo’s retro offerings that none of the games can be purchased separately as Sony now allows with its PlayStation Classics. It’s 2024 and fans still have to pay $50 a year to rent <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time </em>running on a Nintendo 64 emulator.</p><p>However, the biggest addition to Switch Online this year wasn’t a game at all.

The service has also been used to offer week-long free trials of various eShop games like<em> Cursed Golf </em>and <em>Vampire Survivors</em>.

The Switch’s 2024 calendar was a mix of remakes and smaller spin-offs buoyed by a good year for indie games. The first half of the year ramped up with <em>Mario vs. Donkey Kong</em>, <em>Princess Peach: Showtime!</em>, and <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>. It then brought things home with<em> The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>, <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, and <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>. </p><figure id="" data-id="4e09cd6f6b657310be9c0ee6579731c0" data-recommend-id="image://4e09cd6f6b657310be9c0ee6579731c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="829" data-height="466" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario and a Koopa talk to a dragon.

The best game Nintendo put on the Switch in 2024 was arguably <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, a remake of a two-decade-old GameCube game that, in another universe, would have come to the platform without the HD upgrade simply the via Switch Online back catalog. </p><p>Fortunately, the Switch also had another banner year for indie releases to fill in the gaps. Some of 2024's top games—<em>Balatro</em>, <em>1000xResist</em>,<em> Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>,<em> Animal Well</em>,<em> Arco</em>,<em> Botany Manor</em>, <em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em>, and <em>Neva</em>—all arrived in a timely manner, even if their ports to other consoles were delayed. Microsoft’s multiplatform push also saw the Switch get <em>Pentiment</em>, the excellent Renaissance-era murder mystery RPG, while some third-party GOTY contenders like <em>Unicorn Overlord</em> and <em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</em> were present day-and-date. </p><p>The Switch’s 2024 library didn’t reach the same heights as it has in past years, but there was still plenty to play, an incredible feat for a console that should have been replaced long ago. And there’s still more coming. Ports of<em> Donkey Kong Country Returns</em> and <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X </em>arrive early in 2025. <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, announced ages ago, is also still set to come to the platform, as will <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, the next game in the hit franchise after an unprecedented year off from new Pokémon games. Nintendo is clearly saving its best for the launch of the Switch 2. In that context, a quiet year for the current Switch was still way better than it had any right to be. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
