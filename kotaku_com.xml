Proulx said he also still technically stands by the “intent” of the hat, and his apology for it is not because of the message it conveyed to some viewers but because the controversy around it has led to division <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-preview-impressions-1851624294&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-preview-impressions-1851624294">in the <em>Splitgate 2</em> community</a></span>, some of whom have been arguing about it in comments and Steam reviews ever since. </p><p>“We did not intend for this to be taken in any political way whatsoever,” he said. “And I’m not an idiot, like obviously I knew there would be some level of controversy, but we really saw this as a meme that was sort of stating our truth, which is we do want to improve this genre, we are disappointed with the state of the genre, and so we took it as a meme we thought would not be nearly negatively received as the way it was.”</p><p>The new video appeared just a day after another one where Pourlx apologized <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-skin-bundle-prices-call-duty-maga-hat-1851784073&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-skin-bundle-prices-call-duty-maga-hat-1851784073">for an $80 cosmetic bundle</a></span> in the game that players spent the weekend dunking on. He said it “slipped through the cracks” after blaming it on a former head of monetization from <em>Call of Duty</em> who left 1047 earlier this year. <em>Splitgate 2</em> has reached a few million players since launch, though many are still waiting on a ranked mode. What’s the over/under on how many more videos Pourlx puts out before they get it?</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
