              <p><span>What’s that riff about more time elapsing between </span><i><span>That ‘70s Show</span></i><span> and now than the time between </span><i><span>That ‘70s Show</span></i><span> and the actual 1970s? ‘90s PlayStation freaks, we stand on razor-thin wire. It has been 27 years since </span><i><span>Robot Anime Geppy-X </span></i><span>released on the first PlayStation, and 27 years between </span><i><span>Robot Anime Geppy-X</span></i><span> and the broadcast debut of </span><i><span>Mazinger Z</span></i><span>. Don’t know what </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4120310/70sstyle_Robot_Anime_GeppyX/"><i><span>Robot Anime Geppy-X</span></i></a><span> is? Well, thanks to a new remaster, you can quickly familiarize yourself with the giant mecha spoof, which is now as retro as the cartoons it’s making fun of.</span></p>

 <p><span>Released in 1999, </span><i><span>70s-style Robot Anime Geppy-X</span></i><span> is a sideways shoot-em-up about blasting mechanical space fiends. A competent enough shmup, what established </span><i><span>Geppy-X</span></i><span> as a cult classic in Japan was its lovingly crafted send-ups of ‘70s anime, such as </span><i><span>Getter Robo</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Mazinger-Z</span></i><span>. An ever escalating robo-opera divided between episodes, with mean robot bosses, increasingly absurd transformations, and suffocatingly tight disco speedsuits. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/edgar-allen-poe-cult-classic-horror-steam-pc-2000669201"><span>And unlike other recent cult-classic Steam ports</span></a><span>, this one’s unwieldy long title is in fact the original.</span></p>  <p><span>The four-disc (count ’em, four) release also held a Saturday morning’s worth of cartoons. Not only the FMV theatrics of the brave </span><i><span>Geppy-X</span></i><span>, but mock commercials for toys, shampoo, and parodies of other vintage anime.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Now </span><i><span>70s-style Robot Anime Geppy-X</span></i><span> is getting </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4120310/70sstyle_Robot_Anime_GeppyX/"><span>an official remastered Steam release</span></a><span>, its first time leaving Japan. In addition to new localized language offerings, this remaster also restores the full-motion cutscenes, having digitized the original master tapes. Even across four PS1 discs there ain’t enough leg room for robots that big without some serious 320×240 compression.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>70s-style Robot Anime Geppy-X</span></i><span> comes to Steam this July for all the ‘90s kids whose media diets were primarily send-ups of late ‘60s variety shows they may never see themselves.</span></p>
