              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-skyrim-port-switch-2-upgrade-free-release-date-trailer-dlc-2000651683"><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> on Switch 2</a> is looking and playing better after a new update added a much-requested 60FPS mode and plenty of fixes and tweaks to the game.</p> <p>In December 2025, <a href="https://kotaku.com/skyrim-elder-scrolls-switch-2-port-60fps-30fps-compare-price-input-lag-fix-patch-2000652156">Bethesda shadowdropped the 15-year-old open-world RPG <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em></a> onto the Nintendo Switch 2. But unlike <a href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remaster-elder-scrolls-eso-glitch-meme-1851777557">the last time the company surprise released an <em>Elder Scrolls</em> game</a>, the reaction to <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 wasn’t positive. Many players were upset over the game’s poor performance, visual glitches, bugs, and bloated install size. Well, Bethesda has fixed some of these problems with a new update out now on Nintendo’s hybrid handheld.</p>

 <p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/2023799788936867979">Bethesda released update 1.2 for <em>Skyrim</em> on the Switch 2</a>. The big news is that this free patch added a 60FPS performance mode. Bethesda has also locked <em>Skyrim</em>‘s framerate to 30FPS when playing in “Prioritize Visuals” mode. Either choice should provide a smoother, more stable experience compared to what <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 played like previously.</p>

 <p>In the patch notes for the update shared online on February 17, Bethesda also dedicated two different sections to addressing fixes made to the game’s performance and visual bugs. This includes improved performance in certain areas, like the Talking Stone giant camp and during combat at Secunda’s Kiss. Issues with water not looking correct from a distance or while in a menu have been fixed, too.</p> <p>While it can be frustrating how often <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4s-10th-anniversary-update-is-a-complete-shit-show-that-nobody-wanted-2000642938">Bethesda seemingly breaks their own classic RPGs with updates and ports</a>, I am happy that the studio seems committed to going back and fixing problems. And hey, if Bethesda doesn’t fix it, at least PC players can rely on talented modders to pick up the slack. Switch 2 and other console players are still at the mercy of Bethesda, though.</p> <hr> <p>Here are the full patch notes for the 1.2 <em>Skyrim</em> update on Switch 2:</p> <div dir="ltr"> <p><span

            <title><![CDATA[The Source Of Highguard‘s Mysterious Funding Was Reportedly Chinese Tech Giant Tencent]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Developers at Wildlight Entertainment were very open about <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em>‘s development</a> back when it launched last month. Everything except where the money to make it came from. A week after mass layoffs at the studio, it’s come out that the source of funding for the hero shooter’s four-year development cycle may have been Chinese conglomerate Tencent.</p> <p>That’s according to a <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-highguard-wildlight-entertainment?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=188295226&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;r=155iz&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email">new report by <em>Game File</em></a>. It claims Tencent studio group&nbsp;TiMi, responsible for online hits like <em>Honor of Kings</em> and military multiplayer shooter <em>Delta Force</em>, is the one backing Wildlight Entertainment.</p> <p>Wildlight was cofounded by <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">ex-Respawn Entertainment veterans</a> who worked on<em> Titanfall</em> and <em>Apex Legends</em>. But unlike many recent startups which happily publicize their investment backers, Wildlight has kept that fact a secret. When pressed about the studio’s funding last month <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-01-30/-highguard-maker-wildlight-entertainment-talks-about-the-game-s-dramatic-launch">by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, CEO Dusty Welch said, “We don’t really speak publicly about the business, and the economics and the financials of our company.”</p>

 <p>As <em>Game File</em> points out, it’s unclear why the relationship has been kept secret. Tencent is no stranger to investing <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-world-s-biggest-game-company-just-keeps-getting-big-1826294558">in Western game studios</a> and companies. It has billions in holdings across companies big and small, from Larian Studios and FromSoftware to Epic Games and Ubisoft. Usually these are just partial financial stakes. In Wildlight’s case, TiMi appears to have been the primary backer.</p> <p>Questions about the funding have taken center stage following Wildlight’s layoffs last week and fan questions about just how much longer the live-service game <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192"><em>Highguard</em> can continue</a> in its current state. It’s lost over 95 percent of concurrent players on PC from its peak at launch, even as an unknown pool continues to play on console.</p>

 <p>As a free-to-play shooter, its revenue comes entirely from in-game microtransactions for skins and battle passes, things players are much less likely to buy when they think a game won’t stick around. Wildlight has yet to update players on the game’s revised roadmap or future plans and today, <em>Highguard</em>‘s official website was discovered to <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-website-down-shutting-down-servers-free-to-play-shooter-steam-playercount-2000669734">have been taken offline</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Between the game’s seasonal crops, time-locked fish, and pressure to keep up relationships with townspeople, most </span><i><span>Stardew Valley </span></i><span>players wouldn’t think of wasting a single in-game day by going to sleep early. Squeezing every possible hour of productivity out of the workday might just be the difference between completing the game’s Community Center and having to wait another in-game year to finish the challenge. However, one player has now done the unthinkable and slept through…an entire 1,000 in-game years.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Late last week, Reddit user Holozard </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1r3xzkg/slept_for_1000_years_straight/"><span>shared</span></a><span> screenshots of their absolutely ridiculous farm, which they left unattended while sleeping in-game for what has to be a record-breaking stretch of time (</span><span>thanks</span><span>, </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/simulation/stardew-valley-fan-recreates-wait-for-haunted-chocolatier-by-sleeping-for-1-000-years-in-the-farming-sim-wakes-up-to-sea-of-giant-mushrooms-and-chickens-that-are-immortal-but-understandably-grumpy/"><i><span>Gamesradar</span></i></a><span>). To put Holozard’s 1,000-year slumber into perspective, I’ve probably only gone through five or six years across all my farms despite putting hundreds of hours into the game.</span></p>

 <p><span>Holozard apparently accomplished the absurd task by running their Switch for three weeks straight. The process involved wrapping a hair tie around the joystick to get their farmer to walk toward their bed automatically and using a controller’s turbo function to hit the rest button.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Their screenshots show off the most abandoned farm I’ve ever seen. Predictably, it’s absolutely overgrown and covered in rocks, grass, and trees. But it’s also covered in some pretty neat spawns that most players have never seen.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><span>Most of </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-tips-tricks-beginner-2000669702">Stardew Valley</a>’s</span></i><span> random events work overnight, meaning every time a player sleeps, the game has a chance to select a random event. Some of these events are pretty rare and have less than a 1 percent chance to occur (and even if one of these rare events does happen, the game might still randomly select an incompatible tile, causing nothing to actually show up).&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But it turns out, if you sleep for 1,000 years, even the game’s rarest events become common. Holozard’s screenshots show a farm littered with meteorites, mushroom trees, and stone owls, all rare items that have impressively low chances to spawn. Looking at these screenshots and trying to parse everything is like playing a messed up version of Where’s Waldo, but it looks like 1,000 years still wasn’t enough to land them the strange capsule item, another rare spawn that I can’t see anywhere in the screenshot. Maybe their farm became too overgrown before the item had the space to spawn?</span></p> <p><span>While poor Holozard had to go through a pretty tedious cleanup process (they said it took them three entire seasons to chop down the mushroom trees alone), it was apparently pretty profitable. “I now have lots of cool purple rocks all over my farm, and made almost half a million in mushrooms, so I’m happy,” they wrote in a Reddit comment.</span></p>

 <p><span>Holozard’s technique is quite the niche way to collect cash, but I guess if you’re desperate to fund your farm and have a spare hair tie and turbo controller, maybe sleeping for a while and crossing your fingers is worth a shot. You just might want to save plenty of time to clean up your farm before bringing either of the game’s two new marriage candidates, which ConcernedApe </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valleys-1-7-update-marriage-map-editor-children-2000665425"><span>plans to reveal later this month</span></a><span>, home.</span></p>
