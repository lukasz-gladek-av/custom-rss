              <p>Robotaxi car company Waymo and food delivery app DoorDash confirmed that, yes, they are working together to send people out to close car doors left open by careless riders. We live in a sad and horrible future.</p> <p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DoorDash_Dasher/comments/1r170zc/craziest_offer/">a Reddit post from a DoorDash driver went semi-viral</a> as it seemingly showed the app offering the user $6.25 to go drive a few blocks and close a Waymo door that was left open. Once the task was completed and verified, the driver would be paid an additional $5. The user had never seen an offer like this before and asked others if they had been asked to go close a robotaxi’s door. Some even wondered if the driver was faking the order entirely for some odd reason. But nope, this is real.</p>   <p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2026/02/12/waymo-is-asking-doordash-drivers-to-shut-the-doors-of-its-self-driving-cars/"><em>TechCrunch</em> reached out</a>&nbsp;to Waymo and DoorDash about the post, and the two companies confirmed they are indeed working together and paying people to close doors.</p> <p>“Waymo is currently running a pilot program in Atlanta to enhance its AV fleet efficiency. In the rare event a vehicle door is left ajar, preventing the car from departing, nearby Dashers are notified, allowing Waymo to get its vehicles back on the road quickly,” said the companies in a joint statement.</p>

 <p>Yes, this means that DoorDashers are getting paid to close doors on vehicles that are designed to one day replace them and other drivers completely. But hey, $11 is nice, I guess. And maybe the robots will remember the ones who closed the doors for them and be nicer to them when they run everything.</p>

For a time, the movie was projected to come out in 2029, a good four years after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381"><span>the original blew up last year</span></a><span>. But now, it sounds like it might take even longer than that.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/sony-kpop-demon-hunters-2-spider-verse-pressure-3-goat-1236503016/"><i><span>The Hollywood Reporter</span></i></a><span>, Sony Pictures Animation president Kristine Belson didn’t say much about </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters 2</span></i><span>, but did heavily imply that the planned 2029 date is probably not going to pan out. When </span><i><span>THR</span></i><span> said that a 2029 release seemed “far-fetched,” Belson responded by, as the outlet describes, placing “her pointer finger to her nose, to indicate that’s correct thinking.” Could we be waiting until 2030? 2031? That’s brutal.</span></p>

 <p><span>From the sound of it, even in these very early stages the team has been so busy during awards season that directors Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans have had little time to buckle down on the project. </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>has been doing very well at award shows, with wins at the Academy Awards and the Grammys, among many others. I guess all that flying back and forth between different events does have a way of complicating things. Larian expressed </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-too-many-awards-winning-larian-goty-1851593323"><span>a similar sentiment when </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>was winning a bunch of awards</span></a><span> after it launched in 2023, which had staff out of the office and at award shows so much it got in the way of the studio’s work.</span></p> <p><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters 2 </span></i><span>has a lot of potential threads to follow whenever it does eventually come out. The first movie doesn’t end on a cliffhanger, per se, but </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-theories-questions-netflix-2000620717"><span>there are a lot of character beats it only briefly touches on</span></a><span> that could be expanded into a full-blown sequel. </span></p>

              <p>PlayStation in the UK has paired up with a company called Raylo to offer rental options for a huge range of its hardware. For a whacking £24.49 ($33) a month you can get a 1TB PS5 you don’t own, or make that £28.49 ($39) if you want a second controller with it.</p> <p>Called PlayStation Flex, it purports to lease out PS5s and accessories “starting at £9.95 per month,” deliberately aimed at customers who aren’t able or willing to pay the full price up front. But the reality is much more grim.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Join your friends on PlayStation 5 with Flex. Lease a PS5 Digital Edition console starting at £9.95 per month, for a limited time only: <a href="https://t.co/7O84kquQ89">https://t.co/7O84kquQ89</a> <a href="https://t.co/RCeCNQfdZF">pic.twitter.com/RCeCNQfdZF</a></p> <p>— PlayStation UK (@PlayStationUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStationUK/status/2021926500245639184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The “starting at £9.95 per month” claim in the promotional materials is extremely misleading. This is the price for the bizarre Europe-only <a href="https://playstation-flex.raylopay.com/products/new-sony-playstation-5-digital-edition-console-model-group-slim-white?term=12-months">825GB digital edition of the PS5</a>, roughly working out to $13.50 a month, but crucially only at that rate if you commit to a 36-month plan from which it is very difficult to opt out. In reality, to rent that lowest-tier console for a month without a contract would cost you £19.49 ($26.50), more than twice as much as the implied price.</p> <p>For clarity, let’s focus on the <a href="https://playstation-flex.raylopay.com/products/new-sony-playstation-5-disc-edition-console-model-group-slim-white?term=12-months">1TB standard PS5</a>, which purports on the front page of the store to be available for £11.59 a month ($16), but for a single month would actually cost you £24.49 ($33). The same console, to buy and own outright, costs £479.99 ($654, with tax included in that figure).</p>

 <p>If you signed up to that 36-month (three-year) commitment, which you cannot cancel, at the cheapest rate this would cost you a total of £417.24. So maybe a bargain, right? That’s £60 cheaper than buying it day one! Except, no, because at the end of those three years you’ve spent your £417 on owning <em>nothing</em>. You have to give the PS5 back. The person who bought it for a not dissimilar price three years ago gets—most importantly—to keep it, and also has the option of reselling it to make back a chunk of their cash.</p>

 <p>This situation obviously gets considerably worse if you rent the PS5 for a shorter period of time. If you were unable to commit beyond a monthly rate (which of course is the case for many with low incomes looking to find cheaper access to this tech, unable to commit to 12-month contracts, let alone three-year ones), for the equivalent three years you’d have paid out £882 ($1202) for a console you don’t even own.</p> <p>Oh, and let’s not forget, we did all this math for consoles that come with just one controller. Run that again with a couple of DualSense included and it’s £450 at the cheapest, £1,026 at the monthly rolling rate. That’s $1400 for a console you didn’t buy. (And just for fun, the PS5 Pro? $834 to $1840.)</p>

 <h2>If you cannot keep up payments…</h2> <p>This becomes more insidious when you note the ease with which these contracts can be entered into. <a href="https://playstation-flex.raylopay.com/#how-it-works">Sony’s store states</a> that applying for the deal takes “60 seconds,” and that “We only do a soft credit check and applying has no impact on your credit file.” Which is to say, it’ll allow you to sign up to a long-term contract costing hundreds of pounds without checking if you can afford it.</p> <p>There is nothing mentioned on the store pages for what happens if you’re unable to keep up your payments years after making the commitment, and the site’s AI assistant fought hard against telling me this, but eventually revealed that cancelling early requires having paid a minimum of 18 months of charges, plus that month’s and the next. So if you’ve signed up for two years but need to cancel after 12 months, you’ll need to pay another eight months’ worth of charges to get out of the contract. What happens if you can’t? It wouldn’t tell me. I’m waiting on a human response.</p> <p>Renting electronics was once a peculiarly popular phenomenon in the UK, with 1970s retailers like Radio Rentals and Granada renting out color TVs and washing machines to those who couldn’t afford to buy them outright. And of course those people would go on to spend far more in monthly payments than the item would have cost up front. There was another resurgence of this model, but <em>far</em> more predatory, in the 2010s with companies like BrightHouse working on a “rent-to-own” model, preying on those with the lowest income, designed <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-47452571">to trick customers into spending five times the real price</a>, although people did at least get to keep the product. (<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52090976">The company collapsed in 2020</a> under the weight of its own cruelty, after <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-41732865">it was found to have deliberately sold contracts to those who couldn’t afford them</a>.)</p>

 <p>Raylo pushes its rental scheme as a “circular economy,” claiming renting tech is in some way more sustainable and environmentally friendly, <a href="https://internetretailing.net/dyson-and-raylo-set-new-standard-for-circular-tech-as-eu-ramps-up-sustainability-push/">as was declared during its partnership with Dyson last year</a>. Meanwhile, the company has rather embraced its own model <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/tech-rental-subscription-service-raylo-clicks-on-30m-fundraising-13499275">by taking on board more than £180 million of debt and equity funding</a> in the last few years, all with a view to launching in the U.S. later this year.</p>
