I’m very excited to see more of this thing.</p><h2 id="h25681"><a id=""></a><strong>SLIDE #9Sony is making a fight stick</strong></h2><p>Not much info beyond that. Here’s Sony’s official description of the device:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Join the fray at home or away with the Project Defiant wireless fight stick*. Take the fight to your opponents with the included sling carry case, and enjoy precise in-game response with ultra-low latency wireless and wired play options, along with a durable, ergonomic design that’s built for battle.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h25682"><a id=""></a><strong>SLIDE #10New <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake Eater</em> trailer</strong></h2><p>The<em> Ape Escape</em> mode is back and looks bigger than before. But the big news is at the very end, where Konami is teasing what looks like a multiplayer mode. Is <em>Metal Gear Online </em>returning? I hope so. </p><h2 id="h25683"><a id=""></a><strong><em>SLIDE #11Nioh 3 is coming in 2026, a demo is out now</em></strong></h2><p>Team Ninja is back with <em>Nioh 3</em>. The game will let players swap between a samurai and a ninja on the fly during combat, and looks slick as heck. This one drops in 2026, but you can check out a demo for it today on PS5. </p><h2 id="h25684"><a id=""></a><strong><em>SLIDE #12Thief VR spin-off coming to PSVR2 this year</em></strong></h2><p>When I saw this trailer, I thought, “Hey, this looks like a new Thief game.” And I was right.<em> Thief VR Legacy of Shadow</em> arrives in 2025 and is being co-developed by Eidos-Montréal and Vertigo Games. </p><h2 id="h25685"><a id=""></a><strong><em>SLIDE #13Tides of Tomorrow looks like a colorful Waterworld game</em></strong></h2><p>I love colorful-looking games, so<em> Tides of Tomorrow</em> instantly caught my eye. The mix of online asynchronous gameplay and having to deal with other people’s decisions in a dying and flooded world sounds interesting. <em>Tides of Tomorrow</em> arrives in February 2026.</p><h2 id="h25686"><a id=""></a><strong><em>SLIDE #14Astro Bot is getting even more levels!</em></strong></h2><p>One of the best PS5 games ever made, <em>Astro Bot</em>, is getting even more free levels later this month. Five new levels will soon be added to <em>Astro Bot.</em> And Sony is bringing back the fan-favorite <em>Astro Bot</em> PS5 controller that sold out instantly last year.</p><h2 id="h25687"><a id=""></a><strong><em>SLIDE #15Sea of Remnants is another colorful pirate game</em></strong></h2><p>Wait a minute, another colorful and fun-looking ocean-based adventure game? That’s strange. But anyway, this third-person pirate game has a cool style and big bosses to fight. and ship gameplay. And mermaids. It arrives on PS5 in 2026. </p><h2 id="h25688"><a id=""></a><strong><em>SLIDE #16Sword of the Sea is coming to PS Plus</em></strong></h2><p>The people behind <em>Abzu </em>and <em>Pathless </em>have a new game coming out, and it looks like you’ll be doing a lot of sick sword surfing.

The big news out of the trailer is the first official reveal of the game’s new James Bond, which you can see in the image above. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197580" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="GameStop Doubles Down On Crypto With Massive Bitcoin Purchase As Stores Close" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="88" data-playlist="197580,197576,197567" data-current="197580"><div><p>GameStop Doubles Down On Crypto With Massive Bitcoin Purchase As Stores Close</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Here’s the full trailer straight from State of Play:</p><p>And here’s the game’s official description, courtesy of YouTube: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> In 007 First Light, follow James Bond as a young, resourceful, and sometimes reckless recruit in MI6's training program, and discover an origin story of the world’s most famous spy. Coming 2026.</p></blockquote><p>Earlier this week, IOI, the studio famously behind the excellent <em>Hitman</em> franchise, finally revealed more about its upcoming Bond game, including its name: <em>First Light</em>. The game is coming to PS5, Xbox, Switch 2, and PC in 2026. </p><p> According to <em>First Light’</em>s website, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ioi.dk/007firstlightgame&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ioi.dk/007firstlightgame" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which was updated earlier this week</a></span>, IOI’s game will feature a “wholly original Bond origin story” that will let players “step into the shoes of the world’s favorite Secret Agent to earn their 00 status.” And in this new trailer, we got a good look at this new Bond. Personally, while the game looks very exciting and fun, I’m disappointed by how bland and boring the new Bond looks. He looks like the guy you start with in a big RPG character creator, the guy you immediately modify to make them look interesting. </p><p>It’s been a long wait for this game. IOI first announced this new <em>007</em> game nearly five years ago, back in November 2020. Now, we know that nearly six years later, <em>007: First Light</em> will finally be arriving on consoles and PC. Will Agent 47 make a cameo appearance? I hope so. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
