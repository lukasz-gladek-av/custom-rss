            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Christmas approaches rapidly and LEGO rushes to clear remaining holiday inventory before the season passes and these seasonal sets lose immediate relevance. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5554/">Christmas tree set just dropped to $25 from $44, hitting a record-low 44% discount for Black Friday</a> on Amazon. If you want a compact Christmas tree that survives annual storage cycles without shedding needles, wilting branches or requiring disposal after the holidays, this is a great investment.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5554/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>2-in-1 Design</h2>
<p>The set lets you build either <strong>one big Christmas tree display or two smaller mini trees</strong>, depending on how much space you have and what you like to decorate with. The <strong>bigger version is more than 11 inches tall</strong> and makes it a great choice for mantel displays, dining table centerpieces, or office desk decorations that really stand out. The dual mini tree option makes one 9-inch tree and one 6-inch tree. This lets you display them together with other decorations or spread holiday cheer throughout several rooms.</p>



<p>Each type of tree has <strong>intricate decorations, candles, and yellow star toppers</strong> that give LEGO’s unique blocky style a classic Christmas tree look. The ornaments use colored round pieces that look like glass baubles, and the candles use special pieces to make shapes that are easy to recognize, even though LEGO’s shapes are limited. <strong>The yellow star on top of each tree</strong> is made in the same five-pointed way that every Christmas tree needs, which gives it a classic look.</p>
<p>Building things is a fun activity that can be done alone or with family during the holidays when relatives want to do more than just eat and talk, and kids 12 and older can build things on their own using clear, illustrated instructions. The moderate number of pieces and easy-to-follow assembly instructions <strong>make it possible to finish in 1 to 2 hours</strong>.</p>



<p>The small size works in places where full-size trees don’t work like apartments, dorm rooms, office cubicles, or homes with aggressive pets and curious toddlers, where regular trees can be dangerous. Put them on desks without taking up too much space, on mantels next to other decorations without crowding, or on dining tables as centerpieces that spark conversation.</p>
<p>The <strong>gift potential is broad because it appeals to a wide range of people</strong>. Connecting kids, teens and adults who love LEGO and like to build complicated things that look like holiday decorations. Kids get fun building projects that last, teens like Instagram-worthy decor to make their dorm rooms feel more like home, and adults know that quality home accents are worth showing off all year long, not just during the holidays.</p>
<p>The aggressive 44% Black Friday discount from $44 to $25 makes LEGO’s Christmas tree set cost less than many holiday decorations that can only be used once and then thrown away. If you want Christmas decorations that will last for decades and provide fun and conversation, this is the deal for you.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-osmo-pocket-3-creator-combo-2000648172</link>
            <guid>1367209</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Vlogging cameras, especially those offering incredible stability and quality video, both day and night, usually sit well over $800. DJI makes some of our favorite vlogging and action cameras out there, and all thanks to Black Friday, picking up one today doesn’t cost an arm and a leg.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6033/">We just spotted the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 creator combo going for $669 on Amazon right now.</a> It typically sits around $979, so you can save more than $300 on it if you act right now. The deal is available to all shoppers, whether you’ve got the Prime subscription or not.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6033/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stable, High-Quality Footage</h2>
<p>It’s a tiny, travel-friendly vlogging that fits in your palm and slips into your pocket for easy portability. Superior stability comes from Pocket 3’s advanced 3-axis mechanical stabilization, while ActiveTrack 6.0 keeps you in focus at all times. Trying out a new dance move or chasing a furry friend around, you can bid shaky, headache-inducing footage goodbye. The camera even locks onto your subject, which can come in handy when filming some action-packed sequences.</p>
<p>The built-in 2-inch full-color OLED rotatable touchscreen moves both horizontally and vertically to give you the perfect shots. When it comes to picture quality, the camera records in 4K resolution at an impressive 120fps. There’s a 1-inch CMOS sensor to capture clear highlight-shadow details, meaning you will be able to show the world what you’ve been up to even after the shadows fall. It’s smart enough to fine-tune exposure for different skin tones on its own, giving you a glow like never before. Pair this with background bokeh that makes the subject stand out, and you’ll have stunning, professional videos ready to be uploaded on YouTube right away. Speaking of YouTube, you can also use the camera to live stream on different platforms, and even use it for online meetings as a webcam. Basically, it takes care of all your video needs, both personal and professional, like a pro.</p>



<p>Sound quality is another strong selling point. Pocket 3 actively reduces background noise to capture what you’re saying clearly, even in noisy, chaotic settings. The sound is pretty solid on its own, but you can always pair the camera with a compatible DJI microphone for a more premium experience.</p>
<p>Battery life is impeccable. A single charge lets you film in 1090p/24fps for over 2.5 hours; perfect for longer journeys where you want to take your online family along. Recharging won’t take long either, as Pocket 3 hits 80% in just 16 minutes. Best of all, tweaking settings and editing the content won’t be a hassle, thanks to the dedicated smartphone app. The platform lets you play around with filters, plus convert 3-second videos into photos on iOS devices.</p>
<p>Included in the box are the Osmo Pocket 3 starting set, the DJI Mic 2 Transmitter, battery handle, Osmo mini Tripod, and more. The battery charger, however, is sold separately. All things considered, if you’ve been on the lookout for a portable camera that makes it easy to record your adventures and share your everyday life with the world, the Pocket 3 Creator Combo is an excellent option to consider.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6033/"> On a regular day, it would run you around $979, but this rare Black Friday deal drops the price to just $669</a>. We know it’s still a bit of an investment, but one that’s definitely going to pay for itself in the long run. Just be sure to get your orders in quick, as discounts this massive don’t stick around for long.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Offloads All Flagship Phones This Black Friday, Including OnePlus 13 Now at New Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-offloads-all-flagship-phones-this-black-friday-including-oneplus-13-now-at-new-record-low-2000648375</link>
            <guid>1367182</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday’s main day arrives with Amazon delivering massive discounts across every product category to maximize shopper satisfaction. iPhone 17 models are still absent from Amazon’s catalog but flagship Android devices receive substantial markdowns <strong>including the Galaxy S25 Ultra, Google Pixel 10, and OnePlus 13</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6045/">OnePlus 13 costs $799 in its 512GB configuration during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $999</a> and hits a record-low price that explains its bestseller status. The 20% discount makes flagship specs (including Snapdragon 8 Elite processor, 6,000mAh battery, 120Hz QHD+ display and Hasselblad camera system) accessible at pricing that approached mid-tier phones.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6045/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Snapdragon 8 Elite Performance That Rules</h2>
<p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Elite processor is the <strong>best Android mobile silicon out there</strong>. It has maximum clock speeds of 4.32GHz and is made using cutting-edge 3nm technology which gives it desktop-level performance, and it can handle demanding games at their highest settings, professional photo and video editing, and extreme multitasking across dozens of apps without the slowdowns that happen with less powerful processors.</p>



<p>The <strong>6.82-inch ProXDR display has a QHD+ resolution of 3168 x 1440 pixels</strong> and an <strong>adaptive refresh rate of 120Hz</strong> that smoothly switches between 1Hz for static content and 120Hz for scrolling or gaming. The LTPO technology makes this variable refresh possible while also making the battery last longer by automatically adjusting based on the type of content, and the ProXDR name means that the screen is brighter with a peak brightness of up to 4,500 nits for HDR content.</p>
<p>Dolby Vision support makes video from Netflix, YouTube, and Disney+ look amazing by giving it a lot of contrast. The 10-bit color depth shows over 1 billion colors, so there are no banding issues with smooth gradients, and the display is just as good for work as it is for play with clear text and detailed spreadsheets, bright colors, and deep blacks.</p>
<p>The huge <strong>6,000mAh battery is one of the biggest in flagship phones and really lasts for two days of normal use</strong>, not just the optimistic marketing claims that say you need to use airplane mode and not much else. Heavy users who stream video, play games and use apps all the time can go full days without worrying about their batteries dying. Moderate users can go two evenings before needing to charge their phones. The <strong>80W SuperVOOC wired charging fully charges the battery in about 35 minutes</strong>&nbsp;so you don’t have to wait until the next day to charge it. Instead, you can charge it during your lunch break or morning routine. The 50W AirVOOC wireless charging is as fast as many wired charging options and lets you charge your phone at your desk or nightstand without having to deal with cords in the dark.</p>



<p>The<strong> fifth-generation Hasselblad camera system has three cameras with 50MP sensors on the main, ultra-wide, and telephoto lenses,</strong> and gives you a lot of options for shooting. The main sensor captures incredible detail thanks to its large 1/1.4-inch size, which lets in more light than smaller sensors in other phones. This makes it work better in low light and gives it a shallower depth of field.</p>
<p>The ultra-wide lens handles wide-open spaces with little edge distortion, and the telephoto lens lets you zoom in on things that are far away without losing quality, which is a problem with phones that only crop. <strong>Hasselblad’s color science makes pictures that look real</strong> with accurate skin tones and balanced saturation, instead of the over-processed look that phones that try to look good on social media have.</p>
<p>OnePlus’s<strong> custom interface for Android 15 with OxygenOS</strong> combines the clean look of stock Android with useful features like gesture navigation, gaming mode, and a wide range of theme options. The interface stays fast and responsive because it doesn’t have much bloatware and manages resources well, which keeps it from slowing down like heavily skinned Android versions do. OnePlus promises to give the phone four years of major Android updates and five years of security patches.</p>
<p>The 512GB model is on sale for a record-low price of $799 on Black Friday, down from the usual price of $999. This makes OnePlus’s flagship specs competitive with mid-range phones that cost about the same but have much better performance, display quality, battery life, and camera capabilities.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Meta Quietly Offloads Ray-Ban Gen 1 via Amazon, Smart Wayfarer Now Goes for What Regular Sunglasses Cost]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/meta-quietly-offloads-ray-ban-gen-1-via-amazon-smart-wayfarer-now-goes-for-what-regular-sunglasses-cost-2000648328</link>
            <guid>1367170</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Meta launched a second generation of Ray-Ban smart glasses with incremental improvements but the original model remains compelling through proven functionality and dramatically lower pricing. The <strong>Gen 1 Ray-Ban Meta featuring 12MP camera, open-ear speakers, and AI assistant integration</strong> delivers the core smart glasses experience without the premium that newest hardware commands.</p>
<p>The price gap tells the story clearly: Gen 2 models cost $410 while these <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6031/">Gen 1 Wayfarers hit $262 during Black Friday on Amazon (down from $329) which is roughly 40% savings for hardware</a> that differs minimally in daily use. <strong>All coloris and frame styles</strong> receive identical discounting and the<strong> #1 bestseller status in tech glasses</strong> validates that buyers love it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6031/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>12MP Camera That Shows Different Angles</h2>
<p>With the built-in 12MP camera, <strong>you can take pictures and videos hands-free from your exact point of view</strong>: This makes content that smartphones can’t make without awkward arm extensions or obvious filming. Parents keep track of their kids’ soccer games, recitals, and everyday moments by looking them in the eye and being present instead of watching through phone screens. Perspective shots that show what you really saw instead of what cameras picked up from hand-held positions that were slightly off from your line of sight make travel photography more real.</p>



<p><strong>Video recording can last up to 60 seconds per clip in 1080p resolution</strong>, and this is long enough to capture important moments without using too much storage space or battery life that would come with unlimited recording. Birthday cake presentations, scenic overlooks, and quick tutorials all fit easily into the 60-second window. This limit encourages people to film on purpose instead of filming for hours and hours and hours of footage that needs to be edited. The Meta View app automatically syncs the captured content to your phone, keeping everything organized without the need for manual file management or card readers.</p>
<p><strong>Open-ear speakers send sound</strong> in a way that only you can hear at normal volumes: This lets you listen privately without the isolation or discomfort that comes with wearing earbuds for a long time. You can still hear podcast episodes, directions, phone calls, and music while being aware of conversations, traffic, and other sounds that are important for safety. <strong>This technology is great for walking, biking, or any situation where complete audio isolation could be dangerous</strong> or lead to bad behavior.</p>



<p>Meta’s software lets <strong>you use voice commands to control photos, calls, messages, and information queries</strong> without having to touch your phone. You can ask the glasses to take a picture, make a call, send a message, or answer factual questions by speaking naturally, which is easier than trying to use your phone. The hands-free feature is useful when cooking, working out, or doing anything else where it’s hard or impossible to reach your phone.</p>
<p><strong>Ray-Ban’s classic look is kept with the iconic Wayfarer style</strong> which is better than the obvious tech-forward designs that scream “smart glasses” and cause problems in social situations. The matte black frames and polarized gradient graphite lenses make these look like high-end sunglasses first and wearable technology second. This means they can be worn in both professional and social settings where tech that stands out is not appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>The battery lasts through full days of moderate use</strong> which includes taking a few photos, making a few videos, streaming music, and making calls without having to charge it in the middle of the day. The charging case that comes with it lets you charge it more than once on trips that last more than one day when there aren’t many wall outlets available.</p>
<p>There is a $148 difference between the Gen 1 models, which cost $262, and the Gen 2 models, which cost $410, and most users won’t even notice the improvements in their normal use. This record-low price makes smart glasses available without the usual trade-offs or extra costs for early adopters.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/airpods-4-2000647084</link>
            <guid>1367149</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The biggest shopping event of the year is almost here, and you know what that means; saving big on items that rarely go on sale. It’s especially a great time to treat yourself to some Apple products, since we’re spotting iPads, audio gear, and even MacBooks dropping to their lowest ever prices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">One of the best discounts live right now is the Apple AirPods 4 with ANC marked down to just $99.99.</a> These typically retail for $179, so you’re saving a whopping nearly $80 on the pair. These have dipped to around $130 during past sales, but $99.99 is the lowest we’ve seen them go in a long time. Even crazier? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/">The non-ANC AirPods 4 are nearly 50% off at just 69, which is an insane deal for the latest model.&nbsp;</a>The deal is open to all shoppers, whether you have a Prime subscription or not.</p>
<p>It’s best to get your orders in fast, as we’re not expecting the deal to stick around for long.</p>

<h2>Adaptive Noise Cancelation for an Immersive Experience</h2>
<p>Apple unveiled its AirPods 4 last year, after redesigning the pair for exceptional all-day comfort and greater stability. The redefined contour makes for a better fit, while the shorter stem keeps the frame minimal. The build is responsive, meaning you can just press the earbuds to control music and manage calls.</p>
<p>The pair is packed with Apple’s powerful H2 chip to unlock an immersive, rich audio experience with two modes; Active Noise Cancelation and Transparency. ANC blocks background noise and chatter, letting you vibe to your favorite songs or listen to podcasts without distractions. It’s great for noisy, chaotic public places where you just can’t seem to focus on what’s playing. Putting the buds on will disconnect you from the outside world, making it feel like you’re in a quiet room even when you’re packed into a subway.</p>
<p>Transparency mode does the opposite. It lets some ambient sound in, so that you can stay aware of what’s happening around while still enjoying high-quality audio. It’s better for public settings where you don’t want to miss when someone tries to interact. Even better, there’s Conversation Awareness that automatically lowers the volume of what’s playing when someone talks to you. You won’t have to awkwardly take the earbuds out just to hear the other person properly.</p>
<p>Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking is supported, too. It places audio all around you for a 3D experience, letting you enjoy your favorite movies and TV shows better.</p>



<p>Voice/video calls get a boost with Voice Isolation, a feature that reduces background noise while clarifying yours. Catch up with friends on the go, or hop on meetings in a cafe without having to repeat yourself or constantly apologizing for the background noise. It plays nicely with Siri, so you can use the voice assistant for hands-free convenience throughout the day. Just say “Hey Siri”, and ask it to play music, make calls, or check your schedule. It’s helpful when you’re behind the wheel and don’t want to take your attention off the road, or even when both your hands are busy typing and picking up the phone would break your flow.</p>
<p>On a single charge, AirPods 4 give you around 5 hours of listening in the standard mode, while up to 4 hours with ANC on. Drop them back into the charging case, and your total extends to 30 hours. The pair is also IP54-rated dust, sweat, and water resistant. Intense workouts in the gym or a few splashes here and there won’t affect the functionality.</p>
<p>All things considered, AirPods 4 are some of the best wireless earbuds out there. You’re getting impressive sound, two listening modes, and a reliable battery life, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">all for just $99.99 (ANC)</a> and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/">$69 (without ANC) right now.</a></p>
