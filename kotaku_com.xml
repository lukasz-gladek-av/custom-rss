            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC is out now, and one of the less publicized things the expansion adds is new Research Requests. These are mini-quests that, upon completion, raise your Research Level and unlock new rewards like attacks to teach your monsters and items to help you level up faster. At the final level, you’ll unlock the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shiny-hunting-despawn-sound-effect-2000636142"><span>Shiny Charm</span></a><span>, which raises the rate at which alternate-colored critters show up in the overworld. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>made acquiring the Charm a notorious grind, and now </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>makes it much simpler, but this handy bit of rebalancing is locked behind the $30 paywall of the DLC’s asking price.</span></p> <p><span>To unlock the Shiny Charm, you have to reach Research Level 50. At a glance, this doesn’t seem that difficult, until you complete all but the last request and realize that you’ve come up short of reaching the final level. The remaining request you have is to complete 1000 battles. To put the scale of that accomplishment into perspective, I’ve put about 60 hours into </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>and have only hit around 570 battles. I’m not trying to get the Shiny Charm, so I haven’t been grinding to try and complete this request, but some folks have, and it’s a major time investment.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">It looks like if you have the DLC, you may not have to do 1000 battles <a href="https://t.co/3BxmF9dv7D">pic.twitter.com/3BxmF9dv7D</a></p> <p>— Austin John Plays (@AustinJohnPlays) <a href="https://twitter.com/AustinJohnPlays/status/1998623037290156227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Now that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-x-y-gorochu-scrapped-2000652133"><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i></a> <span>is out, if you progress through the early bits of the story, you’ll unlock a wave of new Research Requests, allowing you to make your way to Level 50 with relative ease. That’s cool for anyone who hasn’t put a ton of effort into the grind. If you have already done it, though, you’re probably feeling some type of way. If you don’t want to do that grind and still want the Shiny Charm, you’re also probably angry that you have to pay a sizable chunk of change to get it more easily</span></p> <p><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>has had no shame when it comes to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-raichu-ranked-2000625708"><span>paygating some pretty major stuff</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>is one side of the problem; the other is that Mega Stones for popular Pokémon are rewards for online ranked battles, which require a subscription to access. I guess the silver lining on this particular one is that you don’t </span><i><span>have </span></i><span>to pay for this to get the Shiny Charm. Maybe boot up a show you’ve been wanting to consume as second-screen content as you grind, though.</span></p>

              <p>Steam’s Next Fests, where developers share hundreds of demos, tend to get most of the focus allotted to playable pre-release morsels of various games each year, but it’s definitely worth noticing that Microsoft frequently does the same over on Xbox. <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/browse/Indie-Selects-Demo-Fest">The ID@Xbox Indie Selections Demo Fest</a> (catchy) has been running on and off for a few years, offering a few dozen trials across a limited time, often featuring some stunning games. The latest features 36 free demos to check out until the end of December, mostly for Xbox consoles, and has some bangers. But that’s a lot of games to sort through, so we’ve picked out nine of the most interesting you might want to check out.</p> <p>ID@Xbox’s continual promotion and support of indie games is very welcome, especially given how easily they can be lost on the Xbox Series’ clumsy store pages, usually only picked up by the casual shopper if they show up on Game Pass. So all power to efforts like this, giving a push to small teams in an overwhelming marketplace. You can browse the full selection over on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/12/09/xbox-indie-selects-demo-fest-starts-now/"><em>Xbox Wire</em></a>, or of course <del>you can look through them on your Xbox console</del>… No, extraordinarily, there’s no presence for the Fest on the console UI anywhere I can find, not even in the heavily buried “Demos” section. This seems like something of an oversight. Instead, to find any of the listed games, you need to search for them individually on the store, where their demos will then appear. Here are a few worth grabbing first:</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/cash-cleaner-simulator-piggy-bank-demo/9NBJR3JSR989">Cash Cleaner Simulator</a></h2>  <p>Just the title alone tells you everything you need to know about this demo. Yes, it’s absolutely a spoof of post-<em>PowerWash Simulator</em> cleaning games, and yes, it really is about laundering money. But even better, it conflates the two into a game about literally washing money in the name of crime. <em>Cash Cleaner Simulator</em> <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2488370/Cash_Cleaner_Simulator/">came out on Steam</a> earlier this year, and has been met with a jubilant reaction.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/deck-of-haunts-demo/9NMVCHBBF1XF">Deck of Haunts</a></h2>  <p>Another game that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3179730/Deck_of_Haunts/">came out on Steam</a> earlier this year,&nbsp;<em>Deck of Haunts</em> combines deckbuilding roguelite gameplay with literally <em>being</em> a haunted house. It’s all about being truly dreadful, luring humans into your creepy rooms and then exploiting their fears to drain them of their essence! Despite proving popular on PC, it’s gone under-noticed by the press—hopefully an Xbox release will see that put right.</p>

 <hr>   <p>The second game from Canadian team Thousand Stars, <em>Aikyam</em> is a Bollywood-inspired third-person RPG, where characters Vishva, Ramli, and Guruji battle demonic attacks in a game about the rippling effects of kindness! There’s a whole Diwali-looking vibe to the art, and the combat is presented like bombastic Bollywood fight scenes, and seriously, how are you not already downloading this demo?</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/pathologic-3-demo/9N6RDKD38WL9">Pathologic 3</a></h2>  <p>Ice Pick Lodge’s&nbsp;<em>Pathologic</em> was one of the most extraordinary indie games ever made, with its dream-like delivery of a plague doctor simulator, translations so poor as to become genuinely poetic, and gameplay broken to the point of barely being held together all adding to the experience. Its sequel was similarly broken, but didn’t possess the same magic, but hopefully the series can rebound for this third entry. The trailers certainly suggest something utterly bemusing and hauntingly alluring.</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/cassette-boy-demo/9P830VNBHM29">Cassette Boy</a></h2>  <p>I’m pleased to report that there is no sign of any shortage in fresh ideas when it comes to puzzle RPGs, and&nbsp;<em>Cassette Boy</em> looks to be further proof. This is a game in which anything you’re not looking at ceases to exist. Despite looking like a 2D game, it is in fact 3D in a way that’s somewhat reminiscent of <em>Fez</em>, but where rotating the isometric 2D world causes everything that becomes hidden to literally no longer be there. Still confused? Just play the demo!</p>

 <hr> <h2><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/knuckle-jet-demo/9PPC608C3CD0/0010">Knuckle Jet</a></h2>  <p>Side-scrolling platformer&nbsp;<em>Knuckle Jet</em> looks like a combination of old-school acrobatic jumping and punching, combined with a stunning stop-motion-esque aesthetic, and perhaps even a little bit of bullet-hell. I especially love that it describes itself as featuring “scientifically inaccurate flight action.” This is from Rain Games, who previously gave us the splendid&nbsp;<em>Teslagrad</em> series, so there’s good reason to be very hopeful.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/relooted-demo/9N1TC30FZTLT/0010">Relooted</a></h2>  <p>2018’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-semblance"><em>Semblence</em></a> was an inspired and ingenious puzzle platformer, but after its release developer Nyamakop went very quiet. Now they’re finally back,with <em>Relooted</em>, a game about repatriating African artifacts from Western museums. A group of thieves from a number of different African countries team up to commit cunning heists to recover items museums have hidden in their vaults. It looks like it’s lifted all the right ideas from <em>Gunpoint</em>, with a mixture of pre-planning and improvised escapes, with a bunch of parkour movement thrown in for good measure.</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/limbot-demo/9NVQVM8KR1D9/0010">Limbot</a></h2>  <p>The reason <a href="https://kotaku.com/tesla-robot-optimus-kojima-od-boys-season-5-trailer-2000651373">modern robots are all so rubbish</a> is because everyone’s forgotten to make them out of cardboard boxes. Clearly that’s the only sensible medium from which to build, as proven by local co-op party game <em>Limbot</em>. Up to four players can take control of one limb each of this person wearing a robo-guy costume, and attempt to work together to control it as it stomps through a very easily broken cardboard world. You can have a go at this extreme silliness right away, which the makers boast is the “ultimate physics-based city stomping experience.”</p> <hr> <h2><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/worshippers-of-cthulhu-demo/9P9JLD62B12B/0010">Worshippers of Cthulhu</a></h2>  <p><em>Worshippers of Cthulhu&nbsp;</em>came out earlier this year on PC, and despite proving <em>very</em> popular with those who played it, went completely under the radar. So let’s hope this Lovecraftian colony sim has a second chance at success with its Xbox outing. It’s all about leading a cult hell-bent on raising Cthulhu and bringing about the cosmic obliteration of the current order, so y’know, normal Wednesday. Very much inspired by the <em>Anno</em> series, but with a somewhat more malevolent approach.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[World Of Warcraft Players Are Making Houses Fly And Blizzard Approves]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/wow-world-of-warcraft-player-homes-floating-trick-update-blizzard-2000652188</link>
            <guid>1378684</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/wow-world-of-warcraft-player-housing-homes-blizzard-mmo-1851697796">after two decades of waiting</a>, Blizzard finally added player housing to its popular MMORPG <em>World of Warcraft.</em> And pretty quickly after it was added, players figured out how to make houses float in the air. Instead of patching out this unintended feature, Blizzard is making it official, but with some warnings.</p> <p>On Wednesday, <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/housing-development-notes-updated-december-9/2207508/5"><em>World of Warcraft</em> community manager Randy Jordan aka Kaivax explained in a post</a> that shortly after <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/news/world-of-warcraft-patch-11-2-7-official-patch-notes-379455"><em>WoW</em> update 11.2.7</a> went live on December 2, crafty players discovered unlisted hotkeys that allowed them to move their homes up into the air. <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/please-fix-the-floating-houses/2211847/117">The community is still debating whether this was a bug or not</a>, but regardless, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1pd603o/so_houses_can_float/">levitating homes</a> weren’t an intended feature. Still, Blizzard isn’t patching out the hotkeys and grounding player creativity. Instead, it’s making the feature official and adding UI elements to allow everyone to easily move their homes into the sky.</p>

 <p>Kaivax did include two warnings for those looking to live in the clouds: “The underside of houses isn’t modeled or textured. Players who lift their houses may decide to hide that part behind other things,” explained the community manager. And also, “If you lift your house up, clicking on the door could become difficult. You might want to consider building a ramp or a jumping puzzle, or a mount landing spot, etc.”</p>

 <p>It’s cool to see Blizzard recognize that people are having fun with floating houses–crafting all sorts of stuff like flying ships and magical hovering towers–and deciding to not only leave the feature in, but make it an official part of the game that anyone can use.</p> <p>And to help people decorate these flying homes more elaborately, Blizzard has also upped the number of items players can place on the exterior of their domicile from 200 to 250. These changes are now live in <em>World of Warcraft</em> following a scheduled bit of maintenance.</p> <h2><a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/housing-development-notes-updated-december-9/2207508/5#p-28364924-inside-out-2" name="p-28364924-inside-out-2"></a></h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-boys-ps2-vr-game-cyberpunk-tcg-2000652144</link>
            <guid>1378642</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Would PS VR2 have sold better if the games looked and played more like PlayStation 2 classics? Will John Romero’s next game also get suddenly canceled? And can a <em>Cyberpunk</em> trading card game bring back those awesome <em>Netrunner</em> vibes? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint,&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. It’s Game Awards Eve and I’m celebrating by remembering the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-rA5LzFc9I">special kind of hell</a> that was Joel McHale co-hosting the 2013 VGX.</p> <h2><em>The Boys</em> is getting a VR game that looks like a PS2 game</h2> <p><em>The Boys</em> is coming to Meta Quest just in time for season 5. The licensed tie-in is called <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/the-boys/5661258417332116/?srsltid=AfmBOoo8okddGts-VWwafdidPQDXpRHiKIOe81sLpIEKTA65ljxAbGVV"><em>The Boys: Trigger Warning</em></a>, drops in spring 2026 for $24, and features Butcher and Mother’s Milk “guiding from the shadows” as game protagonist Lucas Costa “sets off on a no-mercy hunt” to kill “a washed-up but still lethal family of Vought Superheroes.”</p>

 <p>As <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-boys-trigger-warning-vr-game-ps2-graphics/"><em>The Gamer</em> notes</a>, it somehow looks like something that would have come out in 2003. Despite weird, lifeless depictions of Karl Urban and Laz Alonso, the VR spin-off by Arvore Immersive Games, which is inexplicably published by Sony Pictures Virtual Reality, promises “brutal boss fights” and “partial nudity.”</p>

 <h2>Minecraft has a big new content drop</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/mounts-of-mayhem-official-release-date"><em>Mounts of Mayhem</em></a> arrived December 9 and added new creatures for players to ride and a new weapon. Spears are finally in the game, too. They bring a new lunge capability to mounts. Fans are already fantasizing about recreating the<span dir="auto" role="text"> “Charge of the Rohirrim” in <em>Minecraft</em>.</span></p>  <p>The developer was speaking at Salón del Videojuego de Madrid (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-cancelled-shooter-has-been-saved-with-fresh-redesign-inspired-by-elden-ring"><em>Eurogamer</em></a>) when he confirmed that Romero Games is working on a new project that “incorporates a lot of the elements” from a game that was cancelled earlier this year when Microsoft <a href="https://kotaku.com/romero-games-xbox-layoffs-shut-down-canceled-game-1851785765">suddenly pulled funding</a>. “We’re not starting at ground zero,” he said. “We can take pieces out of and put into a brand new indie game. We have a lot of stuff we can put in the game. The design is completely different, but the team is very excited about the new design.”</p>

 <h2>Switch Online is getting two more N64 adventures</h2>  <p><em>Rayman 2: The Great Escape</em> and <em>Tonic Trouble</em> are getting added to the Expansion Pack on December 17. It’s the first time the Ubisoft classics will be available on a modern console, which may help get fans primed for the eventual new<em> Rayman</em> game Ubisoft is reportedly working on.</p>

 <h2>Microsoft is reportedly working on getting legacy Xbox games running on PC gaming handhelds</h2> <p>That’s according to industry leaker NateTheHate. “There exists a hope to make legacy Xbox (OG and Xbox 360) games [backwards compatible] on ROG and Windows. Whether they succeed is the unknown; but there is an effort being made,” he wrote on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jason-ronald-on-25th-anniversary-we-want-to-celebrate-the-legacy-of-xbox-as-well-as-define-the-future-of-where-the-xbox-ecosystem-is-going.1376665/#post-148633819">gaming forum ResetEra</a>. “The other unknown would be how extensive will the initiative be in offerings. Will it be what we currently have on Series or will BC expand to add more titles across the Xbox ecosystem.”</p>

 <h2><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> is getting turned into a trading card game</h2>  <p>The<em> Cyberpunk TCG</em> is a collaboration between CD Projekt Red and TCG newcomers WeirdCo. Characters like Johnny and Panam will make the cut for the starting set, as will<em> Edgerunners</em> characters like Lucy. It’s still not entirely clear what the mechanics of the game will be, but it looks like it will revolve around cybernetic enhancements, as you’d expect. The game will be crowdfunded through Kickstarter.</p> <h2>Warner Bros. is reportedly sticking with the Netflix deal</h2> <p>Despite Paramount’s 11th-hour bid of over $100 million, which included financing from Saudi Arabia and Jared Kushner, <a href="https://x.com/Lucas_Shaw/status/1998550897232880032"><em>Bloomberg</em>‘s Lucas Shaw</a> says Warner Bros. Discovery isn’t interested. The company is expected to stick with Netflix’s bid after the streaming platform shored up support among its board. Maybe it’ll bring back <em>Succession</em> for a bonus season to celebrate.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-theft-card-store-phantasmal-flames-2000651666"><em>Pokémon</em> card thieves went on a $100,000 burglary spree</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-game-awards-statue-theory-2000651769">The Game Awards hell statue is probably for a new Larian Studios RPG</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-review-switch-sakurai-2000651657"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> isn’t shy about being a Switch 2 sugar rush: our review</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-lenovo-15-laptop-with-good-everyday-specs-drops-75-off-but-only-on-amazon-not-official-site-2000652164</link>
            <guid>1378636</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Basic computing needs haven’t changed much over the years, and most people don’t need gaming rigs to handle their daily digital lives. Email, web browsing, video streaming, and video calls represent the bulk of what typical users do with their laptops, and the <strong>Lenovo V15 G2</strong> handles these tasks without breaking a sweat or your budget.</p>
<p>This 15.6-inch machine packs enough power (8GB DDR4 RAM, 256GB PCIe SSD, WiFi 6) for anyone who needs a reliable Windows 11 laptop for everyday productivity and entertainment. The good news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6337/">Amazon has just slashed the price to a record low of $299, down from the typical $1,199 asking price</a>, while Lenovo’s official website maintains full pricing without similar discounts available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6337/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real-World Computing Performance</h2>
<p>The <strong>Intel Celeron N4500 dual-core processor</strong> runs at base speeds that can go up to 2.8GHz when applications need more processing power and it is enough power for most people’s everyday computing tasks. This chip won’t beat high-end processors in benchmarks, but it starts Chrome quickly, can handle a lot of browser tabs without slowing down too much, and runs Microsoft Office apps smoothly. The built-in Intel UHD Graphics handle video encoding without any stuttering or lag that would interrupt conversations, so video calls through Zoom or Teams work well.</p>



<p>The 8GB DDR4 RAM gives you enough room to comfortably multitask with normal application loads: You can keep your email open while you work on a word processor, a spreadsheet, and several browser tabs without having to close applications all the time to keep performance up. This 8GB setup leaves enough free memory for your actual work, but power users who often work with dozens of tabs or apps that use a lot of memory may eventually run into problems.</p>
<p>A <strong>PCIe SSD gives you 256GB of storage space and fast boot times and instant application launches</strong> that make modern computers feel responsive: You can keep a good number of documents, photos, and media files on your computer, but people with a lot of videos or games will need to be more careful about how they use their storage or buy external drives. The PCIe interface makes it possible to quickly back up files or move large folders instead of taking a long time and the lack of moving parts means that the device will run quietly and be more durable when it is moved.</p>
<p>The <strong>Full HD display is 15.6 inches wide and has a resolution of 1920×1080</strong> which makes text easy to read without straining your eyes and gives you enough space to work comfortably. Anti-glare coating cuts down on reflections from windows and overhead lights, so you can see clearly no matter what kind of lighting you have at home, at work, or at a coffee shop. The laptop’s thin bezels around the screen give it a modern look while making the most of the display area. The Dolby Audio speakers make the sound clearer than the cheap laptops’ tinny sound which makes the laptop more fun to use for streaming shows, listening to music, or video calls where you need to hear everyone clearly.</p>
<p>The 720p webcam has a <strong>physical privacy shutter that blocks the camera lens</strong> when you’re not using it which solves security issues without needing tape or third-party covers that leave residue. The video quality is good enough for casual video calls and meetings, but content creators who want high-quality streaming will need to use external cameras. What’s more, WiFi 6 support gives you faster wireless speeds and better performance in busy network areas than older WiFi 5 standards.</p>
<p>There are a lot of ways to connect<strong>, including USB-A ports for older devices, USB-C ports for newer accessories</strong> and data transfer, HDMI output for external monitors or presentations, and an Ethernet jack for when wired networking is more reliable than WiFi. The keyboard has a full-size numeric keypad that is useful for anyone who works with spreadsheets or enters data. The layout of the keyboard follows standard spacing, so there is no need to get used to it.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Home comes with a familiar interface for Windows users: It gives you access to the Microsoft Store, built-in productivity apps, and works with the huge library of Windows software. This hardware runs the operating system smoothly, without the lag that comes with underpowered machines. It stays responsive during normal daily use.</p>
<p>When entry-level Windows laptops from big-box stores often cost more and have similar or worse parts, spending $299 on a laptop with these specs is a great deal. Lenovo usually charges $1,199 for Celeron-based hardware, which seems high. However, even when compared to realistic market rates, this 75% discount gives you a complete, working laptop for a price that is only slightly higher than a basic Chromebook.</p>

              <p>Ring belongs to Amazon, which gives the retail giant complete freedom to price these video doorbells however aggressively it wants without worrying about profit margins on individual units. Amazon’s strategy focuses on getting Ring devices installed in as many homes as possible and knows that subscription revenue and ecosystem lock-in will pay off long-term even if the hardware sells at cost or below.</p>
<p>The newest<strong> battery doorbell model delivers head-to-toe video coverage with 66% more vertical view</strong> than the previous generation, and captures packages on the ground and tall visitors’ faces in a single frame. This<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/"> latest version currently sells for $49 on Amazon instead of the usual $99</a>&nbsp;which marks a record low price that makes smart doorbell technology accessible to practically anyone with a front door and a WiFi connection.</p>

<h2>Video Coverage That Shows What Really Matters</h2>
<p>The <strong>bigger vertical field of view is a big improvement over older Ring doorbells</strong> which often cut off the tops of tall people’s heads or packages on the ground below the camera’s frame. This full-body coverage gets rid of the annoyance of having to watch footage again and again only to find that important details are missing because they were out of the camera’s view: You can clearly see the faces of delivery drivers while also making sure they really left your package instead of just pretending to deliver it. You can also see people who look suspiciously like they’re casing your property while they think they’re outside the camera’s range.</p>



<p>The<strong> built-in rechargeable battery</strong> means you don’t have to connect the doorbell to your home’s electrical system so renters or anyone who doesn’t want to deal with electrical work can install it. You probably already have cables that work with the USB-C charging port because it uses modern connector standards that are the same as those used by most new phones and tablets. When the battery gets low, just take the doorbell off its mount, plug it into any USB-C charger, and put it back in place after a few hours.</p>
<p>With the <em>Live View</em> feature, <strong>you can use the Ring app on your phone to see what’s going on at your door</strong> at any time, even if no one has pressed the doorbell button or motion detection has been triggered. This is helpful if you’re waiting for a delivery and want to see the driver, if you want to make sure your kids got home from school, or if you just want to see what’s going on outside without having to walk to the door.</p>



<p>When there is movement near your door, <strong>motion detection sends real-time alerts to your phone</strong>. However, the basic notifications only let you know that motion was detected and don’t say what caused it. Ring’s subscription service offers Smart Alerts, which use AI to tell the difference between people, packages, and other moving things like cars or animals. This way, you get more useful notifications that help you decide if something needs your immediate attention.</p>
<p>With Alexa integration, you can stream doorbell video to Echo Show devices all over your house, use Alexa speakers to announce visitors, or use voice commands to control Ring functions. You can ask Alexa to show you the front door, and within seconds, the video feed will appear on compatible Echo displays which lets you check who’s there without having to pull out your phone.</p>
<p>When you consider that smart doorbells from well-known brands usually cost between $150 and $250, spending $49 on a Ring video doorbell with its build quality and features is a great deal. Amazon’s usual price of $99 already made this a good deal compared to other options, but the 50% discount makes it so cheap that it is almost as cheap as regular doorbells from home improvement stores.</p>
