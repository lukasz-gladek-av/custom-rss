Having to be on the main menu to piece together which characters can pull off a unique throw is a drag, especially when there are ten total to keep track of. Our guide will break down how to perform them all and what makes them different from a fighter’s typical grab.</p><h2 id="h65733"><a id=""></a><strong>How to Trigger Special Throws</strong></h2><p><strong>All it takes to trigger a unique throw is to have one particular fighter grab a specific target.</strong> It’s distinct enough that just using any version of a character might not cut it. Goku has three opponents he can perform a special throw against, but each one requires him to be in a certain form from a particular era.</p><p>Aside from some launching an opponent differently, these don’t feature any <em>major</em> gameplay differences. While there are some subtle advantages, they’re mainly meant to be fun references to iconic moments and fights us fans love.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ac1c3b3216a3c0c44131e423fd2d65ec" data-recommend-id="image://ac1c3b3216a3c0c44131e423fd2d65ec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Goku swings Frieza around by his tail." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Goku swings Frieza around by his tail." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ac1c3b3216a3c0c44131e423fd2d65ec" data-recommend-id="image://ac1c3b3216a3c0c44131e423fd2d65ec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Goku swings Frieza around by his tail." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Goku’s standard throw has him grabbing the opponent by their foot, swinging them around for a bit, and then slamming them downward.

Referencing their first fight on Namek, Goku grabs Frieza’s tail before swinging and throwing him off into the distance. The cinematic starts with the egotistical tyrant crossing his arms, as this moment occurred when he pompously fought Goku without using his hands.</p><p>This special can allow for alternate combos, since it launches Frieza differently.

His default grab has him use a three-hit punch combo to launch enemies away horizontally. It even has some extra flair for ending with a rocket arm punch.</p><p>The bulky android takes a little influence from Goku if he’s fighting against Cell’s 1st Form, though. While he doesn’t comically swing them around, he does grab the terrifying monster’s tail and slam him downward. Fans might remember Android 16’s fights against Cell’s evolved forms more, but he did have his moment thrashing this imperfect form.</p><p>Besides looking more brutal, it can take out additional health from the big bug if he hits the ground. If you throw him from high in the air, you can also follow up with a vanishing attack, the Hell’s Impact super, or the Self Destruct Device ultimate.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bae761ed867af9a5fd7096d696b08346" data-recommend-id="image://bae761ed867af9a5fd7096d696b08346" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Teen Gohan uppercuts Perfect Cell into the air." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Teen Gohan uppercuts Perfect Cell into the air." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bae761ed867af9a5fd7096d696b08346" data-recommend-id="image://bae761ed867af9a5fd7096d696b08346" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Teen Gohan uppercuts Perfect Cell into the air." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Gohan’s first foray into the Super Saiyan 2 form is rife with lightning-fast attacks and slower heavy ones too. His typical grab embodies the latter with two powerful hits that send the opponent flying horizontally, with their back to you.</p><p>He shows even less mercy against the so-called perfect being. Gohan will hit Perfect Cell with a devastating punch to the gut, and then follow up with an uppercut that launches his nemesis into the sky. A nice touch is that Cell attempts (and fails) to throw a punch of his own, which makes this one of the more dynamic throws in the game. It’s also a fun, faster representation of the first two hits Gohan lands on the villain in this form.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d4c7b95038fed3ec080cbeb4de40e272" data-recommend-id="image://d4c7b95038fed3ec080cbeb4de40e272" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Super Saiyan 3 Goku punches Majin Buu in the face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Super Saiyan 3 Goku punches Majin Buu in the face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d4c7b95038fed3ec080cbeb4de40e272" data-recommend-id="image://d4c7b95038fed3ec080cbeb4de40e272" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Super Saiyan 3 Goku punches Majin Buu in the face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This version of Goku has a slightly different default throw from the one we mentioned earlier. He still swings Majin Buu around by their foot, but opts for an upward launch instead of throwing them downward. Although you’ll miss out on additional damage from a possible ground smash, there can be more potential to combo from the launch.</p><p>Super Saiyan 3 Goku doesn’t just throw Majin Buu, but grabs him by his stretchy antenna to punch him in the head first before tossing him aside. The punch certainly makes this a hilariously brutal cinematic. Otherwise, the only real difference is that this is a horizontal throw and a great reference to these two fighters’ first meeting.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fbec5415e41c5e3e6b41d72af5f8921d" data-recommend-id="image://fbec5415e41c5e3e6b41d72af5f8921d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gohan swings Super Buu around by his antenna." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gohan swings Super Buu around by his antenna." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fbec5415e41c5e3e6b41d72af5f8921d" data-recommend-id="image://fbec5415e41c5e3e6b41d72af5f8921d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gohan swings Super Buu around by his antenna." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Ultimate Gohan spends more time hitting the enemy than his teenage self manages.

He throws a punch before, you guessed it, grabbing Super Buu’s antenna and swinging him around. Aside from the total disrespect that the punch adds, which is accurate to the initial fight between these two in the anime, this will launch the hungry pink blob upward.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c02a7fb8b5b5f7527286ee6798f958a1" data-recommend-id="image://c02a7fb8b5b5f7527286ee6798f958a1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta pulls up Goku Black by his hair and screams in his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta pulls up Goku Black by his hair and screams in his face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c02a7fb8b5b5f7527286ee6798f958a1" data-recommend-id="image://c02a7fb8b5b5f7527286ee6798f958a1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta pulls up Goku Black by his hair and screams in his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The blue-haired version of Vegeta, who has the unnecessarily long name of Vegeta (Super) Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan, normally uses two heavy punches to launch the opponent forward. If you’re confused about it counting as three hits, it’s because the first punch counts as two. He’s just that damn cool I guess.</p><p>Vegeta is a lot more vicious against Goku Black in his Super Saiyan Rose form. After punching the latter onto the ground (which looks strange when using this throw in the air), Vegeta picks the body-stealer up by his hair and delivers a headbutt and punch. It’s mechanically identical to the default throw as both send the opponent flying forward.</p><p>Even though there isn’t a gameplay difference, and it’s unfortunately missing the entire speech the Prince of all Saiyans delivers during this <em>Dragon Ball Super</em> moment, the throw is still one of the coolest in the game.

The default is a flashy four-hit punch and kick combo, including a vanishing grab midway through. It has a great flow to it that feels nearly as dramatic as any quick-time event Impact Action. Your opponent will be sent flying away with their back to you.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-impact-action-qte-guide-1851678426&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-impact-action-qte-guide-1851678426">Let’s Master The Art Of <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s QTEs</a></span></p><p>Kefla’s Super Saiyan 2 form ends up receiving a special interaction that’s just as cool with a lot fewer hits. Starting with an overwhelming staredown, Goku catches Kefla flinching and quickly sends her flying forward with a single two-handed punch. This is indeed a reference from their fight, although a little unrecognizable because they’re not falling upside down next to a rock.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b6d996194f6da3b76a7bb0adbabc8002" data-recommend-id="image://b6d996194f6da3b76a7bb0adbabc8002" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Toppo in his God of Destruction form picks up Frieza by his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Toppo in his God of Destruction form picks up Frieza by his face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b6d996194f6da3b76a7bb0adbabc8002" data-recommend-id="image://b6d996194f6da3b76a7bb0adbabc8002" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Toppo in his God of Destruction form picks up Frieza by his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Toppo isn’t nearly as big as Anilaza or Great Ape Vegeta, but he still dwarfs most of the roster.

With a style that would make Vegeta proud, Toppo uses his obscenely large hands to shove Frieza head-first into the ground, pick him up for a quick head squeeze, and then let go just to kick him away. Referring to the self-proclaimed Emperor of Universe 7 as trash is the disrespectful cherry on top of this great <em>Dragon Ball Super</em> scene recreation.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5541651b1ef136972c3938b20ea81760" data-recommend-id="image://5541651b1ef136972c3938b20ea81760" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The original version of Broly holds Goku up in the air by his hair." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The original version of Broly holds Goku up in the air by his hair." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5541651b1ef136972c3938b20ea81760" data-recommend-id="image://5541651b1ef136972c3938b20ea81760" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The original version of Broly holds Goku up in the air by his hair." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Broly has always been one of the most brutal fighters in the series, and his grabs certainly reflect that.

The similarities unfortunately include the default throw for his Super Saiyan form, as it is the same animation as his sadistic predecessor’s.</p><p>His unique throw is thankfully a decent departure from everyone else’s. When fighting against Frieza (Super), the angry Saiyan uses his giant feet to get in some kicks and a sick backflip, before punching him away. This exact scenario plays out in the movie <em>Dragon Ball Super: Broly</em>, albeit with Frieza being kicked into a giant rock. While it looks strange in-game, since there is no rock or wall to play off of, the backflip does add a lot to the coolness factor.</p><hr><p>It is pretty disappointing that <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> doesn’t have more unique throws, given the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-unlock-every-character-shop-1851670640&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-unlock-every-character-shop-1851670640">abundance of characters</a></span>. Despite that, these are still a very welcome treat if you can trigger them in a fight. The animations are great and they do spice up your matches a little bit. Just as with the Special Finishers, we can only hope more are added through updates or DLC.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It sounds like Warner Bros. is now revisiting the prospect of some kind of film adaptation of George R.R. Martin’s books, even if the project is still in the earliest stages of development. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193818" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Last of Us’s Lamar Johnson On Learning Sign Language For The Show" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="258" data-playlist="193818,197298,197284" data-current="193818"><div><p>The Last of Us’s Lamar Johnson On Learning Sign Language For The Show</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193818/193818_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193818/193818_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193818/193818_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193818/193818_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19270.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>According to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/game-of-thrones-movie-warner-bros-1236050190/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/game-of-thrones-movie-warner-bros-1236050190/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Hollywood Reporter</em></a></span>, the studio is making at least one <em>Game of Thrones </em>movie, though the project doesn’t yet have a script, director, or cast associated with it. These “concepts of a plan” for a theatrical adaptation of <em>A Song of Ice and Fire</em> might soon break free of its existing HBO prestige TV enclosure, something the company had resisted in the past. </p><p>While we don’t have any idea what such a movie would focus on, from entirely new events to existing portions of Martin’s world that haven’t yet been adapted to TV, it seems unlikely a project would be able to rival the previous success of <em>Game of Thrones</em> without involving that cast and characters in some way. Maybe it’s not unthinkable that we might get a complete do-over of the show’s much-maligned ending, something fans have long speculated about. </p><p>Any movie would also be coming out alongside a full suite of new <em>Game of Thrones</em> TV, from <em>House of the Dragon</em> season three and<em> A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</em> to a host of other spin-offs and animated adaptations. Not all of Warner’s grand plans for the fantasy IP have come to fruition, however. A direct sequel with Kit Harington reprising his role as Jon Snow was infamously abandoned, seemingly over a lack of strong ideas for where to take the character after the as-of-yet unfinished conclusion of Martin’s books. </p><p>  <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> points out that a new era of post-merger Warner Bros. seems much more comfortable with major franchises seamlessly hopping between streaming and the big screen. The <em>Harry Potter </em>movies are currently being remade as a TV series, and<em> The Batman</em> has already spawned a very successful spin-off in <em>The Penguin</em>. It’s not hard to see<em> Game of Thrones</em> going in the opposite direction five years after the conclusion of the original show. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
