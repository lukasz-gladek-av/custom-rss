              <p><span>David Hayter, the long-time voice of Snake in the </span><i><span>Metal Gear Solid </span></i><span>series, is just like any other creative. He, like most of us who spend years improving our craft, looks back at older work and wishes he could iron out some of the wrinkles. Maybe you wish you’d sung a different note, chosen other words to express an idea, or posed the subject of a painting a little differently. In Hayter’s case, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-3-mgs3-mgs4-konami-2000619259"><i><span>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</span></i></a><span> has him wishing the remake had allowed him to re-record his 20-year-old lines.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/mgs-delta-snake-eater-voice-talent-interview"><i><span>Inverse</span></i></a><span>, Hayter, alongside The Boss actor Lori Alan and the vocalist behind the game’s music, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cynthia-harrell-the-woman-who-sang-snake-eater-is-rea-1845440278"><span>Cynthia Harrell</span></a><span>, reflects on the experience of working on the original </span><i><span>Snake Eater</span></i><span> game that launched on the PlayStation 2 in 2004. Each of them was surprised to learn that a </span><i><span>Snake Eater</span></i><span> remake was in the works, but they were more surprised that they were asked to contribute to it. Alan told </span><i><span>Inverse</span></i><span> she would have expected to be recast, but that’s not the route Konami took. Instead, </span><i><span>Delta</span></i><span> primarily reuses the 20-year-old recordings from the original. However, Hayter and Alan did hop back in the booth to update some lines for the game’s tutorials. Hayter says that while he’s always down to play Snake again, he wishes Konami would let him re-record his whole performance after gaining 20 more years of acting experience.</span></p> <p><span>“I do feel that I’m a little better of an actor now than I was then,” Hayter told </span><i><span>Inverse</span></i><span>. “It was fine back in the day, but I would have loved to bring some of the knowledge that I’ve picked up over the past 20 years to it. But you don’t want the [new tutorial] lines to be better acted all of a sudden, because that’ll take you out of the game.”</span></p>

 <p><span>While Hayter’s involvement in the remake was small, he’s hopeful this means the series is making a comeback after it went on ice following director Hideo Kojima’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/report-kojima-finally-leaves-konami-to-start-his-own-s-1748162428"><span>departure from Konami</span></a><span> in 2015, the laughably misguided survival game </span><i><span>Metal Gear Survive</span></i><span> in 2018 notwithstanding.</span></p> <p><span>“Anytime they ask me to be Snake, I’m in,” Hayter told </span><i><span>Inverse</span></i><span>. “It’s the definitive role in my life. It’s so complex and so profound, and there are so many different aspects to both him and Big Boss. So anytime it comes up, I’m down.”</span></p> <p><span>For more on the </span><i><span>Snake Eater </span></i><span>remake, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-delta-remake-2000619269"><span>check out </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>’s review</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>And…there we go! It’s officially Friday, folks. I’m filling in for Ethan, who <em>should</em> have written today’s edition, so if you prefer his take on Morning Checkpoint, well, sorry, you have to deal with me. This morning, we learn about Double Fine’s future, get ready to watch a weird <em>Fortnite</em> stream, check out what’s up with <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s campaign, and catalog the first game to run away from <em>Silksong</em>‘s September launch. Oh and here’s a trailer for a movie that looks like <a href="https://youtu.be/9oJEUcpPeBw"><em>Jaws</em>, but set during the Second World War. Enjoy</a>?</p> <h2>Aeterna Lucis is delaying its launch to avoid <em>Silksong</em></h2> <p>Yesterday, after many years of waiting, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-september-release-date-trailer-2000619152">we finally got a release date for <em>Silksong.</em></a> It’s arriving next month, and one game is already throwing in the towel and delaying its launch to avoid the indie superstar sequel. On Friday, the devs behind <em>Aeterna Lucis</em> announced that the game was being pushed back from a planned September launch to sometime in 2026, partly because of <em>Silksong</em> and partly because they lack all the dev kits needed for a release on “next-gen” platforms.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/CUomiRcsZU">pic.twitter.com/CUomiRcsZU</a></p> <p>— Aeternum Game Studios (@aeternathegame) <a href="https://twitter.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Our initial plan was to launch<em> [Aeterna Lucis]</em> this September,” said the devs in a statement. “But after the announcement of <em>Silksong</em>, we are fully aware that our game wouldn’t have the visibility it deserves. Competing with a phenomenon of that scale would not only be unfair to our team’s effort, but also to you, the community, who expect to experience this adventure under the best possible conditions.”</p>

 <h2>Double Fine isn’t working on <em>Brutal Legend 2</em> or any other sequels</h2> <p><em>Keeper</em>, Double Fine’s next game, looks great! It comes after a big gap following the company’s last game, <em>Psychonauts 2</em>. If you’re worried that, after&nbsp;<em>Keeper</em>‘s release, you’ll be waiting a while again for more Double Fine goodness, take heart: the studio’s founder and boss, Tim Schafer, says that Double Fine is working on multiple projects at the moment. But, if you were hoping for a <em>Brutal Legend 2</em> or <em>Psychonauts 3</em>, well, I’m sorry to say that ain’t happening anytime soon.</p> <p>“I’m working on other stuff,” <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/double-fines-tim-schafer-rules-out-more-sequels-for-now-so-you-can-forget-about-brtal-legend-2-and-psychonauts-3">Schafer told <em>IGN</em></a>. “The studio is doing multiple projects right now and they’re all original IPs, because we did <em>Psychonauts 2</em> and that will hold us for sequels for a while.”</p> <h2>The alleged mother of one of Elon Musk’s kids will be on a <em>Fortnite</em> stream</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">💥 Fortnite Friday is BACK 💥</p> <p>🚨 Alleged Mother of Elon Musk's Child… Ashley St. Clair (<a href="https://twitter.com/stclairashley?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@stclairashley</a>) gives her FIRST live interview since news broke… straight from the Battle Bus 🚨</p> <p>🇺🇸 5PM PST / 8PM EST 🇺🇸 <a href="https://t.co/WFBXsFMblL">pic.twitter.com/WFBXsFMblL</a></p> <p>— connor (@ConnorEatsPants) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConnorEatsPants/status/1958612410774040833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>I don’t have much to add to this other than that we live in a very strange world.</p> <h2><em>Call of Duty Black Ops 7</em> is ditching campaign difficulty levels</h2> <p>The latest <em>Call of Duty</em> is making some big changes to the series’ handling of campaigns. <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s will support co-op, and there will be a rogue-like endgame included with it. Another big change? <em>Black Ops 7</em> won’t feature the franchise’s usual difficulty levels, like Veteran or Hardened. Instead, as developers, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-does-not-have-difficulty-options-treyarch-explains-why">Treyarch explained to <em>IGN</em>,</a> the studio is using co-op to balance the game. The more players you include in the action, the harder things get. It’s an interesting change, though I wonder how more casual players hopping in to play with a friend might handle getting their ass kicked over and over again and having no way to make things easier.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-pete-parsons-halo-destiny-2-sony-2000619244">After 23 years, Bungie boss Pete Parsons is leaving</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown-ftl-2000619136">This new<em> Star Trek Voyager</em> game seems cool</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/critical-role-campaign-4-cast-brennan-lee-mulligan-date-2000619230">Critical Role’s big shake-up, explained</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="How Star Wars Control Panels Were Made for Filming!" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UykDcJEojc4?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>
