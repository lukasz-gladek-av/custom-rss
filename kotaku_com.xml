The modern <em>Pokémon </em>games have been universally plagued by technical issues, but the debate about the series’ graphics and art style is a bit more complicated and subjective than simple acknowledgments of technical shortcomings. <em>Legends: Z-A </em>is being held to a lot of scrutiny after games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review-nintendo-switch-1849843125&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review-nintendo-switch-1849843125"><em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em></a></span><em> </em>traded the intimate, crafted environments of their predecessors for open-world scope, and the fandom seems divided on whether the upcoming Switch RPG is an improvement or another step in the wrong direction.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

But it is a step up from the 2022 RPGs in that it’s more colorful, uses smaller environments to get more details and textures on screen, and at least in the trailer, it looks like it’s running better than <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> do, too. I’m open to conversations about whether <em>Legends: Z-A </em>looks bad, but I feel like anyone who thinks it looks <em>worse</em> than the ugly open world of Paldea probably hasn’t booted up <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>in a minute or is wearing rose-colored glasses. The side-by-side comparisons are pretty damning.</p><p>For all the discussion happening in the <em>Pokémon </em>fandom, <em>Legends: Z-A </em>feels like a calculated pivot away from the pitfalls of the series’ recent open-world entries. It’s focusing on a smaller world by taking place entirely in Lumiose City, which means we’ll hopefully not be subject to the same framerate culling and texture pop-in that plagued <em>Legends: Arceus </em>and <em>Scarlet</em> / <em>Violet</em>. But even if it’s a technical step up earned through careful planning, does <em>Legends: Z-A</em> beat the ugly artstyle accusations? That’s the question fans can’t seem to agree on.</p><p>I’m still interested in some of the mechanical changes <em>Legends: Z-A </em>is implementing like real-time battles, but the longer I’ve thought about it, the more I’m disappointed that visually, the <em>Legends</em> subseries isn’t following in the superior footsteps of <em>Legends: Arceus</em>. Yes, <em>Arceus</em> had some of the same technical troubles that impacted <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, but it was generally pretty to look at because it adopted a colorful cel-shaded look. Seeing <em>Legends: Z-A </em>fall in step with <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>is a bummer because moving away from the open-zone structure could have, in theory, given Game Freak the chance to focus on smaller environments with some visual flair and personality. <em>Sword </em>and <em>Shield</em> was the last game that featured (primarily) smaller environments, and it had some real standout towns that popped on screen and had a real sense of place. I look back at the city of Ballonlea, which is adorned with colorful, bioluminescent mushrooms, as a reminder that Game Freak can create gorgeous environments when it scales back. Lumiose City looks better than anything in <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>, but if it were more stylized, it could look even better.</p><p>Hopefully, we’ll see something more visually striking between now and when <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>launches on Switch later this year. Until then, at least I haven’t seen anyone <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/c0l58j/why_is_this_ok/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/c0l58j/why_is_this_ok/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">getting mad about the trees.</a></span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the post, they answered over a dozen fan questions about how the upcoming open-world stealth game will perform on consoles, specs needed on PC, upscaling and raytracing options, and more. And in this new post, Ubisoft confirmed that <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> on Steam won’t, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-connect-steam-assassin-s-creed-valhalla-1849809946&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-connect-steam-assassin-s-creed-valhalla-1849809946">like past many Ubisoft PC games</a></span>, require players to download and install Ubisoft Connect.</p><p>So yes, here’s the good news: According to Ubisoft, you won’t need to muck about with a separate launcher when playing <em>Shadows </em>via Steam. The company says that <em>Shadows </em>includes a “lite embedded version” of Ubisoft Connect in it. </p><p>However, you’ll still need to link your Steam account to a Ubisoft Connect account to play <em>Shadows</em>. Ubisoft promises this is a “one-time” thing and once you link the accounts you will be good to go, but it is still a weird barrier between Steam users and the game. And for those worried that this means you have to be online to play <em>Shadows</em>, that’s not the case. Ubisoft confirmed you only need an internet connection to install the game. Then you can play offline. </p><p>Now for some bad news: Steam Deck users won’t be playing <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> at launch. In today’s tech Q&amp;A, Ubisoft very bluntly responded to a question about <em>Shadows </em>on Steam Deck with: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>At launch, the game will not be compatible with Steam Deck, due to the fact it is below our minimum specs for PC.</p></blockquote><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2024-big-games-unplayable-space-marine-2-pc-1851669933?_gl=1*1lj6v08*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDc2NTY5Ni4xNy4xLjE3NDA3NjY1NjAuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-2024-big-games-unplayable-space-marine-2-pc-1851669933?_gl=1*1lj6v08*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDc2NTY5Ni4xNy4xLjE3NDA3NjY1NjAuNjAuMC4w">This isn’t surprising, as more and more games are struggling to run on the aging Steam Deck</a></span>. However, the fact that Ubisoft specified it won’t be playable <em>at launch</em> is interesting. Perhaps in a future update the company will add some Steam Deck options to make it playable on Valve’s portable PC. But if you don’t have a computer that can play <em>Shadows</em> and rely on a Steam Deck to play PC games, I’d hold off on buying the new <em>Assassin’s Creed.</em></p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is nearly here. The game launches on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on March 20. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
