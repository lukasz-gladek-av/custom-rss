            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When Apple drops a new tech device to replace a top-rated favorite — say, the AirPods Pro 2 — the first questions are always “how much better can the new one be?” and “do I really need to upgrade?” In the case of the AirPods Pro 3, the answers are “a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>” and “yes, absolutely.” The AirPods Pro 3 aren’t just Apple’s best active noise-cancelling in-ear buds, they’re the best ones made by anyone, anywhere, at any time. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">They’re also on sale for the very first time at Amazon for Black Friday, with an all-time low price of $220.</a></p>
<p>There’s definitely nothing wrong with the AirPods Pro 2. They’re still among the very best wireless earbuds on the market (and almost certainly the subject of some epic Black Friday deals of their own, especially now that the Pro 3s have arrived). But the Pro 3s are on a whole new level, from their sound and noise cancellation to their redesigned feel — more contoured, shorter stems, and a better overall fit. As much as we love the Pro 2s and didn’t think we’d be recommending an upgrade this soon, here we are.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Turns Phenomenal</h2>
<p>As long as the list of serious perks is for the AirPods Pro 3, we have to start with the active noise cancellation. It takes the formidable ANC of the Pro 2s and doubles it, creating the world’s best in-ear active noise cancellation. And now with as much of the outside world blocked out as you want, you can immerse yourself in the upgraded sound of the Pro 3s. Apple’s added a new acoustic architecture that really brings out the bass, but also the mids, vocals, and every facet of the music.</p>
<p>It’s also an improved Spatial Audio sound, which will have you turning your head to move the sound source over and over until you get used to just how realistic the effect is. And you can move your head or any other part of your body as much as you like with the AirPods Pro 3, because in addition to the more contoured design, they also come with five sets of ear tips to ensure a more secure fit. The AirPods were already great workout buds, but the better fit and the new heart-rate-sensing feature that links to the Move ring and step count on your iPhone, and also the Apple Intelligence-powered Workout Buddy feature.</p>



<h2>All-Day Listening</h2>
<p>Active Noise Cancellation is a notoriously greedy feature when it comes to battery life, but the AirPods Pro 3 give you 8 full hours of ANC listening time on a single charge, and 10 hours in Transparency mode, even if you engage the Hearing Aid feature that’s been carried over and enhanced from the AirPods Pro 2. The Hearing Aid feature now has automatic Conversation Boost and active Hearing Protection to safeguard your ears when the environment around you gets overly loud. (Think live sporting events or construction zones.)</p>
<p>If putting the brand-new AirPods Pro 3 on sale is Apple’s opening move for Black Friday and Cyber Week, it’s a sign of a truly epic holiday shopping season to come. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">This Amazon deal for $220 is the lowest price yet on the AirPods Pro 3, and they’re a worthy upgrade even from their famously great predecessors.</a></p>

              <p><em>Command &amp; Conquer</em>‘s legendary Lord Yuri, Udo Kier, has died aged 81. The news of the death of the well-loved German actor on Sunday morning was <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/udo-kier-dead-own-private-idaho-andy-warhol-frankenstein-1236590259/">shared by his partner</a> Delbert McBride, followed by an impassioned online tribute from Hideo Kojima.</p> <p>For games players, Kier is most immediately identifiable as Lord Yuri, in what’s widely considered to be one of the best&nbsp;<em>Command &amp; Conquer</em> games,&nbsp;<em>Red Alert 2</em>. Leader of the Soviet Psychic Corps, Yuri was the antagonist of the game, and the star of the esteemed expansion pack,&nbsp;<em>Yuri’s Revenge</em>. The <em>C&amp;C</em> games were famous for their use of FMV and real-world actors, making Kier a very familiar face to a generation of strategy gamers.</p>

 <p>Over his career, Kier appeared in over 220 films, working with legends like Lars von Trier, Werner Herzog, Gus Van Saint and Alexander Payne, and most recently was due to star in Hideo Kojima’s mysterious next game,&nbsp;<em>OD</em>. In the game, co-written with Jordan Peele, Kier was due to play one of the lead roles, alongside Sophia Lillis and Hunter Schafer. Kojima reacted to the news of Kier’s death this morning on X, calling the actor an “icon of his time.”</p>

 <p>According to Kojima’s post,&nbsp;<em>OD</em>‘s filming (the game, like so many of the creator’s, was due to use motion capture and astonishingly photorealistic faces for its characters) was delayed until 2026 by the recent voice actors strike, meaning none of Kier’s scenes have been shot. Kojima stated that despite this, the two had stayed in close contact, emailing one another and meeting up as recently as September. “He told me how much he was looking forward to the shoot starting up again next year,” said the video game director.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I’m at a loss for words. It all happened far too suddenly.<br>Because of the strike, we weren’t able to shoot “OD” for a long time, and we were forced to reschedule to next year. Even during that time, Udo and I exchanged emails frequently. We stayed in close contact. When we met in… <a href="https://t.co/aRpP1i38CE">pic.twitter.com/aRpP1i38CE</a></p> <p>— HIDEO_KOJIMA (@HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1992785286712209409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Still a prolific actor in his 80s, Udo Kier had multiple projects in pre-production at the time of his death alongside&nbsp;<em>OD</em>, on top of the three movies in which he’d already appeared this year. Other video game roles for the actor included 2022’s&nbsp;<em>Martha Is Dead</em> and 2017’s&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: WWII</em>, but his portrayal as the ESP-wielding Lord Yuri will always be his most iconic.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung launches new flagship tablets every year and the latest models, like the Tab S11 series, easily cost upwards of $1,000. The 2024 Galaxy Tab A9+ finds its place in the <strong>middle of budget and premium</strong> and offers solid specs without the price of a flagship. You get an 11-inch tablet ready to provide a quality Android experience for consumption, casual gaming and productivity tasks. Now down to just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/">$149 from $219 for the 64GB/WiFi, it has reached a record-low price on Amazon for Black Friday</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Big Screen Entertainment</h2>
<p>It has an<strong> 11-inch display running at a resolution of 1920 x 1200</strong>, and provides sharp text and detailed video playback. The <strong>90Hz refresh rate</strong> gives you a noticeably smoother scrolling through apps and websites compared to the more common 60Hz on tablets. Peak brightness reaches 480 nits to give you good visibility outdoors or in bright rooms. The TFT LCD panel does a solid job with color reproduction-whether you’re watching shows, browsing photos, or reading e-books.</p>
<p><strong>Dolby Atmos powered quad speakers</strong> turn this tablet into a surprisingly capable media machine. Movies, TV shows, and music will all be augmented by the increased audio that fills a room. The speakers feature directional sound, a more immersive experience than that of single or dual speaker arrangements. You can comfortably watch content without having to use headphones and actually hear what is being said.</p>



<p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 69<strong> processor performs everyday tasks with competent performance</strong>. Streaming video, web browsing, social media scrolling, and casual gaming are relatively smooth. Similarly, 4GB of RAM manages multiple apps open simultaneously without excessive slowdown. You won’t mistake this for a flagship tablet when running demanding games or heavy multitasking, but it covers the basics reliably. The 64GB of internal storage <strong>expands up to 1TB via microSD card</strong> and gives you room for downloaded content and files.</p>
<p><strong><em>Multi Window Display</em> lets you run multiple apps side by side on the large screen</strong>: Browse the web while checking email, take notes while doing video calls, or refer to a document while writing in another app. This split-screen functionality turns the tablet into a productivity tool for real work: students can research and write papers in parallel, professionals can manage spreadsheets while being part of video conferences.</p>



<p>Quick Share makes it easy to transfer files across devices: <strong>Send photos, videos, or documents to other nearby Samsung devices, Android phones, or even iPhones</strong>. Choose the file you want to share, select the device nearby, and voilà! In a few seconds, your file transfers wirelessly. No more need for pesky email attachments or cloud uploads for simple file sharing. Immediately swap vacation photos with family members.</p>
<p>This Black Friday, the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ is $149 which means it offers solid tablet performance at an accessible price. You’re getting an 11-inch 90Hz display, quad speakers with Dolby Atmos, expandable storage up to 1TB, multi-window multitasking, and Samsung Kids parental controls for 32% off retail.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple manages impressive <a href="https://kotaku.com/apple-swallows-its-pride-macbook-air-falls-to-all-time-low-and-goes-2x-cheaper-than-pro-2000646450">25% discounts on MacBooks through Amazon during Black Friday</a>, but this HP laptop just shattered discount records with a massive 71% price drop.</p>
<p>Amazon dropped this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5860/">HP laptop to an all-time low of $859 for Black Friday, down from its usual $2,999 price tag</a>. For this price, you get a <strong>13th Gen Intel 10-core i5 processor, 17.3-inch Full HD display, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB SSD storage</strong>. Windows 11 Pro comes preloaded with Copilot AI, and HP includes a backlit keyboard plus fingerprint reader for security.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5860/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>10-Core Intel Power That Handles Real Work</h2>
<p>The 13th Generation Intel Core i5-1334U processor has <strong>10 cores that turbo boost up to 4.6GHz if you need that extra horsepower</strong>. The hybrid architecture splits the cores between performance and efficiency, throwing the heavy lifting of demanding tasks to powerful cores while background processes run on efficient cores. You can open multiple Chrome tabs, Microsoft Office applications, video conferencing software, and photo editing programs all at once without any lag.</p>
<p>The 32GB DDR4 RAM removes memory bottlenecks that plague laptops with 8GB or 16GB configurations. You keep dozens of browser tabs open, switch between heavy applications, and work with large datasets without seeing the dreaded spinning wheel. Virtual machines run smoothly for developers or IT professionals who need to test software across different environments.</p>



<p>The <strong>1TB PCIe NVMe SSD provides read speeds to make the entire system snappy</strong> and responsive. It boots up Windows in seconds, launches applications almost instantly, and complete file transfers in no time. The storage capacity holds an entire work library of documents, presentations, spreadsheets, photos, videos, and software installations without the constant management of the drive.</p>
<p>The<strong> 17.3-inch Full HD display provides serious screen real estate at 1920×1080 resolution</strong>. You can view full spreadsheets without horizontal scrolling, edit documents with toolbars visible, and run applications side-by-side comfortably. The anti-glare coating reduces eye strain during marathon work sessions and makes the screen readable in bright offices or near windows.</p>



<p><strong>Fingerprint reader security</strong> provides instant login without the need to type passwords every time one opens the laptop. Biometric authentication works quicker and more reliably than passwords, while it offers better security compared with simple PINs. You unlock the laptop with a quick touch of your finger, jumping right into work without delays in authentication. The fingerprint data remains stored locally on the device rather than in cloud databases.</p>
<p><strong>Wi-Fi 6 gives you faster wireless speeds</strong> and greater performance in crowded networks than ever before. Fast transfer of bulky files, smooth video streaming, and jitter-free video conferencing are now possible. <strong>Bluetooth 5.3</strong> connects your wireless mouse, keyboard, headphones, and other accessories with greater range and reliability. USB Type-A and Type-C ports support existing peripherals and accessories along with newer ones without the need for dongles.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 11 Pro</strong> incorporates enterprise features, remote desktop access, and domain joining for business users. Integration with Copilot AI will help users brainstorm ideas, organize tasks, create drafts of content, and answer questions directly in Windows. The AI assistant simplifies your workflow by automating routine tasks for you and displaying relevant suggested actions based on how you work.</p>
<p>This 17.3-inch laptop delivers 10-core Intel performance with 32GB RAM and 1TB SSD for nearly $2,000 off its usual price, at just $859.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-qrevo-curvx-drops-to-all-time-low-22000pa-beast-with-auto-hot-water-cleaning-falls-to-record-pricing-2000646746</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock holds the same premium position in robot vacuums that Dyson commands in traditional vacuums, with flagship models regularly exceeding $1,500 to $2,000. These luxury cleaning machines pack technology that separates them from budget competitors flooding the market.</p>
<p>The good news is that Amazon just dropped one of Roborock’s best-sellers<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5859/"> to an all-time low of $849 for Black Friday, nearly half off from its usual $1,499 price tag</a>. The <strong>Qrevo CurvX</strong> delivers 22,000Pa suction, zero-tangling design, reactive AI obstacle recognition and 80°C hot water mop washing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5859/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Technology That Solves Real Cleaning Problems</h2>
<p>The<strong> 22,000Pa HyperForce suction</strong> creates enough force to pull deeply embedded dirt from carpet pile and pulls debris from gaps in hardwood flooring. You can immediately tell the difference compared with a vacuum that has only 8,000-10,000Pa-suction power and tends to push dust instead of picking it up. Pet hair, long human hair up to 40cm, cereal crumbs, and tracked-in dirt-all get pulled into the dustbin in one pass. The zero-tangling design stops hair from tangling around the brushes, thus doing away with the maintenance nightmare of standard robot vacuums where you end up spending 15 minutes each week cutting tangled hair off rollers.</p>
<p>The <strong>ultra-slim profile, at only 3.14 inches, makes this the thinnest Roborock ever</strong> manufactured-just 7.98cm tall. This reduced height lets the robot glide under sofas, beds, and cabinets where dust bunnies really collect. Traditional robot vacuums with raised LiDAR domes get stuck or completely skip whole sections below furniture. This Roborock reaches those forgotten spaces and captures hidden dirt that ruins air quality even when visible floors appear clean.</p>



<p>Reactive AI obstacle recognition relies on structured light and an RGB camera to detect and avoid 108 different object types. It <strong>works both in bright and dark environments</strong> and navigates around toys, cables, pet bowls, shoes, and even furniture legs without getting stuck. You don’t have to preclean your floors before running the vacuum, which really changes the vacuum from a scheduled maintenance tool into something you can turn on spontaneously.</p>
<p>AdaptiLift Chassis is industry-first technology that <strong>can lift the entire robot up to 4cm or individually according to terrain</strong>. The system raises the front to climb high thresholds, adjusts side wheels to navigate around furniture legs, and lowers for tight clearances. This adaptability prevents the ‘stuck’ notifications which interrupt other robot vacuums in mid-clean.</p>
<p>The 80°C hot water washing of the mop dissolves stubborn stains and grease left by cold water. The dock heats water to 176°F before washing the mop pads to make sure they are thoroughly cleaned and sanitized after each use. Warm air drying at 113°F prevents mildew and odors from forming on damp mop pads. This focus on hygiene means your robot will never spread dirty water around on your floors in the course of subsequent cleaning.</p>



<p>The automated maintenance tasks handled by the<strong> Multifunctional Dock 3.0 Thermo+ mean you barely touch the robot</strong>. Auto dust emptying transfers collected debris to the dock’s larger bag, holding weeks of dirt. Auto tank refilling keeps the water reservoir full for mopping sessions. Intelligent dirt detection analyzes mop pad contamination and adjusts washing intensity accordingly. The dock performs self-cleaning with hot water, preventing the buildup that makes other docking stations smell terrible after a few weeks.</p>
<p>At $849, this Roborock delivers flagship cleaning technology and hot water mop washing for $650 off the usual price. You are getting premium features that normally would call for an outlay in excess of $1,500+, skimping on very few minor conveniences.</p>
