              <p>The laptop market is drowning in hundreds of models, each claiming to be the perfect fit and honestly, it’s exhausting trying to figure out which one actually delivers daily performance without unnecessary extras. If you need a powerful machine that handles real work without drama, this Dell Inspiron 15.6-inch touchscreen laptop (16GB RAM, 1.25TB Storage) checks every box, especially at its current price: Dell rarely drops discounts below 30 percent on its own site, but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4851/">Amazon just slashed this model to an all-time low of $699, down from $1,999</a>. That’s a <strong>65 percent reduction</strong> on a laptop built for people who actually use their computers for more than checking email.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4851/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Processing Power That Can Keep Up With Your Load</h2>
<p>The 13th Gen Intel Core i5-1334U processor is where this notebook diverges from budget laptops. This is the<strong> 10-core processor with hybrid architecture: two performance cores that operate between 1.3GHz and 4.6GHz to handle intensive jobs</strong>&nbsp;and eight efficiency cores that work between 0.9GHz and 3.4GHz to handle background processes.</p>
<p>The 12MB cache memory keeps often-used data on hand for quick grab and go, and eliminates the time your processor spends searching through RAM. Practically speaking, it means you can be on video conference calls and working on spreadsheet edits, churning out presentations and keeping hundreds of browser tabs open without the system grinding to an unresponsive crawl.</p>



<p>The 16GB DDR4 RAM provides you the working memory you need to handle heavy multitasking. RAM is where programs youre currently running live, and more room means more smooth-as-silk performance when youre running several programs. Storage is provided by the lightning-fast 1TB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD. <strong>PCIe NVMe SSDs are the fastest consumer storage tech available</strong> and cut boot times and file copies by orders of magnitude over old hard drives or earlier SATA SSDs. The system comes with an<strong> included second 256GB SD card</strong> to boost overall storage to 1.25TB to accommodate massive media libraries.</p>
<p>The 15.6-inch FHD touchscreen uses WVA panel technology. This ensures colors stay consistent when viewed from the side whcih is crucial during collaborative work sessions. The 1920 x 1080 resolution delivers sharp text and detailed images while the anti-glare coating reduces eye strain during long work sessions and makes the screen readable in bright environments. The narrow border design maximizes screen real estate without increasing the laptop’s footprint, keeping it portable while maintaining a comfortable viewing area. <strong>Intel Iris Xe Graphics handles visual processing</strong> and offers smooth performance for video playback.</p>



<p>The Realtek Wi-Fi 6 card has faster speeds and better performance in busy networks compared to Wi-Fi 5, which is essential for video conferencing and cloud office collaboration. Bluetooth accommodates wireless mice, headphones, and keyboard. <strong>Port options are USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A and Type-C to transfer data quickly, USB 2.0 to connect to previous accessories, HDMI 1.4 to connect an external monitor, headset jack, and SD card slot</strong>. The <span>bundled 8-in-1 docking station</span> accommodates more connectivity with additional USB ports and SD slots and an RJ-45 ethernet connector to remain connected by wire and output the HDMI signal to an external monitor.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Professional is available in S Mode to limit installations to Microsoft Store applications for increased security. S Mode can be switched off permanently if traditional desktop applications are required. The keyboard is full size and has the familiar 10-key numerical keypad to handle spreadsheet work and data entry.</p>
<p>With these specifications at $699, you get hardware worth $1500 to $2,000 even on sale.</p>

              <p>If you’ve been around LEGO collecting for any amount of time, you know the deal: <strong>Star Wars sets are the crown jewel of the entire catalog</strong>, the most popular licensed theme LEGO has ever produced, and discounts? They’re about as rare as finding a mint condition Boba Fett mini-figurine at a garage sale.</p>
<p>That’s what makes this current Amazon deal so unique: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">Millennium Falcon 25th Anniversary edition just hit an all-time low of $67, down from $84</a>. This is a commemorative piece celebrating a quarter-century of LEGO Star Wars magic, and seeing it at this price is the kind of opportunity that doesn’t come around often.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mid-Scale Marvel That Demands Attention</h2>
<p>There are <strong>921 pieces in the set and the final product</strong> is an accurately detailed replica of the Millennium Falcon exactly as it appeared in the first movie, A New Hope. All the important details are there: the celebrated cockpit where Han and Chewie plotted the movie’s famous narrow escapes, the satellite dish that’s almost as iconic as the ship and those cannons mounted cheek by jowl to blast TIE fighters to pieces. Details are incredibly fine giving the mid-scale size of the build: you can’t quite hide them away but they’re not so big that they’re nothing but eye candy.</p>
<p>The included stand isn’t just functional: it tilts the Falcon at a dynamic angle that makes it look like it’s banking through an asteroid field or making the jump to light speed. The stand features a nameplate and a commemorative LEGO Star Wars 25th Anniversary brick, and turns this from a simple model into a proper collectible piece. At <strong>5 inches high, 9.5 inches long, and 7.5 inches wide</strong> when mounted, it strikes that perfect balance between being substantial enough to showcase and compact enough to find a home on a bookshelf.</p>



<p>The set itself provides that elusive LEGO experience adults seek: substantial enough to be compelling over the course of multiple building sessions but not so gigantic that it’s a months-long affair like the 7,500-piece Ultimate Collector’s Edition. It’s included within LEGO’s Starship Collection, an individual line aimed specifically at adult builders who want display-worthy models but not furniture-sized builds. Over the course of several pleasant evenings, the 921 pieces come together to provide that calm and focused building experience that’s become one of the key attractions of adult LEGO sets.</p>
<p>For the price, it’s an affordable way to get into Star Wars collecting if you’re new to the franchise or an automatic purchase if you’re an existing fan. As a gift set, it’s perfect, the box presentation is high-end and the ages 18+ warning is an indication the set is aimed at adult sensibilities. At an all-time low price, this won’t be around long, so now’s the time to make the jump if you’re looking at this Falcon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What would <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> be like if your fights with people and creatures played out like matches in <em>Mortal Kombat</em>? That’s the thought experiment at the center of <a href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-streamer-blurbs-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-voice-mod-1851443327">streamer Blurbs</a>‘ latest mod for the Rockstar open-world game. There’s lots of punching, lots of blood, and some downright nuts fatalities.</p> <p>Blurbs has transformed mod-making into a communal activity by having fans contribute ideas and constructing and testing them in real time as viewers <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=comments&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbmhOVmdlUEJCc3RCVDZkLUhBTF9IMkI0MWhEZ3xBQ3Jtc0trVmQ1WjdyS3JDZjJ3VFBoVXh0Y2VUZ09OYWdKY2tBRUhzTS1aRVMzcUJOUGhHZFRPNWRjUXB5a0pHTFNDTDdBQWYzWTdSc2I2ekxIT3p1YmJEYkJKLVdrRFkxcG1wVUptVURnQmVuMjRrNUdSTVRDYw&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitch.tv%2Fblurbs">watch on Twitch</a>.&nbsp; Last time it was a <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> mod that shows you <a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-mod-video-npc-memories-blurbs-2000631070">the dying memories</a> of all the NPCs you murder. Now, for <em>Red Dead Mortal Kombat</em>, he starts with a basic mechanic where any time you punch someone, the camera flips to a side-by-side view like a fighting game and builds from there.</p>

  <p>Blurbs even went ahead and added rudimentary animations, sound effects, and cheat codes that need to be entered for fatalities. In one, Arthur Morgan lets out a tuberculosis-filled cough that makes the opponent explode in a geyser of blood. In another, the loser is pushed out in front of a runaway train that obliterates them.</p>

 <p>But the mod doesn’t just allow Arthur to fight people. In the video above showing off the mod, Blurbs also has Arthur go head-to-head with an alligator, a deer, and a grizzly bear. That last one does not go well for him.</p> <p>He’s currently taking requests for <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> mods.&nbsp;“My whole mission is overproducing really dumb ideas that no one else would ever think to make,” he told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>.</p>
