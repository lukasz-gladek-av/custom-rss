What followed is one of the most indelible sequences in the show’s short history: the normally stoic Milchick dancing under Technicolor lighting like he was transported back to the ‘70s with quaaludes steering his limbs. The unabashed joy and unhinged dancing were jarring in a place where handshakes only transpired after formal requests. It also shocked the people who made the show.</p><p>“We had a choreographer who came, but basically, Tramell just kind of went off and said, ‘I’ve got some ideas. I’ve got some thoughts.’ Then, they just showed me this dance he came up with,” Stiller jokingly says.</p><p>Lumon workspaces are typically monotonously mundane, barren of anything but four interconnected cubicles. Disrupting that with this foolishness seven episodes into the season added a somewhat terrifying levity that makes the bleakness of the characters’ everyday lives more apparent. That’s because every detail in the show seems meticulously arranged, down to the  lights used in the scene, which Stiller revealed he hoped “wouldn’t break the reality” of the show. </p><p>The surprise on the Innies’ faces when the lights started changing colors underscored the strangeness of scenario, and was pretty genuine. “We didn’t know the lights were going to change until we were shooting the scene,” Scott reveals. </p><p>There are only two more episodes left for the podcast to break down. They’ll also be sharing tidbits about the new season of <em>Severance</em> as each episode airs. Let’s hope, at some point, we’ll get some answers about those damn goats. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That means, if you’re running with randos, that it’s entirely possible you’ll end up with a team of people who instalock their favorite damage-dealing Duelist character and leave you to babysit. <em>Rivals</em>’ roster makeup is a factor as well, with Duelists accounting for nearly 20 slots of the 35 playable heroes in the game. It’s only natural that many players would land on one of them as a favorite.</p><p>Credit where credit is due, <em>Marvel Rivals </em>plays around with the core elements of the DPS role. It has a great mix of melee, snipers, and everything in between. Which characters you gravitate toward will undoubtedly boil down to your playstyle, but we’ll try and be fair to everyone as we rank the best and worst of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ Duelists.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6897e9969b9add5684156ef551029396" data-recommend-id="image://6897e9969b9add5684156ef551029396" data-format="png" data-width="1000" data-height="562" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Widow stands with her rifle in her right hand pointed downward." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Black Widow stands with her rifle in her right hand pointed downward." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6897e9969b9add5684156ef551029396" data-recommend-id="image://6897e9969b9add5684156ef551029396" data-format="png" data-width="1000" data-height="562" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Widow stands with her rifle in her right hand pointed downward." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Natasha, who is clearly meant to be the Widowmaker character in NetEase’s hero shooter, is one of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ most unfortunate <em>Overwatch </em>knock-offs. The inevitable direct comparison highlights that, for as much as she may have been modeled on Blizzard’s sniper, Black Widow is nevertheless a significantly inferior version of the archetype. Unlike her <em>Overwatch </em>counterpart, Black Widow can’t one-shot with her rifle. That makes her a lot less frustrating to go up against, but it also means that she’ll often be more reliant on her teammates to shave off enough damage that one well-placed headshot can take out a foe. And when so many characters in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>are incredibly mobile and can rush her down in seconds, she just isn’t as dominant as she could be. If NetEase does decide to give her a one-shot kill, the community will lose its mind. But until then, she gets to kick off this ranking at the very bottom.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5a3b1b91319092840572392114d80ca6" data-recommend-id="image://5a3b1b91319092840572392114d80ca6" data-format="png" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wolverine stands with one of his giant hands held up." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Wolverine stands with one of his giant hands held up." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5a3b1b91319092840572392114d80ca6" data-recommend-id="image://5a3b1b91319092840572392114d80ca6" data-format="png" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wolverine stands with one of his giant hands held up." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Logan, the comic-accurate short king, is a decent rush-down character who is greatly outclassed by most others in the role. He’s got some okay tankiness for survivability, he can slice a squishy enemy hero to bits if he manages to corner them, and his Feral Leap ability is pretty forgiving of even the least accurate aiming. But that’s kind of all he’s good for. His Team-Up ability with Hulk in which the big green guy throws Wolverine so he can get in close is fun, but he’s a little too easy to counter.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bb07a853f7ffd8db33f9e60aeafc39e7" data-recommend-id="image://bb07a853f7ffd8db33f9e60aeafc39e7" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wanda stands with red energy emanating from her hands." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Wanda stands with red energy emanating from her hands." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bb07a853f7ffd8db33f9e60aeafc39e7" data-recommend-id="image://bb07a853f7ffd8db33f9e60aeafc39e7" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Wanda stands with red energy emanating from her hands." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Wanda was always destined to become less impactful as players spent more time with <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. On the plus side, Scarlet Witch has decent damage and an explosive ultimate that <em>can </em>be very effective if you find interesting ways to combo it with the right abilities. In the early days, her Reality Erasure ultimate, which nuked anyone within a decent radius, was terrifying in the same way D.Va’s Self-Destruct is in <em>Overwatch</em>. However, it has so many more weaknesses to exploit that it has made Scarlet Witch one of the least optimal picks in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>right now. Wanda has to charge up the attack, move slowly through the air while exposed to get into position, and as she screams “Pure! Chaos!” she’s so vulnerable that she can be crowd-controlled or just killed before she even gets a chance to set it off. She’s just too predictable these days. Her own CC ability is decent, but ultimately there are better picks who don’t leave themselves open to wasting an ult every team fight. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="87f7fedf04113d9e938844666c23be54" data-recommend-id="image://87f7fedf04113d9e938844666c23be54" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Spider-Man stands with his arms by his sides." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Spider-Man stands with his arms by his sides." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="87f7fedf04113d9e938844666c23be54" data-recommend-id="image://87f7fedf04113d9e938844666c23be54" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Spider-Man stands with his arms by his sides." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man has one of the most devastating ultimates in the game, but he’s otherwise a bit finicky. Swinging around the map is as satisfying as it’s been in any game starring the web-slinger (if you mess around with the settings, at least), and it’s always fun to yank an enemy into a chasm with your web, but Spidey sometimes feels map-dependent and can be easily punished for poor play. That ultimate, though. When I hear “Don’t mess with the Amazing Spider-Man!” I know I have only a few seconds to move before I’m about to see Uncle Ben.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f5e3b3377ece980a57b35bc781b91688" data-recommend-id="image://f5e3b3377ece980a57b35bc781b91688" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iron Man hovers in his suit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Iron Man hovers in his suit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5e3b3377ece980a57b35bc781b91688" data-recommend-id="image://f5e3b3377ece980a57b35bc781b91688" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iron Man hovers in his suit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When Tony Stark has a Hulk on his team, he can rain down a ton of damage from the skies. Otherwise, he still does that but it’s a lot less impressive. Iron Man can be a real pest in the right hands, but his air-based playstyle leaves him more static than you might think. A good hitscan hero can ground him pretty easily and even in the best circumstances, he often has to choose between damage output and the slightest mobility. It makes him a well-balanced hero in the grand scheme of things, but it also means that one of the smartest men in the Marvel universe is constantly leaving himself open to anti-air fire. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9ed5d8f6980da58910ee9f1874134aaf" data-recommend-id="image://9ed5d8f6980da58910ee9f1874134aaf" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Punisher holds a rifle in his hands." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Punisher holds a rifle in his hands." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9ed5d8f6980da58910ee9f1874134aaf" data-recommend-id="image://9ed5d8f6980da58910ee9f1874134aaf" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Punisher holds a rifle in his hands." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Every hero shooter needs a standard point-and-shoot guy, and the Punisher is that in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. He’s the most straightforward character on the roster, and that means he’s good at looking down the barrel of his gun and shooting whatever’s in front of him. His turret and gatling gun ultimate can shred through even the tankiest heroes on the field, but the latter also makes him easy to flank, and by the time you’re out of your turret and mobile again, you’re probably already dead. Overall, the Punisher is solid and will do exactly what he needs to.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e81c3d4529650145c8978e5db085dbe2" data-recommend-id="image://e81c3d4529650145c8978e5db085dbe2" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Namor holds his trident while looking at the camera with some disdain usually reserved for scornful teenagers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Namor holds his trident while looking at the camera with some disdain usually reserved for scornful teenagers." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e81c3d4529650145c8978e5db085dbe2" data-recommend-id="image://e81c3d4529650145c8978e5db085dbe2" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Namor holds his trident while looking at the camera with some disdain usually reserved for scornful teenagers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Namor’s turrets are some of my favorite tools in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, but they can also frustrate me as a user just as much as they probably annoy my foes being pelted by the octopus-like monstro spawn shooting them from whatever vantage point I can place them in. The King of the Seas is a defense-driven builder character who is good at setting up a fortified space on an objective. You can throw his turrets into any nook and cranny you can reach and they’ll automatically pepper enemy foes with decent damage and push them back as they attempt to advance on the point. His trident throws are slow but strong, and while his whale-summoning ultimate only does okay damage, it’s a quick deploy with good crowd control. That being said, if someone dives on you, you’re probably fucked, and his turrets aren’t static fixtures you can set and forget. They disappear after only a few seconds, and it makes it harder to create good setups and get value out of them; if you set up too early, you’ll lose time with them on the field, and if you set up too late, you’re probably going to end up just throwing them somewhere to do even a bit of damage while you’re getting swarmed. Playing Namor well requires game sense and timing, and I wouldn’t be mad if NetEase made it so his turrets stayed present until they were destroyed, but for now, he’s good at what he does.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="54e1a3f0ee20d95f9275bcd88807260b" data-recommend-id="image://54e1a3f0ee20d95f9275bcd88807260b" data-format="png" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mister Fantastic stands with his arms crossed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mister Fantastic stands with his arms crossed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="54e1a3f0ee20d95f9275bcd88807260b" data-recommend-id="image://54e1a3f0ee20d95f9275bcd88807260b" data-format="png" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mister Fantastic stands with his arms crossed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I have become a Mister Fantastic main since he launched last week, and I was surprised to hear most people think Reed Richards is one of the worst characters in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. Based on his placement here, I obviously disagree. Mister Fantastic is surprisingly tanky, with most of his kit being focused on survivability and slow but strong swings of his stretchy arms. I wouldn’t be surprised if in a year’s time, Reed has been moved to the Vanguard role considering his entire schtick is absorbing damage to send it back to enemies and raising the defenses of his teammates through shields. But for now, I still find myself wrecking shop in his inflated state, zipping around by latching onto friends and enemies, and being an absolute bother as I bounce on the point with my ultimate. He’s one of the most interesting and effective brawlers in the game if you know how to use him.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0af2efabe2668cb809a641764fead811" data-recommend-id="image://0af2efabe2668cb809a641764fead811" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Storm hovers as her cape flows in the wind." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Storm hovers as her cape flows in the wind." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0af2efabe2668cb809a641764fead811" data-recommend-id="image://0af2efabe2668cb809a641764fead811" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Storm hovers as her cape flows in the wind." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>NetEase has taken some time to figure out Storm’s place in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. She started out Season 0 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvelrivals.com/heroes_data/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/heroes_data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with the lowest pick rate</a></span>, but has received some pretty substantial buffs in Season 1. Since then, the flight-based hero has become a much more reliable Duelist with higher damage output and sustainability. Storm also has some decent supportive abilities to empower her teammates, so she manages to stand out among the other flight-based heroes. Her ultimate is also still one of the most useful for clearing a group of enemies, as she’s able to unleash heaps of damage while not remaining stationary the way other heroes with high-damage AOE attacks have to. She’s got a lot of potential, so I’m interested to see what she looks like in a season or two.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6a0bb2cef1213598fd2ab60222aaf6d0" data-recommend-id="image://6a0bb2cef1213598fd2ab60222aaf6d0" data-format="png" data-width="1079" data-height="606" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Squirrel Girl holds a slingshot and a grey squirrel is perched on her shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Squirrel Girl holds a slingshot and a grey squirrel is perched on her shoulder." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6a0bb2cef1213598fd2ab60222aaf6d0" data-recommend-id="image://6a0bb2cef1213598fd2ab60222aaf6d0" data-format="png" data-width="1079" data-height="606" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Squirrel Girl holds a slingshot and a grey squirrel is perched on her shoulder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Squirrel Girl can pack a punch and she’s been helped by the Season 1 buffs that made her ultimate something actually worth fearing instead of just a mild inconvenience. Her explosive abilities are great at keeping people at bay without you having to be a living aimbot. She’s basically <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ Junkrat, and it’s good that NetEase has its own silly gremlin to occupy that playstyle. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="330e065d1c9cbecad69fc8f5f3fda7a9" data-recommend-id="image://330e065d1c9cbecad69fc8f5f3fda7a9" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Panther lifts up one of his claws." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Black Panther lifts up one of his claws." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="330e065d1c9cbecad69fc8f5f3fda7a9" data-recommend-id="image://330e065d1c9cbecad69fc8f5f3fda7a9" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Panther lifts up one of his claws." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A good T’Challa can be absolutely vicious in the enemy’s backline. His Vibranium Mark, which marks enemies after they’ve been struck by most of his abilities, allows him to immediately recharge his dash-based attack and helps sustain him with bonus health. The best way to use Black Panther is to master combos that maximize cooldowns and let you maintain a neverending onslaught of damage and mobility, zipping around enemy teams so fast they don’t have time to react. That chain-based kit does leave him vulnerable, however, as fumbling those combos will leave you without available abilities and open to enemy fire. That precision can be a lot to manage, but Black Panther is a force to be reckoned with when the player knows what they’re doing.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e081badaa15b793de95adca6b2840850" data-recommend-id="image://e081badaa15b793de95adca6b2840850" data-format="png" data-width="1079" data-height="606" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Moon Knight holds a crescent moon blade as his cape flows in the wind." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Moon Knight holds a crescent moon blade as his cape flows in the wind." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e081badaa15b793de95adca6b2840850" data-recommend-id="image://e081badaa15b793de95adca6b2840850" data-format="png" data-width="1079" data-height="606" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Moon Knight holds a crescent moon blade as his cape flows in the wind." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Moon Knight is the kind of setup character who can wreck an enemy team before they’ve realized he’s done anything. His playstyle revolves around ankhs he can place anywhere on the map that, when fired upon with his primary attack, will bounce around and do damage to enemies within a radius. If you place one of these and it escapes a foe’s notice, you can rack up so much damage before anyone on the enemy team even catches on. Making the most of him is a bit reliant on positioning and the good fortune of not drawing your enemies’ attention, but sneaking around, getting a good ankh placed, and going to town on a group of enemies never gets old, and also never stops being frustrating to deal with for more stationary heroes.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="39c5e9e9354844a9f85981d6eac9af5a" data-recommend-id="image://39c5e9e9354844a9f85981d6eac9af5a" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bucky stands with his metallic arm pressed against his chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bucky stands with his metallic arm pressed against his chest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="39c5e9e9354844a9f85981d6eac9af5a" data-recommend-id="image://39c5e9e9354844a9f85981d6eac9af5a" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bucky stands with his metallic arm pressed against his chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Again!</p><p>Again!</p><p>Again!</p><p>You heard that vividly in your head every time, right? Bucky is great at picking off multiple enemies very quickly thanks to his high damage and crowd-controlling maneuvers. He can pull people in close and/or punch them in the air, and each of these attacks puts them in the perfect position for a well-placed headshot. But really, the bread and butter of his moveset is his repeatable ultimate that lets him jump into the air and strike down on foes multiple times, as long as he’s landing kill shots within an incredibly gracious window. Winter Soldier’s ultimate has several interlinking systems that determine just how many times you get to bring the hurt down on unsuspecting foes on the ground, but when all the stars align and enemies are positioned just right, it deletes entire squads groveling underneath your mechanical fist.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2ba1282d3d7416b800284348a79554a4" data-recommend-id="image://2ba1282d3d7416b800284348a79554a4" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Star-Lord holds his pistols with one pointed in the air and the other at the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Star-Lord holds his pistols with one pointed in the air and the other at the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2ba1282d3d7416b800284348a79554a4" data-recommend-id="image://2ba1282d3d7416b800284348a79554a4" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Star-Lord holds his pistols with one pointed in the air and the other at the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Peter Quill is hands down one of the most fun characters to play in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. He’s a more mobile evolution of Tracer from <em>Overwatch</em> with a little Reaper and Soldier: 76 sprinkled in there to fill out his kit. The dual-pistol-wielding smartass zips around the map with a fluidity not afforded to pretty much any other flight-based hero on the roster. His hit-and-run playstyle lets him get in close, spray enemies with a barrage of bullets, then quickly escape to reposition and do it all over again. Hit ultimate ability automatically locks onto enemies from a good distance as he gains infinite flight. It’s one of the best flanking abilities in all of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, but it’s also well-balanced enough that it’s not an instant win button. He’s the kind of character that feels good to play, but also feels good to play against.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b7572bd65d7a5a1699b61c21c6abe776" data-recommend-id="image://b7572bd65d7a5a1699b61c21c6abe776" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Magik stands with one hand on her hip and the other holding her sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magik stands with one hand on her hip and the other holding her sword." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b7572bd65d7a5a1699b61c21c6abe776" data-recommend-id="image://b7572bd65d7a5a1699b61c21c6abe776" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Magik stands with one hand on her hip and the other holding her sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Speaking of hit-and-run characters, Magik is all about mind games at close range. Her slower sword swings are offset by her mobility, allowing her to cleave through enemies and then pop back to safety through a teleport. Despite her melee-based playstyle, she’s not a brawler per se. Trying to beat up an entire enemy team as Magik is how you end up back in spawn, but a strategic dive can take out your enemy’s backline in seconds. When she pops her ult, her entire kit becomes more destructive and that’s when she’s able to really deal some damage. But even without that, Magik can reliably get picks no matter what.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5dc32a8774eebacdf59fab908f84a8b3" data-recommend-id="image://5dc32a8774eebacdf59fab908f84a8b3" data-format="png" data-width="1079" data-height="606" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iron Fist stands in a combat stance with his hands raised." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Iron Fist stands in a combat stance with his hands raised." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5dc32a8774eebacdf59fab908f84a8b3" data-recommend-id="image://5dc32a8774eebacdf59fab908f84a8b3" data-format="png" data-width="1079" data-height="606" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iron Fist stands in a combat stance with his hands raised." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re looking to get right up in an enemy’s face, you can’t go wrong with Iron Fist. He’s arguably one of the best melee-based characters in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> with a focus on survivability, quick hits, and mobility that even lets him keep up with an Iron Man as he flies away in fear. No one in the game is able to incessantly pester people like Iron Fist can. When he’s not throwing punches and kicks, he’s blocking enemy attacks and recycling all that incoming fire into shields so he can punch and kick them some more. His entire kit fuels a repeating cycle of fists and feet barraging an enemy until they’re either dead or they start running away. Iron Fist’s ultimate cranks all of these already incredible abilities up to 11, allowing him to pummel enemies into the ground with speed and simplicity. He’s a menace, and any character without the mobility to avoid him (and even some who can fly out of a fight) hates to see him coming.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9d0f820676772468cce8d0d11b574535" data-recommend-id="image://9d0f820676772468cce8d0d11b574535" data-format="png" data-width="1079" data-height="606" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Psylocke stands with one arm by her side the other raised to her chest with two fingers extended." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Psylocke stands with one arm by her side the other raised to her chest with two fingers extended." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9d0f820676772468cce8d0d11b574535" data-recommend-id="image://9d0f820676772468cce8d0d11b574535" data-format="png" data-width="1079" data-height="606" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Psylocke stands with one arm by her side the other raised to her chest with two fingers extended." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The last of the X-Men on this list is one of the most efficient assassins in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. When Psylocke gets into the thick of a fight she can take out squishy heroes with a few shuriken tosses, then quickly escape and hide thanks to her invisibility. She’s a ninja, and her kit reflects that. She’s all about quick, precise strikes and retreating to safety and secrecy when needed. A sneak attack by a Psylocke is pretty much a guaranteed kill, and that ferocious killing intent extends to her ultimate, which is one of the best in the game. As she strikes down enemies in a pretty wide area of effect, even the most powerful heroes in the game will still get sliced up like butter under a hot knife.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="00675459194d4cc98cfc11db3c30277c" data-recommend-id="image://00675459194d4cc98cfc11db3c30277c" data-format="png" data-width="1079" data-height="606" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hawkeye stands with his bow in hand, pulling the string slightly." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hawkeye stands with his bow in hand, pulling the string slightly." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="00675459194d4cc98cfc11db3c30277c" data-recommend-id="image://00675459194d4cc98cfc11db3c30277c" data-format="png" data-width="1079" data-height="606" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hawkeye stands with his bow in hand, pulling the string slightly." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Everyone’s least favorite Avenger is easily the best one in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. Clint’s bow is somehow one of the most powerful weapons in the Marvel universe, capable of one-shotting most characters in NetEase’s shooter. Part of this is because of Hawkeye’s passive ability Archer’s Focus, which increases the damage of your arrows the longer you aim at a specific enemy, allowing you to easily clear the threshold of a one-shot kill if you land a headshot. There’s nothing quite as frustrating as the immediacy of dying by Hawkeye’s hand. You’ll be in the middle of a team fight, living your best life, and starting to make some headway in capturing an objective when-boom, you’re dead. Even after the nerfs at the beginning of Season 1, Hawkeye still has almost everyone in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> in his sights. Well, all except for one…</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ff51349a64f5b9c241cb32165e20ccc1" data-recommend-id="image://ff51349a64f5b9c241cb32165e20ccc1" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hela stands with one hand on her hip and the other holding a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hela stands with one hand on her hip and the other holding a sword." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ff51349a64f5b9c241cb32165e20ccc1" data-recommend-id="image://ff51349a64f5b9c241cb32165e20ccc1" data-format="png" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hela stands with one hand on her hip and the other holding a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I can’t believe NetEase watched the devastation the Marvel goddess of death was raining down upon the <em>Marvel Rivals</em> player base and thought a 25 HP nerf would be sufficient in Season 1. With a flick of her wrists, Hela can send hit-scan daggers across the battlefield that will two-shot most of the roster without all the focus you need to pull off something like that as Hawkeye. On top of her insane damage output, having a brief CC and some decent mobility means Hela has responses to most other playstyles. If she gets dove on, just hold an enemy in place and fly away, then throw daggers at their heads as you gently float down. If all of this wasn’t enough, her ultimate lets her leer over the map with a whopping 1000 HP as she lobs down chaos and destruction at her ant-like foes, cackling as she destroys them like the meaningless insects they are. Somebody call Surtur to start Ragnarok. I need this woman dead expeditiously.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

During the PS3 and PS4 eras he was center stage, promoting the platform as it transformed from just a disc-playing machine into a massive distribution network for digital downloads and online gaming. His last day at Sony is January 15, though he promises he’s not retiring from the games industry entirely. </p><p>His departure will, however, mark the end of a friendlier, more fan-facing PlayStation brand. While the PS5 is more dominant than ever, the company that powers it has all but faded into the background. Gone is the era of E3 press conferences and live fanfests. Yoshida was the last familiar face from that epoch, and now he’s gone too. </p><p>To mark the occasion, January’s “monthly picks” on the PlayStation Store were personally chosen by the Sony veteran to celebrate some of the platform’s past legacy, its best exclusives, and recent indie hits from new generations of game makers. Here’s the full list of 22 recommended games:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>﻿Nine Sols</em><br></li><li><em>Hades</em></li><li><em>Dead Cells</em></li><li><em>The Binding of Isaac: Repentance </em></li><li><em>Super Time Force Ultra</em></li><li><em>Doki Doki Literature Club</em></li><li><em>Sifu</em></li><li><em>Before Your Eyes</em></li><li><em>Inscryption</em></li><li><em>Persona 4 Golden</em></li><li><em>Genshin Impact</em></li><li><em>Fall Guys</em></li><li><em>Let It Die</em></li><li><em>Nioh 2</em></li><li><em>Ape Escape</em></li><li><em>Crash Bandicoot N-Sane Trilogy</em></li><li><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></li><li><em>Returnal</em></li><li><em>Bloodborne</em></li><li><em>Sound Shapes</em></li><li><em>Journey </em></li><li><em>Shadow of the Colossus </em></li></ul></blockquote><p>Let’s note a few standouts. One is <em>Before Your Eyes</em>, a PS VR2 game about a person reflecting on their past as they make their way into the afterlife. The scenes shift every time the player blinks, underlining the fleeting nature of time and our fragile grasp on our own memories. <em>Let It Die</em>, Grasshopper Manufacture’s 2016 cult-hit survival action game about climbing a tower, is another underrated shoutout. <em>Sound Shapes</em> also deserves more love. The 2012 music-based platformer doesn’t get talked about as much these days, but it speaks to how much more diverse Sony publishing used to be in the past (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/mango_lychee/status/1678838942202839040&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/mango_lychee/status/1678838942202839040" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its creator is quietly working on a new game</a></span>). </p><p>Most of the other names on the list are well-known at this point. If you haven’t already checked out <em>Nine Sols</em>, it’s a Metroidvania Souls-like in the vein of <em>Hollow Knight</em> that was one of 2024's best games. <em>Super Time Force Ultra</em>, meanwhile, is a retro shoot ‘em up in which the ghosts of prior failed runs help you out. It’s neat, pretty, and totally deserves a sequel. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/yosp/status/1878905474059554964&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/yosp/status/1878905474059554964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yoshida’s also playable in it</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
