We knew a few games that would be featured, including <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> and <em>South of Midnight</em>, but Microsoft had also teased a surprise announcement from a mystery studio, and the presentation started by reminding viewers that each game shown will be available on Game Pass at launch. If you want to watch the show yourself you can do so below, but for those who just want the bullet points, read on.</p></div></div><div><p>Kicking off the show was the surprise game: <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>. Team Ninja and <em>Bayonetta </em>developer PlatinumGames are working on a new <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>game in the style of the series’ 3D reboot trilogy that ran from 2004 to 2012. It  will feature two playable characters in returning protagonist Ryu Hayabusa and a new character named Yakumo who is following in Ryu’s footsteps to become a master ninja. Platinum seems like a perfect choice for reviving the series, which is known for stylish, fast-paced combat and its punishing difficulty. It will launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this fall.</p></div><div><p>After the <em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em>showcase, Team Ninja also announced it’s bringing a revamped version of <em>Ninja Gaiden II</em> to modern platforms today in the form of <em>Ninja Gaiden II Black</em>. It’s available on PC and Xbox Game Pass, so if you’re a subscriber you can grab it as part of your membership.</p></div><div><p>Next up was Compulsion Games showing off its dark fantasy adventure <em>South of Midnight</em>. The studio showed a bit of protagonist Hazel’s nature-based magic and how she utilizes it when fighting monsters that are inspired by Southern folklore and the game’s “Southern gothic” aesthetic. It’s giving PS2-era action game and I’m here for it. <em>South of Midnight </em>is coming to PC and Xbox Series X/S on April 8.</p></div><div><p>To give us a quick break between all the action-oriented games, Sandfall Interactive showed off <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. As the name implies, the turn-based RPG follows an expedition of people in a French-based fantasy world that is ruled over by a malevolent goddess who is able to kill people over a certain age. <em>Expedition 33 </em>marries real-time and turn-based combat, though it seems this will be highly customizable and those who prefer to keep the real-time elements to a minimum can do so. The game will launch on April 24 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p></div><div><p>Closing out the show was an extended look at <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>. The game is a prequel to the 2016 <em>Doom</em> and takes place in a hellscape that feels both futuristic and Middle Ages, a fusion that’s also reflected in the game’s  medieval-style weapons and mayhem. The shield saw, which basically functions like a Captain America shield with a buzzsaw attachment, was the star of the show, and you can use it to deflect attacks or throw it at enemies and watch it slice into them as you close in with your shotgun. Developer id Software also showed off giant mech and dragon combat, and I have to hand it to the <em>Doom </em>series, it knows how to capture “middle-school binder” excess and make it work. The game will launch on PC, Playstation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on May 15.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, we get to see the Doom Slayer<em> </em>during the wars in Hell that happened eons ago in the franchise’s timeline. (Yes, the series has lore, its not all super shotguns and demons.)</p><p>Here’s the full <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> presentation from the event: </p><p>In <em>Dark Ages</em>, the iconic Doom Slayer will face more enemies than ever before in <em>Serious Sam</em>-like battles in large battlefields.

And this time around, Id Software wants you to feel like a big, heavy tank instead of a high-flying jet fighter. The studio really wants players to “stand and fight” in this entry. To help really sell the fantasy of being an unstoppable warrior, <em>Dark Ages f</em>eatures three melee weapons with upgrades and finishers. Oh but don’t worry, there are plenty of wild medieval-themed firearms, too. And yes, you get a fully drivable mech, something teased in past games.</p><p>It ain’t all killing and blasting, though, as Id Software promises a lot of exploration and secrets to find. Large open levels, described by Id as “<em>Doom </em>sandboxes,” will include platforms and puzzles, and if you complete these challenges you’ll unlock upgrades to make the Doom Slayer a stronger murder machine. (Okay, I guess it does all come back to killing.) </p><p><em>Dark Ages</em> also features a bunch of difficulty sliders that will let you change how fast and hard the game is, making it easy for everyone to hop in and kill demons. </p><p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> arrives on Xbox, PlayStation, PC, and Game Pass on May 15. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
