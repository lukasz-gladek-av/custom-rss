              <p><span>One thing rich people love to do is miss the point. Entire multimedia franchises are built as critiques of powerful people using their money and influence to put the average Joe through some hellish trial for their own amusement, and then rich folks are like, ‚ÄúWhat if I remade that?‚Äù Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast, who has made a lot of YouTube content out of putting people in viral simulations of outlandish competitions or even dangerous situations with the promise of a cash prize, has already made a recreation of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeasts-irl-squid-game-sees-contestants-just-running-t-1848134062"><i><span>Squid Game</span></i></a><span>, the hugely popular Netflix series which was intended to be a commentary on the power the wealthy wield over the impoverished. Now, he‚Äôs apparently considering doing the same for </span><i><span>The Hunger Games</span></i><span>, a dystopian franchise about a society where the wealthy and powerful who reside in the Capitol treat the common citizen like cattle and make them kill each other for sport.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><i><span>The Today Show</span></i><span>, Donaldson was seemingly caught off-guard when the interviewer asked him about his plans for a </span><i><span>Hunger Games</span></i><span> recreation. He did say that the idea would ‚Äúobviously‚Äù not pit people against one another in a fight to the death, with the concept instead being to put ‚Äúpotentially 26 random people‚Äù on an island and have them use something like laser tag guns instead of real weapons to eliminate each other, with the last person standing winning a million dollars.</span></p>    <p><span>‚ÄúI think that would absolutely crush because yes, we recreated </span><i><span>Squid Game</span></i><span>, but we also rebuilt Willy Wonka‚Äôs Chocolate Factory,‚Äù Donaldson said on </span><i><span>The Today Show</span></i><span>. ‚ÄúI have a chocolate company, and we gave golden tickets and brought people out, and people loved it. A lot of times, we just bring these fictional ideas to life, and people love seeing it.‚Äù</span></p> <p><span>Donaldson isn‚Äôt wrong that people love to experience a facsimile of their favorite fictional worlds. It‚Äôs why theme parks are so popular, and you can find an escape room based on all your favorite horror franchises. I‚Äôm sure his team will have no shortage of people volunteering as tribute, but I still think that recreating these stories, even if they aren‚Äôt actually putting people in deadly situations, involves taking advantage of those in need in order to profit from the theater and spectacle of it all. MrBeast has </span><a href="https://www.beastphilanthropy.org/"><span>used his position to do a lot of good</span></a><span>, but I can‚Äôt help feeling like using </span><i><span>The Hunger Games</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Squid Game</span></i><span> as reference points for your real-world game shows just makes everyone involved look like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-slur-n-word-clip-2017-controversy-explained-1851612313"><span>caricatures of the sadistic game makers</span></a><span> these dystopian stories are meant to critique.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><i><span>Spider-Man: Brand New Day </span></i><span>just started filming this month in Glasgow. Marvel‚Äôs team turned the Scottish city </span><a href="https://x.com/Clyde1News/status/1951237551877996843"><span>into a stand-in for NYC</span></a><span> so Tom Holland could swing around and do sick flips while wearing a new red-and-blue suit. Over the weekend, Marvel and Sony released a teaser video of Holland in the new suit, and it‚Äôs giving ‚Äúback to basics.‚Äù&nbsp;</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="SPIDER-MAN: BRAND NEW DAY - Tom Holland New Suit Reveal" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vsn7sVxCq1M?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>At a glance, that probably doesn‚Äôt seem like a big deal. He‚Äôs wearing a Spider-Man suit that looks like plenty of others. If you‚Äôve been around Marvel fans long enough, however, you‚Äôll find that people have very strong opinions on costuming, especially as the MCU movies have become so reliant on CG that some actors </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BhkdYGJF4k0/"><span>will play out scenes in motion-tracking tech suits</span></a><span> instead of what you‚Äôll eventually see them wearing on screen. Spider-Man has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/spiderman-2-peter-parker-best-suits-playstation-5-1850950369"><span>so many different looks</span></a><span> across comics, movies, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-spider-man-2-review-ps5-venom-miles-morales-1850929271"><span>video games</span></a><span>, and television shows that fans of the web slinger love to argue about the most minute details in each appearance. Now, there are a lot of set pictures and videos being taken by passersby in Glasgow that show Holland and his stunt doubles swinging around in the full suit, and they‚Äôre making even those who doubted the suit believers.</span></p> <p><span>As some viewers have pointed out in the trailer‚Äôs comments section, Holland‚Äôs suit looks like an homage to those worn by Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield, the previous Spider-Man actors who both appear in </span><i><span>No Way Home</span></i><span> back in 2021. The raised webbing is a big part of what made those suits distinctive, but that‚Äôs not the only element of the design that seems to draw from the outfits of prior Peters. The spider symbol is much larger than it was on the Tony Stark-developed suits Holland‚Äôs Peter has worn throughout his movies, but also looks more practically made rather than leaning into the high-tech maximalism of some of the later suits in </span><i><span>Infinity War</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>No Way Home</span></i><span>. Since </span><i><span>No Way Home </span></i><span>ended with Peter losing his connection to the rest of the MCU via Doctor Strange making the world forget him, he has to go back to making his own suits rather than relying on Stark tech. His making something that pays tribute to the Spider-Men who helped him save the world, while also going to something homemade, is a nice touch.</span></p>

 <p><span>All of that is cool from a character design standpoint, but it‚Äôs also really nice to see Peter wearing something vibrant and comic-accurate. That has caught a lot of fans‚Äô attention, as the set photos and videos that are sprouting up online show that the suit looks great in motion as Holland swings through Fake New York. As this is happening, fans are also pointing out that some of the set photos from the upcoming </span><i><span>Punisher </span></i><span>TV special and the second season of </span><i><span>Daredevil: Born Again</span></i><span> also show stars Jon Bernthal and Charlie Cox in more vibrant and comic-accurate costuming than people have come to expect from the MCU.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="und" dir="ltr">raw <a href="https://t.co/SOR51TIvYP">pic.twitter.com/SOR51TIvYP</a></p> <p>‚Äî ·¥¢·¥Ä è‚òÜ (@booyakabungala) <a href="https://twitter.com/booyakabungala/status/1952881844757680368?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Brand New Day set photo just casually blessing us with the HARDEST Spider-Man shot you‚Äôve ever seen. <a href="https://t.co/UxfNwO0kks">pic.twitter.com/UxfNwO0kks</a></p> <p>‚Äî Parker üï∏üï∑ (@mcuspider616) <a href="https://twitter.com/mcuspider616/status/1952839449227755676?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I‚Äôm never shutting up about how good this Spider-man suit looks ü•πü•≤ <a href="https://t.co/LmiCGQ2lOO">pic.twitter.com/LmiCGQ2lOO</a></p> <p>‚Äî Cris Parker (@3CFilmss) <a href="https://twitter.com/3CFilmss/status/1952053318034845774?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">these are legit the best set photos we‚Äôve ever gotten of tom‚Äôs spider-man &amp; it‚Äôs legit only day 4 of filming‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/Fg7LrTWF9I">pic.twitter.com/Fg7LrTWF9I</a></p> <p>‚Äî Matt Ramos (@therealsupes) <a href="https://twitter.com/therealsupes/status/1952905783831871670?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is the most Spider-Man anyone has ever looked <a href="https://t.co/TpFQFkhOuR">https://t.co/TpFQFkhOuR</a></p> <p>‚Äî Logan (@DiamondSpiderP) <a href="https://twitter.com/DiamondSpiderP/status/1952892187399565383?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Holy fucking shit <a href="https://t.co/IHPO3ZvIiR">pic.twitter.com/IHPO3ZvIiR</a></p> <p>‚Äî That REDACTED Guy (@REDACTEDSpider) <a href="https://twitter.com/REDACTEDSpider/status/1952552801256816950?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Brand New Day <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SpiderMan?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SpiderMan</a> <a href="https://t.co/EaT0TnDtKS">pic.twitter.com/EaT0TnDtKS</a></p> <p>‚Äî Digital_Nomad_ (@DigitalNMD) <a href="https://twitter.com/DigitalNMD/status/1952912982117077444?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">C‚Äômon dawg. <br>New York has never been more active. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SpiderMan?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SpiderMan</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Punisher?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Punisher</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/DareDevil?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#DareDevil</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BackLikeWeNeverLeft?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BackLikeWeNeverLeft</a> <a href="https://t.co/tsunzaTfm3">pic.twitter.com/tsunzaTfm3</a></p> <p>‚Äî bailey (@devdweight) <a href="https://twitter.com/devdweight/status/1952577231257219239?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>While the practical suits are nice, one character in </span><i><span>Brand New Day </span></i><span>who will require some CGI is the Hulk, who is set to finally make his MCU big screen return after last appearing in the post-credits scene of </span><i><span>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</span></i><span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Rockstar Games co-founder Dan Houser finally has a publisher for his first project since <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. A game banned from Steam amid the NSFW censorship crackdown goes free-to-download. And Microsoft‚Äôs canceled ‚Äú<em>Blade Runner</em> meets <em>Destiny</em>‚Äù MMORPG <em>Blackbird</em> continues to sound really cool in fresh leaks. Welcome to <em>Kotaku</em>‚Äòs latest Morning Checkpoint, a daily rundown of what‚Äôs going on in gaming and beyond, like what James Gunn‚Äôs Superman would have looked like <a href="https://variety.com/2024/film/news/superman-trunks-costume-james-gunn-resisted-david-corenswent-pitch-1236252273/">without red underpants</a>. I think he made <a href="https://x.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1952851885490356613">the right choice</a>.</p> <h2>More details on Microsoft‚Äôs canceled MMORPG <em>Blackbird</em> leak</h2> <p>A recent <a href="https://www.trueachievements.com/news/canceled-xbox-mmo-project-blackbird">report from True Achievements</a> shares apparent plot details from <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-layoffs-zenimax-online-blackbird-elder-scrolls-1851785629">the ill-fated ZeniMax Online project</a>. Its setting included a planet divided between fire and ice, a floating mega city controlled by AI, and various alien factions vying for power. The game would kick off with players investigating a high-profile murder, embarking on missions that would net them more powerful gear, and dealing with firefights that would erupt between the various groups. It all sounds very neat, making the project‚Äôs cancelation all the more unfortunate. Of course, it‚Äôs easy to take the most broad contours of an unreleased game and transform them into something amazing in your head, when the actual game, had it survived development and actually shipped, might have been anything but. At least with ZeniMax‚Äôs unannounced looter shooter, however, Microsoft executives <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-03/microsoft-s-xbox-cancels-blackbird-an-upcoming-game-that-impressed-executives">were apparently also very impressed</a>.</p> <h2><em>The Elder Scrolls Online</em> briefly goes free-to-play</h2> <p>The Bethesda MMORPG will let folks dive in without paying as part of QuakeCon 2025 which starts August 7. <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/68521">The deal runs through August 12</a>, which should be plenty of time to get through the tutorial section and find out if you dig <em>ESO</em> or not. Released back in 2014, the game has been <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sales-mario-kart-world-elden-ring-nightreign-1851786793">blowing up on Xbox again recently</a> thanks in part to the arrival of <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> earlier this year. If you‚Äôre desperate for more <em>Elder Scrolls</em>,<em> ESO</em> is your best bet right now. <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> is in active development but probably still a couple of years away.</p>

 <h2>The post-<em>Grand Theft Auto</em> Absurdaverse draws one step closer</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/rockstar-games-gta-6-what-is-dan-houser-nexts-game-1851058701">Ex-Rockstar creative Dan Houser</a> and Korean publisher Smilegate announced a partnership on Wednesday to ship Absurd Ventures‚Äô ‚Äúupcoming AAA, open-world, sci-fi action-adventure game‚Äù set in the ‚Äúmind-bending A Better Paradise‚Äù universe. What does any of that even mean? Time will tell. Houser is crafting the story alongside fellow <em>GTA</em> veterans Lazlow Jones and Michael Unsworth, with a studio helmed by ex-Niantic and Pandemic Studios boss Greg Borrud. For a taste of what any of this might be building toward, you can check out Houser‚Äôs 2024 audio book series <a href="https://www.absurdventures.com/abetterparadise/book"><em>A Better Paradise Volume 1: An Aftermath</em></a>.</p> <h2><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> comes to console</h2> <p>Strange Scaffold‚Äôs <a href="https://kotaku.com/tmnt-tactical-takedown-review-impressions-steam-tactics-1851782184">fun turn-based tactical riff</a> on<em> TMNT</em> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0prD_mVl45g">revealed</a> it‚Äôs coming to Xbox and Nintendo Switch on August 14.</p> <h2>The <em>Hell Is Us</em> Demo arrives on August 12</h2> <p>Don‚Äôt sleep on this upcoming horror action game led by the<em> Deus Ex</em> art director. Preview buzz back in May <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LRDO-y9mNI">was surprisingly positive</a>. It‚Äôll be free to try later this month on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p> <h2><em>Vile: Exhumed</em> returns from Steam censorship as a free download</h2> <p>The horror game about uncovering toxic online relationships by combing through someone‚Äôs computer files <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-itch-io-sex-game-nsfw-censor-visa-mastercard-1851787281">was swept up in the payment processor NSFW game crackdown late last month</a>.
