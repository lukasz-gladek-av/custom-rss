Darth Vader once again joined <em>Fortnite </em>on Friday, except unlike so many crossover cameos in Epic’s game, this one will talk back to you and your friends while you’re running around Junk Junction looking for easy pick-offs. It’s voiced by a digital replica of the late James Earl Jones’ voice and Epic Games says the <em>Star Wars </em>actor’s family is okay with the whole thing. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197564,197562" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Strategize with the ultimate Sith Lord.

Be the first to recruit him and your whole team will be able to take turns talking to the Dark Lord. Just remember to press the special Darth Vader button that’ll pop up to talk to him.”</p><p>Players have already been running around with the James Earl Jones Darth Vader AI chatbot since it went live and have been getting it to say all kinds of weird and silly stuff. “What freaking fucking food is that Darth Vader?” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMbUPYQjw0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OtMbUPYQjw0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">streamer LoserFruit asked</a></span> in one clip going around online. “Freaking, fucking, such vulgarity does not become you,” he said in response after a short pause. </p><p>I’m sure you have lots of questions. Epic has tried to answer a few of them in an FAQ. The James Earl Jones Darth Vader AI uses Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash model to generate responses, and ElevenLabs’ Flash v2.5 model to create the audio. If you’re under 13, you’re not supposed to be able to talk to James Earl Jones Darth Vader AI without your parents’ permission. If James Earl Jones Darth Vader AI says anything offensive, you’re supposed to report it to Epic. </p><p>“James Earl felt that the voice of Darth Vader was inseparable from the story of Star Wars, and he always wanted fans of all ages to continue to experience it,” reads a statement from the actor’s family shared by Epic. Jones passed away last year and previously <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/timlammers/2024/09/09/james-earl-jones-signed-over-rights-for-ai-to-recreate-darth-vaders-voice/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/timlammers/2024/09/09/james-earl-jones-signed-over-rights-for-ai-to-recreate-darth-vaders-voice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">signed over rights to his voice to Lucasfilm</a></span>. “We hope that this collaboration with<em> Fortnite</em> will allow both longtime fans of Darth Vader and newer generations to share in the enjoyment of this iconic character.”</p><p>The <em>Fortnite Star Wars </em>experiment comes weeks after Lucasfilm recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Yo7PULlPs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3Yo7PULlPs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">showcased a two-minute AI-generated <em>Star Wars</em></a></span><em> </em>that involved a jumble of weird looking animals and was, frankly, insulting garbage.

And while Darth Vader might be the franchise’s most iconic character, the character whose dark ambitions turned him into a broken cyborg is an odd choice for resurrecting the voice of a legendary actor so it can get trolled by <em>Fortnite </em>teens. </p><p><strong>Update 5/16/2025 12:03 p.m. ET:</strong> A spokesperson for Epic told <em>Kotaku</em> that Vader’s use of swear words has been patched out. “We pushed a hot fix within 30 minutes of this happening in-game, so this shouldn’t happen again,” they wrote in an email. They then elaborated on some of the guardrails in place to prevent the AI from promoting self-harm or engaging in other less than ideal battle royale banter:<br></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>If a player is repeatedly attempting to get Darth Vader in Fortnite to violate our settings and instructions, he will eventually leave the squad, and the player will be unable to recruit him again in that gameplay session.</li><li>We’ve added a new parental control so parents can choose whether to ‘allow voice and written communication with AI Features’ across Epic’s products. This includes interacting with Darth Vader. If a child is under 13 or their country’s age of digital consent, whichever is higher, this parental control is off by default and will require a parent or guardian to affirmatively turn it on.</li></ul></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>If a player believes Darth Vader in Fortnite responded in a way he shouldn’t, they can submit a bug report. We will investigate reports and, if needed, make adjustments to avoid similar responses in the future.&nbsp;</li></ul></blockquote><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
