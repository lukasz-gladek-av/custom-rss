              <p><span>Defining a role-playing game in 2025 is more complicated than it’s ever been. Pretty much every game has RPG elements these days, so if you squint hard enough, you can make the case for a lot of games being RPGs, even if they don’t follow the same formulas and structures the genre historically has. Because the definition of what makes an RPG has gotten looser over the years, any list of the best ones in any given year is pretty much guaranteed to have a ton of variety, including everything from action-packed open-world sprawls to strategic retro throwbacks. Here are our picks for the best RPGs of 2025.</span></p> <h2><b><i>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</i></b></h2>  <p><span>So many </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed </span></i><span>games are set in open worlds that aren’t worth exploring. Everything is marked on your map, and outside of those locations there’s little to find. But more recent entries, like </span><i><span>Valhalla</span></i><span>, have bucked this trend and started featuring maps that were not just vast, but stuffed with details to spot, people to meet, and activities to discover.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Assassin’s Creed Shadows,</span></i><span> which successfully moves the series to feudal Japan, is the next step in this evolution. The world is so satisfying to explore, and as you do so, you find new ways to alter both playable characters and their builds. And yeah, the presence of two playable characters who both feature their own quests and dialogue options as well as combat styles and skill trees means you basically get two different, but similar RPGs for the price of one. That’s an impressive accomplishment, and it means </span><i><span>Shadows</span></i><span> isn’t just one of the best RPGs of 2025, but one of its biggest, too. -Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Avowed</i></b></h2>  <p><span>My favorite RPGs are the ones in which I can pick a direction and just start hiking, running into interesting encounters and monsters to fight as I go. </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>, while not as big as some other open-world RPGs, let me do just that.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But even better, I got to do so in a unique fantasy setting filled with characters I’ll remember for years. It’s also an RPG that is so confident in its characters and writing that it essentially forces you to camp between quests and exploration. Standing around the campfire and chatting with my small crew of misfits could have been annoying in another RPG. But in </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>, these are some of the best moments in the game. Any RPG that makes chatting as fun as combat and questing is a winner in my book. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</i></b></h2>  <p><span>Much has been said about </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </span></i><span>as some kind of “savior” of the turn-based RPG genre, as if those games stopped coming out after </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span>. I don’t want the nauseating way in which RPG detractors have wielded it to take away from just how good Sandfall Interactive’s debut game is. </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>’s grief-driven tale of a group of expeditioners on a suicide mission, desperately hoping to end an annual culling of their friends and family (called a Gommage), is one of constant misdirection and pain, whether that be in its narrative twists or in the showy way its enemies swing at you to throw off your well-timed parry or dodge. It circumvents the bloat that weighs down the RPG genre in favor of something tight, focused, and reasonably paced, and it packs it with a dense, rewarding turn-based battle system. After the amount of acclaim it has received this year, hopefully other RPG devs learn from its relative restraint and calculated excess. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Deltarune</i></b></h2>  <p><span>Toby Fox’s episodic follow-up to </span><i><span>Undertale </span></i><span>is still ongoing, but four episodes in, </span><i><span>Deltarune </span></i><span>has already provided humor, atmosphere, character, and a banger soundtrack that stands tall next to its predecessor. With the closing chapters still at least a year away, we still have quite some time before we see the end of Kris’ journey, but what we’ve seen thus far has the potential to be just as impactful as </span><i><span>Undertale </span></i><span>was in 2015. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Demonschool&nbsp;</i></b></h2>  <p><span>What if you took the first </span><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>game and made it like </span><i><span>Into the Breach</span></i><span>? You’d have </span><i><span>Demonschool</span></i><span>, a clever, charming RPG that takes turn-based battles and makes each round of combat into a mini-tactical puzzle. The pixel art is great. So is the soundtrack. The characters are endearing but interactions are brisk, keeping the calendar time-management sim aspect of the formula feeling breezy rather than tedious. The writing’s not for everyone but it worked for me. Think of the snappiest people in your group chat playing off their archetypes and trading zingers at breakneck speed. It can feel at times like a case of style over substance. For a game with this much retro swag, I say, “who cares?” — Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><b><i>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</i></b></h2>  <p><span>The </span><i><span>Digimon </span></i><span>series may have fallen into relative obscurity compared to other ‘90s monster-taming phenomena, but the series has absolutely not been resting on the laurels of its early popularity. </span><i><span>Digimon </span></i><span>games are experimental, darker than you remember the series being, and offer a degree of creativity and freedom in party building you won’t find elsewhere. </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>pulls off all of the above with more polish and budget than most of the </span><i><span>Digimon </span></i><span>games have gotten before, and though its turn-based battles are a bit simple, its incredibly modular monster-training mechanics make it a lot more compelling than it appears on the surface. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p> <h2><b><i>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles&nbsp;</i></b></h2>  <p><span>There might never be another strategy RPG this good, in these exact ways, ever again. Mentioning any quibbles I have—cutting bonus content, a new localization that makes Ramza too whiny sometimes—feels like complaining about micro-mistakes in the plating of a Michelin Star three-course banquet. Perfectly paced, beautifully crafted, and heart-stoppingly authentic, </span><i><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></i><span> is like a long-lost Shakespeare play turned into the best </span><i><span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span></i><span> session you’ve ever had. — Ethan Gach</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Fretless – The Wrath of Riffson</i></b></h2>  <p><i><span>Fretless</span></i><span>’ marriage of turn-based battles and rhythm mechanics brings clarity to the timing-based attacks of something like </span><i><span>Paper Mario </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> by tying every strike, swipe, and sidestep to the beat of its excellent soundtrack. Ritual Studios weaves sheet music into the RPG’s design, from its rhythm-based battles to its musical world, in which brushing up against a plant or stepping on the right stone can add a lovely melody to a world that’s already brimming with song. It is the kind of game that anyone with rhythm can enjoy, but it’s especially delightful if you have a background in music and can hear how sound is integrated into everything you do. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p> <h2><b><i>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</i></b></h2>  <p><span>It’s hard to believe that an old and clunky open-world RPG like Bethesda’s 2006 </span><i><span>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion </span></i><span>could blow up in popularity in 2025. But that’s what happened thanks to the remaster, which mainly improves the game’s looks and adds a few quality-of-life changes. That’s it, though. At its core this is still the original </span><i><span>Oblivion</span></i><span>. And yet, there is something special about it. Walking around the forest in </span><i><span>Oblivion</span></i><span> and stumbling upon some odd ruins that lead to a dark dungeon is still as much fun in 2025 as it was back on the Xbox 360. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Octopath Traveler 0</i></b></h2>  <p><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0 </span></i><span>is proof that Square Enix had no reason to make </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent</span></i><span> a gacha game when it could have easily made it an exceptional RPG without all the gacha elements dragging it down. </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0 </span></i><span>is a game saved from obscurity, as Square Enix has stripped </span><i><span>Champions of the Continent </span></i><span>of its live-service trappings and revived it as the proper turn-based RPG fans wanted in the first place. It is a beefy monster of a game that will take up nearly a hundred hours of your time, but that’s the consequence of adapting what was once meant to be a forever game into something that feels complete. </span><i><span>Octopath Traveler 0 </span></i><span>feels like a prodigal son returning after being shut down due to Square Enix’s short-sighted hubris. And it sure is nice to have all the best parts of the game preserved when they were once thought lost. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p> <h2><b><i>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</i></b></h2>  <p><span>The </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>subseries has become </span><i><span>Pokémon’s</span></i><span> place to experiment, and </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> takes some of the boldest swings Game Freak’s ever taken. Its real-time battle system includes one of the most interesting spins the studio has ever put on the franchise’s decades-old combat formula, the single-city setting lets the devs stick with one of the most memorable casts in series history, and the plethora of new Mega Evolutions gives a lot of old favorites new life. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is almost nothing like </span><i><span>Legends: Arceus,</span></i><span> beyond both games having you manually throw Poké Balls at wild creatures and dodge roll when a powerful attack comes your way. And that’s pretty exciting, because it means that maybe the next </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>game can surprise us in a whole new way. After </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, I’m willing to just let Game Freak cook. I have no wish list. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p> <h2><b><i>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</i></b></h2>  <p><span>Too Kyo Games’ magnum opus is the kind of game that is so ambitious and unwieldy it’s hard to recommend without caveats, but it’s also one of the best RPGs this year you probably haven’t heard of. The game is one part visual novel, another part tactical RPG, and another part absolute mindfuck of a branching narrative, with 100 different endings across over 20 routes, and your path through the story entirely defined by your narrative choices. Its puzzle-like tactical battles are more brain teaser than sweaty warzone, but their challenging, </span><i><span>Evangelion</span></i><span> Angel-style boss fights keep things interesting and unpredictable. </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>might not have gotten the awards buzz it deserved, but make no mistake, few games from 2025 even come close to matching its ambition. — Kenneth Shepard</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>The Outer Worlds 2</i></b></h2>  <p><span>It’s clear that we aren’t getting a new </span><i><span>Fallout </span></i><span>game from Bethesda anytime soon. But I can wait, because Obsidian’s </span><i><span>Outer Worlds 2 </span></i><span>is a worthy spiritual successor that even exceeds the franchise that inspired it in some key ways. Every part of </span><i><span>Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> is bigger than the original, and it’s clear that the people at Obsidian (who also developed </span><i><span>Avowed </span></i><span>this year!) are experts at crafting RPGs that offer players plenty of freedom while still telling a tale that doesn’t feel like a series of random moments, lightly connected. Take note, </span><i><span>Starfield</span></i><span>. This is how you combine space, sci-fi, and the Bethesda RPG formula correctly. The end result: One of the year’s best RPGs. — Zack Zwiezen</span></p> <h2><b><i>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter&nbsp;</i></b></h2>  <p><i><span>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</span></i><span> is the type of remake fans dream about: a complete overhaul that nevertheless stays as true to the spirit of the original as possible. The world is reimagined and the coming-of-age story of peacekeeping warriors Estelle and Joshua retold with new cinematics and voice acting that bring it to life the way you always imagined it. Advances in hybrid real-time combat and menu navigation are deftly folded into the structure of a game that came out back in 2004 in a way that adds both depth and convenience. Finally, the starting point for the long-running </span><i><span>Trails</span></i><span> series has a version you can play that doesn’t just feel like JRPG homework. — Ethan Gach</span></p>

            <guid>1386163</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There were two things I wanted most out of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span>: </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-raichu-x-2000652246"><span>Mega Raichu</span></a><span> and the return of Latias to my party. The dragon/psychic monster has been a favorite of mine for over 20 years, and she’s been a mainstay of my team in every game she’s featured in. Latias is flying around the Hyperspace Lumiose City featured in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>, but I still haven’t caught her yet. Why? </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s maddening grind makes catching her and several other Legendary monsters a game of chance, harkening back to some of the more frustrating capture mechanics of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s past that the series</span> <span>has mostly gotten away from.</span></p> <p><span>Latias, along with several other Legendary Pokémon who aren’t tied to the main plot, is gated behind a mechanic called Special Scans. These allow you to find rare pockets of </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s Hyperspace that include powerful trainers to battle, valuable loot, and, in some cases, Legendary monsters you won’t be able to find anywhere else. All of that is well and good, but the mere act of acquiring a Special Scan is already such a time sink that the randomization of what follows makes the whole process an almost insulting waste of your time.</span></p>

 <p><span>To get a Special Scan, you have to grind through </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s various mini-quests in Hyperspace. These are typically simple objectives like beating trainers in the Battle Zones, capturing a certain number of Pokémon, or finding loot in the mirrored city. Each of these gives you intel points to contribute to the scan, and it’ll take multiple runs through Hyperspace to reach the appropriate number.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The problem is that the results of Special Scans are randomized. You </span><i><span>might</span></i><span> find a Legendary Pokémon, but you may also find a battle zone full of powerful trainers that can’t give you anything beyond more intel points to do another Scan, or you could stumble into an area of Hyperspace filled with Pokémon you’ve already caught. Sometimes, if you’re lucky, you’ll find a repeat of one of the Rogue Mega Evolution boss fights, which remain one of the best parts of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, but if you’re trying to find the monsters you need to fill the Pokédex, even those feel like a barrier you can’t get around.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654219" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654219"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654219">© The Pokemon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There’s no way to game the system and manipulate these scans to lead you where you want to go, and even if they do take you to a Legendary Pokémon’s lair, there’s no guarantee that you’ll go back to Lumiose City with one in a Poké Ball. I’ve put more than 20 hours into </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span> and have only found two Legendary Pokémon through these methods, and neither of them was Latias. When I happened upon Virizion’s home after hours of grinding and acquiring one of these scans, I searched every square inch of the space for grass/fighting antelope, and couldn’t find it before the time limit ran out. These Special Scan portals close behind you after you leave, willingly or not, so I spent all that time grinding and battling through Special Scan areas with nothing of value in them to get to this point, all for nothing.</span></p>

 <p><span>Gating Legendary monsters behind chance is bad enough, but making it a lengthy grind to even roll the dice artificially inflates an already hefty expansion that relies on the grind to fill out the time between its better moments. If your sole value determination for a video game is how much time it takes up, </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>offers that with reckless abandon. If you want to feel like you’re accomplishing something rather than wasting your time, Special Scans are one of the most annoying things </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>has implemented in years.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In some of the earlier generations, certain Legendary Pokémon were roaming encounters you had to essentially track and follow throughout a region, hoping that you’d stumble upon them in a random battle. This mechanic was notoriously derided, and the series has largely moved away from it, but Special Scans feel like that design philosophy magnified in a way that kills momentum so thoroughly that I’m not sure if I’ll ever actually complete the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>Pokédex. I guess I can live with that, but I’m pretty fucking sad that my girl Latias is waiting for me in Hyperspace, and we might not get to reunite until another game.</span></p>

              <p>The chances are you’ll know developers Butterscotch Shenanigans from their&nbsp;<em>Crashlands</em> games—enormous open-world action games in which you fight, loot and craft your way to victory. However, if you’re an indie game developer, it’ll be their <em>Coffee with Butterscotch</em> podcast that’s most familiar, the long-running show dissecting everything indie for years. But today I draw your attention toward them for something far, far sillier:&nbsp;<em>How Many Dudes</em> is a forthcoming…I’m not sure there’s a genre title for this…game that asks, how many dudes does it take to kill 30 toddlers and a duck-sized horse? So yes, I spoke to them to see what on Earth is going on.</p> <p>Butterscotch Shenanigans was created by three brothers—Seth, Sam and Adam Coster—and was originally best known for fun, experimental and superbly animated mobile games, like <a href="https://www.bscotch.net/games/flop-rocket"><em>Flop Rocket</em></a>&nbsp;and <em><a href="https://www.bscotch.net/games/quadropus-rampage">Quadropus Rampage</a></em>. That is, until <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-game-i-make-before-i-die-fighting-cancer-by-m-1758326409">Sam Coster was diagnosed with stage 4b lymphoma</a>, and the three decided that was the moment to work on something bigger and more substantial. The result was <em>Crashlands</em>, and it proved successful enough, after creating platform game&nbsp;<em>and</em> engine&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/792710/Levelhead/"><em>Levelhead</em></a>, for the team to move on to <em>Crashlands 2</em>.</p>

 <p>With Sam in remission (and, I’m delighted to report, now officially cancer free!), that sequel was a four-and-a-half-year project, with another six months of updates and new content after launch, leaving the three siblings and their newer colleagues really ready to do something else. Something smaller. Something incredibly dumb. Thus <em>How Many Dudes</em>.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654200" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654200"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654200">© Butterscotch Shenanigans / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The game plays something like an auto-battler, in which you gather an ever-growing group of dudes who must fight teams of enemies of various bizarre natures. You begin the game with a single dude, tasked with fighting a group of 10 toddlers. Yup, right out of the gate. At this stage you’re essentially an observer, watching the battle play out before you, and you’ll either be relieved or horrified to learn you’ll definitely win. As a result you gain $100 to spend on items you can deploy during battles, and also get to select a new dude to add to your team. In that first choice you can pick between a Knight Dude or a Paladin Dude, and obviously each of the many, many dudes has their own stats and skills. From then on, it’s all about picking the right dudes, deploying the right skills at the correct moments, and trying to save enough money to buy revives for all who fall in battle.</p>

 <p>Having played an early build of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3934270/How_Many_Dudes/">the demo being released today</a>, I chatted with Seth Coster about why I’d just spent so long punching crowds of toddlers to death.</p> <p>“First of all, those toddlers are gonna be fine,” Coster assured me. “I have it on good authority that they’re happily munching on hay in a farm upstate.” So that’s a relief. But I still wondered how they got here. What process brings a creative team to an idea like this? “In the past, when starting a new game, we would start by asking what we wanted to play, and then we would try to bring that into the world. It has always worked for us in terms of quality—we’ve found that we can make whatever game we set ourselves on, and we can make it at a high level of polish and fun.”</p>

  <p>Despite this, and despite routinely high review scores, Butterscotch Shenanigans has found it tough to get much attention. “It has always been very difficult to get players, press and streamers to notice our games and talk about them,” says Seth. “And I don’t blame them; there are a trillion games out there!” As a result, the team decided to try a new approach this time. “What can people not stop talking about?” they asked themselves, eventually landing on the internet debate about “how many dudes it would take to beat up a gorilla.”</p>

 <p>“We didn’t even have an idea of what the game would be,” notes Seth, “we just wanted to make it about that. From there we iterated fast with no real roadmap or plan—we prototyped the game during the Game Maker’s Toolkit Jam, so there wasn’t really time to overthink it.”</p>

 <p>Five days later they’d created something that felt to them like a mix between <em>Balatro</em> and&nbsp;<em>TABS</em>, a “roguelike thing,” and people’s response to the jam entry was really positive. “We thought we might’ve just struck gold. Or at least copper.”</p> <p>As bizarre as it all sounds, from what I’ve played this appears to be true. While the first couple of rounds where you have little role might seem strange, it ramps up quickly as your decisions have more effect on the results. Which types of dudes you choose to recruit strongly changes your experience in any run, along with the upgrades and bonuses you pick, and with each battle lasting less than 30 seconds, it’s a quick and bloody process.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000654202" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654202"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654202">© Butterscotch Shenanigans / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>So how do you go about deciding the rules here? Who does the research to identify the correct amount of power and skill necessary to win in a fight with 30 duck-sized horses? “An anchor point in the game is the Regular Dude,” explains Seth Coster. He’s the one you start with, the average dude. “Everything in the game is orientated around him—how hard he can hit, and how many hits he can take. So when we’re designing a new enemy, we just ask, ‘Do we think this thing hits twice as hard as a Regular Dude? Five times as hard? TEN? And how many hits can it take compared to a Regular Dude?'”</p>

 <p>So yes, a horse “can probably take lot of punches.” (I hope my mum doesn’t read this article.) A horse-sized duck is the game’s first boss fight, for instance. “Weight classes exist for a reason, and horses are HUGE,” observes Seth. “Plus you gotta get past its flailing legs. Our sophisticated calculations have shown that a horse has 35 times the HP of a Regular Dude, which equates to about 70 seconds worth of regular punches.” Uh-huh. “Trust me, the math is sound.”</p> <p>I wondered, given the nature of that bar discussion topic of how many people it might take to fight a hundred worm-sized tigers and so on, whether the game might also pitch the enemies against one another to decide other natural questions. Who would win in a fight between a horse-sized duck and 100 toddlers? “The game isn’t about the answer,” says Seth very wisely, “it’s about the question. Because the answer to the question can only be, ‘It depends.’ The reason there’s ever a debate about ‘who could win in a fight’ is that the debate is actually about assumptions. How much prep time do the various parties have? If we’re talking about mythical creatures (like lion-sized ants), what kids of liberties are we taking with their capabilities?”</p>

 <p>He’s not done. “If we’re talking about Dudes versus a gorilla, what kinds of Dudes are we talking about? Olympic gymnasts? MMA fighters? Accountants? Marines? And do the Dudes have prep time, or are they just all thrown into the ring with the gorilla without warning?”</p> <p>I’m regretting the question.</p> <p>“The fun of the debate isn’t in having an answer, it’s about exploring all the possibilities. So that’s really what the game has ended up being about! We have LOTS of different types of Dudes in this game, each with their own unique capabilities and limitations. And then we throw them into the ring with a whole bunch of weird opponents to see what happens.”</p> <p>So <em>will</em> the game let the enemies fight, too? No, I’m not asking again. Moving on, I wondered what motivated this return to a smaller, sillier idea, after the success of the <em>Crashlands</em> games. Was it something Butterscotch had missed?</p>

  <p>“Certainly!” says Seth. “When you work on one thing for longer than it takes to get a college degree, you go a little crazy. But also, that one thing tends to take on an outsized importance. When you’re committing that many resources to something, you start to get in your own head about how everything has to be perfect. Especially if you’re trying to make a game that has a big story and lots of world-building.”</p> <p>But in this case? “<span><em>How Many Dudes </em>exists for one reason only: to be fun and stupid. It’s not trying to say anything important. It’s not trying to be anything other than what it is: a goofy game. So whenever we think of something that makes us chuckle, we just throw it in there. We don’t have to ask about the story implications, or whether it ‘fits’ with the world, or how it’s going to integrate into some larger vision for the game.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000654199" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654199"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654199">© Butterscotch Shenanigans</figcaption></figure> <p>Butterscotch Shenanigans has always been a very mobile-forward developer, but also one that charges a price for its games instead of littering them with ads and IAPs. Given just how dire things feel in mobile spaces for premium games, I wondered if this is still viable. “I’m not gonna lie…” says Coster. “It’s rough. Over the past nine years, our mobile revenue for new premium launches has declined by about 90 percent. I’m not sure whether others are experiencing the same thing, but that’s one data point for you. On the flipside, Google Play Pass and Apple Arcade do offer much clearer paths to success for a premium game—provided you can get into either of them.”</p> <p>This is why the company has shifted to cross-platform launches. “We plan to launch <em>How Many Dudes</em> on Steam, Google Play and the App Store,” says Seth, “and maybe Xbox if the Game Pass team reads this article and wants to give us a call…”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654203" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654203"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654203">© Butterscotch Shenanigans / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I highly recommend those&nbsp;<em>Crashlands</em> games, by the way. They feel perfect on a tablet, playable in short bursts, and come with hours and hours of stuff to do. And their daunting scale certainly does suggest a daunting amount of work. Do those games put pressure on the studio to have to match them, or even go bigger, spend more, raise ambitions ever-higher? “There are always expectations and demands,” says the Coster brother, “but that comes with the territory. Players will never stop asking for more sequels and more features and more updates, but that’s just them expressing that they love a thing and want more of it. In a weird way, those player demands don’t create pressure; they just create guidance on possible next steps.”</p> <p>The real pressure, says Coster, comes from within the team. Previous games have been about proving something to themselves, proving they’re capable of making long-lasting “hobby games” (<em>Levelhead</em>) or big and intricate games (<em>Crashlands 2</em>). “But in both cases, those were pressures we put on ourselves.&nbsp;<em>How Many Dudes</em>, on the other hand, feels pretty light by comparison. We’re not out to prove anything about our skills or capabilities. We’re just making something fun.”</p> <p><em>You can get <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3934270/How_Many_Dudes/">the&nbsp;How Many Dudes demo right now from Steam</a>, and go slaughter ducks and toddlers to your heart’s content.</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-sells-its-tv-soundbar-3-times-cheaper-than-direct-rivals-now-at-record-low-before-christmas-2000654172</link>
            <guid>1386112</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Soundbars don’t have to cost close to $1,000 like the Sonos Arc Ultra to make your TV’s sound much better, especially if your current TV speakers sound weak and thin. Amazon’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5862/">Fire TV Soundbar is currently on sale for $99, down from its regular price of $119</a> and this is the kind of aggressive pricing that Amazon uses for all of its hardware brands (including Ring, Blink, and eero). This 2.0 speaker system has two speakers that fit naturally under most TVs without taking over your entertainment center and it makes sound fuller, dialogue clearer, and bass deeper.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5862/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Virtual surround sound that is better than its price</h2>
<p><strong>DTS Virtual:X technology</strong> makes it possible to hear sound in three dimensions from just two speakers, instead of needing several satellite speakers placed around the room. The processing looks at audio signals and makes it seem like sound is coming from different directions and heights and makes movies, shows, and games more immersive without the cost and complexity of real surround systems. <strong>Dolby Audio suppor</strong>t makes this effect even better by keeping detail and dynamic range across all kinds of content, from quiet dialogue scenes to loud action scenes.</p>
<p>The included HDMI cable makes setup quick and easy because it connects directly to your TV’s HDMI eARC or ARC port. This one cable connection sends both audio and control signals, so the soundbar turns on when you turn on your TV and responds to volume changes from your TV remote. You don’t have to mess with optical cables, figure out how to use complicated menu settings, or set up universal remotes to make everything work well together.</p>



<p>The <strong>soundbar is 24 inches long and only 2.5 inches tall</strong> so it will fit comfortably on most TV stands and entertainment consoles without blocking your TV screen or infrared remote sensors. This small profile works best with TVs that are small to medium-sized, since a big soundbar would look out of place and take up too much space. You can put it right in front of your TV stand or mount it on the wall below your TV if you want a cleaner look.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth makes the soundbar more useful</strong> than just for TV audio: You can also stream music directly from your phone or tablet. You can play music from Spotify, Apple Music, or any other audio app on your device without having to turn on your TV or switch inputs. The wireless connection pairs quickly and stays stable over normal room distances, so you can control playback from your couch or even another room without losing sound.</p>



<p>If you have a Fire TV device, the integration works perfectly and lets <strong>you control both your TV and audio settings with just one remote</strong>. The soundbar automatically picks up Fire TV commands and changes the volume for different types of content and it works with smart TVs and any TV that is connected to streaming media players from other brands, like Roku, Apple TV, or Chromecast, even if you don’t use Fire TV devices.</p>
<p>You can get a big improvement in sound quality for $99 instead of $119, which is about the same price as a nice dinner out. You can find budget soundbars from generic brands in this price range, but they don’t have DTS Virtual:X processing, Dolby Audio support, or the ability to work with Fire TV like Amazon’s does.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Video Game Console Sales Just Flatlined Ahead Of The Holidays As Prices Soar]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-sales-inflation-economy-2000654196</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A new Nintendo console is on the market <a href="https://kotaku.com/light-up-the-town-cozy-christmas-holiday-lights-simulator-steam-demo-review-2000652213">this Christmas</a> for the first time in eight years, but that apparently wasn’t enough to juice overall hardware sales. According to the latest data, last month was the worst November for new video game hardware sales in the U.S. since 1995, the year the original PlayStation launched here.</p> <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social">Circana’s Mat Piscatella reports</a> that only 1.6 million new consoles were sold last month, including during Black Friday. That’s just a few hundred thousand more than the 1995 low of 1.4 million. Perhaps just as surprisingly, the Switch 2 wasn’t even the best-selling hardware in November. That honor went to the PS5, a console that’s five years old and ended up not benefiting from the expected <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delay-november-gta6-reaction-news-2000641817"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a> launch hype this year.</p>

 <p>Part of that no doubt came down to a discrepancy in Black Friday deals. Sony was aggressively discounting the all-digital PS5 by $100 while Nintendo actually got rid of its long-standing <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-black-firday-sales-2025-mario-zelda-2000642413"><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> bundle</a> for the original Switch. The Switch 2 did end up getting some surprise discounts from retailers by <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sale-cyber-monday-mario-kart-world-walmart-amazon-2000649232">Cyber Monday</a>, but that ended up falling on December 1 this year, so it doesn’t fall within this period.</p>   <p>Piscatella reports that the average price of a new console “reached an all-time November high of $439, up 11 percent compared to a year ago.” Back in November 2019 the average was just $235. That’s partly the impact from <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881">President Trump’s trade war</a> which led Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft to all implement multiple rounds of price increases in 2025. A new Xbox Series X, first released five years ago for $500, now costs $650 at Best Buy.</p>

 <p>Microsoft was also notable for being the only hardware manufacturer not to discount its consoles at all during the holiday season. It’s almost as if the company’s been trying <em>not</em> to sell new hardware, encouraging players instead to play its games in the cloud or on rival platforms. The Xbox ended up coming in third for the month, even as <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-activision-2000652111"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a> launched as November’s best-selling game (it will likely still remain behind <em>Battlefield 6</em> for the year, however).</p> <p>Is console gaming <a href="https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-administration-white-house-halo-gamestop-2000639566">just getting too expensive</a>? Is the floor <a href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/us-economy-flashes-warning-signs-new-data-analysts/story?id=128463726">secretly falling out</a> from under the U.S. economy? Why not both, Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6uq52s3c22">suggested</a>. “Correlation does not necessarily imply causation…unless it does,” he wrote when speculating about the drop-off in console sales. With Roblox free and <em>Fortnite</em> back on phones, it’s never been easier for parents to look at the $500 sticker price for a new system and say, “no thanks.”</p>
