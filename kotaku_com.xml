              <p data-start="0" data-end="318">As game sizes continue to grow with new releases sometimes topping 100GB, it’s becoming harder to make room to play them all. You have two options: either delete games after you finish them or expand your storage. The simpler and more permanent solution? Upgrading to a larger solid-state drive. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5983/">Currently, the Samsung 9100 Pro SSD is on sale at Amazon, offering discounts up to 33%.&nbsp;</a>This SSD is available in several storage sizes, including 1TB, 2TB, 4TB, and an enormous 8TB option. With the sale, you can save anywhere from $60 to $250 depending on the version you choose. The 1TB model is now $135 (down from $200), the 2TB version is $220 (down from $280), the 4TB model is priced at $370 (down from $470), and the 8TB version is available for $750 (down from $1,000).</p>
<p data-start="0" data-end="318">Instead of constantly juggling downloads, you can switch between games whenever you feel like jumping back into an old favorite. This convenience extends to other large applications as well, whether you’re editing 4K footage from large files or storing extensive media collections.</p>

<p data-start="1136" data-end="1568">Beyond just giving you all that extra storage space, the Samsung 9100 Pro will deliver solid performance. With read speeds reaching 14,700 MB/s and write speeds of up to 13,300 MB/s, this SSD offers blazing-fast data transfers while remaining power-efficient. Whether you’re gaming, editing videos, working with large datasets, or whatever else it is you do at your computer, the Samsung 9100 Pro provides the performance you need without putting unnecessary strain on your system’s power usage.</p>
<h2 data-start="1136" data-end="1568">PlayStation 5 Compatible</h2>
<p data-start="1570" data-end="2047">If you’re a PlayStation 5 owner, you’ve probably noticed that storage can be tight. The PS5 comes with only 825GB of internal storage, and with the growing size of AAA games, you’ll find yourself deleting and reinstalling games just to make room for new ones. Fortunately, the PS5 allows you to expand its storage with a compatible M.2 SSD, and the Samsung 9100 Pro is one such option. However, if you want to avoid overheating, it’s crucial to get the version with a heatsink. These are small metal casings that sit around the SSD which allow heat to dissipate.</p>


<p data-start="2049" data-end="2267">Installing the SSD in your PS5 is a straightforward process that you can follow along with watching any number of YouTube tutorials. Right now, the 2TB version with a heatsink is priced at $209, the 4TB version is $399, and the big 8TB version is $800. The 1TB with heatsink option is currently out of stock.</p>
<p data-start="2049" data-end="2267">Heatsinks on their own go for about $10 to $20. Now when you compare each of the Samsung 9100 Pro SSDs here, with and without heatsink, there’s definitely a drop off in value. The 2TB option with a heatsink is actually cheaper than without so there’s not reason not to pick up that one (where you end up using the heatsink or not). The 4TB model is about $20 more with a heatsink. That isn’t bad but you might be able to pick up the standard version and find a different heatsink for less. Then the 8TB price difference is laughable. It’s $50 more to get it with the heatsink. Don’t do that. Get yourself another one for far less.</p>
