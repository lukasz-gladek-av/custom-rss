              <p><span>The most memorable experience I’ve ever had with a captcha, those li’l online tests you have to complete to prove you aren’t a bot trying to DDOS someone’s blog, was being shown a puzzle grid that used images of the building I was currently sitting in. It was a moment that would be written off as too “on-the-nose” in an episode of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/black-mirror-netflix-striking-vipers-hang-the-dj-1851770891"><i><span>Black Mirror</span></i></a><span>. That intimidation tactic will be tough to beat, but a free new game from Paper Hat Projects is going to have a go at it anyway.</span></p> <p><a href="https://paperhatprojects.itch.io/captchaware"><i><span>CaptchaWare</span></i></a><span>, a “totally normal captcha game,” blends the agony of proving your humanity to a robot on a web page with the manic ecstasy of </span><i><span>WarioWare</span></i><span>’s fast-paced micro-games. Before gaining access to this mysterious site, you’ll have all of your web browsing faculties tested, from correctly identifying fire hydrants, simple math, and agreeing to the terms of service, to devilish riddles, grass touching, and proper art appreciation.</span></p>

  <p><span>Survive 20 consecutive captchas, each with increasing hostility and reflex demands, to claim your prize of proving you’re <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-DSVDcw6iW8">a real human being</a>. The fun and fancy of </span><i><span>CaptchaWare</span></i><span> suggests that even the internet’s most agonizing rituals can become a little more whimsical by making them incomprehensibly fast, instead of routinely </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-palantir-peter-thiel-persona-age-verification-2000668951"><span>harvesting our user metrics for lord knows what purposes</span></a><span>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sega-genesis-hideki-sato-dies-dreamcast-2000668977</link>
            <guid>1436335</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>“We knew how to make arcade games, we didn’t really know anything about console development,” </span><a href="https://shmuplations.com/segahistory/"><span>Hideki Sato told </span><i><span>Famitsu</span></i></a><span> in an oral history of Sega. “They sold so well, we started to get stars in our eyes.” Sato was a steward to Sega’s biggest consoles, from the original SG-1000 right through to the Dreamcast. The storied engineer passed away this Friday, February 13, 2026, at age 77.</span></p> <p><span>Joining Sega back in 1971, Sato saw the company go through every transformation firsthand, from a U.S.-based electronics enterprise to a Japanese gaming power-house, and from a titan of the arcade hall to one of the fiercest competitors of the home console wars. While involved in the original SG series and the Master System, Sato’s star ascended in 1989 when he was promoted to director of Sega’s Research and Development department. There he and his team were tasked with a herculean feat: take down Nintendo.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>The Nintendo Entertainment System crushed Sega’s Master System. The NES rose from the ashes of the early ‘80s crash and dominated markets around the world. Sega wanted to get revenge in the second round. For the 16-bit era, they’d introduce something that synthesized their arcade strengths with what was possible at home with new, budget-friendly microchips. Sato wanted a home console with the visual appeal of an up-scale sound system, making it sleek, rounded and black with contrasted gold lettering. “That gold printing, by the way, was very expensive,” Sato told </span><i><span>Famitsu</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The result was the Mega Drive, known as the Genesis in North America. With a two-year head start on the Super Nintendo, the console was a massive hit even before the debut of </span><i><span>Sonic the Hedgehog</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Sato oversaw all of Sega’s classic systems. The Mega Drive made Sega a household name, showing off what they did that </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7nsBoqJ6s8"><span>‘Nintendon’t.’</span></a><span> The uncanny Sega Saturn was the world’s peek at the true potential of a dedicated 3D, CD-based console. And of course Sega’s swan song, the Dreamcast, ended up being a beloved underdog whose hard shake didn’t stop it from hosting the loudest, most uncompromising games of the era.</span></p>

 <p><span>Even beyond the heat of the console wars, Sato’s influence on the gaming world was felt in immeasurable ways. Magazine </span><i><span>Beep21</span></i><span> had already been compiling a new book about </span><a href="https://x.com/Beep2021/status/1924655482024952281"><span>Sato and Sega’s hardware legacy</span></a><span>. Just last December, Sega co-founder David Rosen also </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2026/jan/05/sega-co-founder-david-rosen-dies"><span>passed away at 95</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/saudi-arabia-bytedance-moonton-acecraft-mobile-ea-2000668972</link>
            <guid>1436317</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Saudi Arabia’s appetite for gaming consolidation is reportedly unsated. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-ownership-trump-jared-kushner-2000649726">Its leveraged buyout to take over <em>Battlefield 6</em> publisher Electronic Arts</a> isn’t even complete yet and it’s already eyeing other major deals, according <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/bytedance-talks-sell-gaming-unit-moonton-more-than-6-billion-sources-say-2026-02-13/">to <em>Reuters</em></a>. This time the target is TikTok owner ByteDance’s gaming subsidiary Moonton which could sell for as much as $7 billion.</p> <p><em>Reuters</em> reports that the “broad terms” of the transaction are already agreed upon, with the official deal possibly getting announced as early as March (thanks <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-biggest-gaming-buyouts-in-history-is-reportedly-underway/1100-6538177/"><em>GameSpot</em></a>). ByteDance purchased Moonton back in 2021 for $4 billion and Saudi Arabia, through its game investment vehicle Savvy Games Group, is apparently willing to pay over 50 percent more than that just a few years later.</p>

 <p>So what the hell does Moonton make to justify that spiking valuation at a time when so many other parts of the game industry are financially plateauing? The Shanghai-based subsidiary’s biggest game is the 2016 MOBA <i>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang</i> which has been downloaded over a billion times. Last year it also launched the auto battler <em>Magic Chess: Go Go</em>, the RPG <em>Silver and Blood</em>, and the coop vertical shooter <em>Acecraft</em>.</p>   <p>That last game is a thinly-veiled remix of <em>Cuphead</em> and features cartoon icons like Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Tom, and Jerry as fighter pilots. Some players feel like it’s essentially a microtransaction casino dressed up in the retro animation stylings of Studio MDHR’s hit 2017 indie action platformer. Weirdly, the game <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Acecraft/comments/1qgxfrw/acecraft_temporarily_suspended_in_us/">randomly went offline</a> for all U.S. players starting last month. Moonton promised make-up rewards once it returns but it’s still mysteriously MIA.</p>

 <h2>Saudi Arabia corners the mobile gaming market</h2> <p>A $6-$7 billion sale price would make Moonton one of the top-10 biggest gaming acquisitions in history, but it’s hardly the only mobile titan Saudi Arabia has sought to gobble up in recent years. Savvy Games Group also purchased Monopoly Go maker Scopely in 2023 for $4.9 billion and Pokémon Go maker Niantic in 2025 for $3.5 billion.</p>

 <p>The EA acquisition still dwarfs those, but won’t be complete until sometime over the summer. While the <em>Madden</em> and <em>Sims</em> publisher’s board of directors and shareholders overwhelmingly approved a historic $55 billion deal to take EA private, unions and Democrats in Congress have called for investigations and regulatory due diligence before one of the largest American gaming companies is sold to a foreign government.</p> <p>Given Saudi Arabia’s direct line to the White House via President Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, who reportedly helped broker the deal and has a personal stake in it via <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">his own Saudi-backed investment group</a>, that seems unlikely to happen.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/den-wolves-layoffs-gtfo-game-awards-cyberpunk-2000668953</link>
            <guid>1436260</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Den of Wolves</em> was revealed at <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2023-tga-trailers-game-previews-1851082729">The Game Awards 2023</a> with a brutal cinematic trailer teasing bloody cyberpunk heists. Developer 10 Chambers didn’t reveal any gameplay or a release date but it got the shooter on people’s radars. Over two years later it’s still not out and the studio behind prior Steam hit <em>GTFO</em> is already facing layoffs.</p> <p>News of the cuts broke first on LinkedIn on February 13 when individual developers started sharing their layoff stories. “<span data-testid="content-text">This wasn’t on my 2026 bingo card, but here we are wearing the green LinkedIn banner for a while,” wrote one </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/filipblom_opentowork-gamingindustry-activity-7424851079118495745-vIEU?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web&amp;rcm=ACoAAByD5EUBfxY4kCf3wHtdwCavc5euTv0rxzo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">affected employee</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. 10 Chambers later confirmed the layoffs in a statement <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-gtfo-developer-10-chambers-lays-off-staff">to <em>Game Developer</em></a> and others.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“We can confirm that we’re taking a hard look at how we work and how the studio is set up, so Den of Wolves can become the game it deserves to be,” it read. “This unfortunately means a significant restructuring of the studio, impacting a large number of roles, including several of the studio’s co-founders.”</span></p> <p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It continued, “We remain focused on the vision of<em> Den of Wolves</em>. Ulf Andersson and Simon Viklund remain fully committed to the game and to leading the studio forward. When we have more concrete news to share, we’ll do it through our official channels.”</span></p> <h2 data-testid="content-paragraph">From horror shooter to cyberpunk heists</h2> <p data-testid="content-paragraph">One person who isn’t still committed to the upcoming multiplayer shooter is 10 Chambers co-founder Hjalmar Vikström. He revealed his departure from the studio after a decade of working there earlier in the week. “Next up for me is going indie–making way smaller games, focusing on health and family, and just enjoying game development,” he <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hjalmarvikstrom_hey-im-not-the-most-active-on-linkedin-activity-7427282044239413248-_sVU/">wrote on LinkedIn</a>.</p> <p data-testid="content-paragraph">10 Chambers released <em>GTFO</em> in Early Access in 2019 and it immediately gripped players with its grime-y and claustrophobic coop horror gameplay. It revolved around prisoners fighting mutants and avoiding hazards while completing opaque objectives in an underground complex. It was uncompromisingly brutal and gained a devoted following as a result, occasionally spiking to nearly 20,000 concurrents on Steam and acquiring thousands of positive reviews in the process.</p>

 <p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><em> Den of Wolves</em> applies a similarly harsh formula to sci-fi heists, but with much more ambitious trappings. It combines the smash-and-grab break-ins of a <em>Payday</em> with a second layer of nightmare-fueled gameplay where teams hack into fleshy human mind vaults to retrieve the valuable data stored in them. It’s a neat concept that received decent previews in early 2025 but there’s still no launch date.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2 data-testid="content-paragraph">Buying more time for <em>Den of Wolves&nbsp;</em></h2> <p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><i>“</i>I’ve been begging management to give us a release window for <em>Den of Wolves</em> in the trailer–but no,” 10 Chambers comms director Robin Björkell said alongside a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1818140?emclan=103582791474302810&amp;emgid=499465877188510087">new community gameplay trailer in December</a>. “They won’t budge. These developers really don’t want to make promises they can’t keep for the sake of marketing. It makes my job harder, but as a gamer myself, I respect it. I told them we at least need to prove that the game exists, and that was the starting point for this trailer.”</span></p> <p data-testid="content-paragraph">The cuts at 10 Chambers come as many game companies struggle in an ultra-completive release environment where development schedules are taking longer and investment dollars are drying up. Wildlight Entertainment, the team behind January’s new PVP shooter <em>Highguard</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192">recently underwent mass layoffs</a> just weeks after launch and months after a splashy Game Awards 2025 reveal.</p>

 <p data-testid="content-paragraph">“If you know me you’ve heard this before: Making games is hard,” 10 Chamber’s outgoing cofounder wrote on LinkedIn. “And these past years have taken their toll. But thinking back I’m proud of how we managed to punch above our weight and deliver GTFO. Both the Early Access release from a team of 9, and also the releases culminating with GTFO 1.0 from the bigger 10 Chambers team. I’m grateful for the friends I’ve made and everything I’ve learned.”</p>

              <p><span>Last July was the cut-off date for major digital platforms to comply with the UK’s Online Safety Act (OSA). In an attempt to block access between minors and material deemed “harmful” by the government, platforms like Reddit, Spotify, and X began tougher age verification for their users, such as facial scans or, in some cases, even needing to see government ID. At the top of those <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-age-verification-ai-hack-nitro-boycott-2000667358">stumbling to do so was Discord</a>, whose system is not only </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/someone-has-already-made-a-free-in-browser-3d-model-to-bypass-discord-age-verification-that-works-on-any-potato-computer/"><span>easy to game</span></a><span> but also not impossible to compromise, with one major security breach </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/oct/09/hack-age-verification-firm-discord-users-id-photos"><span>exposing some 70,000 users’ IDs shortly after</span></a><span>. Now Discord is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-will-force-you-to-scan-your-face-or-id-to-unlock-all-of-its-features-2000666884"><span>looking to enforce age verification globally</span></a><span>. A firm Discord at one point worked with to do so may be even more controversial than the decision itself.</span></p> <p><span>While the roll-out is aimed for March, </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/oh-good-discords-age-verification-rollout-has-ties-to-palantir-co-founder-and-panopticon-architect-peter-thiel/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i><span> reports</span></a><span> that some Discord users have already been prompted for new age verification, this time using the third-party service Persona. Started in 2018, Persona develops identity detection and anti-fraud technologies. They’ve been having an absolute field day since the OSA, being implemented to verify user ID across Reddit and Roblox. One sticking point, however, is who’s backing the company: Peter Thiel, the cofounder of ICE-approved surveillance firm Palantir.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">managed to catch it <a href="https://t.co/Yyu0FaoDJ7">pic.twitter.com/Yyu0FaoDJ7</a></p> <p>— Folf (@itsfolf) <a href="https://twitter.com/itsfolf/status/2021749585111069152?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>One of Persona’s biggest investors is the Founders Fund, valuing the company at $1.5 billion and </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-09-15/founders-fund-values-identity-startup-persona-at-1-5-billion"><span>rallying $150 million towards it in 2021</span></a><span>. The Founders Fund began in the mid-2000s and made key early investments in the likes of SpaceX, AirBNB, OpenAI and Polymarket. All your favorite tech things “disrupting” the modern world. And who would unleash such a monetary power unto civilization? Why, none other than your friend and mine, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hulk-hogan-sex-tape-gawker-lawsuit-kotaku-go-media-1851787000">the anti-humanist, antichrist-awaiting Thiel</a>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Thiel, of course, is known for many things. A co-founder of PayPal, Thiel is now more closely affiliated with Palantir, a company specializing in digital surveillance and exploiting user information. Palantir, named after the crystal balls that allow communication across Middle-earth in <em>The </em><em>Lord of the Rings</em>,&nbsp;has been around since 2003 but has kept plenty busy lately. </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/elite-the-palantir-app-ice-uses-to-find-neighborhoods-to-raid/"><i><span>404</span></i><span> uncovered</span></a><span> how the company has been developing ELITE, an instrument to monitor user information for the purpose of conducting ICE raids. Elsewhere, the recent, massive disclosure of Epstein emails had </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/epstein-files-tech-elites-gates-thiel-musk/"><span>reoccurring correspondence</span></a><span> between the world’s most active user information broker and the world’s most famous sex trafficker. The two discussed the lawsuit to <a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/">end</a> </span><a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/"><i><span>Gawker</span></i></a><span><a href="https://aftermath.site/jeffrey-epstein-files-kotick-thiel-xbox-rockstar/"> and how to best balkanize the planet</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Having the Founders Fund so close to expanded data-capturing across Discord, one of the more private places to have a public conversation online, </span><a href="https://piunikaweb.com/2026/02/12/discord-uk-age-verification-persona-vendor-shift/"><span>has made users a little itchy</span></a><span>. The platform has not been entirely clear about how it aims to rapidly expand its age verification process, stating a mix of mandatory scanning but also </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/discord-clarifies-it-is-not-requiring-everyone-to-complete-a-face-scan-or-upload-an-id-and-will-confirm-your-age-group-using-information-we-already-have/"><span>using existing user data to guesstimate</span></a><span> if a user is in their 30s (which is great news for everyone who communicates through </span><i><span>Simpsons</span></i><span> quotes). </span></p>

 <p><a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Complete-Age-Assurance-on-Discord"><span>In an official update</span></a><span>, Discord suggested users who encountered prompts from Persona are part of “an experiment” and that the information will only be stored for seven days. How the tech will be used in the long term is yet to be known. When asked for comment, Discord told <em>Kotaku</em> its work with Persona was part of a “limited test” which has since been concluded.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Regardless, I will see you on the forums.</span></p>

No dice.</span></p>

 <p><span>However, Grayson did succeed in tracking down the original winner of this infernal machine, a streamer by the name of </span><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/storms888"><span>Storms888</span></a><span>. While it didn’t solve the gross mysteries that got under his skin, Grayson did learn something just as shocking: the damn thing still works. Two years later the rig continues pumping its blood.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“I haven’t seen any drops in performance since the day I got it,” Storms888 tells Grayson. “Did leak a ton though.”&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>The streamer says that he believes the liquid coolant to be a cocktail of human blood and more conventional ingredients. But there is some amount of blood. Blizzard sent him replacement vials and documentational slips confirming the red stuff came from human donors. Storms888 said it’s an incredible rig for his purposes, which include livestreaming “</span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span> at ultra settings.” And with RAM prices through the roof, who can blame him for not upgrading.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>This is hardly the first time the deep red stuff has been used in a promotional stunt, nor the first time it was batched to accomplish it. In 1977, Marvel Comics mixed their ink with blood donated from each member of KISS for their funny book debut. Lil Nas X did something similar, drawing blood for </span><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/kiss-used-band-members-blood-in-marvel-comic-book-2021-3"><span>a custom pair of Nikes</span></a><span> to promote 2021’s </span><i><span>Montero</span></i><span>. Blood, it turns out, is in you to give. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>If Blizzard, Activision or Microsoft were to pull this stunt again, or cram any other body parts into giveaway hardware, it wouldn’t even make </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-ai-slop-satya-nadella-2000656473"><span>the list of the most</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/jeffrey-epstein-files-bobby-kotick-activision-ghislaine-maxwell-2000665456"><span>nauseating things</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-games-for-genocide-xbox-microsoft-boycott-palestine-2000650175"><span>to come out of them</span></a><span> in recent history.</span></p>

 <p><span>Storms888 remains chuffed by his useful, practical, even, gross-out gift.
