Wrong. Fans in denial (and delusion) are interpreting Shakman’s statements as <em>technically </em>true but not the full truth. </p><p>Some fans are focusing on how Shakman specifically mentioned that Doom is not part of <em>his </em>film or his <em>purview</em>. That sounds, they argue, like an attempt to establish plausible deniability, given how Marvel has separated certain duties on its films. After <em>Thunderbolts* </em>director Jake Schreier revealed to <em>ComicBook.com</em> that the film’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://comicbook.com/movies/news/thunderbolts-post-credits-scene-details-jake-schreier-comments/#:~:text=In%20an%20interview%20with%20ComicBook%20to%20promote%20the,only%20about%20a%20month%20before%20Thunderbolts%2A%20hits%20theaters.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://comicbook.com/movies/news/thunderbolts-post-credits-scene-details-jake-schreier-comments/#:~:text=In%20an%20interview%20with%20ComicBook%20to%20promote%20the,only%20about%20a%20month%20before%20Thunderbolts%2A%20hits%20theaters." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post-credit scene</a></span> was filmed weeks before the theatrical release, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DJOeBqnxGwC/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=8b6826e3-1af7-4964-8a1f-0d8c4abbf03d&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJOeBqnxGwC/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=8b6826e3-1af7-4964-8a1f-0d8c4abbf03d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russo Brothers confirmed</a></span> they were the ones who filmed it, rather than Schreier himself. That told Marvel fans that a film’s director doesn’t have to be involved with any post-credit reveals, which would align with Shakman’s assertion that Doom has nothing to do with his efforts on the film. </p><p>In the <em>Thunderbolts* </em>post-credit scene, the New Avengers get a notification that an unidentified aircraft had entered Earth’s atmosphere before we see the iconic “4" logo of the Fantastic Four emblazoned on the side of the ship. Doom has hijacked the Fantastic Four’s ship multiple times in the comic books, so it’s not far-fetched to believe he might do the same in the MCU. </p><p>We’ll have to wait until July 25 to see if these theories are anything more than just fanboy fantasies. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is a big increase over the laggy 30 FPS on the older Switch. Epic also confirmed that <em>Fortnite</em> on Switch 2 will boast a higher resolution in both docked and undocked play, as well as a significantly improved draw distance, allowing players to see more detail from further away. And clothing will now have physics, something seen in the other versions of <em>Fortnite </em>on Xbox, PS5, and PC.</p><figure id="" data-id="042c57312168ce7f0b3d934a535bf03f" data-recommend-id="image://042c57312168ce7f0b3d934a535bf03f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Fortnite running on a Switch 2.

Epic says if you do a console transfer from Switch to Switch 2, you’ll need to delete the old port of <em>Fortnite</em>, download the new version, and log in. Then all your skins and goodies should be waiting for you. </p><p>Epic also says that <em>Fortnite </em>will support mouse controls on Switch 2 via the console’s advanced Joy-Cons. All modes in <em>Fortnite</em>, including Battle Royale, will support mouse controls on Switch 2. The new port works with the Switch 2's capture button and GameChat system, letting you stream your game while chatting with friends.</p><p>And for you super nerds out there, like myself, Epic shared a few more techy details about the new port: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>For the hardcore tech folks: full “desktop” renderer, high-detail geometry, distance field ambient occlusion in docked mode, shadow casting point lights, high-quality effects.</p></blockquote><p>All in all, it seems like the Switch 2 port of <em>Fortnite </em>will be a comparable experience to playing on PS4 Pro or Xbox Series S, though it won’t be as graphically advanced as the PS5, PS5 Pro, PC, or Xbox Series X ports of the popular game. Still, it’s nice that Nintendo players will have a better way to play <em>Fortnite </em>in the near future, assuming they can get their hands on a Switch 2 when it launches on June 5. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
