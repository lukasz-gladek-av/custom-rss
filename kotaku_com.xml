              <p>HoYoverse, the studio behind the mega-hit&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>, has announced that the game will no longer be supported on the PS4. Not only will the game no longer receive updates on the older console by next spring, but it’s due to be removed from the PlayStation store next month, and will lose all its in-game purchases by February 2026. By the end of this process, you won’t be able to play the game on PS4 at all.</p> <p>“Due to limitations related to hardware performance and platform application size,” <a href="https://www.hoyolab.com/article/40408849">a statement from HoYoverse begins</a>, “we will be discontinuing our support and updates for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em> on PS4 in future versions.” This process will begin on September 9, 2025, when the open-world RPG will be removed from the PlayStation Store. That means, if you haven’t added the game to your PS4 before that date, it’ll disappear from search results and no longer be listed as available to download.</p> <p>Following this, after February 25, 2026, all of <em>Genshin Impact</em>‘s in-game purchases will be removed as well, both from the PS Store and from the game itself. That means if you’ve bought anything from the store but have yet to claim it in-game, you’ll need to do that before February or risk losing it entirely.</p>

 <p>Finally, on April 8, 2026, the game will lose all PS4 support and will no longer allow players to log in, and that’s that. Of course, people can use their accounts to continue playing the game on other systems, including the Xbox Series, PS5 and PC. Or even mobile.</p> <p>And it’s this last part that makes the decision somewhat confusing. No one can argue that HoYoverse isn’t given plenty of warning to PS4 players–it’s eight months until the game will become inaccessible–but the reasons given seem a little strange when the game runs fine on mobile devices. The PlayStation 4 released in 2013, so is clearly pretty old tech, but it does seem odd that the stated issues regarding hardware and install size wouldn’t also affect cellphones. The game’s listed requirements for Android are 8GB of storage and 3GB of memory, working on anything from an Arm v8a 64-bit chip or higher–an architecture that’s been around since 2011. It’s a bit more needy on iOS, wanting anything from 2017’s iPhone 8 onward. Meanwhile, the PS4 launched with 8GB of RAM and 500GB storage, which would therefore seem plenty. Of course, it could be far more complicated than this, and we’ve reached out to HoYoverse to ask for more information about what’s caused the issues.</p> <p>Either way, this still sucks for PS4 owners, and speaks to the impermanence of modern games.</p>
