              <p>A new Unreal Engine 5-powered horror game based on 1978’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/retrorealms-halloween-ash-evil-dead-horror-16-bit-retro-1851620847"><em>Halloween</em></a> from director John Carpenter is in the works and will launch next year. It’s titled <em>Halloween: The Game,</em> and will feature iconic slasher Michael Myers killing people on the night he returns home.</p> <p>Announced on August 20, <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219630/Halloween/">Halloween: The Game</a>,</em> which isn’t the most creative name, will be heavily inspired by the original movie and will feature a “one-versus-many stealth horror experience.” The game will let players put on Michael’s mask and stab their friends online in multiplayer or run away from the killer as a civilian of Haddonefield. IllFonic, the team developing <em>Halloween: The Game, </em>is a studio that has become well-known for its focus on asymmetrical online games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/predator-hunting-grounds-is-only-fun-when-the-predator-1843181244"><em>Predator: Hunting Grounds</em></a> and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/rest-in-pieces-friday-the-13th-the-game-1827582283">now-defunct<em> Friday the 13th</em> game.&nbsp;</a></p> <p>Here’s the official trailer for <em>Halloween: The Game:</em></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Halloween The Game - Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NFfhM1Jxqds?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>In a press release for the newly announced horror game, it was confirmed that <em>Halloween</em> will include a story mode and the ability to play against bots, too. As someone who has been disappointed by so many <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/killer-klowns-from-outer-space-the-game">horror movie franchises</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-texas-chainsaw-massacre-game-review-crossplay-ps5-1850752842">getting video game adaptations</a> that are purely online-only, this is good news. And I imagine many other players will agree. <em>Halloween: The Game</em> will also feature “multiple maps” and a soundtrack “inspired by” that of the original <em>Halloween</em> movie. Interestingly, the original film’s director, John Carpenter, is credited as an executive producer on the upcoming game.</p>

 <p>“Working with Compass International Pictures and Further Front has been a dream,” said Charles Brungardt, CEO of IllFonic. “As rights holders of the film and producers on the game, they’ve shared incredible insights to help us stay true to the soul of the 1978 film. Their tremendous passion for Michael Myers has pushed us to craft something that fans of the franchise will truly appreciate.”</p> <p><em>Halloween: The Game</em> is set to launch on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC in 2026. <em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Illfonic to see if this project is the same one <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-ign-halloween-games-michael-myers-john-carpenter-1851619732">teased back in 2024.</a></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-switch-2-erderee-expansion-open-world-rpg-1851774222"><i><span>Elden Ring</span></i></a> <span>is one of the most exciting </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-elden-ring-gtav-final-fantasy-1851745512"><span>third-party games coming to Nintendo Switch 2</span></a><span>. Who among us doesn’t want to get our shit rocked on the go? Well, according to folks who have played FromSoftware’s action RPG at Gamescom in Cologne, the system is apparently struggling to run the game in handheld mode, and to make matters more worrisome, Bandai Namco is reportedly not letting people record footage of it.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Hq3m8UwhGM"><i><span>Nintendo Life</span></i></a> <span>posted a video on its YouTube channel discussing the port and said that while they only played the Switch 2 port for about 15 minutes, the game looks pretty good visually, but leaves a lot to be desired in terms of performance. The tutorial ran pretty well at a locked 30fps. Once they reached the open world, everything changed.</span></p> <p><span>“It’s really bad, and I understand why they don’t want you to see this, because wowie zowie, it is terrible,” </span><i><span>Nintendo Life </span></i><span>video producer Felix Sanchez said. “Of course, you’re never going to see the light of this—maybe it will just release in that state, but I can’t imagine they will do that—It was like playing </span><i><span>Ocarina of Time</span></i><span>. It was like 20 frames per second, sometimes I was like, ‘This has dropped [to] 15 frames per second.'”</span></p>

 <p><span>Sanchez says that in the Switch 2’s handheld mode, the game was “incredibly unstable” in the open-world segments, even in surprisingly static areas where few enemies were on screen at once. You can hear his full impressions below:</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="We've Played Elden Ring on Switch 2 and Have Concerns" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Hq3m8UwhGM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>So if you’re wondering why </span><i><span>Elden Ring </span></i><span>footage is conspicuously absent from the internet’s Gamescom coverage, now you know that Bandai Namco has prohibited it. The game is supposed to launch on the Switch 2 this year, but it doesn’t have a release date at the moment. It’s entirely possible the game could be delayed into 2026 to fix things up, or that things could turn around by the time it finally comes out. Whatever the case, it sounds like </span><i><span>Elden Ring</span></i><span> on Switch 2 has not made the best first impression.</span></p>
