              <p>If you’re looking for something new to play this fall but can’t quite decide what to dive into, these free demos might help you make up your mind. They run the gamut from traditional turn-based RPG to action roguelike and mech RPG-lite. Best of all, nearly all of them let you carry over your progress from the free demo to the full paid game if you end up taking the plunge. Most of them are also available across nearly ever console.</p> <h2><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em></h2>  <p>I recently had the opportunity to go hands-on with <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> for <a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-digifarm-hands-on-preview-2000624093">a couple of hours at PAX West</a> and was pleasantly surprised by just how good it looks, sounds, and plays. It’s a crunchy turn-based RPG that seems like it’ll have a lot of Digimon-customizing depth to mine, but with the aid of some streamlining including a fast-forward option for battles. The demo takes place at the beginning of the game, sets up its central mystery, and introduces you to most of the basic systems. If you opt to keep playing, you can pick up right where you left off in the full release next month.</p> <p><strong>Release Date:</strong> October 3</p> <p><strong>Platform:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p> <h2><em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</em></h2>  <p>Imagine <em>Hades</em> but you control two characters instead of just one and you get a sense of the chaos and potential of <em>Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</em>. Choose a team of two from an assortment of guardians, each with their own abilities and each controlled by a separate thumbstick. If you make it to the end, a guardian must be sacrificed and is removed from your pool of fighters until the evil you’re fighting is sealed away for good. There’s a fair bit of town-building, build-crafting, and weapon-crafting on top of this loop, making<em> Towa and the Guardians</em> far and away one of the more interesting mashups I’ve played this year.</p>

 <p><strong>Release Date:</strong> September 19</p> <p><strong>Platform:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Switch 1, Switch 2</p> <h2><em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em></h2>  <p>The first game in the super-awesome but very convoluted <em>Trails</em> series is getting a remake and it’s almost out.<em> Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em> is a modern 3D overhaul of the 2006 isometric PSP RPG. It’s basically taking the world and story of the original and grafting it onto the more current gameplay systems from the recent <em>Trails Through Daybreak</em> games, including a hybrid of turn-based and real-time action combat options. If you’ve always been curious about Nihon Falcom’s long-running science fantasy series but couldn’t figure out where to jump in, <em> Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em> is meant to be the lifeline for you. It might not be as easy to hop into from a gameplay perspective as the original, but the presentation and everything else is a lot prettier and more streamlined.</p> <p><strong>Release Date:</strong> September 19</p> <p><strong>Platform:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Switch 1, Switch 2</p> <h2><em>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion</em></h2>  <p>What if you combined <em>Armored Core</em> with <em>Xenoblade Chronicles</em>? It sounds like a match made in open-world mech RPG heaven, right? Based on my early time with <em>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion</em>, the sequel to the Switch exclusive doesn’t entirely deliver on that promise but there are definitely more than a few flashes of brilliance. <em>Titanic Scion</em> has you taking big robot suits through sprawling environments to kill enemies and upgrade your powers, culminating in the occasional big boss fight. The scope is way more massive than in the original, which means it’s not necessarily doing any one thing very good. For anime mech-heads, though, it’s definitely worth a look. What it lacks in cogent storytelling and environmental detail, it makes up for with some really excellent mech progression and customization gameplay.</p> <p><strong>Release Date:</strong> September 5</p> <p><strong>Platform:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Switch 1, Switch 2</p> <h2><em>Persona 3: Reload&nbsp;</em></h2>  <p>The best <em>Persona</em> is finally coming to Switch 2! <em>Persona 3: Reload</em> hit PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC last year, where the demo has been free for a while now. But the announcement of a port for Nintendo’s newest portable has brought a free demo to Switch 2 as well ahead of launch next month. Hang in there! The opening of <em>Persona 3</em> is one of the slowest among the series’ modern entries, and the dungeon-grinding mechanics can get tedious at times. But the music, characters, and later game are all top-notch. If the other <em>Persona</em> games haven’t gripped you, <em>Reload</em> might have what you’ve been missing. There’s a bit more old-school dungeon crawling in it and the story is darker, more unsettling, and, in my opinion at least, ultimately more engaging.</p> <p><strong>Release Date:</strong> October 23</p> <p><strong>Platform:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Switch 2</p>

              <p><span>OpenAI officially has a Korean office. Normally, that wouldn’t be news we would cover here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, but </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span>, Netflix’s animated musical phenomenon, was apparently brought up during the generative AI organization’s launch event for its new Korean subsidiary on Monday, September 15. Vince, a prolific K-pop producer who wrote songs performed by the film’s demonic boy band group called the Saja Boys, made an appearance at the Seoul event. That’s annoying in and of itself, but he also apparently dropped the bomb that he used AI to help write the group’s infectious song “Soda Pop.”</span></p>   <p><span>OpenAI technical staff member Sherwin Wu said in a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KpopDemonhunters/comments/1nhu38x/vince_admitted_to_using_chatgpt_in_writing_soda/"><span>since-deleted tweet</span></a><span> that Vince said he used ChatGPT to write “Soda Pop,” and that the generative chatbot “gave him ideas to make it sound ‘more bubbly.'” This occurred during an on-stage discussion with Oliver Jay, OpenAI’s Chief Business Officer. </span><a href="https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2025-09-15/business/tech/BTSs-RM-shares-photo-celebrating-birthday-at-unofficial-OpenAI-launch-event/2399287"><i><span>Korea Joongang Daily</span></i></a><span> reports that Vince said this was an example of how AI is “already used in K-pop production,” but this is notably not a direct quote, as the original article was written in Korean and “translated by a bilingual reporter with the help of generative AI tools.” </span>The publication’s <a href="https://www.joongang.co.kr/article/25367002">original Korean article</a> includes mentions of Vince using ChatGPT, but doesn’t call out <i>KPop Demon Hunters</i> or “Soda Pop” by name. We’ve reached out to the outlet for clarification.</p>  <p><span>At the moment, there doesn’t seem to be footage of Vince’s talk on the internet, but we’ve reached out to Netflix and OpenAI for comment on the situation. Based on these accounts, it sounds like Vince used ChatGPT to help ideate the song that would eventually become “Soda Pop,” but AI was not used to generate the song that appears in the film. Rei Ami, one of the vocalists behind the voices of the fictional girl group Huntr/x, has been </span><a href="https://x.com/reiamimami/status/1955420365439771097?s=46"><span>very vocal about the real people behind every performance</span></a><span> in the film ever since accusations of AI use have sprouted up in the wake of the film’s colossal popularity.</span></p> <p><span>Even if the final song is all produced and sung by real people, fans are feeling burned knowing AI may have played any part in the creation of the film, given </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381"><span>its worldwide success</span></a><span> and how it’s become a poster child for people advocating for new ideas in the animation industry in the face of never-ending sequel slop. We’ll update this story if we hear back from Netflix or if Vince makes an official statement.</span></p>
