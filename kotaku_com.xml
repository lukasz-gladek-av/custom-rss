              <p>Skateboarding games are a hell of a good time and EA’s recent <i>skate</i>, the free-to-play title aiming to reboot EA’s once-cherished series, is trying to lure folks back into the thrills of digital ollies and kickflips. And because it’s a free-to-play game from a AAA publisher in 2025, it’s got microtransactions and seasons and all that stuff. While we mostly tolerate this silliness in games nowadays, some stuff is just too expensive and too ugly to pass without comment.</p> <p>Instead of throwing money at the screen for a skin of space zombie-stomper Isaac Clarke from <i>Dead Space</i>, fans of <i>skate</i> have taken to the internet to throw shade at the developers for selling such an ugly version of Clarke for $35 bucks (h/t <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-space-fans-slam-35-isaac-clarke-costume-in-eas-new-skate/1100-6535310/">comrade Pitts at <i>GameSpot</i></a>). That’s like, a whole meal at Taco Bell these days (with maybe a drink if you’re lucky). It’s also the price of many full, complete games you can play from start to finish. That’s probably what’s left folks so sore: <i>skate</i>. Is the type of game you could once plunk down a moderate sum for and be done with it, but is now yet another nagging wallet leech trying to bank on your nostalgia.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">You can buy 3 Dead Sapce games with that money  (and probably 3 Skate games)</p> <p>— Diogo Rodrigues (@Rodrigues_520) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rodrigues_520/status/1975629911059800416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The situation reminds us just how far we’ve come from an era of gaming that felt more respectful of our time and money. One fan over on r/SkateEA points out that 2010’s <i>Skate 3</i> had an Isaac Clarke skin–but it was free and seemed more faithful to the character’s appearance in the original game.</p>

    <p>It’s a real shame as <i>skate</i> looks like a good time otherwise, full of all of the crazy stuff we’ll never be able to do in real life on a skateboard.</p>   <p>And as another fan on Reddit opines, the game’s battle pass (skate pass?) just contains “ugly accessories and clothing along with phoned in feeling graphics for decks” instead of stuff from actual skate brands. And if ever there was an industry that was ripe for having its aesthetics&nbsp; cut up and sold in little bits, it’s the skateboard industry. With its various legendary designs, from the <a href="https://www.birdhouseskateboards.com/">epic birds of Birdhouse Skateboards</a> to the gorgeous artwork found on your average <a href="https://www.elementbrand.lu/skateboards/">Element board</a> (which used to my brand of choice back in the day), there’s a ton of cool designs that could be packaged into the game as a fitting tribute to the industry. I’d still be annoyed if those cost $35 a piece, but at least they’d feel a little more relevant.</p>  <p>C’mon, EA.</p>

              <p>Doja Cat is coming to <a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-fortnite-rei-ami-stream-zoey-rumi-2000632536">Fortnite’s 2025 Halloween event</a> and the battle royale tried to get players hyped by letting R&amp;B’s “Queen of Memes” take over the <em>Fortnite</em> X account on Wednesday. It didn’t take long for that piece of online performance art to blow up after the account tweeted what seemed like an obvious allusion to sex toys and Doja Cat denied being behind it. “Shit cringe as fuck now I’m embarrassed,” she wrote back.</p> <p>The<em> Fortnite</em> X account had Doja Cat’s in-game face as its avatar when it posted “mother of rose toys,” which many fans immediately took to mean sex toys. “Oh damn the sex update is real!!” one joked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1o1jdub/mother_of_rose_toys/">on the subreddit</a>. But Doja Cat immediately distanced herself from the whole thing and the post was taken down. People didn’t believe her at first. “I told them not to man that’s not even me,” she wrote. “I said this yesterday and then said ‘don’t post that’ :/.”</p> <p> <figure id="attachment_2000633342" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000633342"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000633342">X</figcaption></figure> </p> <p>The internet-savvy artist has a history of trolling and back-handed marketing endorsements, as <a href="http://he internet-savvy artist known for trolling"><em>Polygon</em> points out</a>. So many are left wondering whether this was an actual brand activation gone bad or part of some elaborate 4D poster chess to get people talking and arguing about what is, at the end of the day, a microtransaction-filled in-game event aimed at getting players to empty their virtual wallets on overpriced skins. Is the modern media landscape so cynical as to desperately gin up a non-troversy just to pad the quarterly sales figures?</p> <p>Some folks are genuinely surprised that a game largely aimed at children would go anywhere near sexual entendres, even if the whole thing really is just a social media fake-out on page seven of the <em>Fortnite</em> Halloween 2025 marketing deck. With the culture already primed to lash out at any online gaming-adjacent micro-scandal, it does seem a bit far-fetched that Epic Games would willingly ignite a whole discourse cycle around “<em>Fortnite</em> sex toys.”</p> <p>After all, it only just got done making sure there weren’t any accidental Nazi allusions in its latest <a href="https://kotaku.com/peacemaker-s2-fortnite-dance-nazi-swastika-refund-2000630714"><em>Peacemaker</em> emote</a> following some late season-2 twists. It’s due back tomorrow with a “modified” animation that will apparently remove any possibility of it accidentally conjuring a swastika. Then again, Epic didn’t seem too worried about Darth Vader, voiced by AI James Earl Jones, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-star-wars-ai-darth-vader-james-earl-jones-1851781018">saying racist stuff and cursing at players,</a> so who can say?</p>
