Goodbye, Aerosmith, the band the ride has been attached to since it opened. Apparently, Disney also plans to have “music’s biggest stars” team up with the Muppets, but didn’t share any details on what that will entail. </p><p>As with any change to a Disney Park, there was a mix of excitement from some online as well as a lot of complaints. Many older fans aren’t happy that Disney is removing more of the park’s history and replacing it with more movie tie-in rides and areas. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wdwinfo.com/walt-disney-world/walt-disney-world-is-paving-over-rivers-of-america-to-put-up-a-parking-lot/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wdwinfo.com/walt-disney-world/walt-disney-world-is-paving-over-rivers-of-america-to-put-up-a-parking-lot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In August 2024</a></span>, Disney announced plans to remove the Rivers of America and replace it with a new <em>Cars</em>-inspired area and ride. </p><p>The Muppet*Vision 3D attraction and show isn’t closing right away and Disney says people will have time to enjoy it one last time.

A paid<em> Throes of the Watchmaker</em> expansion is coming in 2025 that adds a new area and dungeon to explore. </p><h2 id="h33076"><a id=""></a><em>Blasphemous 2</em></h2><p> The Game Kitchen’s sequel to its first 2D side-scrolling Souls-like did not disappoint. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/blasphemous-2-review-metroidvania-soulslike-platformer-1850767035?_gl=1*1krk5t7*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMjI5NzY5NC45MS4xLjE3MzIyOTkyODAuMjEuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/blasphemous-2-review-metroidvania-soulslike-platformer-1850767035?_gl=1*1krk5t7*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMjI5NzY5NC45MS4xLjE3MzIyOTkyODAuMjEuMC4w"><em>Blasphemous 2</em></a></span> was one of 2023's great games, introducing new weapon-based playstyles and putting an emphasis on exploration that pushed it much more in the direction of being a proper Metroidvanaia. The free <em>True Torment</em> update arrived alongside the paid <em>Mea Culpa </em>DLC in October. It added new game+ mode with difficulty modifiers, more enemies, abilities, a Labyrinth of Tides challenge, and expanded zones with better connecting areas to streamline backtracking. The way the new game+ mode was structured has been controversial with fans, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2114740/view/4479486532875452519&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2114740/view/4479486532875452519" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but changes based on that feedback</a></span> are due out before the end of November. </p><h2 id="h33077"><a id=""></a><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</em></h2><p>2022's<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tmnt-shredders-revenge-review-tribute-game-dotemu-multi-1849077972&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tmnt-shredders-revenge-review-tribute-game-dotemu-multi-1849077972"><em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em></a></span> is one of the defining beat-em-ups of the dcade, combining retro sensibilities with incredible pixel art animations and game feel. Kicking Foot Clan ass never felt so good, or so responsive. And somehow the game is still getting new free content. September’s paid <em>Radical Reptile </em>DLC added Mondo Gecko and Mona Lisa—deep cuts from the ‘80s cartoon—as new fighters, but a free update alongside the expansion also added a Remix Mode that lets you battle with music  from guest artists including Jake Kaufman (<em>Shovel Knight</em>), Tomoya Tomita (<em>Yoshi’s Woolly World</em>), Sean Bialo (<em>Penny’s Big Bre</em>ak<em>away</em>), Button Masher (<em>Secret Levels</em>), Keiji Yamagishi (<em>Ninja Gaiden</em>), and Anamanaguchi (<em>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World</em>). It’s perfect for someone like me who’s still grinding out the platinum trophy on PS5. </p><h2 id="h33078"><a id=""></a><em>Front Mission 1st Remake</em></h2><p><em>Front Mission 1st Remake</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/front-mission-1st-remake-review-nintendo-switch-rpg-1849836644&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/front-mission-1st-remake-review-nintendo-switch-rpg-1849836644">isn’t one of my favorite remakes</a></span> of a Square Enix RPG in recent years, but it gets the job done and is the only way to play one of the best old-school mech strategy RPGs around.

The other big part of the update is a local multiplayer mode that includes co-op and PvP skirmishes. I’d love a fully online version, but it’s still a neat novelty for hardcore <em>Front Mission</em>-heads.</p><h2 id="h33079"><a id=""></a><em>Remnant 2</em></h2><p>Souls-like loot shooter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/remnant-ii-dark-souls-handler-class-does-the-dog-die-1850540297&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/remnant-ii-dark-souls-handler-class-does-the-dog-die-1850540297"><em>Remnant II</em></a></span>’s final DLC arrived this autumn as well. While the paid <em>The Dark Horizon</em> expansion added new storylines and dungeons, the free update, out at the same time, introduced a boss rush mode for a more concentrated action experience. Cutting out all of the exploration, the new mode just throws enemies big and small at players and their co-op squads with the runs augmented by various buffs earned as they progress. It’s basically another roguelite mode with additional loot that rewards players for taking the punishment.</p><h2 id="h33080"><a id=""></a><em>I Am Your Beast</em></h2><p>Most recently, the excellent <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-am-your-beast-shooter-john-wick-is-it-good-fps-demo-1851538308&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-am-your-beast-shooter-john-wick-is-it-good-fps-demo-1851538308">lo-fi shooter <em>I Am Your Beast</em></a></span>, which is kind of like <em>Hotline Miami</em> in 3D, just received a bunch of new levels via its free Support Group update on Friday. The new content offers players even more “extraordinary abilities” to overcome “extreme situations” across nine new levels. That’s a big addition given the base game only had 27. The short but punchy experience just got a little less short and a little more punchy. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
