            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Early on in <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505"><i>Silent Hill f</i></a>, as Hinako and friends try to regroup after the fog and its monsters roll into town, our girl finds herself stranded in the middle of a field, surrounded by scarecrows dressed like schoolchildren wielding sickles. Like many moments in <i>f</i>, the way through this challenge involves some puzzle solving and a couple of scuffles. What really makes this moment sing, however, is how it combines the separate elements of <i>Silent Hill f</i> into one: Puzzle solving, paranoid dread, and combat that will punish you for sloppy mistakes.</p> <p><strong>Read More:&nbsp;</strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505"><em>Silent Hill f</em>: The&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></p> <p>The scarecrows are, of course, no ordinary scarecrows, and can definitely turn those sickles on you. They don’t attack immediately, however; instead, they remain frozen, waiting for you to pick the right one based on a cryptic riddle, after which the correct scarecrow will point you in the direction of the next challenge and eventually out of the fog. Choose the wrong scarecrow and you’ll get attacked, with few replacement weapons in sight. Oh, and you’ll regularly hear footsteps behind you as you try to figure out which scarecrow is the correct one. Yes, they are following you, but only when you’re not looking. The number of scarecrows and the speed with which they freeze when you turn to look at them is enough to make you question whether or not you’re hearing things, and even those footsteps don’t guarantee an attack every time you hear them. Early on, I wondered if the game was just playing the sound effect to screw with me. Nope! I was eventually attacked by one of these freaks.</p> <p>The horror of this whole scene isn’t one of blood dripping red in your face, but instead comes from the pressure to figure out the puzzle, which is virtually immune to brute force solutions, in a timely manner. The sheer tension of this situation, sustained in the perpetual gray fog of this endless field, makes it one of <i>f</i>’s best moments.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000629872" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629872"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629872">© Screenshot: NeoBards Entertainment / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Most of <i>Silent Hill f</i>’s puzzles resist brute-force solutions due to their sheer number of variables. Many of them are technically solvable by just trying out every possible combination, but it’s all too easy to end up spinning your wheels in frustration for far longer than is necessary instead (ask me how I know). What makes the field puzzle so uniquely resistant to brute force is that it punishes you rather harshly for just trying to spam your way through it.</p>

 <p>Each scarecrow segment starts with a riddle like:</p> <blockquote><p>Can you even imagine how I feel?<br> I’ll put on my polite smile for now.</p></blockquote> <p>You’ll then need to choose the one that best fits the description from among around half-a-dozen scarecrows. It’s not easy; you’ll have to determine which scarecrow seems to give a “polite smile,” or in another instance, which scarecrow looks like it’s betraying another.</p>

 <p>Against your better judgment, you’ll have to get up close and personal with many of the scarecrows, with footsteps playing behind you sporadically, and the chance that one of these freaks is actually ready to jump you at any moment.</p> <p>During my first playthrough, I screwed up the final puzzle of this whole sequence and had about five or six scarecrows stalking me around the feels as I frantically tore at the remaining ones to find the correct solution.</p> <p>The puzzle also deals with <i>f</i>’s consistent themes about love, longing, betrayal, and harm; so, not only is the game asking you to survive the dread of the endless gray fog and murderous scarecrows, but you’ll also be trying to figure out how this sequence fits in with <i>f</i>’s cryptic narrative. It’s a nice mixture of traditional survival horror puzzle solving,&nbsp; the threat of the game’s punishing combat, and its looming sense of dread, all without feeling like it’s a bunch of abstract symbol-matching or number crunching.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/peacemaker-fortnite-nazi-emote-season-2-spoilers-2000629842</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-peacemaker-dance-pulled-over-nazi-concerns-following-latest-episode%E2%80%99s-big-reveal.1311544/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>“Peaceful Hips” is an&nbsp;emote that was added to <em>Fortnite</em> earlier this month. Part of the “DC Series,” it cost 400 V-Bucks and referenced HBO’s show <em>Peacemaker</em> HBO, specifically a dance move the character does in the season 2 intro that has him flapping his arms and swerving his hips around. That was all fine and good until the comic book series’ big season 2 reveal last week cast it in a different light. Epic Games has now pulled the cosmetic over concerns about its “creative intentions.” In plain English, Epic is worried it might be intended to look like a Nazi Swastika.</p> <p>“We’re disabling the Peaceful Hips Emote in <em>Fortnite</em> as we inquire into our partner’s creative intentions in this collab emote,” the battle roayle’s <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1972168326551138447">official account</a> announced over the weekend. “Assuming it’s not coming back, we’ll issue refunds in the next few days. Sorry folks.” All of this weirdness stems from the following dance which players were previously able to buy separately or as part of the Peacemaker bundle:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000629848" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629848"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629848">Epic Games / DiscussingFilm / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It wasn’t until <em>Peacemaker</em> season 2 episode 6 that some people started seeing it in a different light. Full <strong>spoiler warning</strong> ahead if you haven’t watched yet and don’t want to know what happens.</p> <p>Chris Smith, AKA Peacemaker, doesn’t want to leave the alternate dimension where things seem “perfect” despite that menacing suspicion that something is very, very off.&nbsp; It turns out that this Earth-2 the mercenary’s been hanging out in is actually Earth-X, our planet in an alternate timeline where the United States lost to Hitler’s Germany in WWII. In case the lack of any non-white people didn’t give it away already, the big reveal comes when Chris realizes there’s a Swastika on the American flag. It now seems like that Nazi theme may have made it into the <em>Fortnite</em> emote. <em>Forbes</em> notes its similarity to a&nbsp; dance Donald Duck performs in the&nbsp; Disney short “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7vb89c6pQY">Der Fuehrer’s Face</a>” when he’s trained to become a Nazi.</p> <p>The headscratching part is how Epic Games didn’t know about this twist coming ahead of time, or who at Warner Bros. or HBO would have tried to keep its “creative intentions” hidden. The show is written and directed by James Gunn, the creative force fueling <em>Superman</em> and the rest of the rebooted DC universe right now. Epic would have seemingly developed the emote in-house, suggesting that it didn’t initially raise any suspicions internally. Live by the branded cosmetic, fail by the branded cosmetic, I suppose.</p>

Beyond that, the Saudi Arabian government has been hosting events with industry figureheads like Hideo Kojima.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We may not be getting a handheld Xbox anytime soon, but this will be the next closest thing. Asus has partnered with Microsoft to create an update to the ROG Ally with official-branding for Xbox. The Asus ROG Xbox Ally enters the market as a new competitor to the Steam Deck and Nintendo Switch 2 to be your go-to gaming handheld. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4361/">It’s set to arrive on October 16 and the pre-order window has just opened up.</a> Head on over to Amazon and reserve yours today for $600.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about the core improvements on this model over the existing Asus ROG Ally. This new model is now powered by an AMD Ryzen Z2 A processor and puts to use an all-new streamlined Windows OS. Both will lead to a smoother user experience both in and out of your games.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4361/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Your Gaming Library, Anywhere</h2>
<p>Access your full library of PC games and boot up directly into the new Xbox App UI. Stream Xbox games from either your console or from Microsoft’s cloud streaming service. The Xbox Game bar can be accessed quickly via the Xbox button on the left side of the handheld. The Asus ROG Xbox Ally also has support for Steam, Epic Games Store and other game stores so you won’t just be locked into the Xbox architecture.</p>
<p>The gaming handheld comes with 16GB of dual channel RAM along with a 512GB PCle Gen4 M.2 2280 SSD. Storage is upgradable if you wish to download more games than the default capacity allows.</p>



<p>The screen measures in at seven inches across, same as the Steam Deck, and weighs just under 1.5 lbs. — almost exactly the same as the Steam Deck on that front too. The display is capable of 1080p HD along with a refresh rate of 120Hz. The redesigned chassis is pulls inspiration from the model Xbox wireless core controllers, employing new contoured grips for better comfort gaming all day long. Choose to play either handheld or hooked up to your TV via the dual USB-C ports.</p>
<p>The Asus ROG Xbox Ally has a 60Wh battery to your game time running long and can recharge fairly quickly. Just have it plugged in for a half hour will get it back up from zero to 50% battery life.</p>
<p>Alongside this model is the upgraded Asus ROG Xbox Ally X which features a more powerful processor, more RAM and a full 1TB SSD, doubling the base model’s storage capacity. It also comes with an 80Wh battery. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4361/">Unfortunately, most storefronts appear to be sold out on the X model, but you can still pre-order the Asus ROG Xbox Ally for $600 over at Amazon.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-didnt-wait-for-prime-big-deal-days-fire-tv-stick-hd-is-already-down-to-almost-free-2000629372</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lots of awesome movies that hit theaters over the summer have finally released to streaming. So if you missed them on the big screen, now’s your chance to see them on the small-to-medium screen. James Gunn’s take on<em> Superman&nbsp;</em>starring David Corenswet as the titular super-powered man arrived on HBO Max. There you can also check out Tim Robinson and Paul Rudd’s painfully awkward, intense, and hilarious <em>Friendship</em>. And Zach Cregger’s invigorating horror flick <em>Weapons&nbsp;</em>can now be rented from most places that offer digital on-demand. But in order to watch any of these, you’re gonna need something to stream to —something like Amazon’s Fire TV Stick. Right now, you can get one for dirt cheap. These things normally aren’t too pricey to begin with, starting at $35. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/">For a limited time, however, you can snag one for about half price at just $18.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Amazon has upgraded its line of Fire TV Sticks over the years and this is the latest model, albeit, the first in the lineup. It doesn’t support 4K, and it’s still stuck back on Wi-Fi 5. While it does only stream in Full HD 1080p, most streaming service charge extra for 4K streaming to a point where they’re not even worth it. Netflix’s premium plan is now up to $25 per month. That’s more than you’re paying for the Amazon Fire TV Stick and that’s just for a single month. You’ll likely be streaming most content in regular HD anyway, so in practice, you may not even notice the difference between getting this one or shelling out for the Fire TV Stick 4K.</p>



<h2>Xbox Games Right to Your TV</h2>
<p>One big bonus of the Fire TV Stick is it now supports Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. You no longer need an Xbox console to play Xbox games. Stream games from the cloud like&nbsp;<em>Black Myth Wukong</em>, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, or even the newly released <em>Borderlands 4</em>. The first two are just part of Game Pass, but the latter does require you to purchase a copy.</p>
<p>If you are intrigued by the prospect of playing Xbox titles directly off the Fire TV Stick, you can consider picking up the unit bundled with a Luna Controller. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4360/">That normally goes for $105, but has also been marked down halfway to just $53</a>. You can also choose to pair a different Bluetooth controller such as the official Xbox core wireless controller. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4359/">Otherwise, just go with the standard Fire TV Stick HD, now only $18.</a></p>
