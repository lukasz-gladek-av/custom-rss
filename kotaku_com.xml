That delay is apparently the result of internal concerns about the game’s development following outside testing. <em>Fairgame$</em> is being made by Haven Studios, a Montreal-based team formed of ex-Google Stadia devs that Sony acquired in 2022. It was being run by Raymond, a veteran of <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>and EA Motive. Not anymore. </p><p> “Jade Raymond has been an incredible partner and visionary force in founding Haven Studios,” a spokesperson for Sony told <em>Bloomberg </em>in a statement. “We are deeply grateful for her leadership and contributions, and we wish her all the best in her next chapter.” </p><p><em>Fairgame</em>$ was revealed back in a 2023 PlayStation showcase with little detail about what the game would consist of. It was situated around class warfare and “emergent sandbox gameplay,” with shades of <em>Robin Hood</em> meets <em>Payday 2</em> if it were made by Ubisoft. The studio behind it was formed in 2021 shortly after Google shut down its internal development teams, previously led by Raymond, following the failure of its cloud gaming platform Stadia. </p><p>Sony is sticking by <em>Fairgame$</em> for now and has appointed Marie-Eve Danis and Pierre-François Sapinski as co-studio heads.
