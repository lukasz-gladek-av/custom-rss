              <p><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-final-hours-videos-clips-stream-2000659367"><span>been officially wiped off the face of the Earth</span></a><span> for two days now, and Mark Darrah, an ex-BioWare producer who worked on both the ill-fated looter shooter and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569"><span>the </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>series</span></a><span>, has released a nearly four-hour postmortem on the game and how it all went wrong. If you care at all about the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-bioware-dragon-age-mass-effect-1851786136"><span>RPG developer’s odd live-service detour</span></a><span>, it’s a pretty interesting watch, but there’s one thing of note we’re going to focus on: </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>could have had local servers that would have allowed it to live on even after EA had abandoned it.</span></p>  <p><span>At the end of Darrah’s video, he starts to give a soft pitch for how </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>could live on and maybe even see a bit of that fabled </span><i><span>No Man’s Sky </span></i><span>redemption arc that BioWare was hoping for when it announced it was revamping the game in 2019.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>He says that his idea would “conservatively” run EA about $10 million, and if that should sell more than 400,000 copies, it could actually work out for everyone involved. To start, he suggests moving </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> to current-gen consoles, rather than leaving it on PS4 and Xbox One, and using locally-hosted servers. Apparently, BioWare had local servers running in a development environment “up until a few months before launch,” and while he doesn’t know if they still work, the code is there and can be recovered.</span></p>

 <p><span>“The reason you do this, it pulls away the cost of maintaining this game,” Darrah says. “So rather than having dedicated servers that are required for the game to run, you let the server run on one of the machines that’s playing the game.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Hearing that BioWare, at some point in development, had the tools in place to save </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> from its fate actually gives me a mix of sadness and anger for the devs and fans who wanted the game to go on existing, even if it wasn’t going to be supported with future updates. BioWare’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-servers-still-up-shut-down-bioware-ea-1851785618"><span>reasoning for shutting the game down without an offline mode</span></a><span> was that it was “designed to be an online-only title,” but now we know that there were, at one time, tools in place to remove all the server costs from EA’s shoulders, and that it just chose not to use them. Killing the game off is certainly the more straightforward approach, but it’s also far more destructive.</span></p>

 <p><span>Darrah goes on to suggest that most of the hypothetical $10 million budget would go into making </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> a single-player game, which would require creating AI party members to accommodate the game’s combat encounters which are balanced for multiple players. He suggests either promoting some of the NPCs to companions, or just making three to five new characters that could go through the existing story alongside you with their own stories. He even says that if EA really wanted to do it for cheap, go with the bare minimum amount of new party members by capping it at three so they just fill out your four-player party.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“If you can do those two things and turn the local servers on and give them a little bit of their own storytelling, that what you have essentially reverse-engineered is a BioWare game without romances with a decent BioWare-style story with companions that can be played as a single-player game,” Darrah says. “And I think there are a significant number of people who enjoy BioWare stories who did not play </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> because they didn’t want to play a multiplayer looter shooter who would be interested enough in seeing that story to pick that game up and give it a try.”</span></p>

 <p><span>As nice as it sounds, Darrah says he has no faith that EA would do something like this, even if it were a relatively cheap lift compared to running the servers forever. It’s annoying to know that </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>could still have lived on in some form, but at least we know definitively that EA and BioWare pissed in our ears and told us it was raining.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re preparing to put some of your holiday cash to work by building yourself a gaming PC, stop. Before you lock yourself into a mediocre graphics card that will mess up your whole rig, check out this Amazon deal on <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6203/">the ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5070 card, which is just $540 for a limited time</a> (down from $609). That goes double if your dream DIY rig is going to be on the smaller side — we’ll explain why.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6203/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Anyone who’s ever built a gaming rig from scratch or performed a massive overhaul to upgrade an older machine knows — or should know — the two things they absolutely cannot compromise on: the processor and the graphics card. The latter can be a real challenge if you’re looking to build a compact yet seriously potent rig, because graphics cards that are small in size also tend to be small in performance. But the ASUS RTX 5070 is a 2.5-slot model that’s small form factor-friendly, which means it can fit in a smaller chassis while packing enough power to blow away virtually all the other SFF-ready cards.</p>
<h2>Secret Weapon</h2>
<p>The RTX 5070 is basically a unicorn: powerful enough for modern gaming, cool and quiet enough for daily use, and trim enough to slide into smaller chassis without fuss. That’s a sweet spot for any DIY gamer, especially when you consider the&nbsp;12 GB of GDDR7 memory, you’re looking at a card that beats up mid/high-tier textures and takes their lunch money.</p>
<p>That extra memory isn’t just a numbers flex that looks good on a spec sheet — it actually matters when modern games start leaning hard into photoreal lighting and other next-gen features that lesser cards won’t be able to keep up with. Coupled with PCIe 5.0 support, you’re set up for a smooth ride across a wide swath of titles and workloads for years to come.</p>



<h2>Keep It Cool</h2>
<p data-start="4446" data-end="4979">A compact rig chassis runs the risk of heat issues — smaller container, less area for heat dissipation. Or smaller components running super-fast — and super-loud — cooling units. The RTX 5070 has ASUS’s Axial-tech cooling design, with a tighter fan hub and longer blades that push air more effectively while keeping noise in check — perfect for a living-room PC that doesn’t sound like a hurricane.</p>
<p data-start="4981" data-end="5403">Thermals and noise aside, performance is where this card quietly flexes. For 1440p and even 4K gaming with some settings toggled just right, the RTX 5070 handles itself admirably. Games look great with DLSS tricks up your sleeve, and the triple display outputs (DP 2.1 + HDMI 2.1b) mean you can drive multiple panels without the headache of wrestling with adapters and dongles.</p>
<p data-start="4981" data-end="5403">With ASUS packing the RTX5070 with advanced features and Amazon knocking the price down for a limited time to just $540, the SFF-ready ASUS PRIME GeForce RTX 5070 is the deal you can’t afford to ignore if you’re planning on building your own rig or upgrading an old one.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/shokz-openrun-pro-headphones-keep-you-aware-while-you-listen-now-39-off-at-amazon-2000659455</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As we find ourselves at the beginning of the new year, it’s a natural time to think about fitness goals—whether that’s running your first 5K, sticking to a consistent workout routine, or training for your first marathon. The challenge, of course, is motivation. While the days stay short and temperatures low, even the best intentions can be hard to follow through with. One of the most effective ways to stay on track is to make your workouts something you genuinely look forward to. For me, that’s turning my runs into dedicated podcast time—and the right gear makes all the difference.</p>
<p>I’ve been working my way through the third campaign of <em>Not Another D&amp;D Podcast</em>, and four days a week I’m out running, listening, and actually excited to lace up. My go-to headphones for this routine are the OpenRun Pro from Shokz. If you’re looking to upgrade your workout setup for 2026, now’s a great time:<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5452/"> they’re currently 39% off on Amazon, dropping from $180 down to just $110</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5452/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bone Conduction Listening</h2>
<p>What sets the OpenRun Pro apart is their bone conduction design. Unlike traditional earbuds, these don’t go in your ears. Instead, they sit just in front of them and transmit sound by vibrating through your cheekbones. You still perceive clear audio, but your ears remain completely open. Elder millennials might remember those <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3ca4tfXefk">novelty lollipops from the ’90s</a> that played music through your teeth. This is a far more refined version of that idea.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of bone conduction is safety. Because your ears aren’t blocked, you can hear what’s happening around you. When you’re running outdoors, especially near traffic, being aware of approaching cars or cyclists is crucial. The OpenRun Pro lets you stay entertained without tuning out the world fully.</p>



<p>Comfort is another standout feature. The headphones sit around your ears like a backwards pair of sunglasses and use a lightweight, wraparound titanium frame. They stay firmly in place even during high-intensity workouts, which eliminates the constant worry of an earbud slipping out mid-run. Personally, I find them far more reliable than in-ear options.</p>
<p>Battery life is dependable, offering up to 10 hours of listening on a single charge. There’s also a fast-charge feature that gives you about 1.5 hours of playback from just five minutes plugged in—perfect for those times you forget to charge them overnight.</p>
<p>Shokz also offers a mini version for smaller heads. The standard model measures 20.7 cm across, while the mini is about 21 mm shorter at 18.6 cm. Both versions are currently discounted, with color options including black, beige, and blue.</p>
<p>If one of your 2026 goals is to stay consistent, safe, and motivated with your workouts, the Shokz OpenRun Pro headphones are a smart investment to help you get there.</p>
