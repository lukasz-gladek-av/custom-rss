              <p><span>Streaming PS3 games through <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-ps-plus-essential-extra-premium-microsoft-xbox-gam-1848722178">PlayStation Plus Premium</a>, Sony’s most expensive subscription tier, has seemingly been busted for at least two weeks now. It’s especially bad timing with <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finally-fixing-dumb-midnight-release-time-2000663241"><em>Fallout</em> season 2</a> inspiring some PS5 owners to try to revisit the PS3 version of </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Exactly two weeks ago today, one fan on the PS Plus subreddit posted a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1qct49v/got_a_problem_with_streaming_on_ps5/"><span>thread titled</span></a><span> “Got a problem with Streaming on PS5.”As they explained, they were unable to boot up 2012’s </span><i><span>Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two</span></i><span> through PlayStation Plus Premium’s cloud gaming service.</span></p>

 <p><span>After some attempts at troubleshooting, other players in the same thread quickly discovered they were facing the same problem. Every single PS3 cloud streaming game, for seemingly every subscriber, was suddenly refusing to load. No error message, no attempt to boot, nothing. <em>Kotaku</em> just&nbsp;tried to boot up Fallout: New Vegas and other PS3 games from the PS Plus and library menus on PS5 and had the same problem.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>From this point on, dozens more threads detailing the same issue began to crop up on the subreddit. In fact, the issue has become such a problem that, as spotted by </span><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2026/01/ps3-game-streaming-still-broken-and-sony-draws-criticism"><i><span>Push Square</span></i></a><span>, moderators have started deleting threads discussing the matter and guiding users towards a single megathread.</span></p>

 <p><span>Players have discovered a few </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1qfg98u/workaround_for_streaming_ps3_games_on_ps5/"><span>workarounds</span></a><span> for the issue, such as booting a Cloud Streaming title from their libraries instead of the store, but the fix doesn’t seem to work for everyone, and appears to be temporary for others. As of today, the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1qol9xu/comment/o228w5a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>top comment</span></a><span> on the moderator-created PS+ Criticism Thread claims the issue still hasn’t been fixed. “Insane this had been broken for nearly 2 weeks and no comms or fix,” reads one reply.</span></p>

 <p><span>Some fans </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1qj3zs5/contacted_support_about_the_streaming_and_this_is/"><span>have opted</span></a><span> to pester PlayStation Support for answers. One member of the support team reportedly confirmed that Sony is aware of the problem, stating that the “issue only impacts PS3 titles within the Classic Catalog.” But there’s still no explanation of what’s causing the problem and when it might be fixed. Sony didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This Baseus Laptop Docking Station uses a single USB-C port on your laptop to turn it into a small docking station for two screens, a wired Ethernet connection, and various accessories. It has a sleek metal bar design with a very short built-in USB-C cable, allowing it to sit along the edge of your desk and expand the number of items you can connect via USB-C. With the dock, you’ll have space to connect two HDMI displays, wired Ethernet, SD and microSD cards, and multiple USB devices via a single USB-C connection, greatly reducing the number of dongles you need.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6923/">For only $38 at Amazon (usually $64), you can purchase this Baseus Laptop Docking Station, which represents a $26 discount, a 41% savings.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6923/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A docking station perfect for connecting all your important devices</h2>
<p>With the two HDMI outputs on the Baseus Laptop Docking Station, you can connect to two monitors with a single USB-C connection, eliminating the need for your laptop screen to carry the entire load. If you wish, you can mirror your primary display onto a larger TV or monitor to increase the size of your display area, or expand your desktop to provide additional space for documents, chat windows, and web browser tabs.</p>
<p>There is an integrated Ethernet port for a reliable wired connection when you experience Wi-Fi issues on your home network, such as heavy traffic or poor signal quality. By running one cable from the dock to your router, you can keep your desk organized while providing your laptop with a consistent, reliable internet connection for downloading, backing up to the cloud, and streaming. There are also three USB ports available, allowing you to keep a keyboard, mouse, flash drive, webcam, etc., plugged into the dock so they are ready whenever you start working at your desk. The integrated SD and microSD card slots make it easier to transfer your photos, video files, and other files without having to dig for another external card reader. Simply insert the card, copy what you need, and remove the card, all without having to reach behind your tower or monitor.</p>



<p>Support for Power Delivery enables the dock to power your laptop via the USB-C connection. This means that if you connect a powerful charger, you can charge your laptop while still using the other ports on the dock to charge other devices.</p>
<p>The aluminum-style housing of the Baseus Laptop Docking Station is designed to be small enough to fit beside your laptop or monitor, creating the appearance of an organic extension of your workspace rather than a large, clunky box. With this dock, you can access nine ports via a single USB-C cable, so you no longer have to deal with the clutter of old, single-function adapters. Since the dock is portable and only requires one USB-C cable, you can easily take it with you wherever you go, whether that is to another meeting room or a different office location. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6923/">At $38 instead of the usual $64 list price, the Baseus Laptop Docking Station is a cheap way to extend your laptop’s capabilities without upgrading.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-eero-6-mesh-wi-fi-routers-at-an-all-time-low-4-pack-bundle-now-matches-the-3-pack-price-2000663612</link>

              <p>It’s 2026, and if you’re still dealing with dead zones around your home and not getting the internet speeds you’re paying each month for, it’s time for an upgrade. A mesh WiFi system can help provide high-speed, whole-home internet coverage without paying for a full overhaul.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6922/">Right now, Amazon has knocked the 4-pack eero 6+ mesh Wi-Fi system by 32%, which brings its price down to just $300 – that’s after an impressive savings of $140.</a> The offer is open to both Prime and non-Prime shoppers, plus there are no delivery charges to worry about. The offer is selling out fast, so it’s best to place your orders before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6922/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Better Coverage</h2>
<p>The eero 6+ mesh Wi-Fi system is Amazon’s most affordable gigabit system ever. It supports wifi speeds up to a gigabit, and is even backward compatible with previous-generation eero devices. The system uses eero’s patented TrueMesh technology that automatically routes traffic to reduce drop-offs and dead spots, letting you experience consistent speeds in up to 4,500 sq. ft.</p>
<p>It uses Wi-Fi 6 to increase your internet efficiency and reduce network congestion. There’s enough bandwidth for the whole family to work, stream, and video chat. This system comfortably supports over 75 devices, so whether you want to catch up on your favorite show in the bedroom, download the latest gaming title on your PC, and hop on a call with friends on a tablet at the same time, you won’t have to deal with slowdowns. Connect all your important devices around the house without feeling limited. Basically, it’s great for working and studying from home, plus casual use.</p>



<p>Getting started is surprisingly straightforward. You just need to download the eero app on your smartphone, which guides you through setup and allows you to manage your network from anywhere remotely. Once you’ve plugged in your eero devices, your Wi-Fi will automatically optimize for your space with TrueMesh.</p>
<p>On a regular day, you’d pay around $440 to enjoy the stability and performance this 4-pack system offers.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6922/"> The current 32% discount, however, lets you upgrade and bring one home for just $300 today.</a> This limited-time (and rare) offer is selling out fast, though. If you’re finally ready to say goodbye to slow internet speeds and dead zones, now is the time to make the move. We suggest getting your orders without wasting much time, as discounts this good don’t stick around for long. That said, now is also a good time to grab some other connectivity essentials, as we’re spotting quite a lot of highly rated accessories going for less.</p>
