The sword-wielding savior of Hyrule is always doing heroic shit in every <em>Legend of Zelda</em> game. He’s the embodiment of courage, goes to great lengths to defeat evil in whatever form it appears, and has saved the day countless times across the series’ convoluted timeline. It’s only natural, then, that he would also embody the important virtue of respecting women. Now, thanks to the Switch 2 version of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, we know that he does.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195755" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The 3 Best And 3 Worst Korok Challenges In Tears Of The Kingdom " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="181" data-playlist="195755,195719,196578" data-current="195755"><div><p>The 3 Best And 3 Worst Korok Challenges In Tears Of The Kingdom </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195755/195755_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195755/195755_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195755/195755_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195755/195755_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21265.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>comes with a few perks not found on the original console. It looks better and runs smoother, but perhaps the most enticing thing Nintendo has added for the new system is Zelda Notes, an assortment of voice and text logs from different characters that you can read on your phone while you play. Many of them are from the princess herself, and actually do a lot to flesh out our hero, who is typically a silent protagonist. One entry has Zelda recounting the time the two went to Eventide Island, and how Link, having been there before and being stripped of his gear, expected the same to happen to Zelda, and thus covered his eyes so he wouldn’t see anything indecent. That, my friends, is a gentleman.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>‪Link came along to protect me, but he suddenly covered his eyes the moment we landed. Fortunately, it seems all the monsters vanished with the Calamity… Regardless, when I asked him what he was doing, he said last time he was here, he had been stripped of…ahem…all his possessions when he arrived. He…could have mentioned that possibility before I set foot on the shore…‬</p></blockquote><p>That’s my Hero of Time. Or whatever we’re calling him these days. <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>is a huge game, so the prospect of going back to it feels a little daunting, even with all the Switch 2 enhancements. But I am looking forward to what other story secrets fans might find in the Zelda Notes.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here’s each one with a brief explanation of what they do:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Banana Peels</strong>: As one of the franchise’s original power-ups, you can always count on Banana Peels showing up. You can place these on the ground, and any players who touch them will wipe out. </li><li><strong>Blooper</strong>: You need to see the track to race on it, right? Well, use a Blooper to squirt ink on your opponents’ screen to briefly block their sight.</li><li><strong>Blue Shell</strong>: No item is more dreaded than the Blue Shell. This shell will track down and hit the leading racer, potentially causing chaos to additional racers along its path.</li><li><strong>Bob-Omb:</strong> You can really frustrate other players with a Bob-Omb. Use this power-up to set the little fella on the track so that it blows up when someone drives nearby.</li><li><strong>Boo</strong>: The Boo power-up makes you a tricky little devil. Using this item will steal another player’s item and turn you invisible briefly.</li><li><strong>Boomerang Flower</strong>: If you’re a good shot, then the Boomerang Flower can be an excellent item to have. It grants you multiple boomerang throws that can hit your opponents during the throw and on the item’s way back to you.</li><li><strong>Bullet Bill</strong>: If you need a good recovery item, Bullet Bill’s got you covered. Using this power-up transforms you into a Bullet Bill so you can dash forward while hitting any opponents in your way.</li><li><strong>Coin</strong>: The more coins you hold (up to 20), the higher your max speed becomes. As such, you’ll want to use these when you get them to, you know, get more vroom vroom.</li><li><strong>Coin Box</strong>: I think we all know what Coin Boxes do in a <em>Mario </em>game. Use this item to let you jump and hit the box for coins.</li><li><strong>Coin Shell</strong>: If you want to go faster, you need coins, and that’s where the Coin Shell comes in handy. This shell fires ahead while dropping coins for you to pick up.</li><li><strong>Feather</strong>: The Feather is a must-have for defensive play. If you learn how to master the timing on this power-up, you’ll be able to jump in the air and avoid items sent at you from other racers.</li><li><strong>Fire Flower</strong>: As one of the original power-ups from Mario canon, we all know what a Fire Flower can do. Use this item to fire off balls of fire at your foes and wipe ‘em out.</li><li><strong>Golden Mushroom</strong>: Speed is the name of the game, and Golden Mushrooms are all about it. A Golden Mushroom gives you unlimited turbo boosts for a brief period after use.</li><li><strong>Green Shell</strong>: If you’ve got a good aim, then a Green Shell can be your friend because this item will fire off ahead or behind you to hit an opponent. And if it misses, it’ll bounce off walls to create a hazard for additional drivers.</li><li><strong>Hammer</strong>: If you want to be a disruptive pest, then Hammers are for you. This power-up lets you throw hammers at your opponents with the added benefit of sticking in the track briefly as an obstacle. </li><li><strong>Ice Flower</strong>: Using the Ice Flower is cold as, uh, ice. Be a pain in the ass by freezing other racers to make them slide around the track with poor control.</li><li><strong>Kamek</strong>: Everyone loves the wizard Kamek and his magical spells, right? Well, you’ll like him better when you’re not on the receiving end of this power-up, which summons the blue-robbed foe to turn your opponents into random enemies.</li><li><strong>Lightning</strong>: Similar to the Blue Shell, the Lightning power-up is historically one of the franchise’s scariest items, letting you shrink other racers. Its duration has been nerfed a bit in this game, but it still slows folks down enough for you to make a little bit of a push ahead.</li><li><strong>Mega Mushroom</strong>: Do you like to get big and crush your foes? The Mega Mushroom lets you do just that by making your character massive so you can streamroll over anyone in your path.</li><li><strong>Mushroom</strong>: If you need a quick boost of speed, you’ll want a Mushroom. This item grants you a quick burst of speed.</li><li><strong>Red Shell:</strong> If you’ve ever played a<em> Mario Kart</em>game, you already know Red Shells are one of the best overall items. This homing shell will track down the closest foe ahead of you and wipe ‘em out.</li><li><strong>Super Horn</strong>: The Super Horn is a useful offensive and defensive tool. It sends a shockwave out that can wipe out enemies or destroy incoming projectiles.</li><li><strong>Super Star</strong>: Any <em>Mario </em>fan knows what a Super Star can do. Use this item to become invincible for a brief period while also granting you the ability to hit your foes with your kart to wipe them out.</li></ul><p>That’s a lot of power-ups! You can start using them by picking up a copy of <em>Mario Kart World</em>, which is available now exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The triggers to release them are also a lot easier to press than the tiny black buttons on the original Switch, too. -Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="31e41cc6e361eed7a2d14748ec06b599" data-recommend-id="image://31e41cc6e361eed7a2d14748ec06b599" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="31e41cc6e361eed7a2d14748ec06b599" data-recommend-id="image://31e41cc6e361eed7a2d14748ec06b599" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s really nice to have a Nintendo console that actually works with my big dumb 4K TV. Previously the Switch, for a few reasons, felt like an old relic I was plugging into my modern TV. But now, I have a Mario machine that takes advantage of the modern features of my big TV and produces a super sharp image. I can’t wait to play Nintendo games like <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and more at smoother framerates and higher resolutions. -Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ea6c39be03d45612178b749402bcc6af" data-recommend-id="image://ea6c39be03d45612178b749402bcc6af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ea6c39be03d45612178b749402bcc6af" data-recommend-id="image://ea6c39be03d45612178b749402bcc6af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Games load noticeably faster on Switch 2. These aren’t lightning-fast PS5 SSD speeds, but they’re a big leap compared to the old hardware. Loading <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>takes only 7-8 seconds on Switch 2, roughly half what they took on the original Switch. Fast-travel in those games is roughly twice as fast as well. Even games without official Switch 2 updates are vastly improved. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NintenTalk/status/1930656532636606865&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NintenTalk/status/1930656532636606865" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a></span> takes 30 seconds less on Switch 2. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/HeavyWingsDX/status/1930623920698257671&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/HeavyWingsDX/status/1930623920698257671" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em></a></span>,<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Lizard_yyy/status/1930543992749326434&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Lizard_yyy/status/1930543992749326434" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em></a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/search?q=switch%202%20load%20times&amp;src=typed_query&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/search?q=switch%202%20load%20times&amp;src=typed_query" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</em></a></span> have all had their load times buffed, too<em>.</em></p><p>I also tested<em> Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> and <em>Mario Kart World</em>.

The Switch OLED was marginally bigger and felt like having a weight lifted when I upgraded to it from my OG model. That feeling is magnified with Switch 2, which includes a much bigger screen with a smaller bezel and rim of plastic at the top and bottom. It’s not OLED, but it’s surprisingly crisp, clear, and vibrant for an LCD. It makes the original Switch feel washed out by comparison. - EG</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="99f70fe8324ae5fbbff287e20023bccf" data-recommend-id="image://99f70fe8324ae5fbbff287e20023bccf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="99f70fe8324ae5fbbff287e20023bccf" data-recommend-id="image://99f70fe8324ae5fbbff287e20023bccf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I always found the Switch to feel like a kids’ toy that just so happened to play games. That’s not the case with the Switch 2. It feels incredible to hold. The buttons feel perfectly pushable, and the outer coating on the console and Joy-Con feels lovely. Not too slippery, not too rough. It also has a nice heft to it and feels substantial. It feels like a  high-end tech device and not a toy, and I really appreciate that. -ZZ</p></div><div><p>It’s been years since the Switch eShop felt anywhere close to borderline usable. It chugged like a ‘90s Windows PC loaded up with malware. Menus were sluggish, icons wouldn’t load, and half the time I just gave up looking for stuff to play and went back to my PS5 or PC instead. But on Switch 2, the eShop is once again snappy and responsive. The search bar returns way better results, and I like that the store has given wishlists and personal recommendations more emphasis on the left action bar. I also like that things are slightly more spaced out, making the whole experience feel a little less cramped. - EG</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="11c7e90c6e75f238bad5303ccbc7ae20" data-recommend-id="image://11c7e90c6e75f238bad5303ccbc7ae20" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="11c7e90c6e75f238bad5303ccbc7ae20" data-recommend-id="image://11c7e90c6e75f238bad5303ccbc7ae20" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Similar to the console and Joy-Con, the Switch 2 Pro Controller is a wonderful thing to hold and use. The buttons feel just clicky enough without feeling cheap or being too loud. The new GL and GR buttons are a great addition that will be useful in more complicated games. And the entire controller, like the Switch 2 console, just oozes high-end, luxury vibes. And it better, as it cost me nearly $100 after taxes and shit. -ZZ</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e16561301ad95ed9412f192f523cfcb3" data-recommend-id="image://e16561301ad95ed9412f192f523cfcb3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e16561301ad95ed9412f192f523cfcb3" data-recommend-id="image://e16561301ad95ed9412f192f523cfcb3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While the eShop got a nice refresh, the rest of the Switch 2 interface, sans new features like Game Chat, looks basically identical to that of the old hardware. The home screen is still a single row of game icons surrounded by a sea of white space (or black if you use the system’s only other menu theme option). The coming back from standby screen is also the exact same, with a news bar on the left, the time at the top right, and a small icon of the last active app in the middle. </p><p>Would it kill Nintendo to add some more color options, menu themes, or background art? - EG</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9131203652269fac7b95630b2d629c4a" data-recommend-id="image://9131203652269fac7b95630b2d629c4a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9131203652269fac7b95630b2d629c4a" data-recommend-id="image://9131203652269fac7b95630b2d629c4a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>For as nice as the controllers feel, they are still a horrible way to play games. The stick is in the wrong place! I’ve been annoyed about this since the OG Switch and it still sucks here, too. The sticks themselves also feel tiny and too soft.</p><p>Actually playing with one single Joy-Con is an experience I’ll avoid like the plague on Switch 2. If I have to use them, I’ll attach them to the included Joy-Con grip and use both. And that will only be if my Pro Controller is missing for some horrible reason. -ZZ</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a451c2349f92017912eb7f9c129cad85" data-recommend-id="image://a451c2349f92017912eb7f9c129cad85" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a451c2349f92017912eb7f9c129cad85" data-recommend-id="image://a451c2349f92017912eb7f9c129cad85" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I miss the old days of the original Switch when I could see all my Twitter friends and their Nintendo accounts, and I could easily shoot them a friend invite. Now I have to share my friend code. I can’t even look up people’s usernames. </p><p>It feels like such a strange old relic to have to rely on friend codes in 2025. Why can’t I link up my Discord and see other Discord buddies with Nintendo Online accounts? Ultimately, once we are friends, this problem isn’t a big deal, but it’s still not great. -ZZ</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9a0f746cdb7508fb07f6bf7219e95857" data-recommend-id="image://9a0f746cdb7508fb07f6bf7219e95857" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9a0f746cdb7508fb07f6bf7219e95857" data-recommend-id="image://9a0f746cdb7508fb07f6bf7219e95857" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The eShop is great now on Switch 2! It loads so fast, and you can quickly navigate it. However, as I did this last night, I quickly noticed that the shop was filled with all the same slop as before. And checking out the upcoming releases revealed a big tidal wave of low-priced garbage coming down the pipeline. A reminder that, while the Switch 2 is a new console, it is bringing with it a lot of baggage. -ZZ</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This skill is mostly used defensively, especially during boss battles. When the Duchess is invisible, this lets her take the time to revive downed teammates without being interrupted, or just take the pressure off and heal.</p><p><strong>While invisible, she can still be targeted</strong>, particularly by projectiles that home in on their targets. Area-of-Effect attacks will still hit her as well, along with grabs if she happens to get caught in one.

This means that daggers are her best option as they take advantage of her rapid-fire attacks. Daggers are also great at inflicting status effects, so if you come across any rare ones like Bleed or Scarlet Rot, those will be a boon for your run.

There’s so much packed into the experience that it should keep fans busy for years to come. But if you’re about to play the game, or are simply curious about what to know before you do, here are a few basic tips for getting started in <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195905" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="195905,196599,195519" data-current="195905"><div><p>Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21419.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h234784"><a id="1"></a>Practice makes perfect</h2><p><em>Mario Kart</em> games have a way of being easy to pick up but extremely difficult to master. There are a lot of little tricks and mechanics high-end players use to maximize their speed and efficiency in races, after all. But look, even if you’re just playing <em>Mario Kart World </em>casually, you should at least practice drifting reliably to help you round corners and curves without slowing down. </p><figure id="" data-id="9a468553394a86cc2c109c900587c905" data-recommend-id="image://9a468553394a86cc2c109c900587c905" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario grinds on a rail in Mario Kart World." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mario grinds on a rail in Mario Kart World." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9a468553394a86cc2c109c900587c905" data-recommend-id="image://9a468553394a86cc2c109c900587c905" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario grinds on a rail in Mario Kart World." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And there’s so much more new stuff now, too, including riding on rails and walls. Mastering these additional movement features and knowing when to use them can help you shave off a lot of time during a race, often by granting you access to shortcuts or letting you bypass parts of a track altogether. In some cases, riding a wall may even save you from falling off a track and losing your place!</p><p>No one says you have to take competitive racing in <em>Mario Kart World</em> seriously, of course. But learning how to make the most of its various mechanics will certainly help you place higher in races and navigate the game’s open world better. So, practice up!</p><h2 id="h234785"><a id="2"></a>Be a coin fiend</h2><p><strong>Every coin you pick up in <em>Mario Kart World</em> will increase your max speed</strong>. You can hold up to 20 coins, which is a step up from the usual 10 in previous games, but you’ll also lose three every time you get hit by a projectile. With this in mind, actively seek them out during the entire race in an effort to stay as close to the coin cap as possible. </p><figure id="" data-id="f2564c60b6314343ac7650aedc6822b3" data-recommend-id="image://f2564c60b6314343ac7650aedc6822b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="3437" data-height="1938" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A cow on a motorcycle speeds toward a coin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A cow on a motorcycle speeds toward a coin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f2564c60b6314343ac7650aedc6822b3" data-recommend-id="image://f2564c60b6314343ac7650aedc6822b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="3437" data-height="1938" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A cow on a motorcycle speeds toward a coin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To help with this, there’s always a chance that you’ll snag a power-up like the Coin Box or Coin Shell to give you a solid influx of coins, so make sure you use those when they come up. Just keep in mind that other racers can grab the additional coins dropped by these power-ups as well, so using them can feel like a double-edged sword at times. But yeah, still do it. Go fast. Vroom.</p><h2 id="h234786"><a id="3"></a>Don’t shy away from accessibility options</h2><p>When selecting your racer, you can press the X button to get a look at a few accessibility options. These can be extremely helpful for those with disabilities, as well as new players looking to ease into the racing experience with reduced punishment for mistakes.</p><figure id="" data-id="a127879b39e637d6fcb698443c51aeb6" data-recommend-id="image://a127879b39e637d6fcb698443c51aeb6" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Waluigi races in a motorcycle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Waluigi races in a motorcycle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a127879b39e637d6fcb698443c51aeb6" data-recommend-id="image://a127879b39e637d6fcb698443c51aeb6" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Waluigi races in a motorcycle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Smart Steering will stop your character from ever driving off the side of a track, while Auto-Accelerate will take care of keeping you moving so that you can focus all of your attention on steering</strong>. You can even turn on Auto-Use Item to make your character use items for you, though this takes away your ability to use power-ups strategically for any given situation.</p><p>Mess with these settings and toggle them on/off any time you want to customize your racing experience. The goal here is to have as much fun as possible, after all. </p><h2 id="h234787"><a id="4"></a>Get those double-item boxes</h2><figure id="" data-id="2fdebaa5dd34ab151bdb22551fc69a44" data-recommend-id="image://2fdebaa5dd34ab151bdb22551fc69a44" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters race toward boxes with question marks on them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Characters race toward boxes with question marks on them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2fdebaa5dd34ab151bdb22551fc69a44" data-recommend-id="image://2fdebaa5dd34ab151bdb22551fc69a44" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters race toward boxes with question marks on them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This one is simple: More items equal a higher chance for survival. Because of this, it’s usually a good idea to aim for double item boxes on a course so that you can snag two items at once, giving you two chances at disrupting other players or providing yourself with additional protection from incoming projectiles.</p><p>Of course, if you see someone else aiming for the double item box ahead of you, it may sometimes be better to snag a nearby normal item box instead so that you don’t risk a chance of getting nothing at all. I don’t want to think you’d get sniped in the butt by a red shell just because your greed left you without protection.</p><hr><p><br><em>Mario Kart World</em> is available now exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Beyond the PSN and Musk hacks, he “triggered a U.S. Air Force alert by forcing a passenger jet to make an emergency landing,” according to the trailer. Seconds after that revelation, an FBI agent attests that Kivimäki revealed he had law enforcement sent to the families of FBI agents by making fake emergency phone calls, an act known as “swatting,” because “he thought it was fun, and he enjoyed hurting or seeing people suffer.” The teaser even features an unidentified man, presumably a victim of Kivimäki’s hacks, who vows to kill him the second the two are in the same location. </p><p>The documentary will not only have victims of his hacks, fellow hackers, SWAT team members, and FBI agents, but also the incarcerated Kivimäki himself.

These little wheels will run you $25—but if you think you’ll get some use out of them, they’re a worthwhile accessory to have around.</p><h2 id="h236152"><a id="4"></a>Spigen Dual Grip Cover</h2><p>It’s totally reasonable if you find the fairly thin Nintendo Switch 2 a little uncomfortable to hold in handheld mode for extended periods. Luckily, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://a.co/d/46DeG2m&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://a.co/d/46DeG2m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spigen Dual Grip</a></span> can alleviate a lot of that discomfort by making things more ergonomic for you. This lightweight polycarbonate grip cover covers all of the parts of the Nintendo Switch 2 needed to ensure you can have a comfortable grip on the device without compromising your ability to place the console into its dock or use the kickstand. The Spigen Dual Grip will run you $30, but you’re getting a much better grip on your console without making any sacrifice in efficiency, so I’d say it’s worth the investment for anyone frequently using their Nintendo Switch 2 in handheld mode.</p><h2 id="h236153"><a id="5"></a>Samsung microSD Express Card</h2><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 comes packing a lot more storage than its predecessor (256GB this time around), but if you’re the type to keep a smorgasbord of games on your console at once, you may want to expand your storage capacity with a microSD Express card. You can’t go wrong with the official Nintendo-branded <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/samsung-microsd-express-card-256gb-for-nintendo-switch-2-123685/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/samsung-microsd-express-card-256gb-for-nintendo-switch-2-123685/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung 256GB microSD Express Card</a></span>. Though you can certainly find both larger and cheaper microSD Express cards, this choice comes from one of the medium’s most trusted brands and doubles your overall storage for only $60. Hell yeah.</p><h2 id="h236154"><a id="6"></a>Transnovo 4-Slot Joy-Con Charging Dock</h2><p>If you’re the kind of person who uses your Switch 2 Joy-Cons frequently — and especially if you have more than two — a good Joy-Con charging dock is important. And the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://a.co/d/3jZIBLW&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://a.co/d/3jZIBLW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transnovo 4-Slot Joy-Con Charging Dock</a></span> is a rad choice. Your Joy-Cons snap into the dock magnetically from any angle, and they’ll charge to full in around 2 hours. LED lights let you know when they’re charging (orange) or fully charged (blue), and the multiple RGB lighting modes can add a bit of flair to your desk or entertainment center. That’s some pretty cool shit.</p><h2 id="h236155"><a id="7"></a>Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case</h2><p>Cases for the Nintendo Switch 2 are plentiful, so you should always pick one that meets your unique needs both in terms of looks and functionality. However, perhaps the best case on the market is the official <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-all-in-one-carrying-case-123692/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-all-in-one-carrying-case-123692/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case</a></span>, which offers impressive protection, high-quality materials, and tons of storage inside. This chunky case even has a spot to store your Nintendo Switch 2 dock so that you can transport your docked console experience anywhere you want to go. </p><figure id="" data-id="04aaf93627858699a5081aaf939b682d" data-recommend-id="image://04aaf93627858699a5081aaf939b682d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One carrying case." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One carrying case." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="04aaf93627858699a5081aaf939b682d" data-recommend-id="image://04aaf93627858699a5081aaf939b682d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One carrying case." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll find six slots for game carts, storage for a Pro Controller, and a large mesh compartment for all of your cables. The only downside is that this big boy costs $85, so opting for a smaller, and thus cheaper, case may be a better bet if you only need protection for the handheld portion of the console.</p><p>It goes without saying that there are plenty of other accessories out there to score for your Nintendo Switch 2. But hopefully, this short list helped you get a feel for some of your best options. Now, get off here and go play some video games.</p><p>.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
