            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Fortnite</em>‘s mega-<a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868">popular<em> Simpsons</em> event</a> is over and season 7 is now officially live in the battle royale. The victory lap for one of the game’s biggest months in a while has been short-lived, however. No sooner did the new update go live than fans started side-eyeing some of the new sprays, music, and art in the game, wondering if it’s AI-generated. The latest slop witchhunt comes just days after Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney argued against storefront disclaimers for games that use AI.</p> <p>Season 7 features a new battle pass with cameos from The Bride from <em>Kill Bill</em> and Marty McFly from <em>Back to the Future</em>. In keeping with this loose ode to classic cinema, the game also now features new posters and sprays that some players think look suspiciously like they might be at least partly the work of gen AI. “Did <em>Fortnite</em> use AI to make this poster?” is now <a href="https://x.com/Duba_legitleaks/status/1995152082731733329">the question</a> ricocheting <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1pahvnv/is_this_chapter_7_art_ai_generated/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-fans-are-saying-no-to-ai-slop-after-spotting-what-they-believe-are-ai-generated-images-in-game">around social media</a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">it's unfair to criticize those that raise suspicion on this kind of thing. </p> <p>suddenly, there are several images that have that "AI look" to them. Likely touched up and not fully generated, but there's something mildly off about shading and lighting</p> <p>and then the toes on one <a href="https://t.co/cynddbBH56">pic.twitter.com/cynddbBH56</a></p> <p>— WayComet ☄️ (@WayComet) <a href="https://twitter.com/WayComet/status/1995264510098366888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>At the center of the debate is a yeti poster, a <em>Back to the Future</em> spray, a tomatohead talk show billboard, and a new emote song in the battle pass called “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1paauzo/the_new_icon_emote_latata_is_an_ai_song/">Latata</a>.” Unlike most of the backlashes to AI we’ve seen in gaming, however, this one is based more on vibes than obvious tells. There’s not yet any clear evidence that gen-AI was used, and Epic Games hasn’t officially commented on the controversy yet.</p>

 <p>But the sheer association with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/nhl26-ai-ea-college-football-madden-card-packs-2000646229">slop aesthetic</a> has already blown up into calls to boycott the season. The debate has gotten so messy that r/FortNiteBR, which features over 1 million active users, has already created a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1pasao6/ai_content_in_fortnite_megathread/">dedicated mega thread</a> to stop it from consuming the rest of the subreddit.</p>

 <p>In addition to calls for commenters to stay “civil,” there’s also an informal poll asking for players’ positions on the use of AI in games. Nearly 2,000 respondents said AI has no place in any game. Only 4 percent said they had no issues with generative AI being used in gaming.</p>   <p>At least one of the artists whose work was involved in season 7 has come out rejecting the AI accusations. Sean Dove, a freelancer who goes by andthankyou on Instagram, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/andthankyou/?hl=en">responded after</a> his Marty McFly spray became one of the witchhunt’s targets. “I guess someone on Reddit thinks this is AI,” Dove wrote. “I think the culprit is a clock in the background.” The face clock in question has incorrect numbers. The artist said he grabbed a bunch of clock images from an image search to collage them.</p>

 <p>“It’s entirely possible I grabbed an AI clock and wasn’t paying attention,” he wrote. Dove followed up with a time-lapse image of making the spray.</p> <p>It’s a perfect example of how poisoned the well has become. On the one hand, you have people so suspicious of slop being forced on them that they are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/destiny2/comments/1p7c6cm/no_bungie_did_not_use_ai_for_dredgen_baels/">pointing fingers everywhere without proof</a>. On the other hand, you have an artist potentially unknowingly introducing AI into their work simply by using random online references for household objects.</p>

 <h2>Time Sweeney rails against Steam AI rules</h2> <p>The cloud currently hanging over <em>Fortnite</em> was made darker by recent comments from Epic’s boss. Sweeney recently argued against AI disclosures on Steam and other storefronts. “The AI tag is relevant to art exhibits for authorship disclosure, and to digital content licensing marketplaces where buyers need to understand the rights situation,” <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1993687499621728312?s=20">Sweeney wrote on X</a> last week. “It makes no sense for game stores, where AI will be involved in nearly all future production.”</p>

 <p>When another user on the platform alleged that Epic might already be using gen-AI for coding its Unreal Engine, the executive denied the claim. “I just hate to see Valve confiscate ever more opportunity from small developers by facilitating new categories cancel campaigns and review bombing,” he wrote. “Steam used to just facilitate downloads. Then they foreclosed on payments, then price competition, then crypto, now AI.”</p> <p>Sweeney’s bullishness on generative AI is the spark that’s helping fuel skepticism about <i>Fortnite</i>‘s latest season. After all, if the CEO of a company tells you gen-AI will be involved in “nearly all future production” and thinks that fact shouldn’t have to be disclosed, it’s not a huge leap to consider that’s already happening in his company’s game. No wonder some players just want to be done with the whole thing rather than having to become a part-time <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-spot-generative-ai-art-according-to-artists/">internet forensic</a> whenever their favorite game introduces new art, music, or voices that sound slightly off.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/beats-powerbeats-pro-2-hits-a-new-cyber-monday-low-while-apple-clears-out-its-black-friday-leftovers-2000648832</link>
            <guid>1369138</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If your first post-Thanksgiving stop is the gym to work off some of that massive feast, you’ll want to make a little Cyber Monday detour to Amazon first to upgrade your wireless earbuds. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6129/">Right now the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 wireless noise cancelling earbuds are $50 off, making them a great buy at just $200</a>.</p>
<p>These are the latest Powerbeats Pro, having dropped less than a year ago, and they’re packed with features that will earn them a permanent place not just in your gym bag, but anywhere that you’re wanting high-quality sound and pro-level noise cancellation. They work equally well with both Apple and Android devices — which has long been one of the top Beats features — and with the charging case they have up to 45 hours of listening time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6129/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ready for Sweat</h2>
<p>There really isn’t a situation that’s wrong for the Powerbeats Pro 2, but they truly excel as workout buds. The secure-fit earhooks keep them firmly in place no matter how hard your workout is, with five different sizes of ear tips included to ensure the best possible fit. The earhooks are upgraded from the previous Beats, with nickel titanium reinforcement for flexibility, grip, and overall strength. The Beats app for iOS and Android has a Fit Test feature built in so you can check that you have the best fit and therefore the best sound and best noise cancellation.</p>
<p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 are also IPX4 sweat- and water-resistant to hold fast during your hardest workouts or if rain or snow show up during your outdoor run or bike ride, and this model comes with a heart rate monitoring feature that you can read on the Beats app. The Beats app is also where you’ll be able to find the customizable controls, battery status, and Locate My Beats feature.</p>



<h2>Big Upgrade</h2>
<p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 come with a number of significant upgrades from the previous version, starting with the charging case. It’s significantly smaller, reduced in size by roughly a third to make them more pocket-friendly. The case can now charge wirelessly, and a full charge of both the case and the buds combine to create up to 45 hours of total battery life. If that somehow runs out and you’re in need of a quick boost before you run for the door, the Fast Fuel feature turns a 5-minute charge into 90 minutes of listening time, enough for a workout or a run.</p>
<p>The Powerbeats Pro 2 are all-around great wireless buds, above and beyond working out. They’re armed with stable Bluetooth, built-in voice isolation, and multiple mics for hands-free phone calls. The Active Noise Cancellation is top-notch, and there’s also a Transparency mode that lets you enjoy your music or podcast fully while being aware of your surroundings for safety’s sake. The Powerbeats Pro 2 also fully support spatial audio.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6129/">The $50 Cyber Monday price drop at Amazon pushes the Beats Powerbeats Pro 2 wireless earbuds to the head of the class for great audio deals</a>. Check them out now before this 20%-off deal expires.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-quietly-offloads-era-100-for-cyber-monday-wifi-and-bluetooth-compatible-speaker-at-record-low-2000649099</link>
            <guid>1369111</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sonos is known for making high-end WiFi speakers that are meant for home audio systems but the<strong> Era 100 adds Bluetooth connectivity and real portability</strong> to the company’s signature sound quality. This speaker has better sound quality than any other portable Bluetooth speaker and it combines the convenience of wireless pairing with the ability to play music in multiple rooms.</p>
<p>Right now, the<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5807/"> Era 100 is now $169 instead of its usual $199 price for Cyber Monday which is the lowest price this model has ever been</a> since it came out. You only have a few hours left to get this deal, which is basically studio-quality audio in a size that makes it easy to move between rooms.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5807/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Better sound with upgraded architecture</h2>
<p>The new processor is 47% faster than the old Era design and when used with more Sonos speakers, it can <strong>handle more complicated audio processing</strong> and keep everything in sync better. This processing power makes the dual-tweeter acoustic architecture work which lets a single small unit create real stereo separation by putting instruments and vocals in different places in space instead of mixing them all together into mono mush.</p>
<p>The tweeters make high frequencies sound clear which lets you hear cymbals shimmer and voices breathe, which cheaper speakers hide. The midwoofer is 25% bigger than the last generation which makes the bass sound deeper and this combination gives you full-range sound that doesn’t need a separate subwoofer for casual listening. However, if you want room-shaking low end, you can still get it.</p>
<p>The Sonos app uses Trueplay tuning technology to <strong>look at the acoustics of your room and automatically changes the speaker’s EQ</strong> to make up for reflective surfaces, furniture placement, and room size. This adaptive processing stops the bass from getting too loud near walls and the sound from getting too thin in rooms with high ceilings and few soft furnishings.</p>



<p>The small size means it can fit on bookshelves, kitchen counters, nightstands and desk corners without taking up too much space or needing its own furniture. The <strong>Era 100 is a good size for smaller rooms</strong> where bigger speakers would be too much. It also encourages people to try out different placements because it only takes a few seconds to move it instead of needing help.</p>
<p>A <strong>single button press turns on Bluetooth pairing which lets you connect to phones, tablets, and laptops</strong> right away when WiFi isn’t available or isn’t convenient. This means that the Era 100 is great for outdoor parties on patios or balconies where your home network might not work well. It also lets guests play music from their devices without having to join your WiFi network or download the Sonos app.</p>



<p>Setting up takes just a few minutes and is very easy: All you have to do is plug it in and connect your phone to the same WiFi network. The Sonos app tells you where to put your speakers and how to calibrate Trueplay without using technical language or menus that are hard to understand. With Alexa integration, you can control playback, change the volume, and skip tracks without having to touch anything.</p>
<p>At this price of $169, Sonos sound quality is on par with that of mid-range Bluetooth/WiFi speakers that don’t have multi-room capabilities and have worse audio processing. The Cyber Monday sale ends tonight, so this is your last chance to get the Era 100 at the lowest price ever before it goes back to regular price tomorrow.</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="627">Black Friday passed but lots of deals are still active on Cyber Monday. You haven’t missed your change to save big on either some gifts for the family or some nice tech upgrades for yourself.&nbsp; <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/">Right now, Amazon is offering the Anker Laptop Charger at 40% off. Normally priced at $100, this USB-C compatible charging block is available for just $60—a savings of $40—for a limited time</a>.</p>
<p data-start="629" data-end="1269">These days, we carry an ever-growing number of gadgets that constantly need to stay charged. It’s no longer just our smartphones that require a nightly plug-in. If you enjoy listening to music or podcasts during your daily routine, your wireless earbuds or Bluetooth headphones also need regular recharging. Anyone relying on a smartwatch for fitness tracking or health monitoring has to keep its battery topped up to ensure it performs at its best. And that’s only the beginning. Tablets, laptops, and even handheld gaming systems such as the Nintendo Switch 2, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally, or the Steam Deck all demand consistent charging to stay powered throughout the entire day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="629" data-end="1269">Dual High-Speed USB-C Ports</h2>
<p data-start="629" data-end="1269">The Anker Laptop Charger is designed to to simplify powering all these devices. Featuring three USB-C ports, this small yet efficient charging brick is capable of supporting essentially any piece of hardware that relies on USB-C for power. It can output up to 140W, allowing it to rapidly charge larger electronics like a 15-inch MacBook Air. Impressively, the Anker Laptop Charger can boost a MacBook Air from completely drained to 50% battery in only 30 minutes. Either of the first two USB-C ports provides that maximum charging speed, so you can plug into whichever one is most convenient without losing performance. The four port is USB-A to ensure compatibility even with older devices you need charged.</p>
<p data-start="629" data-end="1269">The smart display screen on top of the charging brick can provide you with useful insights into your charging. With multiple devices plugged in an charging, it will breakdown for you port-specific details on the power output of each as well as their total together. It displays with high definition color so it is easily legible when you need to see this information.</p>


<p data-start="629" data-end="1269">The display can also be used to show your temperature data. Maintaining a cool temperature will increase charging performance and this gives you insight into how optimal your charging conditions are.</p>
<p data-start="629" data-end="1269">On the subject of temperature, the Anker Laptop Charger employs safety features like ActiveShield 4.0. This system monitors the device temperature over 10 million times per day to protect against your devices from overheating.</p>
<p data-start="629" data-end="1269">In the box, you get the Anker Laptop Charger capable of 140W output along with a five foot 240W USB-C to USB-C cable. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/">The Anker Laptop Charger is available in both dark gray and silver. Both color options are part of the Cyber Monday sale which shaves the price down to just $60 for a limited time.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Acer Goes Rogue on Nitro V Gaming Laptop (i7, RTX 4050, 1TB), Now Selling at All-Time Low for Cyber Monday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/acer-goes-rogue-on-nitro-v-gaming-laptop-i7-rtx-4050-1tb-now-selling-at-all-time-low-for-cyber-monday-2000649093</link>
            <guid>1369081</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cyber Monday is the last day of this week-long shopping spree, and gaming laptops have had some of the biggest price drops on Amazon. The <strong>Acer Nitro V</strong> has become one of the most popular gaming machines on the platform, and right now,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6136/"> it’s at a record low price of $799, down from its usual price of $949</a> – and this setup has an <strong>Intel Core i7-13620H processor, an Nvidia RTX 4050 GPU, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, an 15.6-inch Full HD screen (165Hz) and a 1TB Gen 4 SSD</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6136/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>RTX 4050 Offers AI-Enhanced Graphics</h2>
<p>The RTX 4050 GPU has 194 AI TOPS of processing power which lets it use DLSS 3.5 to boost frame rates and improve ray tracing quality at the same time. This technology can handle complicated lighting, shadows and reflections at speeds that would slow down older graphics cards and it means you can use ray tracing in games that support it without losing playability.</p>
<p>DLSS uses AI prediction to make more frames instead of traditional rendering which means you get higher frame rates while keeping the visual quality, which often looks sharper than the native resolution. This is important, especially at 1080p, where the RTX 4050 performs best, pushing most new games well above 60 fps with high settings on.</p>
<p>The <strong>165Hz refresh rate display</strong> updates almost three times faster than standard 60Hz screens. This makes motion smoother, which makes it easier to track enemies in competitive shooters and makes racing games more immersive. This refresh rate noticeably lowers motion blur and input lag and gives you an edge when your reflexes are most important. The 15.6-inch Full HD resolution makes text and details clear without needing the extra power that 1440p or 4K displays do and lets the RTX 4050 run smoothly and give you high frame rates in all of your games.</p>



<p>The <strong>Intel Core i7-13620H processor combines performance cores and efficiency cores</strong> in a hybrid architecture that handles both gaming and productivity workloads effectively. The six performance cores handle tough single-threaded tasks like game logic and physics calculations, while the four efficiency cores handle background tasks without taking resources away from your main apps. This design lets you stream gameplay to Twitch, record it locally, and use Discord all at the same time without the stutters and slowdowns that happen when processors don’t have this core separation.</p>
<p>The 16GB of DDR5 memory runs faster and more efficiently than DDR4 and reduces latency and improving frame times in memory-intensive games while speeding up application launches and file operations. You can upgrade the laptop’s memory from 16GB to 32GB using two DIMM slots. The 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD loads games and boots Windows in seconds instead of minutes and it has enough space for your operating system and a large game library, so you don’t have to keep uninstalling games to make room for new ones.</p>



<p>The dual-fan cooling system with its own exhaust vent <strong>keeps the temperature stable during long gaming sessions</strong> and stops the thermal throttling that happens after the first hour of play and makes performance drop. <em>NitroSense</em> software lets you keep an eye on temperatures and fan speeds in real time. It also lets you make your own fan curves that balance noise levels and cooling performance based on what you like. The Thunderbolt 4 port supports simultaneous power delivery, data transfer at 40 Gbps, and display output to external monitors, essentially providing three functions through a single cable connection.</p>
<p>This $799 price undercuts competing laptops with similar specs by $300 to $400, and it brings RTX 4050 performance down to pricing where you’d typically find GTX 1650 or RTX 3050 configurations with weaker processors and slower storage. The Cyber Monday discount expires tonight, making this the last opportunity to grab this configuration at record-low pricing before it returns to regular retail tomorrow.</p>

              <p>Black Friday has come and gone, but you still have one last chance to save on the items you missed bagging during the main event – thanks to Cyber Monday. Most discounts from Black Friday, across a wide range of categories but especially tech, have crawled into this one-day event.</p>
<p>We’re spotting plenty of deals, but one that caught our attention and deserves a mention is the impressive 29% drop on the Microsoft Surface Pro 2-in-1 laptop/tablet from last year. It usually sits at $1,200, but the current discount lets you grab one for just $850. Nab it for yourself, or gift it to someone who likes being productive on the go, this holiday season. Since multiple retailers are offering it for less, you might not be able to see the highlighted discount on it right away. If you can’t, click on the “See all buying options” button on the right, and scroll through the list to spot the drop. Add it to your cart, and the offer will apply automatically.</p>

<h2>Vibrant Screen, Plus Exceptional AI Capabilities</h2>
<p>Microsoft calls it a 2-in-1, but it’s not the type where the screen flips all the way around. You’re getting a 13-inch touchscreen display, and you can pair it with a detachable Surface Pro Flex Keyboard, which is sold separately, to convert it into a full-fledged laptop. The screen comes with a built-in kickstand that lets you prop it anywhere you like, whether it’s on a table or your bed for some late-night streaming.</p>
<p>The PixelSense Flow LCD display is bright, delivering sharp, vibrant, and clear visuals to enhance the quality of your favorite shows and movies. The screen is ultra-lightweight at just 1.97 pounds, making it easy to carry around with you on the go. Exceptional power comes from the 10-core Snapdragon X Plus processor, which provides solid performance for both everyday and demanding tasks. You’ll be able to browse, stream, work, and even edit photos/videos without experiencing significant slowdowns. Its powerful NPU is great for those looking forward to using some AI-focused features (real-time translation, noise-canceling, document retrieving, etc) on a regular basis, too.</p>



<p>The built-in 16GB RAM makes multitasking a breeze, whether you’re hopping between a bunch of tabs or trying to use multiple applications at the same time. Storing all your data won’t be a problem, either, thanks to the built-in 512GB SSD. It’s not massive, but still enough to house hundreds of photos and videos, tons of applications, and even a couple of games without feeling limited. Speaking of apps, you’re getting a whole bunch of both useful and popular pre-installed.</p>
<p>Of course, Copilot+ takes the experience even further. Apart from answering your basic questions or generating art from prompts, it provides assistance with retrieving documents, emails, and web pages on your PC. Video calls are made better with auto noise cancellation and distraction blurring. You’ll also enjoy real-time subtitles for 44 languages during video calls or streaming.</p>
<p>Despite all this power and efficiency, the battery life holds up well. On a single charge, you’re looking at around 14 hours of continuous usage, which means you can go an entire day without hunting for your charger or an outlet. There’s a lot more to like about this 2-in-1 machine, whether you’re planning to use it as a tablet or pair it with a keyboard for the ultimate laptop experience. There are multiple color options to choose from, as well, so you can pick the one that suits your aesthetics. Grab the discount sooner rather than later, as it’s not going to be around forever.</p>

              <p>The biggest sale of the year is coming to an end, but with a bang. Cyber Monday is here, offering one last chance to stock up on the items you missed grabbing during Black Friday. Most of the hefty discounts we saw during Black Friday are still available, but the deals bid adieu tonight. Whether you’re after a multi-port charger or are finally ready to grab a 100-inch TV to enjoy better movie nights during the holidays, today is your day to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6128/">Those after a reliable storage solution for their Xbox Series X|S should consider grabbing the Seagate 2TB SSD, which is going for 29% off on Amazon.</a> It normally retails for $260, but the current deal drops the price to $185. Both Prime and non-Prime members will also enjoy free delivery with their orders, so there are no extra costs to worry about. Be sure to grab it quick, as the retailer has marked the discount as a fast-selling one. With this speed, it might not even be around after just a couple of hours.</p>

<h2>Massive Capacity, No Compromises on Performance</h2>
<p>No one likes deleting old titles to make room for the latest releases. This SSD gets you a massive 2TB storage capacity, which is enough to house a bunch of games that won’t squeeze into your console’s internal storage. It’s the sweet spot for most casual gamers who are looking to enjoy fresh releases without feeling limited. There’s a 1TB, plus 4TB version of the SSD too, going for $121 and $380, respectively.</p>
<p>The SSD is designed in partnership with Xbox. It uses the Velocity Architecture and lets you play Xbox Series X|S games directly from the expansion card without sacrificing graphics, latency, frame rates, or load times. Thousands of Original Xbox, Xbox 360, and Xbox One games offer the exact same experience as the console’s internal SSD, so you won’t feel a difference when you switch between them. You’ll just have way more space, while still enjoying ultra-fast load times and stunning visuals for a truly immersive experience. Additionally, Quick resume support means you can hop between multiple titles from the internal SSD or the expansion card within seconds, without those annoying wait times that kill the momentum.</p>



<p>The setup is plug-and-play. Start by locating the storage expansion slot on the back of your console. Remove the protective cover from the card, and insert it into the slot. Once it clicks into place, you’ll know it’s ready to use. The console will recognize the card and display a notification confirming it. Follow the on-screen instructions to proceed. You can also head to your console’s Settings, then choose System &gt; Storage devices to verify the installation. Once everything is set, start playing without feeling limited by storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6128/">Amazon throws in a 3-year limited warranty with your purchase, which provides some extra peace of mind.</a> If anything goes wrong, the retailer will replace or repair your expansion card. All things considered, if you’re looking to game better without storage issues coming in your way this holiday season, now is a great time to make the move. This Cyber Monday deal brings the price down of this 2TB expansion card by $75, letting you grab it for $185. If it’s more than you need, consider the 1TB option. Those looking for even more space can grab the 4TB version. Both of these are also discounted. Just make sure to get your orders in fast, because Cyber Monday wraps up tonight.</p>
