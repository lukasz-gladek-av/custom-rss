Once you’ve done that, you’re taken to an area made up of five challenging platform sections filled with deadly red lasers. This area has become known as “Laser Hell” and is extremely hard to complete as you have to finish all five sections without either player dying. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/split-fiction-players-defeat-secret-challenge-so-tough-that-some-of-the-devs-themselves-can-barely-complete-it-and-get-rewarded-with-the-promise-of-an-early-peek-at-the-directors-next-game/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/split-fiction-players-defeat-secret-challenge-so-tough-that-some-of-the-devs-themselves-can-barely-complete-it-and-get-rewarded-with-the-promise-of-an-early-peek-at-the-directors-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by <em>Gamesradar</em></a></span>, on March 17 two speedrunners from China— “sharkOvO” and “E1uM4y”—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ExXuYaE7E/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1ExXuYaE7E/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recorded themselves beating Laser Hell</a></span>.

Took us a lot of time to finish it. And I’m telling you, this is a crazy, crazy achievement that you have done.”</p><p>Fares then dunks on people like us watching the Easter egg video on YouTube before offering the first people to complete this level a very cool prize.</p><p>“I’m going to tell you one thing: If you see me in real life, somewhere, and you can prove to me that you actually did this challenge, I can promise you the first one that does that, I’m going to fly you to Sweden and show you early footage of our next game,” Fares promises with a smile. “I promise you that.

I will keep my promise and invite you both to Sweden for an early look of our next game. We´ll be in touch!” </p><p>I doubt they’ll be able to say anything about what they see, but hopefully the duo have a good time checking out Hazelight’s next project. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That message was notably not written by any of the staff members and was the only thing you could see on the website for the past seven months after GameStop wiped the publication’s online archive. But in the teaser, the screen glitches out, and the text “{CONSOLE.WRITELINE (CONTINUE?);” appears on the bottom right corner. It ends with a date, March 25, 2025, teasing some kind of announcement next week.</p><p>After the teaser went live, several members of <em>Game Informer</em>’s staff at the time of the shutdown have posted similar teasers on their personal social media accounts, including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/brianpshea.bsky.social/post/3lkqlak7tik2i&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/brianpshea.bsky.social/post/3lkqlak7tik2i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ex-content director Brian Shea</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/matthewmiller.bsky.social/post/3lkql376uq22k&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/matthewmiller.bsky.social/post/3lkql376uq22k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">former editor-in-chief Matt Miller</a></span>.

College sports are growing and changing, and our focus at EA Sports is on continuing to put athletes first as we bring them in the game in <em>College Football 26</em> and beyond.”</p><p>It’s believed that around 11,00o players will allow their likenesses and names to be used in <em>College Football 26</em>, which is roughly the same as last year.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
