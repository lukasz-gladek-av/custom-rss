Except the most important 30 milliseconds.” He goes on to say that remake developer Vicarious Visions “completely botched how jumping works.” That’s fighting words where I come from (Hillcrest, represent). But he’s got some numbers to back him up. Here’s his explanation of the difference between how jumping works in <em>Crash </em>1996 and the recent remakes:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>On the original PlayStation, we only had digital buttons–pressed or not pressed. No analog sticks. Players needed different height jumps, but we only had binary input [...] So we built something borderline insane. The game would detect when you pressed jump, start the animation, then continuously measure how long you held the button. As Crash rose through the air, we’d subtly adjust gravity, duration, and force based on your input.</p></blockquote><p>He sums this up by saying “Let go early = smaller hop. Hold it down = maximum height. [The game] intercepted your intent across those 30-60 milliseconds and translated it into analog control using digital inputs.”</p><p>This is the difference. But I’m kinda skeptical this morning, the 17th of July in the year of our lady 2025. <em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Andy Gavin for more details.</p><p>After some quick testing, I’m either missing some delicate nuance that I’d go so far as to say is negligible, or, Andy, I have to wonder if we’re playing the same remake? Check your LinkedIn messages, I’m curious about the specific differences in actual gameplay instances. </p><p>Granted, I tested things out on a PC with a Bluetooth Xbox controller using a backup of the original game’s image running in RetroArch with a Beetle PSX core. I then timed my jumps in each game to a metronome and jumped every “whole note” (I’m a musician, that’s how you’re going to get accurate timing from me). Some of you are probably freaking out: This is a horribly inaccurate way to drill down into the specifics of a 30-60 millisecond. Until I can devise a <em>Mythbusters</em>-grade testing unit complete with a robot that times a button press at an exact specified time (and then something that blows it all up), I can’t say for certain, but the jumps feel more similar than Gavin’s assertion that the remake only contains “maximum height” jumps. I mean, here’s another gif showing smaller jumps in motion on both games: </p><figure id="" data-id="df0c66046bfa99b115fab801a3476ad2" data-recommend-id="image://df0c66046bfa99b115fab801a3476ad2" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A side-by-side gif shows Crash Bandicoot jupming in the original game vs. the 2017 remake." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A side-by-side gif shows Crash Bandicoot jupming in the original game vs. the 2017 remake." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Naughty Dog / Vicarious Visions / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="df0c66046bfa99b115fab801a3476ad2" data-recommend-id="image://df0c66046bfa99b115fab801a3476ad2" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A side-by-side gif shows Crash Bandicoot jupming in the original game vs. the 2017 remake." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’m willing to believe that, obviously, there are minute technical differences between these two games, separated by decades of change in how video games are made. But also, as my colleague and <em>Kotaku</em> senior reporter Ethan Gach mentioned in our work Slack, <em>Mario</em> had different jump heights based on how long you held the button, so how unique is the <em>Crash </em>jump anyway? I also recently replayed these remakes. I and many other long-time <em>Crash</em> fans typically admit, this collection feels very accurate to the original 1990s-era experience.</p><p>I’ll get back to you if and when I learn more about <em>Crash</em>’s attempts to defy gravity.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/crash-bandicoot-naughty-dog-vicarious-visions-jump-1851786482]]></content:encoded>

There are two controller side panels, similar to a Nintendo Switch, but there’s also a second screen, similar to a Nintendo DS, and you can reconfigure them to achieve your preferred ergonomic layout and overload your multi-tasking gamer brain. Finally, you can scroll TikTok AND play games at the same time. </p><p>The Sugar 1 sports a 6.01-inch screen and a smaller 3.92-inch display and uses a Snapdragon G3 Gen 3 processor for Android, cloud, and “retro gaming” (read: emulation). In addition to multitasking, the device is clearly aiming at players nostalgic for the days of the DS and 3DS, whose second-screen mechanics should be easily replicated given the form factor. It’ll be a pricey way to revisit, say, <em>Viva Pinata: Pocket Paradise</em>, however.

Raid passes which cost roughly $1.50 each let players join special battles from afar. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1klo8gf/crown_clash_taken_over_thepokegohunter/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1klo8gf/crown_clash_taken_over_thepokegohunter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Starting with the Crown Clash Take Over event in May</a></span>, players were allowed to begin using remote raid passes for Shadow raids as well, and Niantic also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1kltqbz/the_daily_remote_raid_limit_is_now_increased_to/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1kltqbz/the_daily_remote_raid_limit_is_now_increased_to/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">upped the number of remote raids players could do each day</a></span>. </p><p>Given how wonky GPS tracking can be in<em> Pokémon Go </em>to begin with, some players are now worried they’ll get unfairly flagged for cheating if their character accidentally gets bounced around the map. “My bathroom sometimes launches me across town, I checked where I was once and it was a place 15 minutes away from where I lived,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1lxjm5y/just_got_this_message_on_discord_today/?share_id=BmfzARQ9s9ntUEWdTePTE&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1lxjm5y/just_got_this_message_on_discord_today/?share_id=BmfzARQ9s9ntUEWdTePTE&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one player on the SylphRoad subreddit. “I’m a suburban player and will very often stop placed when I’m driving to play from my car, especially when it’s 90+ and humid out, and there are tons of errors when I have to restart the app to get it to register that I’m no longer driving or am in a new area from where I was when I minimized it and started driving,” complained another. <br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-fan-confusion-around-the-risks-of-using-a-well-known-pokemon-go-exploit-the-games-developer-responds-by-pointing-back-to-its-terms-of-service-which-lay-out-its-rules-on-cheating&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-fan-confusion-around-the-risks-of-using-a-well-known-pokemon-go-exploit-the-games-developer-responds-by-pointing-back-to-its-terms-of-service-which-lay-out-its-rules-on-cheating" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asked by <em>IGN</em></a></span> for confirmation of whether GPS drifting was considered cheating, the <em> Pokémon Go</em> team pointed to the cheating section of its TOS which states, “Using any techniques to alter or falsify a device’s location (for example through GPS spoofing).” As<em> IGN</em> points out, that section includes a ban on playing with multiple accounts as well, something that’s also been a part of the game for years without any apparent major crackdown. So, is there a ban wave coming for people trying to remote raid for free? Or are players getting freaked out about a years-old exploit for no apparent reason? For now at least, Niantic seems content to let those fears persist. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-remote-raid-chat-gps-drift-niantic-ban-1851786470]]></content:encoded>
