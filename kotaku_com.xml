              <p>Many, many RPG fans are patiently awaiting the <a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-iv-4-square-enix-disney-announced-reveal-1848774720">next installment in the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> franchise</a>. And a lot of those people are waiting for <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>‘s third and final installment, too. As you might expect, some are worried about how development is proceeding on these two massive Square Enix RPGs, and to help calm those players down, <em>FF7</em> and <em>KH4</em> director Tetsuya Nomura has attempted to reassure us all that things are going “smoothly.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-three-and-kingdom-hearts-iv-development-progressing-smoothly-tetsuya-nomura-confirms">As reported by <em>Gematsu</em></a>, during Friday’s <em>Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis </em>2nd Anniversary broadcast, Nomura hopped in toward the end after seemingly spotting comments in the chat asking about <em>FF7 Remake’s</em> third installment. While he didn’t have a release date to share, he wanted everyone to relax. The game is on schedule, okay?</p>  <div data-qa="virtual-list-item" role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="C099JF8RR7T-1757093613.501129-thread-list-Thread_1757093654.334059" tabindex="0" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1757093654.334059"> <div dir="auto"> <p>“Right, so, looking at the comments, I’m seeing people ask every so often about the third entry in the [<i data-stringify-type="italic">FF7</i>]&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Remake</i> series,” said Nomura. “Apparently, [<em>FF7</em> co-director Motomu] Toriyama mentioned in an interview that something might be released around the second anniversary [of <i data-stringify-type="italic">Ever Crisis</i>]. So that’s probably where those expectations are coming from. Right, so things are progressing really smoothly. I can’t really say more—if I suddenly went, ‘Well, actually…,’ everyone would be really surprised!”</p> </div>  <div dir="auto"> <p>He then added: “So yeah, things are moving along really smoothly, and the release timing has already been decided. We’re moving forward according to that schedule right now, so please rest assured and be patient.”</p> </div> </div>  <p>And don’t worry, fans of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>, Nomura also had a small update about the Disney RPG, which was first announced back in 2022.</p>  <p>“And this has also come up in the comments here and there, but <i data-stringify-type="italic">Kingdom Hearts IV</i>&nbsp;is likewise steadily moving forward according to schedule, so please look forward to it.”</p>  <p>While this is good to hear, I imagine a lot of folks want a release window for one or both of these RPGs. <em>FF7 Remake’</em>s third entry will be its last, <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-ff7-vii-remake-trilogy-rebirth-square-eni-1849074004">as confirmed by Square Enix in 2022</a>. We still don’t know when it’s coming, what it will be named, and what platforms it will launch on, though I expect PS5 players will be able to play it day one. Meanwhile, we’ve heard very little about <em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em>, though we did get <a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-4-screenshots-mickey-sora-release-date-1851780809">a new, very low-res screenshot earlier this year of Mickey Mouse in a library.</a> Hopefully, that and Nomura’s assurance that everything is progressing as planned will be enough for folks until the next update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> isn’t without its unsolved mysteries. Between the seemingly <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-ff06b5-statue-code-mystery-netflix-anime-1849732254">unsolved FF06B5 enigma</a> and the lasting impact of <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-peralez-quest-jefferson-dream-on-choice-1849787559">cryptic quests like the Peralez storyline</a>, plenty of cybersleuths are still hard at work on the streets of Night City trying to uncover the game’s secrets. Fittingly, A recent social media post by official <i>Cyberpunk</i> accounts has led fans on another strange quest for truth, and it centers a strange, unlisted video that, at first glance, looks to be just 24 minutes of uninterrupted static.</p> <p>On September 1, 2025, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cyberpunk.net/post/3lxrrdgn3w22h">CD Projekt Red shared an image</a> of an in-universe recruitment message from Rosalind Myers, president of <i>Cyberpunk</i>’s fictional NUSA (New United States of America). Over at the decaying corpse of Twitter known as X, the official <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> account <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1962930885935714594">threw cold water</a> on any notion that this post was a teaser for new content, clarifying that it was simply “part of an activity tied to the <i>Phantom Liberty</i> anniversary [the studio’s] celebrating this month.” But fans convinced there was something more to this message were on to something.</p>   <p>As documented by ArcticXWolf on Reddit, the binary of the image had a link that <a href="https://cyberpunk.cdn.cdpr.app/files/wigvixQWK.png">points to an image of a Roman coin</a>. Using the anonymous messaging platform secretMSG, the link redirects to the unlisted YouTube video mentioned earlier,&nbsp; titled “Secret Message from NUSA,” which seemingly contains nothing more than 24 minutes and 53 seconds of static. Despite my affinity for avant-garde works of art, even I don’t think it’s very pleasant to listen to.</p>

  <p>Things get a little weird from here on out. Select frames from this video can be seen to spell out the words “FILES DETECTED CLASSIFIED.” Unfortunately, this seems to be the last concrete, provable thing anyone’s sussed out thus far. Some have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FF06B5/comments/1n93v8f/a_secret_message_from_the_nusa_static_video_isnt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">turned to LLMs for help</a>–which (shocker!) isn’t turning up anything meaningful. Others have pointed to a possible similarity between this cryptic static video and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FF06B5/comments/1n7skjz/comment/nc9wcza/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">something apparently hidden</a> in <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-season-2-netflix-studio-trigger-1851785703">the <i>Edgerunners 2</i> teaser</a>, which may or may not have something to do with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FF06B5/comments/1n7skjz/comment/nca6b2h/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><i>Cyberpunk</i>’s space-exploration-themed conspiracies</a>. And yet another well-read fan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FF06B5/comments/1n8azmn/comment/nce1a8u/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">quoted the opening line</a> of William Gibson’s classic cyberpunk novel <i>Neuromancer</i>:</p> <blockquote><p>“The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.”</p></blockquote> <p>Spooky stuff! The cryptic video remains unlisted and no social media accounts from <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> or CD Projekt Red actually seem to have given any more clues. <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>’s stories are often at their best when there’s a mystery to unravel, so this is cool and on-brand. Now hopefully someone figures this one out, as well as whatever the hell the true meaning of FF06B5 is.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-review-bomb-chinese-translation-2000623496</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/here%E2%80%99s-why-hollow-knight-silksong-is-getting-review-bombed-in-china.1290255/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hits-over-half-a-million-players-on-pc-alone-after-crashing-steam-2000623193">is soaring on Steam</a>. Just 24 hours after release it’s taken over the sales charts, hit a concurrent player peak of over 550,000, and received rave reviews from fans. But not in China. The long-awaited Metroidvania has instead been getting review-bombed by Chinese-language users on Steam who feel the translation this time around is much worse than that in the first <em>Hollow Knight</em>. The head of marketing for the game has already promised to put things right.</p> <p>“To our Chinese speaking fans: We appreciate you letting us know about quality issues with the current Simplified Chinese translation of <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>,” Matthew Griffin, in charge of publishing for the game, <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1963798473700168146">wrote on X</a>. “We’ll be working to improve the translation over the coming weeks. Thanks for your feedback and support.” Despite the good news, his post has been inundated with comments and quote-tweets, many slamming the fact that the game launched without better quality checks for the Chinese localization.</p> <p>According to localization expert Loek van Kooten, one of the main issues is that <em>Silksong</em>‘s evocative but concise writing has been turned into “a high-school drama club’s Elizabethan improv night” in the Chinese versions. He cites the following as an example of how the prose reads:</p>

 <blockquote><p>With nary a spirit nor thought shalt thou persist, bereft of mortal will, unbent, unswayed. With no lament nor tearful cry, only sorrow’s dirge to herald thine eternal woe. Born of gods and of the fathomless abyss, grasping heaven’s firmament in thine unworthy palm. Shackled to endless dream, tormented by pestilence and shadow, thy heart besieged by phantasmal demons. Thou art the chalice of destiny. Verily, thou art the Primordial Knight of Hollowness.</p></blockquote> <p>Van Kooten goes on to point out that one of two of <em>Silksong</em>‘s Chinese translators, listed as Hertzz Liu in the credits, had a habit of gloating about their involvement in the game and leaking small details about the development process over the summer prior to its release this week. The first <em>Hollow Knight</em>, on the other hand, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/84194/hollow-knight/credits/windows/?autoplatform=true">had six Chinese translators</a>,&nbsp; including one who had also worked on<em> Stardew Valley</em>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">no,you don't hate localizer enough. we need translator,not a fanfic writer that doesn't convey author's original intention,the whole localization industry is a scam <a href="https://t.co/5Q8fBB6UiH">https://t.co/5Q8fBB6UiH</a></p> <p>— NKRZE (@nekorize) <a href="https://twitter.com/nekorize/status/1964020916683493687?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Here’s a Valve-translated portion of one Steam review blasting the Chinese verison:</p>

 <blockquote><p>First, the god-awful Chinese translation that everyone is mocking. It’s not just pretentious, pseudo-artistic nonsense—the phrasing and even the localization of place names are an absolute mess. I don’t understand how Hollow Knight’s fantastic, quotable translation turned into this unsalvageable heap of garbage in Silksong. The utterly idiotic localization has even affected the game’s world-building and storytelling, forcing me to guess at character relationships and main plot points. Thankfully, the combat holds up, or else I’d be completely disgusted.</p></blockquote> <p><em>Silksong</em> currently sits at a staggeringly low rating of just 50 percent out of 10,000 reviews in the simplified Chinese category. That would be enough to significantly stunt the game’s Steam rating worldwide, at least in the short-term, <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-reviews-wuchang-fallen-feather-china-language-filter-2000618249">had Valve not implemented a recent change</a> that segments Steam reviews by language for exactly this reason. Now review-bombing in one country for region-specific issues doesn’t bleed over into a game’s overall perception globally.</p> <p>Unlike when <em>Hollow Knight</em> released eight years ago, Chinese language users <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/4-great-graphs-and-1-new-feature">now make up the largest group on Steam</a>. While poor translations don’t hurt a game for anyone who’s not reliant on them, they can limit a game’s trajectory on the Valve-owned storefront. Somehow I ultimately don’t think that will be a problem for <em>Silksong</em>, especially once Team Cherry gets the Chinese translation sorted.</p>
