              <p>A very important and extremely popular mod for roleplayers in <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-endwalker-goodbye-dawntrail-1851561996">MMORPG <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>,</a> Mare Synchronos, is shutting down with less than 48 hours notice. The news has caught many off guard, and the <em>FFXIV</em> community isn’t happy that such a vital mod for many will no longer be usable in the MMO.</p> <p><a href="https://ffxiv.natsume.io/dalamud/mare-syncronos">Mare Synchronos is a free third-party plugin</a> for <em>FFXIV</em> that, along with some other tools and software, allows players to synchronize their cosmetic mods and custom animations. While thousands of players used the plugin, it was primarily popular with roleplayers and others who enjoy the more social aspects of <em>FFXIV</em>. With Mare, as it is often referred to online, friends could see each other’s characters as they appear on their own PC, complete with all their mods and extra animations that normally are’t seen by other players due to mod restrictions. For many who find <em>FFXIV’s</em> customization features to be lacking and who rely on mods to tweak their looks to create their perfect character, Mare was vital in letting other players see how they “really” look. It was also popular in in-game nightclubs and other areas to allow players to sync up custom dance animations and other…activities. And now all the fun is ending.</p> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1mwhuzu/final_fantasy_xiv_mod_mare_synchronos_is_shutting/">On August 21</a>, one of the lead devs behind Mare Synchronos reportedly posted on the mod’s Discord server that they had received a “legal inquiry” about the mod, likely from publisher Square Enix, and were shutting down Mare completely.</p>

 <p>“With a heavy heart, I have to announce the end of Mare Synchronos as you know it,” said Her Royal Floofness on Discord, in a message shared on Reddit. “I’ve received a legal inquiry concerning the project. After reviewing my options with counsel, I’m winding it down.”</p> <p>Royal Floofness confirmed that Mare will continue to work until August 22 at 6:00 AM. After that point, the server will shut down and the plugin will be removed. “Enjoy your last doomsday party,” said the modder. “Thank you for the past 3 years of Mare, I hope you enjoyed the ride.”&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> has contacted Square Enix about the mod being shut down.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Mare Synchronos GPose Together" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/877WZ18VIKg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Many players online were shocked by the news and speculated that Mare being killed might lead to fewer people playing the game.</p>

 <p>“Holy fuck getting rid of this is MASSIVE,” posted one user on Reddit. “This game has a huge RP player base. Does [Square Enix] think people keep subbed to this game to raid log?”</p> <p>“If you entire reason for playing was the modded glam game then you probably have less of a reason to play now,” said another Reddit user.</p> <p>“Genuinely worried about what this means for the RP community (and I mean the actual RP community, not nightclub/Balmung QS.) I’ve been actively RPing in the Mateus Quicksands for the past two years or so, and whenever Mare has even had as much of a hiccup the Quicksands clears out. There’s definitely been an over-reliance on Mare, but now it’s been taken away, I worry a lot of my fellow RPers will just struggle to adapt and bail,” said a roleplayer on Reddit in response to the news.</p>  <p>Others are hopeful that someone else will fork the mod and that a similar tool will be created in the future. For now, the nightclubs of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> will be a bit less raucous in the coming days.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/critical-role-explains-its-big-shakeup-but-some-fans-aren%E2%80%99t-convinced.1277607/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Earlier this month, the actual play phenomenon </span><i><span>Critical Role </span></i><span>announced a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-internet-reacts-to-critical-roles-big-shakeup-2000614488"><span>pretty big shakeup</span></a><span> for its upcoming fourth campaign. Matt Mercer, who had led each of the group’s previous stories as the game master, will instead take on a player role, and </span><i><span>Dimension 20</span></i><span>’s Brennan Lee Mulligan will step up to lead the next campaign in October. Now, we know what campaign four will entail, and it sounds much more complex than anything </span><i><span>Critical Role </span></i><span>has done before.</span></p> <p><span>In a 17-minute presentation, Mulligan outlined his plans for the campaign, and it sounds pretty ambitious. Rather than being set in Exandria, the world where </span><i><span>Critical Role</span></i><span>’s first three stories took place, this season will see the players enter a new world. Mulligan is dividing the 13 cast members into three distinct groups: Soldiers, Schemers, and Seekers, with each tackling the new fantasy setting and story from a different angle. As such, not every cast member will be present for each episode as it jumps between different perspectives. The announcement didn’t confirm which cast members would be in each group, but it did solidify that </span><i><span>Critical Role</span></i><span>‘s founding members will all be returning. The full cast is as follows:</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Laura Bailey</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Luis Carazo</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Robbie Daymond</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Aabria Iyengar</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Taliesin Jaffe</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Ashley Johnson</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Matthew Mercer</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Whitney Moore</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Liam O’Brien</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Marisha Ray</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Sam Riegel</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Alex Ward</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Travis Willingham</span></li> </ul> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="What Is Campaign Four?" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nY1JaWT-CKo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Now that it’s confirmed the founding members will return for campaign four, some of </span><i><span>Critical Role</span></i><span>’s fans are</span><a href="https://x.com/fearnexcalloway/status/1958579478914863255"><span> more optimistic about all the changes on the way</span></a><span>, though others are still </span><a href="https://x.com/jordancates/status/1958579250627584376"><span>skeptical about the structure</span></a><span>, given that the entire crew won’t be playing together. At least, not at first. It’s entirely possible the story goes in a direction that sees all these disparate groups end up together down the line, which sounds like it would make for a sick finale, but will likely not happen until years from now. The first episode is set to premiere on October 2.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hell-let-loose-vietnam-battlefield-trailer-release-date-2000619203</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hell-let-loose-vietnam-takes-50v50-slaughter-to-the-jungle-in-sequel-fans-have-been-waiting-for.1277544/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</em> was on at least one fan’s Gamescom 2025 bingo card. “Hear me out: ‘Hell let loose Vietnam,'” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HellLetLoose/comments/1i4cqmp/hear_me_out_hell_let_loose_vietnam/">they wrote</a> on the Hell Let Loose subreddit at the start of 2025. Now that fan has fished their wish, as the game’s announcement trailer delivers the sequel that <em>Battlefield</em> players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/114rpnm/we_can_all_agree_that_we_need_a_battlefield/">are still waiting for</a>.</p> <p>Set during the years of the Vietnam War, between 1965 and 1973, the next <em>Hell Let Loose</em> will be a big departure from the first game’s WWII battlefields in Europe. In addition to the shift to dense jungle terrain, <em>Vietnam</em> will also feature aerial vehicles with players ferrying supplies by helicopter between camps, as well as river patrols by boat. North Vietnamese forces, meanwhile, will have access to sprawling networks of tunnels for bypassing enemy patrols and launching ambushes.</p> <p>It’s set to come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in 2026, with the publisher promising that both the new and existing games will continue to be maintained and updated alongside one another. Here’s the trailer:</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Hell Let Loose: Vietnam | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JzYzYNVWZ_A?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><em>Hell Let Loose</em> blew up on Steam when it launched in 2021 despite being borne of a Kickstarter project years earlier by Australian studio Black Matter. Unlike recent battle royale free-for-alls or modern <em>Call of Duty</em>-style deathmatches, <em>Hell Let Loose</em> leans into the military simulation genre with 50v50 battles, in which players designated as officers share commands over priority voice channels and victory requires prioritizing communication and coordination over individual KDA ratio heroics.</p> <h2><em>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</em> won’t replace the original</h2> <p>The new game will introduce six maps at the start focusing on key moments in the war like Operation Starlite and Operation Piranha. It will also transition the franchise to Unreal Engine 5, hopefully with all of the visual bells-and-whistles that allows and none of the PC performance issues we’ve seen so frequently in other games. But even while this entirely new campaign is being built out across multiple game modes, the developers swear post-launch support for the original <em>Hell Let Loose</em> will continue.</p> <p>“Our World War Two-based&nbsp;<em data-prosemirror-content-type="mark" data-prosemirror-mark-name="em">Hell Let Loose</em> is incredibly important to us and our players. We can reassure you all that Team17 remains fully committed to the franchise,” they <a href="https://www.hellletloose.com/blog/introducing-hell-let-loose-vietnam">write in an FAQ</a>. “<span id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-mark-type="annotation" data-mark-annotation-type="inlineComment" data-id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-prosemirror-content-type="mark" data-prosemirror-mark-name="annotation" data-hsprotectannotationtype="inlineComment">To bring </span><em data-prosemirror-content-type="mark" data-prosemirror-mark-name="em"><span id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-mark-type="annotation" data-mark-annotation-type="inlineComment" data-id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-prosemirror-content-type="mark" data-prosemirror-mark-name="annotation" data-hsprotectannotationtype="inlineComment">Hell Let Loose: Vietnam </span></em><span id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-mark-type="annotation" data-mark-annotation-type="inlineComment" data-id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-prosemirror-content-type="mark" data-prosemirror-mark-name="annotation" data-hsprotectannotationtype="inlineComment">to life, Expression have built a second team in order to </span><span id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-mark-type="annotation" data-mark-annotation-type="inlineComment" data-id="34957365-b1f1-4f27-9533-d9421215840b" data-prosemirror-content-type="mark" data-prosemirror-mark-name="annotation" data-hsprotectannotationtype="inlineComment">support both titles simultaneously. </span>One game will never come at the expense of the other. Our focus remains on growing and improving both experiences for our players.”</p> <p>Black Matter sold the franchise to Team17 a year after it came out and is currently working on an extraction RPG set in the plague-ravaged Napoleonic era <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1752080/HUNGER/">called <em>Hunger</em></a>, so <em>Hell Let Loose: Vietnam</em> will be developed from the ground up by a completely separate team. We’ll see how the formula fairs and whether the sequel can live up to its premise. If you’re interested in checking out <em>Hell Let Loose</em> for yourself, it’s currently available on Game Pass on both console and PC. The game continues to get new updates with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HellLetLoose/comments/1je8esl/upcoming_roadmap_hell_let_loose/">a March road map</a> pointing to additional maps, vehicles, and cosmetics coming in the future.</p>
