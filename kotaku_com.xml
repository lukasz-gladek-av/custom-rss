              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-4-is-finally-getting-a-port-wont-be-trapped-on-ps3-2000668326"><em>Metal Gear Solid</em>‘s bandana furrowing Snake</a> is teaming up with Splinter Cell’s Sam Fischer and the rest of Rainbow Six Siege’s roster as the tactical shooter’s newest operator. After teasing the collaboration earlier this year, Ubisoft finally pulled back the curtain with a reveal trailer that has the two heavy-weights of video game espionage broing out before taking down some baddies.</p> <p>The Solid Snake Operator arrives in <em>R6 Siege</em> with Operation Silent Hunt in the new season on March 3. One of the big questions facing the crossover was whether David Hayter, the original voice of Konami’s protagonist (created by Hideo Kojima) would be returning for such a weird and unexpected side-project. The new trailer reveals that the answer is “yes.” Fans are relieved but wish Sam Fischer could have been voiced by a returning Michael Ironside as well. Still not in the budget, apparently.</p>

 <p>Here’s the<em> R6 Siege</em>‘s version of Solid Snake in action:</p>  <p>The reveal trailer shows Snake doing Snake stuff like hiding around corners and taking enemies down enemies with a silencer before sending in a smoke grenade and handing out takedowns. Sam Fisher pops up at the end, the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=upsxB_VxWn0">two embrace <em>Predator</em>-style</a>, and Snake quips about “soldiers like us” never getting a moment’s rest as a new alert pops up on his pager.</p> <p><em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> currently has over 70 operators with Sam Fisher, codenamed “Zero,” added all the way back in 2020 as part of Operation Shadow Legacy. Outside of playable characters, the shooter’s past crossover collaborations have included everything from <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> and <em>Resident Evil</em> to <em>Tomb Raider</em> and<em> Halo</em>. It’s not <em>Fortnite</em> levels of branded content but, like all modern live service games,<em> Siege</em>‘s developers at some point realized how much <a href="https://kotaku.com/crossover-skins-destiny-2-witcher-halo-rainbow-six-bad-1851039973">more money there is in licensed cosmetics than in-universe kits</a>.</p>

 <p>Snake’s arrival is perfectly timed to take advantage of excitement over last year’s<em> Snake Eater</em> remake the upcoming <em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em> remaster via the <em>Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 2</em> coming in August. While it’s not clear if Konami will ever give Snake a new adventure yet, the franchise is alive and well on modern platforms. The same can’t necessarily be said for <em>Splinter Cell</em>. A remake is <a href="https://kotaku.com/all-the-biggest-game-franchises-are-going-backwards-2000668403">still MIA</a> and it’s been over a decade since <em>Blacklist</em> came out.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/edgar-allen-poe-cult-classic-horror-steam-pc-2000669201</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Myst</span></i><span> was the first game to show the world what CD-ROMs were capable of. In the wake of its runaway success, countless new teams emerged to capture the public’s enchantment with PC multimedia, including bigwig Hollywood players. From </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg%27s_Director%27s_Chair"><span>Spielberg</span></a><span> to the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supreme_Warrior"><span>Shaw Brothers</span></a><span>, they correctly assessed that gaming would have a permanent stake in commercial entertainment, though their FMV-forward approach may have missed the mark. It made the mid-90s’ output of PC gaming a particularly interesting slice. One of the most curious bits of software came from a strange union between Time Warner Interactive and poet William S. Burroughs. It returns this weekend with an official Steam release, albeit under a bizarre new handle.</span></p> <p><span>Originally hitting shelves in 1995, </span><i><span>The Dark Eye</span></i><span> is part point-and-click adventure game, part book report. Visiting your eccentric uncle Edwin, you poke and prod around a drafty manor, uncovering salacious family affairs and playing audience to stop-motion renditions of Edgar Allan Poe’s most famous tales. Not puzzles per se, but navigating around the dreamlike estate is cryptic enough. Add in ashen claymation puppets and narration from Burroughs, whose voice itself is like a gust whirling through the rattling doors of places abandoned, and </span><i><span>The Dark Eye</span></i><span> easily secured a cult status. Like most games from Inscape (such as </span><i><span>Drowned God</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Bad Day on the Midway</span></i><span>), it is as adored as it is difficult to find a hard copy of.</span></p>

  <p><span>This weekend, GMedia brings about an official Steam release of the gothic gem. Running off ScummVM, GMedia promises an authentic experience. With one noticeable change: the game has been renamed as ‘</span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4289030/Edgar_Allan_Poes_Interactive_Horror_1995_Edition/"><i><span>Edgar Allan Poe’s Interactive Horror: 1995 Edition</span></i></a><i><span>.</span></i></p> <p><span>Why they’d deke around the original title is no mystery. “</span><a href="https://ulisses-us.com/games/tde/"><i><span>The Dark Eye</span></i></a><i><span>“</span></i><span> is trademarked by a long-running and immensely successful German tabletop RPG of the same name. That </span><i><span>Dark Eye</span></i><span> has numerous licensed video games, including a couple from Daedalic Entertainment on Steam. The real intrigue is why GMedia would settle on </span><i><span>this </span></i><span>name in particular. Could have called it <em>Poe’s Dark Mind</em>, <em>The Tell-Tale Heart: A Telltale Games Series</em> or <em>The Cask of A-Supermario</em>. SEO-friendly or not, it’d be nice to say a title ten times fast without becoming the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gzd11GMBONg"><span>Micro Machines guy</span></a><span>.</span><span><br> </span></p>

 <p><i><span>The Dark Eye</span></i><span>’s resurrection is part of an altogether pleasant trend. A surge of oddball bygone PC games have been made more accessible lately through fan translations, patches and even official Steam releases. Only four years ago, Tomomi Sakuba’s notoriously menacing </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1946430/Garage_Bad_Dream_Adventure/"><i><span>Garage: Bad Dream Adventure</span></i></a><span> reemerged on modern hardware with quality-of-life features and multiple new translations.</span></p>

 <p><span>You can pick up </span><i><span>The Dar</span></i><span>…Sorry, you can pick up</span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4289030/Edgar_Allan_Poes_Interactive_Horror_1995_Edition/"><i><span> Edgar Allan Poe’s Interactive Horror: 1995 Edition Colon Computer Software For Home Device This Year Today</span></i></a><span> as of Sunday on Steam.</span></p>

              <p>Pick ingredients off a conveyor belt. Drag them around a plate. Try to unlock point combos and hope your incredible, edible abominations pass muster with an idiosyncratic cast of anthropomorphic guests. <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/omelet-you-cook"><em>Omelet You Cook</em></a> is a tight, simple, rewarding roguelike with more than enough personality and flare to earn a seat at the table. The only thing I want to do after I lose is fire up the grill all over again.</p> <p><em>Omelet You Cook</em> was really neat when it hit Steam Early Access in early 2025. It’s even cooler now after it’s launched in 1.0. It’s a cooking roguelike in which you select ingredients and get awarded points based on how they’re arranged on top of an omelet according to an ever more intricate cascade of scoring rules. The spatial strategizing and arrangement synergies are where the <a href="https://kotaku.com/luck-be-a-landlord-boycott-bds-xbox-israel-palenstine-indie-dev-2000654628"><em>Luck Be a Landlord</em></a> flavor comes in. Points that blaze more intensely the better you do and an in-game economy for purchasing items that bestow special perks is where the <a href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124"><em>Balatro</em></a> feel comes into play.</p>

 <p>But like the best games in this RNG triage, min-maxing roguelike genre, <em>Omelet You Cook</em> exists as something more than the sum of its parts that can’t simply be reduced to its obvious inspirations. There are elements of cozy sims and chillout puzzle games here, with unique and finicky patrons reminiscent of <em>Animal Crossing</em> villagers, each with different dietary restrictions and preferences. The emphasis on how food is positioned and empty space is managed reminds me a bit of the calming fiddliness of <em>A Little to the Left</em>.</p>  <p>This is the part where I tell you that if you tried <em>Omelet You Cook </em>last summer and liked it then, there’s a whole lot more to love now. Nearly two dozen updates and seven months later, February’s 1.0 update (released early <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/slay-the-spire-2-pulls-a-silksong-scares-indie-devs-into-releasing-roguelike-ahead-of-schedule-in-fear-of-losing-players-to-an-absolute-juggernaut-in-our-own-genre/">to get ahead of <em>Slay the Spire 2</em></a>) includes a bunch of different modes as well as the option to do the whole game turn-based if the conveyor belt continually moving was getting too stressful. There’s a Black Apron difficulty and a final showdown with Principal Clucker himself, the chicken that roasts your chef skills every time you fail.</p>

 <p>While the combo chaos is great for math nerds and the absurd recipes are fun and silly, I think <em>Omelet You Cook</em>‘s greatest strength is its quirky animal characters and light but satisfying conversational bits. There’s a generous spirit that comes through in the hospitality work and sense of community within the game, that games like <em>Luck Be a Landlord</em> and <em>Balatro</em> don’t have. It’s slight but touching, with shades of <em>Donut County</em>. The music is delightful. The visuals are splendid. Every screen and object buzzes with vibrant energy.</p>

 <p>It took over 500 Steam reviews for <em>Omelet You Cook</em> to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cooking-roguelike-game-omelet-you-cook-has-its-perfect-steam-review-record-ruined-by-contrarian-player">get its first negative one</a>, and that was just somebody being a dick. Play it and you’ll instantly understand why.</p>
