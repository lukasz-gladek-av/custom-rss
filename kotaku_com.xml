            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After a decade of back-and-forth attack and defense missions in <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>, it was most certainly time for an update. Most of us were probably expecting a sequel. But Ubisoft decided an update masquerading as an overhaul would suffice. <em>Rainbow Six Siege X</em> enters the picture and, with it, a bunch of technical improvements, playable content, and promises. But if it’s been some time since you jumped into <em>Siege</em>, you’re likely curious about what makes this new version so special. Let’s get into it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195618" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="376" data-playlist="195618,196358,196626" data-current="195618"><div><p>Unboxing The Baldur’s Gate 3 Collector’s Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195618/195618_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h90631"><a id=""></a>What does the community think of the new update?</h2><p>Folks have been actively enjoying <em>Rainbow Six Siege </em>since December of 2015. So we’re about a few months shy of 10 years—that’s a long time to settle into a routine. Folks have been playing maps, operators, and weapons with major changes introduced incrementally over the last decade. But with the <em>X</em> update, everything changes at once. Sometimes, it’s not for the better.</p><p>For instance, over on Steam,<strong> there are a slew of negative reviews, dropping the first-person shooter to ‘Mixed’ on the platform</strong>. To be fair, many of them denounce Ubisoft’s customer service, which is completely fair based on personal experience. Others, however, point toward the game’s ongoing toxic community as part of the problem. It’s not all bad, though. T<strong>here are still more positive reviews than negative, and players happily tout the gunplay and competitive edge that make up the core experience as continuing highlights.</strong></p><p>As for the critics, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamesn.com/rainbow-six-siege/x-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/rainbow-six-siege/x-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PCGamesN</em></a></span> calls it a “remaster, not a reinvention” while showcasing the attention to detail throughout its reimagined environments, all of which change the dynamic between attackers and defenders. Elsewhere, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-x-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rainbow-six-siege-x-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span> proclaims the changes fun and “enough to keep me coming back long after I’ve finished this review.” That’s high praise!</p><h2 id="h90632"><a id=""></a>So, what’s new in <em>Rainbow Six Siege X</em>?</h2><figure id="" data-id="6e65a9d7738d63ad612048a0cc1509d9" data-recommend-id="image://6e65a9d7738d63ad612048a0cc1509d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Soldiers walk down a corridor in formation." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Soldiers walk down a corridor in formation." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6e65a9d7738d63ad612048a0cc1509d9" data-recommend-id="image://6e65a9d7738d63ad612048a0cc1509d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Soldiers walk down a corridor in formation." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On the surface, <em>X </em>doesn’t seem like it’s that groundbreaking. But there’s a lot under the hood to consider, especially if you’re a returning player. It’s a little overwhelming, what with so many unique operators, weapon and character skins, game modes, and more to sift through. Here’s what’s new:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Free Access</strong>: Anyone can download <em>Siege X</em> and gain access to Standard, Quick Play, and Dual Front, along with 26 Operators.</li><li><strong>Carrying Over</strong>: If you previously purchased <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> and any of the content available, such as Operator packs, then everything carries over. <strong>You’ll retain your content, progression, access to Ranked matchmaking, and the Siege Cup, plus you’ll receive exclusive rewards.</strong></li><li><strong>Dual Front</strong>: One of the biggest (literally) additions to <em>Siege X</em> is the introduction of Dual Front, an all-new game mode that features the first-person shooter’s biggest map to date. You’ll secure territory while defending your current holdings in a 6v6 game mode.</li><li><strong>Destructible Elements</strong>: Fire extinguishers, metal detectors, gas pipes, and more litter the maps now, creating additional environmental destruction possibilities.</li><li><strong>Visual Overhaul</strong>: At launch, five maps received an entire graphical rework, and the team promises three more map reworks per season. Everything is graphically enhanced, from the ceilings to the floor tiles.</li><li><strong>New Animations</strong>: Alongside a visual overhaul, there are new animations. You may now inspect your weapon and rappelling now looks a bit more enticing and graphically better.</li></ul><h2 id="h90633"><a id=""></a>Which version should you purchase?<br></h2><p>There are three available editions for <em>Rainbow Six Siege X</em>. Most people will wind up playing the Free version, with its low barrier to entry. But if you genuinely enjoy the game and want more variety, the bigger, more expensive editions come with additional Operators.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Free</strong>: Unlocks Quick Match, Unranked, and Dual Front Modes, alongside 26 operators.</li><li><strong>Elite Edition</strong>: All of the above, plus competitive modes (Ranked and Siege Cup) and an additional 16 Operators.</li><li><strong>Ultimate Edition</strong>: All of the above, plus 52 additional Operators and 4 Operator cosmetic bundle packs.</li></ul><hr><p><br><em>Rainbow Six Siege X</em> is available now, completely free-to-play, on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/rainbow-6-siege-tom-clancy-siege-x-update-still-good-1851785842]]></content:encoded>

If you’ve been enjoying <em>Blue Prince</em> with a friend, definitely link up to work your mind and reflexes to the fullest in <em>Full Metal Furies</em>.</p><hr><h2 id="h62828"><a id=""></a>2: <em>The Witness</em></h2><p>The surprisingly divisive puzzle adventure <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-witness-the-kotaku-review-1754919626&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-witness-the-kotaku-review-1754919626"><em>The Witness</em></a></span> is here for two reasons. For starters, it features an open world filled with line puzzles, and it’s up to you to figure out the rules to each of them. Sometimes these are straightforward, other times they can absolutely boggle your mind. Either way, it should appeal to those hungry for another puzzler after putting down <em>Blue Prince</em>.</p><p>The second reason is that <em>The Witness</em> actually has a full fan-made parody game called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985690/The_Looker/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1985690/The_Looker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Looker</em></a></span>, which is tailored made for people who both love and hate Thekla, inc’s<em> </em>puzzler.

It’s a space exploration game that offers you enormous freedom as you dive deep into every corner of the solar system. Just like <em>Blue Prince</em>, the key here is to gather information as you piece together solutions to puzzles and the history of the civilization that came before you. You’ll even split your game time between “runs” of <em>Outer Wilds</em> just as each in-game day marks a new beginning in <em>Blue Prince</em>, even if the context is a bit different between the two.</p><p>I could say more, but fans of this one have made it very clear that the first rule of talking about <em>Outer Wilds</em> is that you don’t talk about <em>Outer Wilds </em>until all parties involved have finished it. So I recommend you play <em>Outer Wilds</em> to ensure that you can enjoy <em>Outer Wilds</em> related conversations in the future.</p><hr><h2 id="h62830"><a id=""></a>4: <em>Inscryption</em></h2><p>If <em>Blue Prince </em>was the moment you realized you like roguelikes, you should know that there are enough good games in the genre for you to play for, conservatively speaking, the next 8000 years. But if I had to pick just one to recommend, then know that you can’t go wrong with <em>Inscryption</em>.</p><p>At first glance, <em>Inscryption </em>isa card battler a la <em>Slay the Spire</em> and countless others. But as is the case with anything made by the guy who gave us <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pony-island-is-one-seriously-twisted-game-1751138242&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pony-island-is-one-seriously-twisted-game-1751138242"><em>Pony Island</em></a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-murder-mystery-where-the-suspects-are-different-video-1829121840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-murder-mystery-where-the-suspects-are-different-video-1829121840"><em>Hex</em></a></span>, there’s something much more sinister (and metatextual) lurking beneath the surface. </p><p>You can actually find the creator of <em>Inscryption</em> endorsing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1569580/Blue_Prince/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Blue Prince</em></a></span> directly on the game’s Steam Page—he’s even listed in the Special Thanks section of the credits! Even if that’s a <em>very</em> tenuous connection between these two games, I’m sure <em>Blue Prince</em>’s creator would be very happy if you enjoyed the rich atmosphere of <em>Inscryption</em> too.</p><hr><h2 id="h62831"><a id=""></a>5: <em>Animal Well</em></h2><p>I’ve done my best to avoid the term “Metroidbrainia” so far, but <em>Animal Well</em> makes that task impossible. It’s a literal puzzle-focused Metroidvania that rewards out-of-the-box thinking, and you may even find yourself taking notes as you venture deeper into this game’s depths.</p><p><br>Where it gets especially <em>Blue Prince</em>-esque is in its layered design. Getting to the credits in <em>Animal Well</em> is a great accomplishment, but you’ll also see the signs leading you to dig deeper into the game’s secrets. And the more you peel away at each of the game’s layers, you’ll continue to find devious puzzles and new tools that will change the way you look at the sidescrolling world. <em>Animal Well</em> probably won’t occupy over a hundred hours of your time in the way Dogubomb’s game does. But if you’re eager for another rabbit hole to fall into, you’ll have a great time with this.  </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/games-like-blue-prince-roguelike-puzzle-inscryption-1851785833]]></content:encoded>

With few games at release and no backwards compatibility, each new critically acclaimed gem that got ported felt like a special event. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-impressions-launch-games-comparison-1851785748&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-impressions-launch-games-comparison-1851785748">That’s not the case with Switch 2</a></span>. Instead, new owners have access to a wealth of back catalog riches from the jump, including years of the best indie games just waiting to become their next handheld obsession. Here are the ones I think everyone should have.</p><p>Odds are, if you’re a veteran Switch owner who recently upgraded to Switch 2, you already have a few of these in your library. If you’re a hardcore indie fan, you might even have all of them. This isn’t a list of the <em>best</em> games available for Nintendo’s platform, or the best<em> indie</em> games, or even a list of my personal favorites.

It feels great, too, with the dodge and reload mechanics giving it a rewarding tactile quality you don’t always get in this type of arcade mashup.

Think of it as summer reading. It combines interesting storytelling that subverts genre expectations with an incredible soundtrack and novel turn-based combat mechanics.

The rub is that every time you lose you can keep your surviving mech pilot and send them back in time to start a new run. It’s like <em>Front Mission</em> meets <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>, where using the geography to your advantage is as important as the skills and weapons you outfit your squad with.

However, unless you were too busy watching Nintendo Directs or haven’t looked at the in-game manual on the main menu, you’ve probably been sleeping on a really neat tool that <em>Mario Kart World </em>added to your driving repertoire. In light of this, let’s take a look at what the new Rewind command does, as well as how to use it to significantly improve the single player experience.</p><figure id="" data-id="eaead72ae983b42cb1e32cb8b9746ab4" data-recommend-id="image://eaead72ae983b42cb1e32cb8b9746ab4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from Mario Kart World.

Straightforward, right?</p><p>Well, there are a <em>few </em>nuances to how exactly Rewind works—The Dry Bones is in the details, as they say. For instance, <strong>Rewind doesn’t rewind the entire game when it’s used, just your driver’s position</strong>. So if you’re first in a race and you get hit by a red shell that knocks you into 24th place, you’ll still be in 24th even after using Rewind. In fact, you’ll be even <em>worse </em>off, as Rewind will just make your opponents’ leads even greater. </p><p>Rewind will also generally maintain your driver’s momentum from the moment you pressed Rewind, as opposed to resetting it to whatever state your driver was in at the point you Rewind to. To put that in simple terms, if you were going top speed and got hit with a red shell, you’ll still have to accelerate to reach top speed again even if you go back to the moment before you were hit with the shell. Conversely, if you <em>were </em>at your driver’s top speed at the time you press Rewind, you’ll be going just as fast as you were before hitting the Rewind button.</p><p><strong>Just keep in mind that Rewind is <em>completely incompatible </em>with Drifting.</strong> You can’t initiate a Rewind during a Drift, and you can’t rewind into a Drift either. If you’re in the middle of a race, make sure to think twice about using Rewind if you just finished turning a sharp corner.</p><h2 id="h90604"><a id=""></a>How to best use Rewind in<em> Mario Kart World</em></h2><p>This is starting to sound like a list of inconveniences. You might be wondering exactly <em>how </em>Rewind can realistically help you out in <em>Mario Kart World</em>. While this isn’t all-inclusive, there are two use cases where using Rewind can save you a lot of time and frustration.</p><p><strong>The first and most obvious use of Rewind is in Free Roam mode</strong>. There are several “?” Panels and Peach Medallions that require tricky jumps to reach, and setting those maneuvers up can take time. Normally, failing a huge leap means repeating all that driving around to return to your original vantage point. <strong>By using Rewind, you can easily undo your mistake and give it another shot in seconds.</strong> Rewind is equally helpful when you accidentally fall from a high place in a map that’d normally take a handful of minutes to return to!</p><figure id="" data-id="c0de6d67cf9f0078494bfaf71ee026a5" data-recommend-id="image://c0de6d67cf9f0078494bfaf71ee026a5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gif of Mario Kart World gameplay.

Waluigi is shown getting rewound to avoid the impact of a Blue Shell." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The second reason you might want to Rewind is that <strong>it can make you impervious to Blue Shells</strong>. That’s right, as long as you’re in the middle of the Rewind animation, items and other racers can’t hurt you until it’s over. So when a Blue Shell is hanging over your head, a well-timed Rewind will completely circumvent the blast and preserve whatever item you were holding onto at the time.</p><p>You of course will still lose ground because of the way Rewind inherently works, and a Rewind <em>after </em>you get hit won’t do anything for you. Still, if you’ve hit your top speed and you’re on a straightaway, a quick Rewind won’t set you back as much as letting a shell smack you.</p><p>This isn’t all-inclusive of how Rewind can help, but once you realize these tricks exist, you’ll learn to really love this button.

Holly manor. Sold for 32 Gold in the Armory, the Axe lets you nullify the Gem cost of one room forever.

It awards a luxurious eight Gems as a prize, but you have to consume <em>five</em> Gems just to draft it. Sure, a net gain of three Gems is nice, but the high cost of entry means you’d have a healthy reserve of Gems coming in here anyway. Even worse, you run a huge risk of drawing this room when you can’t afford to draft it, making the Trophy Room actively harmful to your room deck.</p><p><strong>The Axe single-handedly transforms the Trophy Room from a liability to the best room in the game.</strong> Removing the Gem cost means you’ll grab all eight gems with no consequence, which is more than enough to draft any room you’d see afterwards. The Trophy Room isn’t a Dead End either, giving it a leg up over rooms like the Wine Cellar. This is a Rare room by default, so you won’t necessarily catch it every run. Regardless, you don’t want to pass up this huge upgrade.</p><hr><h2 id="h60779"><a id="2"></a>Attic</h2><figure id="" data-id="7c1330aeaf9e4681b8dd96b2281c20ed" data-recommend-id="image://7c1330aeaf9e4681b8dd96b2281c20ed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from the Directory menu in Blue Prince.

The Attic is selected." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Even though it’s a Dead End room, the Attic offers enormous value to any run of <em>Blue Prince</em>. It contains <em>eight</em> items, which can include Gems, Keys, Dice, or major finds like rare keys or tools like the Metal Detector. The Attic is so valuable that you’ll often earn back the three Gems you’d normally need to spend drafting it!</p><p>By removing the Gem cost from the Attic, you’ll ensure you can draft this room at any point during your run. After all, it’s when you <em>don’t</em> have a healthy stock of resources to spend that you’ll really want to find an Attic! And even if you’re on a great run, keeping three extra Gems in your pocket is always nice. This is a room you’ll be dying to use regardless of where you are in your overall progression of <em>Blue Prince</em>, making it a safe use of your Axe.</p><hr><h2 id="h60780"><a id="3"></a>Cloister</h2><figure id="" data-id="aa81b166a2156a1bc4e9779538bca0c4" data-recommend-id="image://aa81b166a2156a1bc4e9779538bca0c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Dogubomb / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aa81b166a2156a1bc4e9779538bca0c4" data-recommend-id="image://aa81b166a2156a1bc4e9779538bca0c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Cloister is a great compliment to the Attic since it serves the opposite purpose: adding a bunch of extra doorways to your house. You’ll likely find items in the Cloister too, since it’s a Green Room with spots you can dig up with a shovel. Additionally, this room can grant some useful buffs if it comes up when you use an Upgrade Disk (such as chances to get permanent upgrades whenever you draft it). </p><p>You’ll always feel happy to see this outdoor reprieve in your draft pool, as it virtually guarantees you’re not going to hit a dead end to your run just yet. By removing the three-Gem cost, the Cloister will never be out of reach when you need it most.</p><hr><h2 id="h60781"><a id="4"></a>Rotunda</h2><figure id="" data-id="2d22f3bedc27004fe9ecaf01f32b43a3" data-recommend-id="image://2d22f3bedc27004fe9ecaf01f32b43a3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from the Directory menu in Blue Prince.

The Rotunda is selected." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Rotunda is here as an alternative to the Cloister. It <em>technically</em> offers the same amount of doorways the Cloister does, just with a slightly clunky gimmick of pressing a button in the center to switch which doors you can access. And when you’re drafting from the Rotunda, you’ll have the option to rotate any Rooms you draw. This isn’t <em>always</em> useful, but it can prevent certain rooms from leading you straight into a wall.</p><p><strong>In the unlikely event that you’re purchasing multiple Axes in a Curse Mode playthrough, the Rotunda <em>is</em> better than the Cloister since it’s classified as a Blueprint.</strong> Otherwise, the Rotunda mainly beats out the Cloister in the event that you didn’t get one of the more helpful upgrades for it.</p><hr><h2 id="h60782"><a id="5"></a>Vault</h2><figure id="" data-id="3a5da6c855d962ed69e22bf6e94a78d6" data-recommend-id="image://3a5da6c855d962ed69e22bf6e94a78d6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from the Directory menu in Blue Prince.

The Vault is selected." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The value of the Vault depends on your overall progress in <em>Blue Prince</em>. In the early to mid-game, an infusion of 40 Gold is a really big deal, even at the cost of three Gems. That’s enough to potentially buy out an entire Commissary, and you’ll eventually need hundreds of Gold in a single run to purchase the game’s most expensive upgrades. That said, as your allowance grows, 40 Gold won’t look as impressive. And once you’ve bought the most expensive items in the game, Gold becomes a smaller priority to grind for.</p><p>However, the Vault is also home to critical clues you’ll need to solve several central mysteries in <em>Blue Prince</em>. To get these clues, you’ll need to find certain keys and bring them to the Vault during a single run. This is already an RNG-(Random-Number-Generated)-reliant task, so axing the Gem cost ensures you won’t get stuck when you <em>really</em> need to draft this room. Even with the diminishing returns as you play, that benefit alone can justify using one of your three Axes.</p><hr><h2 id="h60783"><a id="final"></a>Use the Axe on these rooms to make specific challenges easier</h2><p>These two rooms aren’t quite as useful during your average run of <em>Blue Prince</em>, but you might consider using the Axe on them if you’re solely focused on accomplishing certain objectives.</p><h3 id="h60784"><a id=""></a>Classroom</h3><figure id="" data-id="21b7c8b3c636454ec8a362aecc231eb9" data-recommend-id="image://21b7c8b3c636454ec8a362aecc231eb9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from the Directory menu in Blue Prince.

The Classroom is selected." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Classroom is mildly useful at best on its own, so cutting the single-Gem cost won’t add a lot of value most of the time. That said, if you’re gunning for a certain optional challenge, you’ll need to draft the Classroom <em>nine times</em> in a single run. You’ll already need a lot of luck to pull this off, and dedicating so much of your house to Classrooms doesn’t leave a lot of room for Gem grinding. By using the Axe on the Classroom, you’ll functionally save yourself nine Gems over the course of one attempt.</p><h3 id="h60785"><a id=""></a>Throne Room</h3><figure id="" data-id="9a28a5cc43f1c6b366871421724b4b96" data-recommend-id="image://9a28a5cc43f1c6b366871421724b4b96" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from Blue Prince.

As the ominous “Reclaim the crown” text implies, you’ll need this room for some significant story unlocks. The Throne Room also features three doorways and an elusive lever to Room 46, saving you from the long hike you’d normally need to do to open this room.</p><p>If you do use the Axe on the Throne Room, you’ll certainly make use of it whenever you happen to draft it. However, the Throne Room just doesn’t offer <em>that</em> much value compared to other rooms you could choose. You’ll get more doorways out of the Cloister or the Rotunda, and the Room 46 lever really isn’t <em>that</em> important by the time you’re likely to have this room in your deck. Still, for those key runs where you <em>specifically</em> need to get the Throne Room, the Gem cost reduction can come in clutch.</p><hr><p><br><em>Blue Prince</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.  </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/blue-prince-axe-best-rooms-gems-trophy-vault-rotunda-1851785822]]></content:encoded>
