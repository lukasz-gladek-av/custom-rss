He describes frustration with his own lack of upward momentum, as he was passed over for the role of <em>Dragon Age</em>’s creative director in favor of Mike Laidlaw. He says he was eventually won over by Laidlaw’s leadership and that the fantasy series benefited from it, but after he left the series to work on something else, things started to change.</p><p>Gaider asked to move on to something else within BioWare after <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>’s launch in 2014, and it was between either <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em> or “Dylan,” the game that would become <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964"><em>Anthem</em></a></span>, the studio’s ill-fated loot shooter. Opting to work on the latter, he says the experience illuminated tensions between the different BioWare teams and that he felt the <em>Anthem </em>team didn’t want him there.</p><p>“You see, the thing you need to know about BioWare is that for a long time it was basically two teams under one roof: the <em>Dragon Age</em> team and the <em>Mass Effect</em> team,” Gaider wrote. “Run differently, very different cultures, may as well have been two separate studios. And they didn’t get along. The company was aware of the friction and attempts to fix it had been ongoing for years, mainly by shuffling staff between the teams more often. Yet this didn’t really solve things, and I had no idea until I got to the Dylan team. The team didn’t want me there. At all.”</p><p>Gaider says that some of his conflict with the<em> Anthem</em> team came from higher-up instructions to write something more “science fantasy,” similar to <em>Star Wars</em>, whereas the original concept had been more of a “beer &amp; cigarettes” sci-fi world similar to <em>Aliens</em>. According to Gaider, he was frequently given feedback that his ideas were “too <em>Dragon Age</em>.”</p><p>“I won’t go into detail about the problems except to say it became clear this was a team that didn’t want to make an RPG,” Gaider wrote. “Were very anti-RPG, in fact. Yet they wanted me to wave my magic writing wand and create a BioWare quality story without giving me any of the tools I’d need to actually do that.”</p><p>After it became clear that that the project wasn’t a good fit for him, Gaider told BioWare’s bosses that he’d stick with it if there was some kind of promotion on the other side, and when he was turned down, he quit and went on to co-found Summerfall Studios. The studio’s first game, <em>Stray Gods</em>, is a musical game following a modern version of the Greek god pantheon.

Small Black business come ups are always the move. </p><p>On the other hand, the first episode of “Live,” which aired Thursday evening (April 10), is so irrepressibly awful, I won’t know how to explain it to the aliens when they come. It was so terrible, the only reason I turned it back on after shutting it off after the first 12 minutes is to write this piece intelligently.</p><p>The show is a fusillade of f***kery that manages to do everything, everywhere wrong, all at once. The problems start with celebrity host Yvonne Orji, who is meant to bring her irreverent,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theroot.com/yvonne-orji-gets-honest-about-the-pent-up-energy-of-b-1850996498&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theroot.com/yvonne-orji-gets-honest-about-the-pent-up-energy-of-b-1850996498"> virginal</a></span> humor to the proceedings, but most of her “jokes” land like a fart in church. In contrast, Amuli is happy allowing her contestants to deliver the personality on her “PTB,” limiting her flair to a cute lil’ mic twirl and that shimmy she does when she lands a match.</p><p>Then, there’s the cast of singles, who are all well-dressed and range from decently to preternaturally attractive. A significant aspect of O.G. “PTB’s” charm is that several of its contestants look like they either rolled out of bed to come to the show or their friends should be arrested for allowing them to go on camera dressed as they are. And they <em>damn</em> sure don’t all look like they had modeling contracts at some point.</p><p>There’s also the jocular tone of the whole proceedings — as if no one is <em>really </em>there to find a boo and it’s all for play-play. The several reality TV stars ruin the whole damn thing: The first single guy is a jackwagon named Johnny Bananas who was on MTV’s “The Real World” and who goes out of his way to be the most inauthentic human being next to the guy whose job it is to maintain President Donald Trump’s hair.</p><p>So many other aspects of “Live” just don’t hit. The post-round “confessionals.” The live audience and Orji responding to every <em>single</em> balloon pop. The vibe that everyone is there for exposure — which, in fairness, is a staple of the O.G. “PTB,” where 85 percent of the participants are “entrepreneurs.”</p><p>“Live” is yet another example of an authentically Black product getting in the hands of folks with money who bastardize and gentrify it to a pulp. It’s like what would happen if “Verzuz,” the beloved pandemic-era music competition which featured Black artists in every episode, pitted Taylor Swift against Katy Perry.</p><p>In fact, the racial dynamics on “Live” are cringy out the gate: One of the non-Black women pops on Bananas and says, “My physical type is Black,” to which he, a white boy, responds, “I’m Black from the waist up.” And there’s the blondest woman on the panel “rapping” and gyrating while insisting she grew up in Michigan listening to…Chingy. (So, “Right Thurr” on repeat her whole childhood?) Also, the spirit of Dr. Umar Johnson flowed through me every time a white woman popped on a Black male single.</p><p>We simply don’t have to worry about this shit on Amuli’s “Pop the Balloon.”</p><p>Arguably, the O.G. “Pop The Balloon” isn’t actually good <em>for </em>Black folks in how it lays bare the interminable, tired 50-50, “what-do-you-bring-to-the-table”-head ass conversations — that’s a discussion for a different rant. But there’s something charming about the low budget, somewhat ratchet nature of Amuli’s version: The whole thing looks like its shot on a Samsung Galaxy phone and paid for with a few orders of Zaxby’s, and we love it.</p><p>Fortunately, Amuli will continue her Wednesday YouTube show, hopefully maintaining the stripped-down, all Black vibe with which we fell in love. Because my guess is, with the seemingly universal early disdain for “Pop The Balloon Live,” it’s gonna go the route of the “Good Times” Netflix “remake” very damn soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
