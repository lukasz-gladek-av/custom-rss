              <p>I love this new YouTube video that uses mods to recreate the life of an NPC citizen of Gotham City in <a href="https://kotaku.com/batman-arkham-knight-the-kotaku-re-review-1791829083"><em>Batman: Arkham Knight</em></a> because it lets me experience something I’ve always thought about: What it must be like to live in the same place as a superhero.</p> <p>Living in Gotham City, the urban sprawl that superhero crimefighter Batman calls home, must be wild. Going out to grab something from the nearby convenience store could lead to you getting a front row seat for Batman’s next gang fight. Or he might just run past your window in the middle of the night. Or worse, he could run you over with his Batmobile-tank that is totally nonlethal, okay? And that’s what you get in <a href="https://youtu.be/UCosPe2ispc">Gaming with Griff Griffin’s new short but sweet<em> Batman: Arkham Knight</em> video</a>.</p>

  <p>My favorite moments from Griff’s video are when it really does feel like you’re seeing things from the perspective of a random Gotham City resident who just so happens to catch a glimpse of Batman. I imagine with a city as big as Gotham, not everyone has seen Batman, so it’s likely a treat for those who do. Or maybe scary as hell? Probably a bit of both.</p> <p>“Essentially, I modded <em>Batman: Arkham Knight</em> to ‘take control’ of pedestrians in Gotham, and see what Batman looks like from their perspective,” Griff explained to <em>Kotaku</em> in an email. The creator has also made a video presenting things from the point of view of the gang members Batman beats up in the games, <a href="https://youtu.be/yxYtpuc97eY">in case you’re curious about that experience</a>. It is a far more terrifying way to encounter the Dark Knight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, Ubisoft announced it was canceling numerous games and laying off more employees as part of a brutal restructuring of the entire company. It turns out even Ubisoft’s super successful <a href="https://kotaku.com/after-four-years-a-just-dance-streamer-hits-the-breaki-1828839468"><em>Just Dance</em></a> franchise isn’t immune to the company squeezing everything it can for more money, as Ubisoft has confirmed price increases are coming for the dancing series.</p> <p>On January 27, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3MdXqG1y9GD3DvMr1Sf8OD?">Ubisoft announced</a> that its Just Dance+ streaming service, which allows people to pay a monthly or yearly fee to access a large catalog of new, old, and exclusive songs, is getting a price hike in April.</p> <p>One month of Just Dance+ will soon cost $5. Previously, it was $4. Three months of the service is going up in price from $10 to $13. And finally, a full year of Just Dance+ will increase from $25 to $30.</p>

 <h2>Why Just Dance+ is getting a price increase this April</h2> <p>In a press release announcing the price changes, Ubisoft claimed costly song licensing agreements were behind the increase in subscription fees.</p> <p><span><span lang="EN-GB">“Just Dance+ is built around music, and that comes with some important truths,” said Ubisoft. “Every song available in the service relies on licensing agreements that evolve over time, and these conditions directly affect what we can keep, renew, or add to the catalogue. Taking this into account, we’ve had to make a few adjustments to ensure the service can keep growing in the long run.”</span></span></p>

 <p>As for Ubisoft’s massive restructure, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-stock-restructure-layoffs-cancel-delay-2000662684">some employees aren’t convinced it will bring about the positive change the company needs</a>. Ubisoft has done <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-skull-bones-delay-assassins-creed-far-cry-cuts-1849975925">this sort of thing before,</a> but the shake-up of two years ago has failed to turn the company’s fortunes around. It’s lost the overwhelming majority of its value in the past eight years and is now relying on a <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796">$1.25 billion bailout from Tencent</a> to keep the lights on. With that in mind, it makes sense that Just Dance+ is getting a price bump. Ubisoft leadership is looking around for any place to save some cash or squeeze out some more money. If people want their songs, they’ll be paying a bit more this spring.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over the weekend, the nation witnessed federal officers wrestle a man to the ground and <a href="https://www.startribune.com/heres-what-to-know-about-federal-agents-killing-of-alex-pretti-in-south-minneapolis/601570797">shoot him roughly 10 times</a> on a busy street in Minneapolis, Minnesota. The shocking killing, which came just weeks after President Trump threatened the state with a “day of reckoning and retribution,” has sparked a growing backlash against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, otherwise known as ICE, including from the voice of PlayStation’s Spider-Man.</p> <p>“We must speak out against injustice,” actor Yuri Lowenthal said in <a href="https://www.instagram.com/yurilowenthal/reel/DT7AxWNDGHd/">a recent Instagram video</a>. “I know that this is not new for large swathes of the American people but every day that we stay silent, it makes it easier for them to shoot us in the streets and round us up and genocide entire people. We must speak out and we have to take care of each other. I implore you, if you are an American citizen, call your senators every day next week and tell them ‘no more money for ICE.’ We will not stand for it.”</p>   <p>Lowenthal has played Peter Parker in each of Insomniac Games’ <em>Spider-Man</em> releases, and is seemingly set to return for an eventual, <a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-3-has-plenty-of-ways-to-bring-back-venom-1850976956">unannounced <em>Spider-Man 3</em></a>, plans for which <a href="https://kotaku.com/insomniac-hack-wolverine-ps5-spider-man-3-venom-sony-1851120403">leaked back in 2023</a>. His plea to fans and fellow Americans comes as the death of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/868567/alex-pretti-minneapolis-childhood-friend?view_token=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpZCI6IktWYlQ1a1F1ZUUiLCJwIjoiL3BvbGljeS84Njg1NjcvYWxleC1wcmV0dGktbWlubmVhcG9saXMtY2hpbGRob29kLWZyaWVuZCIsImV4cCI6MTc2OTk2NDA1NSwiaWF0IjoxNzY5NTMyMDU1fQ.FrZ0NlULSpVamKAg761dJTzxcH4-LkVYlrvVVZb2ZFc&amp;utm_medium=gift-link">37-year-old Alex Pretti</a> at the hands of masked agents has put pressure on lawmakers to block an increase in funding for ICE. Judicial scrutiny of ICE’s actions in the state has culminated in the acting head being summoned to appear in court this week <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/27/ice-director-judge-minnesota">or risk being held in contempt</a>.</p>

 <p>“The more we stay silent to try and shore up a failing illusion of normalcy, the more we trade pieces of our soul and the easier we make it for them to shoot us in the street,” Lowenthal wrote on Instagram. “Call your reps every day this week. Tell them how furious you are, how scared you are, and that they must speak out against what’s happening. The simple message they need to hear is ‘no more money for ICE’.”</p> <p>ICE, which didn’t exist until 2002, was <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/01/21/nx-s1-5674887/ice-budget-funding-congress-trump">recently awarded a $75 billion funding increase</a> on top of its existing annual budget of $10 billion. Top Border Patrol official Gregory Bovino wrote over the weekend that the real victims in Pretti’s killing <a href="https://x.com/CMDROpAtLargeCA/status/2015535669175541906">were the agents</a>.</p>
