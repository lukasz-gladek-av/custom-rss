              <p><span>Blizzard finally </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-persona-5-skins-crossover-mercy-genji-joker-2000625739"><span>unveiled the five </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>collaboration skins</span></a><span> it‚Äôs bringing to </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> yesterday, and as </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>fans tend to do, they had a pretty wide spread of reactions. When you have 44 heroes, it‚Äôs impossible to spread love across them equally, and it can get pretty irritating if your favorite never seems to get any love in the form of skins and other cosmetics. It‚Äôs especially grating when </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>seems to favor a specific handful of characters with each event or collaboration. While support hero Kiriko, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-kiriko-mercy-venture-reaper-season-12-skins-1851626893"><span>the face of this issue</span></a><span>, wasn‚Äôt included in the </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>skins, the collaboration still hasn‚Äôt gone over well with some fans who feel that heroes like Genji and Mercy are getting preferential treatment, or are disappointed that some seemingly obvious crossovers didn‚Äôt manifest.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">drew junkrat skull and dva oracle earlier cause I'm hyped for the collab hehe ‚ö°<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OverwatchFanart?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#OverwatchFanart</a>‚Äã <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Persona5?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Persona5</a>‚Äã <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Overwatch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Overwatch2</a> <a href="https://t.co/6XOAOfgPgl">pic.twitter.com/6XOAOfgPgl</a></p> <p>‚Äî Souda (@lemonsoudaa) <a href="https://twitter.com/lemonsoudaa/status/1967625308129112547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Surprisingly, the most contentious skin in the </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>event seems to be Genji as Ryuji. Genji makes a lot of sense for the collaboration, given that he‚Äôs one of </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>‚Äôs Japanese heroes, and his katana would make him a pretty natural fit for someone like Yusuke, who also uses a sword in the RPGs. Ryuji, however, is a bit of an odd pick. The track star is the tank of </span><i><span>Persona 5</span></i><span>‚Äôs team, and uses blunt melee weapons in fights, such as bats and pipes. When Genji wears the skin based on the Phantom Thief, his katana is replaced by Ryuji‚Äôs base lead pipe, which, yeah, I mean, that‚Äôs a melee weapon, I guess, but you don‚Äôt slash people with a pipe the same way Genji does when he uses his katana in his ultimate attack.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The choice is even more questionable considering that some fans feel Junkrat, the grenade-launching DPS hero and often forgotten member of the original roster, would have made a better fit, and had been speculating and hoping that he would get the Ryuji treatment. He has Ryuji‚Äôs blonde hair, the two have both suffered leg injuries that leave them with a distinct limp, and Ryuji is often a goofy comic relief character whose mannerisms would have worked well in a Junkrat highlight intro.</span></p>

D.Va, the mech-piloting tank, got a skin based on the student council president Makoto. It has some cool details, like her mech being based on Johanna, Makoto‚Äôs motorcycle-shaped Persona, but </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>also has a character who would have fit D.Va‚Äôs gamer theme: Futaba. The support character in </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>is a bit of a recluse. She‚Äôs extremely online and has to be dragged out of her bedroom to be social half the time, but she is always dropping gamer jokes and memes into casual conversation. D.Va pilots a mech because she was a pro gamer who uses her transferable skills to defend South Korea, so the comparisons are pretty apparent, especially because Futaba also pilots her own Persona like a mech. Still, some fans argue that adapting Johanna‚Äôs design for D.Va‚Äôs mech was an interesting creative choice.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">yeah makoto! you remember the character in persona 5 who spoke in gamer lingo and spent most of her time in mementos in a mech like persona and had  heavy ties to technology in most of the phantom thieves? right? <a href="https://t.co/tPb2pIZfgF">https://t.co/tPb2pIZfgF</a></p> <p>‚Äî * (@star_piIot) <a href="https://twitter.com/star_piIot/status/1967634520720675158?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">blizzard if they used more than 5 percent of their brain  and actually played persona 5 <a href="https://t.co/En7AyTA9bL">https://t.co/En7AyTA9bL</a> <a href="https://t.co/2OJdKvSzKy">pic.twitter.com/2OJdKvSzKy</a></p> <p>‚Äî Jonathan (@JonathanFess) <a href="https://twitter.com/JonathanFess/status/1967756280862499250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">this is a good choice when you look at the mecha</p> <p>yall just dont have imagination <a href="https://t.co/HUExUNV2yz">https://t.co/HUExUNV2yz</a></p> <p>‚Äî AUZZIE ‚úàÔ∏è NYCC (@auzziejlee) <a href="https://twitter.com/auzziejlee/status/1967638175226138773?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The blizzard dev scrolling past your post <a href="https://t.co/NwVHVKmuAK">https://t.co/NwVHVKmuAK</a> <a href="https://t.co/kzjiCO716i">pic.twitter.com/kzjiCO716i</a></p> <p>‚Äî Frankiep423 (@frankiep423) <a href="https://twitter.com/frankiep423/status/1967745502306586881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>If you go looking, you‚Äôll find a lot of ideas fans had for the collaboration before Blizzard revealed the skins.

Ultimately, when Blizzard teases something weeks before revealing it, fans just have more time to imagine the perfect collaboration in their heads and be disappointed in whatever follows, and that disappointment is only exacerbated when there are already perceptions of favoritism. R.I.P. Ryuji Junkrat, though. A real missed opportunity, that one.</span></p>

              <p>Pok√©mon cards. If it ain‚Äôt a story about <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/target-removes-trading-cards-from-stores-after-violent-incident-with-gun.html">sudden acts of intimidation and threats of violence</a> over them, then it‚Äôs probably one about scalpers and reselling. Thankfully, no one got hurt (physically) this time as the Mega Evolution Phantasmal Flames Elite Trainer Box (ETB), Booster Display Box, and Booster Bundle all sold out during their pre-order sale yesterday, with significant amounts of them going to folks who have no interest in actually using them to play the game. And they went <i>fast</i>. Some fans were lucky enough to still get through and lay claim to sets of their own, but the sting of seeing exorbitant listings on reselling sites still sucks.</p> <p>Expected to arrive on November 14, 2025, pre-orders for the latest <i>Pok√©mon </i>card game expansion went up <a href="https://x.com/PokemonRestocks/status/1967620548051218478">yesterday, September 15, 2025</a>, and, predictably, were sold out within 15 minutes (<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/pokemon-tcg-phantasmal-flames-etbs-ebay-for-extortionate-prices/">h/t <i>The Gamer</i></a>). And no, these very pretty-looking cards will not be finding homes with eager fans hoping to add them to their collections. Sadly, scalpers have filled eBay with pre-order listings for the new cards. Some are set at around normal prices, but a significant number of these listings are selling the cards for five times the retail price, hovering around $300, if not more in some cases.</p> <p>Scalpers didn‚Äôt soak up all the fun, however. On social media, many are <a href="https://x.com/ReyGambino_/status/1967626696045269047">celebrating a win</a> with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/camyoin.bsky.social/post/3lyven5lodk2x">screenshots of successful pre-orders</a> of the new cards. That said, others ran into queue issues, getting bounced after only waiting for a short time, or in some cases, <a href="https://x.com/texasboy1060569/status/1967620858714992652">making it to checkout</a>, only to be bounced back in line. Others who made it to checkout were <a href="https://x.com/ChrisMulea96895/status/1967622801319424323">greeted by a mysterious ‚ÄúError 17‚Äù</a> that then sent them back into the queue. Others hopelessly suffered as <a href="https://x.com/josejmurillo/status/1967624598754939237">they got bounced around in line</a> after multiple captcha checks to validate whether they were human or not.</p> <p>Adorned with a healthy splash of color, clearly the new Mega Charizard X ex is one of the main appeals of the new cards, along with Mega Gengar. I‚Äôm also really digging the moody, dark card sleeves. Shame that so few people will be buying them at normal prices any time soon.</p>
