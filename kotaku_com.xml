            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tina Romero, the daughter of the late filmmaker and creator of the modern zombie, <a href="https://kotaku.com/that-time-george-romero-almost-directed-a-resident-evil-1766259870">George A. Romero</a>, is making her directorial debut with, appropriately enough, a movie all about an invasion of the undead. But <em>Queens of the Dead</em> shakes up the formula by having the zombies attack an NYC party featuring drag queen performers and their friends.</p> <p><em>Queens of the Dead</em> is a new horror comedy mixing together drag queens and zombies, and it’s set to hit theaters in October. The first look at this upcoming flick is out now, and the movie looks fun. It also looks like a movie that might greatly upset and confuse your conservative grandpa, who loves Fox News. Here’s the trailer:</p>  <p>The new movie stars the always excellent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katy_O%27Brian">Katy O’Brian</a>, Nina West, Jack Haven, and others, and looks to split its action between a group of clubgoers and drag queens stuck in a warehouse party, and the happenings at a hospital in New York City during the zombie uprising. After watching this trailer, I’m on board for this spin on the classic zombie movie. It’s also great to see Romero continuing her father’s legacy of making zombie movies that aren’t just gory and scary, but also filled with characters and ideas that feel extremely relevant. Romero’s iconic horror movie, <em>Night of the Living Dead,</em> essentially created modern-day zombies, or ghouls as he often called them, and laid out the basic framework most zombie movies follow: People stuck in a place fight back the dead while dealing with each other.</p> <p>Here’s the official description for the film courtesy of IFC Films:</p> <blockquote><p>When a zombie apocalypse breaks out in Brooklyn on the night of a giant warehouse party, an eclectic group of drag queens, club kids, &amp; frenemies must put aside their drama and use their unique skills to fight against the brain-thirsty, scrolling undead.</p></blockquote> <p>In 2025, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/surprise-press-conference-reveals-trump-still-not-dead-2000622401">President Trump</a> and <a href="https://translegislation.com/">other Republicans cracking down on LGBTQ people</a> and anything they deem “different,” a movie about a horde of nasty zombies trying to destroy a safe place for drag queens and queer folk seems pretty dang perfect. I’d bet George would be proud of his daughter’s first theatrical film. Before this, she had done TV and smaller projects. I’m excited to check out <em>Queens of the Dead</em> when it arrives in theaters on October 24. Just in time for Halloween.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-steam-library-valve-discord-radicalization-2000626897</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/report-charlie-kirk-shooter-suspect%E2%80%99s-steam-gaming-history-under-review-by-secret-service.1302006/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It didn’t take long after law enforcement officials publicly identified a <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-helldivers-bullet-engraving-2000625439">suspect in the Charlie Kirk assassination</a> for people online to begin combing the internet looking for his digital footprint. One of the profiles they found appeared to be his Steam account which, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-18/suspected-kirk-shooter-s-gaming-history-probed-by-secret-service?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true">according to <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, is now being investigated by the Secret Service.</p> <p>That’s because 22-year-old Tyler Robinson, who was charged earlier this week with murdering Kirk at a speaking event last week, reportedly used Donald Trump’s name as an alias on the Valve-owned gaming storefront at one point. Sources told <em>Bloomberg</em> the reference to the president is what led to the Secret Service’s involvement despite the Homeland Security agency having no role in protecting Kirk at the time of the assassination.</p> <p>The Steam account many believe to belong to Robinson shows thousands of hours spent playing games like <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em>, and <em>Counter-Strike</em>. The handful of public Steam reviews he seemingly authored were indistinct from the thousands of others posted for those games. People have also been combing through his apparent Steam inventory, which includes hats, trading cards, and other unlockables.</p>

 <p>Steam is among those gaming-affiliated internet platforms <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-discord-politics-helldivers-memes-2000626029">which have been called to Congress</a> next month to testify about online radicalization. The CEOs from Twitch, Discord, and Reddit have also been asked to participate. Despite a reference to <em>Helldivers 2</em> appearing on one of the casings left behind near the crime scene, there’s been little publicly disclosed evidence so far that gaming, memes, or any other part of the modern internet played much of a role in driving Robinson to allegedly assassinate the right wing podcaster.</p> <p>“The politically motivated assassination of Charlie Kirk claimed the life of a husband, father, and American patriot. In the wake of this tragedy, and amid other acts of politically motivated violence, Congress has a duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence,” House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.)&nbsp;<a href="https://oversight.house.gov/release/chairman-comer-invites-ceos-of-discord-steam-twitch-and-reddit-to-testify-on-radicalization-of-online-forum-users/">announced on Wednesday</a>.</p> <p>But <a href="https://www.kenklippenstein.com/p/exclusive-leaked-messages-from-charlie">leaked Discord chats and interviews</a> with friends have so far offered little that would suggest Robinson’s history with gaming and the internet were uniquely worrying, or different from those of most other people his age.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Today, </span><i><span>Dead by Daylight</span></i><span> fans noticed that developer Behaviour Interactive is </span><a href="https://www.bhvr.com/poste/senior-full-stack-programmer/"><span>hiring for a Senior Full-stack Programmer</span></a><span> at the team’s Montreal and Toronto studios. The person hired would work with the team’s “Generative AI Research Team,” with a directive to work on “researching, developing, and integrating innovative solutions using generative AI.” Fans saw “generative AI” and assumed that this might mean that the online asymmetrical horror game would be filled with generative AI assets in a future update. However, Behaviour has publicly spoken out about these claims, saying that it isn’t the case.</span></p> <p><span>In a post on X, Behaviour responded to a post speculating that the hired programmer would be working on </span><i><span>Dead by Daylight</span></i><span>, clarifying that this position is entirely dedicated to improving the company’s workflow using AI, rather than creating anything that will show up in the game itself.</span></p> <p><span>“We have a very firm policy that prevents the inclusion of anything generated by AI in </span><i><span>Dead by Daylight</span></i><span> or any other game we’re working on, including marketing assets,” the post reads. “Yes, Behaviour is exploring the use of generative AI tools to improve internal workflows – not for anything that ships in our games. But our policy isn’t changing, and this job isn’t for a role on a game team.”</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have a very firm policy that prevents the inclusion of anything generated by AI in Dead by Daylight or any other game we're working on, including marketing assets.

However, some people still take issue with the company using generative AI </span><a href="https://x.com/RealDevDaNerd/status/1968714757566841206"><span>in any capacity</span></a><span>, or argue that this is a slippery slope that could lead to </span><a href="https://x.com/KorynsCorner/status/1968717956449202599"><span>implementing it elsewhere in the company</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Dead by Daylight</span></i><span> will enter its 37th “Chapter” on September 25, which will introduce The Krasue, a new Killer character </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pvnkster/video/7545926057501773076"><span>with an absolutely gnarly intro animation</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/remakes-popular-report-survey-fallout-3-eso-oblivion-2000626866</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-era-of-video-game-remakes-is-just-getting-started-new-report-finds.1301874/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I bet if you’re reading this post right now, you’ve played <a href="https://kotaku.com/all-video-game-remakes-remasters-best-2024-ff7-rebirth-1851728879">a remake or a remaster</a> of an old video game at some point in the last 12 months. According to a new survey of 1,500 other players, you’re not alone. A whopping 90 percent of respondents said they’d also played a modern revival of a classic game at some point in the last year. And how could you not? More and more keep coming out all of the time.</p> <p>The new data point comes from strategy and insights consultancy firm MTM, which this week published its “<a href="https://marketing.wearemtm.com/remakevsinnovate">Remake vs Innovate: Is the past the future of gaming?</a>” report (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/90-of-gamers-have-played-a-remake-or-remaster-finds-new-report"><em>Gamesindustry.biz</em></a>). It interviewed 750 players in the U.S. and 750 in the UK and found the overwhelming majority not only played remakes and remasters, but also often hadn’t played the games they were based on. About 67 percent said it was their preferred way to discover older games, and 85 percent said they’d never played the originals before.</p> <p>Some other results from the survey:</p> <ul> <li>Only 26 percent of players thought remakes or remasters could be priced the same as other games or the original versions, with the rest expecting them to be cheaper.</li> <li>About 60 percent thought 5-8 years is the ideal amount of time between versions. Only 11 percent thought 10 years or more was preferable.</li> <li>Only 31 percent found remasters or remakes “very appealing.”</li> </ul> <p>Trying to layer logic onto the gamer psyche is often a fool’s errand, but the takeaway from this one report at least appears to be that most people are actually okay with updating old games as long as they are 1) not too old and 2) sold for less. Apparently, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-remake-hbo-show-1851038633"><em>Last of Us Part II</em> remaster</a> that most of us mocked is actually exactly what some not insignificant cohort of players really want.</p>

 <h2>Why we’re about to get more remakes and remasters than ever</h2> <p>While MTM’s report suggests that many players aren’t outraged at the idea of getting spoon-fed old games like they’re new again, the sales success of releases like the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake, <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em>, and <em>Metal Gear Solid 3 Delta: Snake Eater</em> speak for themselves. And it’s easy to see why companies would want to glom onto this opening in the market.</p> <p>Remakes and remasters can be outsourced (Virtuos handled both <em>Oblivion</em> and <em>Snake Eater</em>), they help plug holes in ever-elongating release schedules (<em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> and <em>Fallout 5</em> are still nowhere in sight), and they offer newer studio teams a chance to familiarize themselves with a game’s design and development pipeline before jumping onto a new entry from scratch. Pulling the best-selling blockbusters of the past into the present is also one way to avoid the risks of taking a chance on a sequel or new IP.</p>

 <p>The results aren’t always cynical, either. Nightdive’s 2023 <a href="https://kotaku.com/system-shock-remake-playstation-xbox-1851331384"><em>System Shock </em>remake</a> was a faithful restoration of and update to an immersive sim classic that also made it playable for the first time on consoles. Few had a chance of rediscovering<em> Persona 3</em> on PS2 or PSP, but <a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927">last</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927">year’s remake</a> showed a whole new generation of players why some fans love it even more than <em>Persona 4</em> and <em>5</em>. Remakes and remasters have given <a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-3-remake-review-hd-2d-changes-quality-of-l-1851700918">no shortage of classic RPGs</a> that might otherwise feel borderline-archaic by today’s standards a second chance thanks to quality-of-life features that let you turn off random encounters or speed up combat.</p> <p>There are already way too many new games to keep up with. Giving me more reasons to check out an old one feels increasingly like a good thing.</p>
