            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-offloads-ps5-disc-edition-bundle-with-nba-2k26-now-cheaper-than-digital-model-alone-2000648079</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony has gone all-in on PlayStation 5 deals this year and it offers consoles in various configurations – standalone units with or without disc drives, plus curated bundles- all hitting record-low prices on Amazon. Rather than picking up a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5992/">PS5 Slim with disc drive for $449 (already down from à549), the smarter move is grabbing this bundle with NBA 2K26 at the identical price point</a>: You’re getting the PS5 Slim <em>Standard Edition</em> for well under its typical $549 tag with a brand-new AAA title thrown in at no additional cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5992/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Bundle Makes More Sense Than Buying Separately</h2>
<p>The value of this PlayStation 5 deal is clear when you look at the details. <strong>NBA 2K26 usually sells for $69.99 on its own</strong> and you’re also getting a $100 discount on the PS5 console with the free game. Sony rarely discounts its products this much and bundling a current sports title at no extra cost shows that the company wants to sell a lot during Black Friday. The <strong>bundle comes with the disc drive model</strong> which is important because you can buy used physical games, trade titles with friends, and watch 4K Blu-ray movies without being stuck with digital-only purchases.</p>
<p>The PS5 Slim in this bundle offers the same performance as the original PlayStation 5 but in a smaller size that fits better in entertainment centers: <strong>Sony reduced the volume and weight by about 30% compared to the launch model</strong> which makes it less noticeable next to your TV. The cooling system works well in the smaller design, keeping fan noise low during intense gaming.</p>



<p>The disc drive gives you more options than digital consoles do: Prices for physical games drop faster than for digital ones, especially during sales at stores like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy that compete on price. <strong>You can also borrow games from friends, rent games from libraries&nbsp;or sell games</strong> you’ve completed to recover some costs. The disc drive also plays <strong>4K Ultra HD Blu-ray discs,</strong> which makes your PS5 a functional media player for your physical movie collection.</p>
<p><strong>NBA 2K26 is the latest version in the basketball simulation</strong> <strong>series</strong> that consistently ranks among the best-selling sports games. The game has updated rosters, improved gameplay mechanics, and better visuals that leverage the PlayStation 5’s hardware. <em>MyCareer</em> mode allows you to create a custom player and guide them through an NBA career. MyTeam features card-collecting gameplay where you build your dream roster. The <strong>game also includes WNBA teams</strong> and street basketball modes with active online multiplayer that gets regular updates and seasonal content.</p>



<p>Performance on the PlayStation 5 elevates gaming experiences beyond last-generation consoles: <strong>Games load in seconds instead of minutes thanks to the custom SSD</strong> that reads data much faster than older consoles. <strong>Ray tracing provides realistic lighting</strong> and reflections in supported games and makes environments feel more lifelike. <strong>Frame rates can reach up to 120fps</strong> in compatible games if you have a display that supports those rates and allows smoother motion than standard 60fps gameplay.</p>
<p>The <strong>DualSense controller that comes with every PS5 adds haptic feedback and adaptive triggers</strong> that change how games feel. The haptic motors produce detailed vibrations, simulating different surfaces and textures, such as the feeling of raindrops or snow underfoot. Adaptive triggers offer different resistance levels, making drawing a bow feel different from pulling a gun trigger.</p>
<p>At $449 for the PlayStation 5 Slim with a disc drive and NBA 2K26, this bundle costs less than buying each part separately while offering full current-generation gaming features. Sony usually keeps PS5 prices solid outside major sales which makes this Black Friday offer a rare chance to get the console with a premium game at a price that won’t return until next year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fire TV Stick HD Gets a 49% Black Friday Cut as Amazon Stops Caring About the Price on This Streaming Device]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-takes-almost-half-off-its-fire-tv-stick-hd-selling-it-for-pennies-2000647772</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday officially kicks off tomorrow, but you don’t have to wait till then to start shopping and bagging discounts. There’s a ton going for less right now; we’re talking plenty of tech gadgets, kitchen appliances, smart home devices, plus entertainment options. Amazon is being the most generous of all retailers, as it’s offering up to 50% off its own devices!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5986/">Those looking to give their entertainment setup an upgrade should consider grabbing the latest Amazon Fire TV Stick HD, which is slashed by 49% right now.</a> It typically retails for $35, but the current discount drops the price to just $18. The offer is open to all shoppers (Prime and non-Prime members), but the discount and the stock won’t be around for long. Lock the drop in before the Black Friday rush hits.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5986/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tons of Free and Paid Content, In a Single Place</h2>
<p>The stick is tiny, but don’t let that fool you. It’s made for HD TVs, and lets you stream all your favorite content, whether it’s TV shows from the 90s or the latest crime thrillers in lifelike, detailed visuals that make every color pop in both dim and bright settings. Entertainment comes built right in. There’s support for all the popular streaming platforms (Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Peacock, and more), so you’ll never be out of content to watch. Binge the season 5 of Stranger Things on Netflix, and end the night with an episode of The Paper on Peacock to cool things down; all from a single place.</p>
<p>These platforms require subscriptions, though. Trying to cut back on those? No sweat. The stick also lets you access over 1 million free movies and TV episodes from ad-supported streaming apps like Prime Video, Tubi, Pluto TV, and more. Those who prefer live TV for a more cable-like feel can consider subscribing to platforms like Sling TV and YouTube TV. This way, you’ll also be able to keep an eye on what’s happening around the world, check the weather, and even watch live sports. Maybe get the day started with some worldly updates, and end it with an episode of your favorite series; the possibilities are endless. Support for music platforms like Amazon Music, Spotify, and Pandora makes it just as easy to listen to your favorite songs throughout the day without pulling your phone out, making it a true all-in-one entertainment device.</p>



<p>The stick comes with a remote for easy navigation, but for times you’re not in the mood to control it manually, you can just use your voice to command, and Alexa will answer. Ask it to launch shows, lower the volume, skip through a scene, and pause; without getting up from your couch. Fire TV Search also lets you find movies by actor, plot, and quotes, so you can also say something like “Alexa, show me the best horror shows of all time” or “Alexa, show me the latest Ryan Gosling movies” instead of getting lost scrolling through a huge library on your own.</p>
<p>To get started, all that you need to do is plug the Fire TV Stick HD directly into your HDTV or use the included HDMI extender. Plug it into a wall outlet, and connect to the internet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5986/">Follow the on-screen instructions to finish the setup. The latest Fire TV Stick HD was already quite affordable at $35, but you can now grab it for just $18 with Amazon’s Black Friday sale.</a> It’s the lowest we have seen it drop to in a long while, and at under $20, it’s practically a steal considering all the features you’re getting.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gaming laptops usually cost over $1,000 for basic performance and high-end models can easily reach $2,000 to $3,000 for complete gaming capabilities. However, this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/">Asus TUF gaming F16 laptop (RTX 4050, 512GB SSD, 16GB DDR5 RAM, Intel Core 5 chip) breaks this trend with a price of $749, down from $1,099</a>. This deal on Amazon for Black Friday <strong>offers real gaming hardware at an all-time low</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Best in Class GPU</h2>
<p>The <strong>Nvidia RTX 4050 laptop GPU with a maximum TGP of 115W delivers true 1080p gaming performance</strong> in modern games: It uses DLSS 3 technology to upscale images and keeps high frame rates while keeping visual quality intact. The ray tracing support creates realistic lighting effects in games like Cyberpunk 2077, Forza Motorsport and Control without slowing down frame rates, thanks to AI-assisted rendering.</p>
<p>The GPU can run esports titles such as Valorant, League of Legends and Counter-Strike <strong>at competitive frame rates over 144fps</strong>, matching the display’s refresh rate. Creative tasks like video editing, 3D modeling and AI image generation also benefit from GPU acceleration and greatly speed up rendering times compared to integrated graphics.</p>



<p>The I<strong>ntel Core 5 210H processor provides balanced power through an efficient hybrid design</strong> that includes performance and efficiency cores. This setup manages demanding tasks while conserving battery life and gaming sessions experience steady frame rates as the performance cores focus on game logic and physics, while efficiency cores handle background tasks without detracting from gameplay.</p>
<p>The <strong>16-inch FHD+ display has a 144Hz refresh rate and a 16:10 aspect ratio</strong>, and offers an immersive gaming experience through smooth motion that avoids the stuttering of standard 60Hz displays during fast actions. The taller ratio adds vertical space, which is useful for productivity tasks like coding, document editing, and web browsing, where having more vertical pixels reduces the need to scroll. The <strong>display achieves 100% sRGB color accuracy</strong> and ensures correct color representation for photo editing and other creative work beyond gaming.</p>



<p>The cooling system is equipped with <strong>Arc Flow Fans, four exhaust vents, five dedicated heat pipes, and anti-dust filters</strong> and keeps temperatures steady during long gaming sessions without too much noise. This thermal design prevents performance drops caused by overheating to ensure consistent frame rates during extended play. The <strong>anti-dust filter</strong> keeps internal dust build-up in check, which helps maintain cooling efficiency over time, extending the laptop’s lifespan compared to systems that quickly degrade in dusty conditions.</p>
<p>At $749, this Asus TUF laptop offers a great mix of true gaming performance and sturdy build, and at this price point, it offers outstanding value in the gaming laptop market.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-enters-chaos-mode-now-selling-galaxy-z-fold7-at-record-low-and-cheaper-than-old-fold6-2000648076</link>
            <guid>1366420</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung stands out with their folding smartphones and faces almost no direct competition from major manufacturers. After seven generations of improvements, the Galaxy Z Fold series has matured into a product category that Apple has yet to enter, despite ongoing rumors.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5609/">Currently priced at $1,657, down from $2,119, the 512GB Galaxy Z Fold7</a> is available at a record low on Amazon for Black Friday which makes this powerful productivity device more accessible than ever. The <strong>Z Flip7 also sees major discounts on Amazon</strong>&nbsp;but the Fold’s tablet-sized unfolded screen offers different use cases for users who want a pocketable alternative to laptops.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5609/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Expanded Design That Balances Size and Portability</h2>
<p>The <strong>wider cover display makes the Fold7 feel more like a traditional smartphone</strong> when closed and addresses past complaints that earlier models were too narrow for one-handed use. This increased width is closer to standard flagship phone dimensions and makes typing, browsing and using apps more comfortable without needing to unfold the device for simple tasks. The improved design encourages users to rely on the cover display for quick tasks instead of treating it as a backup when unfolding is inconvenient.</p>
<p>When unfolded, <strong>the 8-inch internal display creates a tablet-sized screen</strong> that allows for real multitasking with three apps visible at once. You can run email, a web browser, and messaging apps side-by-side, watch YouTube while browsing Twitter and responding to texts or follow recipe videos while taking notes and setting timers. This multitasking ability changes how tasks are completed by reducing the constant app switching that can disrupt workflow on traditional phones.</p>



<p>The <strong>200MP main camera is Samsung’s most ambitious camera</strong> technology to date on a folding phone, competing with flagship models that don’t have to deal with the challenges of hinges. The large sensor captures incredible detail, allowing for significant cropping while keeping clarity, so you can capture far-off subjects as clear close-ups without the limitations of optical zoom. The <em>Pro-Visual Engine</em> processes images using advanced computational photography techniques to analyze scenes, optimize exposure for different lighting conditions and apply smart enhancements that keep the natural look while increasing quality.</p>
<p>The customized <strong>Snapdragon 8 Elite processor</strong> (from Qualcomm) is designed specifically for Galaxy devices and delivers top performance with improved speeds and optimizations that enhance efficiency. This powerful processor can handle demanding games, 4K video editing, and heavy multitasking without overheating or draining the battery like lesser models. What’s more, with 512GB of storage, you can manage a large library of apps and professional content creation tasks without constant worry about storage space.</p>



<p>Durability is boosted with advanced <strong>armor aluminum framing and Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 protection</strong>&nbsp;which help ease concerns about the fragility of folding phones that once discouraged early adopters. The reinforced hinge can handle hundreds of thousands of folds thanks to precise engineering that ensures smooth operation over years of daily use. The <strong>displays are more resistant to scratches than earlier models</strong> and still maintains the flexibility needed for folding, achieving durability that rivals traditional slab phones. <strong>Water resistance</strong> allows you to use the device in light rain or near water without worry.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life lasts through full days</strong> of mixed use despite the demands of dual displays and powerful processors, achieving longevity that matches or exceeds single-screen flagship devices. Samsung’s smart power management adjusts display refresh rates, processor speeds, and background activities based on how you use the device, maximizing battery life without requiring manual adjustments.</p>
<p>At $1,657, the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold7 with 512GB offers an 8-inch folding display, a 200MP camera and Snapdragon 8 Elite processing at 22% less than its retail price this Black Friday. Samsung’s seven generations of refining folding phones have created technology that Apple has yet to match, despite its resources and engineering expertise.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anker Is Clearly Skipping Margin on the Newly Released 160W Prime Charger, All-Time Low for Black Friday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/keep-all-your-crap-fully-charged-with-the-anker-prime-usb-c-charger-at-its-lowest-price-ever-2000647672</link>
            <guid>1366417</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="627">With Black Friday weekend just around the corner, we’re only a couple of days away from one of the biggest shopping events of the year. While the official start of Black Friday may still be a little ways off, many popular items on Amazon are already seeing some substantial discounts. If you’re getting a head start on holiday shopping, or maybe treating yourself to something special, now is a fantastic time to snag a deal. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/">Right now, Amazon is offering the Anker Prime Charger at 33% off.</a> Normally priced at $150, this high-tech USB-C compatible charging block is available for just $100—a savings of $50—for a limited time.</p>
<p data-start="629" data-end="1269">Nowadays, we carry a lot of devices with us that need to stay charged. It’s not just our smartphones that need to be plugged in at the end of the day anymore. If you’re someone who likes to listen to music or podcasts while on the go, your earbuds or wireless headphones also need to be juiced up. If you’re using a smartwatch to track your fitness or health, keeping that battery full is essential for getting the most out of its capabilities. And that barely scratches the surface. Tablets, laptops, even portable gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch 2, the Asus ROG Xbox Ally, or the Steam Deck all need to be regularly charged to stay powered throughout the day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5984/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="629" data-end="1269">Support for Multiple Devices</h2>
<p data-start="1271" data-end="1839">The Anker Prime Charger is designed to make charging all of these devices easier. Equipped with three USB-C ports, this compact charging block can handle any device that uses USB-C for charging. Each of the three ports can deliver up to 140W of power, which means you can quickly charge even larger devices like a 16-inch MacBook Pro. In fact, the Anker Prime Charger can take your MacBook Pro from zero to 50% battery in just 25 minutes. All three of its USB-C ports can charge at that max speed simultaneously, so it doesn’t matter which port you use.</p>
<p data-start="1841" data-end="2380">When all three ports are in use, the charger adjusts to distribute power efficiently. One port can charge at the full 140W, while the other two can each provide 35W of power. This makes it easy to charge multiple devices at once, whether you’re on a trip or just need to power up your devices at home. For example, if you’re traveling with a MacBook Pro, iPhone 16 Pro Max, and an iPad Pro, the Anker Prime Charger can deliver the same amount of power to each device as their individual chargers would.</p>


<p data-start="2382" data-end="2791">The Anker Prime Charger has a smart touch display, located on top of the device. This LED display offers helpful information about your connected devices, allowing you to check the power status of each port when a device is plugged in. You can also customize charging modes via the app.</p>
<p data-start="2793" data-end="3256">Measuring only 2.56 inches by 2.05 inches by 1.38 inches, it’s small enough to easily fit into your bag or pocket. The prongs even fold into the block, preventing them from catching on anything while you carry it around. For folks on the go, whether you’re working remotely or just want to reduce the number of chargers you carry, the Anker Prime Charger is a travel-friendly solution to your charging needs.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Is Practically Dumping the 15.6″ Portable Monitor After Selling Thousands Last Month, Black Friday Makes the Price Even Wilder]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/innoview-portable-monitor-15-6-inch-2000647776</link>
            <guid>1366375</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you need extra screen space on the go, adding a portable monitor to your setup makes sense. These screens are bigger than tablets, connect to laptops, phones, and other devices using a cable, plus offer multiple viewing options for different needs.</p>
<p>Most solid options with basic functionality out there sit around $100, but you can treat yourself to one for less today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4950/">Right now, Amazon is offering the 15.6-inch InnoView portable monitor for just $57, after taking 42% off its retail price.</a> It’s an early Black Friday deal, but there’s a catch. At the time of writing, the deal is only available to Prime members. Non-Prime members can grab it at a modest 5% drop, for $94. Prime members will also enjoy free delivery with their purchase.</p>
<p>That said, now is a good time to grab a Prime subscription if you’ve been wanting to try it out. Black Friday is tomorrow, and just like this early deal, you can expect plenty of member-exclusive discounts. These are usually much steeper than the regular ones. Prime subscription costs $10 per month or $100 a year, and new users can enjoy a 30-day free trial before committing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4950/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Portable, But Powerful</h2>
<p>For a little over $50, you’re getting a 15.6-inch portable screen. The size matches that of most standard laptops out there, so you’re getting the same experience, just without the bulk.</p>
<p>This screen pushes a 1920×1080 resolution for clear, bright visuals, plus features an IPL panel for superior color accuracy. The 178-degree viewing angle makes it easy to enjoy consistent visuals from all angles, meaning you won’t always have to sit right in front of the monitor to see what’s being displayed. It’s great for when you’re sharing the screen with multiple users, as everyone can see clearly without trying to squeeze in. Additionally, low blue light support keeps it easier on the eyes by reducing the blue light radiation damage. You’ll be able to keep using the screen for longer hours without the usual eye strain.</p>



<p>Exceptional compatibility comes from 2 fully functional Type-C ports and 1 HDMI port that let you connect the monitor to a range of devices. Your device should just support Thunderbolt 3.0/4.0 or USB 3.1 Type-C DP ALT-mode. The setup is plug-and-play, meaning you only need a single USB-C cable to get started. If your device does not support a USB-C connection, you can still connect it through HDMI, but you’ll need both an HDMI cable and a separate power cable to proceed. There’s no single way to use it; you can expand your laptop’s display to work on the go, pair the monitor with your smartphone to stream on a bigger screen, and even use it with a console to play better. There are multiple display modes to choose from. We’re talking an Extend mode for a large desktop that spans across both screens, a Second screen mode to use both the screens for different tasks, and a Duplicate mode that mirrors your primary display.</p>
<p>The monitor comes with a scratch-resistant smart protective. Beyond protection, it can be used to prop the screen up. Two grooves let you find the right angle, so you can set it up literally anywhere you want, from a desk to even your couch.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4950/">The InnoView portable monitor is now down to just $57, all thanks to Black Friday.</a> It not only offers you a large screen, but also delivers stunning visuals, plus lets you choose between multiple viewing modes and even comes with a durable case. It’s great for freelancers, work professionals, students and even gamers.</p>
