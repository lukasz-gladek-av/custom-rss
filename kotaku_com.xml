I’d never played it. What could possible be so special?</p><p>“One of the best GB games ever,” she said when I asked. “It uses the original <em>Donkey Kong</em> (the arcade game) as a jumping-off point, like the first four stages of the game ARE the stages of the arcade game, but then instead of just looping infinitely like the arcade game does it becomes this epic puzzle platforming adventure.”</p><p>She continued, “It’s just a really neat riff on the original classic arcade game that expands it brilliantly and is actually ‘beatable’ unlike the arcade game and feels like it comes from an alternate universe of Mario platforming because he has different abilities and movement than he does in the <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> games.” Also there’s really <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/f_fKDQeG9Dg?si=4mUn2_EDEFsdkmBN&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/f_fKDQeG9Dg?si=4mUn2_EDEFsdkmBN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cool arcade cabinet art</a></span> bordering the gameplay on the original Super Game Boy. </p><p><em>Mario’s Picross</em>, on the other hand, was the first in the Nintendo series about chipping away at nonogram logic puzzles to reveal cool pictures. It’s continued all the way to today on the Switch with the <em>Picross S</em> series, though <em>Mario’s Super Picross</em>, <em>Picross DS</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>and<em> Picross 3D</em> remain many fans’ favorites. What’s so special about the original one besides being first? “It’s one of my favorite games ever!” contributing editor John Walker told me. “One of the solutions is a guy sat on the toilet.”</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’ve been playing it with my wife over the last few days  and I have to agree. It’s a truly incredible game that is packed with hundreds of cool moments and ideas. And it seems we aren’t alone in loving <em>Split Fiction</em> because looking around at ever publicly available metric on hand, the game is a smash hit.</p><h2 id="h1880365"><a id=""></a>Impressive Steam numbers and Metacritic scores</h2><p>First, lets look at Metacritic, which is a useful if flawed metric of how well a game is doing overall with critics across multiple sites and outlets.

But it’s also a big deal for publisher EA, as <em>Split Fiction</em> is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gagadget.com/en/597837-split-fiction-is-the-first-game-for-electronic-arts-in-13-years-to-receive-90-points-on-metacritic/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gagadget.com/en/597837-split-fiction-is-the-first-game-for-electronic-arts-in-13-years-to-receive-90-points-on-metacritic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EA’s first video game to score a 90 or higher</a></span> on Metacritic in 13 years. The last time that happened was in 2012 with <em>Mass Effect 3. </em></p><p>Next, we can look at Steam and how many people are playing the game on Valve’s popular PC storefront. According to the ever-reliable SteamDB, just a few hours after launch, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/app/2001120/charts/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/app/2001120/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Split Fiction </em>had over 190,000 active concurrent players</a></span>. Wowza! That means it was as popular as Steam giants like <em>GTA V, Rust, </em>and <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. That high number also set a record for EA. <em>Split Fiction</em>’s peak player count of 197,000 is the second highest concurrent number EA has achieved on Steam. Only <em>Apex Legends</em>, a free-to-play battle royale shooter, has done better. </p><p>It should also be noted that unlike most other EA games, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pc-steam-third-party-ea-ubisoft-ditching-launchers-civ6-1851623212&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pc-steam-third-party-ea-ubisoft-ditching-launchers-civ6-1851623212"><em>Split Fiction </em>(like 2024's <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a></span>) doesn’t require you to install and use a separate EA launcher to play. This is further proof that ditching third party launchers is a smart move for any publisher. </p><p>EA and Hazelight are also probably really happy that <em>Split Fiction</em> is receiving positive reviews from players on Steam. The new co-op game currently has a 94 percent positive user rating on Steam. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/publisher/Electronic+Arts/?sort=rating_desc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/publisher/Electronic+Arts/?sort=rating_desc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That makes it EA’s fifth most well-reviewed Steam game</a></span>, only slightly behind another Hazelight co-op banger, <em>It Takes Two. </em></p><h2 id="h1880366"><a id=""></a>Will EA and other publishers learn a lesson? </h2><p>While we will have to wait and see how well <em>Split Fiction</em> sells, all the currently available data shows that this is a huge home run for EA. It’s yet more evidence that smaller, more focused games (relative to stuff like <em>GTA 6</em> and <em>Starfield</em>) can succeed and blow up in a big way. And you don’t need to spend three years marketing a game for it to find success. </p><p>I also think that EA made a smart move when it decided to not lock <em>Split Fiction</em> behind some third-party launcher on PC. Instead, you buy the game on Steam and just play it. Simple, easy, and a much more appealing offer for the sometimes fickle PC playerbase. And let’s not forget that Hazelight (an independent studio, but one which relies heavily on EA’s money) being able to spend a decade now making smaller co-op games has allowed the team more time to learn and improve at their craft collectively, which means future games are likely to be better. </p><p>Now, will EA and other publishers watching learn a lesson from <em>Split Fiction</em>’s success? Will they allow studios more chances to make smaller games and not burn millions on years of marketing or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818?_gl=1*tht9in*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MTM2MTY2Ni4zNi4xLjE3NDEzNzMzNDYuNDQuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818?_gl=1*tht9in*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MTM2MTY2Ni4zNi4xLjE3NDEzNzMzNDYuNDQuMC4w">lay off people the moment something doesn’t hit as big</a></span>? Probably not. But it <em>would</em> be nice to see someone out there learn a lesson from <em>Split Fiction</em>’s home run success. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
