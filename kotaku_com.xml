            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Square Enix arguably broke the internet about 10 years ago when it finally revealed it was working on a long-anticipated remake of <i>Final Fantasy 7</i>. Now, in 2025, two parts of this trilogy project have arrived on PlayStation and PC, with ports expected on Switch 2 and Xbox in the near future.</p> <p>Speaking with a number of outlets, <i>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</i>’s director Naoki Hamaguchi shed some light on <i>FF7 Remake</i>’s upcoming arrival on Switch 2 and Xbox, what it took to get the game running on less powerful hardware, how <i>Rebirth</i> is shaping up on Switch 2, and which <i>Final Fantasy</i> he’d be eager to see remade next.</p> <h2>The key to the Switch 2’s <i>FF7R</i> port was nailing the lighting</h2> <p><a href="https://screenrant.com/ff7-remake-director-interview-rebirth-switch-2-confirmed/">Speaking to <i>ScreenRant</i></a>, Hamaguchi zeroed in on “character expressions” and “lighting” as being essential to delivering a quality experience on Nintendo’s hybrid console:</p>

 <blockquote><p>Our aim was to align more towards the lightning we see in the PS5 version, and then we also kind of balance this by aligning more towards the sort of switch to post-effect and fog. And in this way the user is not really able to make out a huge difference</p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-xbox">In an interview with <i>Inverse</i></a>, Hamaguchi said that a Switch 2 port seemed likely early on once “Nintendo first shared with [Square Enix] the new hardware […] the thought came to me that <i>Final Fantasy 7 </i>can likely run on these specs.”</p>

 <p>According to Hamaguchi, the Xbox version was already in the works before the team got their first look at the Switch 2 hardware. And, contrary to what you may think, the underpowered Series S wasn’t much of an issue. Though the team has run into some memory problems on Series S, Hamaguchi still describes Microsoft’s budget console as “quite high in terms of specs.”</p>

 <p><i>FF7 Remake</i> isn’t the only part of the remake project headed to Switch 2. The more graphically ambitious <i>Rebirth</i> is also expected to arrive at some point in the future. Hamaguchi described <i>Rebirth</i> as being in a “working state” on Switch 2. “Our desire was to be able to ultimately offer and serve all of the platforms available,” Hamaguchi told <i>ScreenRant</i>. He declined to say, however, whether or not the third installment will arrive as a multiplatform title on day one.</p>

 <h2>Development on part three of <i>FF7</i> remake’s trilogy is ‘going extremely well’</h2> <p>The <i>FF7 </i>remake project is still ongoing, with a yet-unnamed third entry on the horizon. Hamaguchi describes development as “going extremely well.” “A lot of the content is already playable,” <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-selling-well-no-need-to-worry-about-the-trilogys-finale-director-naoki-hamaguchi-says/">he told <i>Automaton</i></a>, “and the game’s direction and form are firmly set in place. Right now the team is united around refining everything.”</p>

 <p><i>FF7</i>’s remakes have certainly impressed a number of fans, but concerns over the sales of the last entry and the general direction of the various plot changes do remain. For his part, Hamaguchi has described <i>Rebirth</i> as “doing very well on both PS5 and PC” in terms of sales. He also shared with <i>ScreenRant</i> how the recent live-action <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> remake inspired his decisions in reinterpreting <i>FF7</i> for the remake trilogy:</p> <blockquote><p>When development [on <i>FF7 Remake</i>] was happening, the <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> movie remake was released. That movie, the original, was one I watched as a child. And then they now had the live-action that’s a remake…I saw the overall story and the world itself was not altered, but it was completely deconstructed in a way to really entertain today’s viewers, which was deeply satisfying.</p></blockquote> <p>Although <i>FF7</i>’s remake chapters have occupied his time, Hamaguchi has spent some time daydreaming about other possible remakes in the classic JRPG series. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/final-fantasy-7-director-on-xbox">Speaking to <i>Windows Central</i></a>, the director described <i>FF6</i> as his favorite, saying “That would be very cool to take on as a remake. I’ve put my heart and soul into the <i>Final Fantasy 7 Remake</i> series for over a decade now. Working on something completely new would be quite fun as well.”</p>

              <p>If you’ve been perusing for a fancy new tablet, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4336/">do take note that the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ just got its price chopped down over at Amazon.</a> Usually this Samsung tablet starts at&nbsp; $220, but right now you can score the 11-inch Android for just $159. The 28% discount amounts to a savings of $61. That’s for the 64 GB model by the way. Double your storage, and you can still save as the 128 GB model dropped from $270 to just $209. That one is a 23% discount which works also out to you saving $61. Both versions are available in either black or silver.</p>
<p>This 2024 Galaxy tablet has a nice and large 11-inch LCD screen which can display in resolutions of up to 1200p with a refresh rate of 90 Hz. According to the product page, the Galaxy Tab A9+ can deliver a “cinema-like audio experience,” which is, uh, an obvious embellishment. No one is expecting something you can hold in your hands to match that of an AMC theater. What this is really saying is the tablet has Dolby Atmos support. You can expect terrific sound that’s loud and clear as far as tablets go coming from the on-board speakers.</p>

<p>Storage we covered. You have a choice between either 64 GB or 128 GB. The price jump from one to the next is an even $50. If you expect to be downloading a bunch of movies or TV shows or storing tons of photos, you may decide it’s best to splurge. Otherwise if streaming and documents saved to the cloud will be the main way you use it, just stick with the cheaper 64 GB.</p>



<h2>Full Flexibility</h2>
<p>Android OS is able to run multiple apps at the same time, allowing you to view them side-by-side. This is excellent when multitasking, letting you work more efficiently. You can even view multiple tabs in you web browser next to each other.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Vandal Hearts II</em> is an obscure strategy RPG sequel produced by Konami at the end of the PS1’s life. Few played it but many who did will cherish it forever. Now its oldest and weirdest mystery has finally be solved. A reference to Konami’s classic shoot ’em up series <em>Gradius</em> mentioned a special sword in the game’s files that no one could ever get to spawn without hacks. Fans thought up all sorts of wild theories about the “intended” way to unlock the secret, including maybe needing very specific save files from other Konami games like<em> Suikoden</em>. It turns out that they actually needed a super-rare demo disc.</p> <p>The Gradius Sword in <em>Vandal Hearts II</em> isn’t just a fun little Easter egg. The weapon contains a powerful spell called “Ripple Laser” that summons an actual 3D model of <em>Gradius</em>‘ ship, the Vic Viper, to fly across the battlefield and blow up enemies. It’s pretty powerful and has a surprisingly ornate animation for something that no one was ever able to discover in the game naturally. The result has been decades of random threads across <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/199180-vandal-hearts-ii/80436904?page=2">message boards like GameFAQs</a> and elsewhere as fans tried to figure out what you could actually do in the game to trigger the Gradius Sword to appear.</p> <p>Three years ago, the tiny <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjQ4JRg9fo">YouTube account Dragon Quarter</a> reposted footage of the Ripple Laser skill in action that was originally uploaded in 2010. Then last night, Dragon Quarter returned with a major update. “After getting a tip from a follower (who I realize now got their tip from a recent post on&nbsp;<a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/199180-vandal-hearts-ii/80436904?page=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">GameFAQs</a>) of Twitch streamer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/karkalla" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Karkalla</a>, who is currently playing through <em>Vandal Hearts II</em> for the first time, I have confirmed the Gradius Sword was originally unlocked by downloading a special save data file from Dengeki PlayStation D22 (SLPM-80471), a demo disc included with <em>Dengeki PlayStation Magazine</em> Issue 116 (dated 1999-09-24),” they <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-decades-old-mystery-about-a-hidden-unlockable-gradius-sword-in-vandal-hearts-ii-for-playstation-has-finally-been-figured-out.1309491/">posted</a> on ResetEra on Friday.</p>

  <p>According to GameFAQs user Kern, the discovery came after finding a reference to the demo disc on an older Japanese site. “Someone on a discord who had some old discs found the file on the D22 disc (which you can get from ebay),” they wrote. “I wasn’t able to verify it personally myself but he posted images of the file, and he was able to open the save file on an English copy and the Gradius sword was available for purchase.” Dragon Quarter has since confirmed it as well.</p>

 <p>This is the kind of deep gaming lore I thrive on. For years, random players <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/199180-vandal-hearts-ii/53785268">on forums have claimed</a> to have found the weapon early on in <em>Vandal Hearts II</em> just by chance. Is it possible there’s some one in a million chance for it to just spawn randomly without the demo disc data? Who knows. It seems clear that Konami at least intended for it to be an exclusive bonus for owners of the demo disc, similar to the deluxe edition pre-orders of today that let players begin a game with unique upgrades and gear.</p> <p>The most absurd theory by far was that you needed to have a final Gregminster save point from the original<em> Suikoden</em> on a memory card to get the Gradius Sword to appear in the shop. When that was debunked a couple of years ago, many players had resigned themselves to the weapon only being available via some hacked save file from “Jean” that was uploaded to GameFAQs over a decade ago. Now players can get it the “official” way by downloading a <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/199180-vandal-hearts-ii/saves">copy of the demo disc save</a> and using a PS3 memory card converter to get the data onto a PS1 memory card.</p>

              <p>We can’t blame you if you were planning on keeping your wallet stashed away until Amazon’s Fall Prime Day hits on Oct. 7-8, but the run-up to the big event is often where you can find sneaky-good deals as Amazon looks to clear out the shelves. We found this one today — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/">24% off the price of the Samsung Galaxy Buds3 Pro, which brings their price down to just $190.</a> That’s right in line with Apple’s AirPods 4 and a big drop from the closer-comparison AirPods Pro3.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Buds3 Pro got a full redesign from Samsung before dropping this past July, with an emphasis on comfort for long listening sessions. The sound is, of course, the amazing quality that Samsung’s famous for. And these buds are bolstered by Galaxy AI to enhance the noise cancellation, equalization, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Theater of the Mind</h2>
<p>Whether you’re listening to your own playlist or connecting to your tablet or TV via Bluetooth, the surround sound from the Galaxy Buds3 Pro is so good and so immersive it’s like being in the theater, but the sound is all for you. Dual amplifiers and a 2-way speaker in each bud creates a 360-degree effect, and Galaxy AI powers an adaptive equalizer that optimizes the sound specifically for you.</p>
<p>You can disappear into the listening experience of the Galaxy Buds3 Pro regardless of where you are, because the Adaptive Active Noise Cancellation feature, also powered by Galaxy AI, intelligently adjusts the level of noise cancellation based on your surroundings, and changes is as the conditions around you change. You won’t want to put them down, and thanks to the comfort-enhancing redesign and long battery life, you won’t have to.</p>



<h2>Futuristic Features</h2>
<p>One of the most jawdropping features of the Galaxy Buds3 Pro is the real-time interpreter. When your Buds3 Pro are paired with a compatible Galaxy device, your can carry on a conversation with someone speaking a foreign language and hear the translation on your earbuds in real time. All you need is a Samsung account, from which you can download languages for free. (English and Spanish are pre-installed.)</p>
<p>Will there be incredible tech deals dropping during the two-day Fall Prime Day event? Of course. But consider the several days leading into the event a golden opportunity to find those under-the-radar bargains Amazon likes to drop as they get their inventory set for the big rush. This is most definitely one of them — a $60-off deal on Samsung’s newest and best wireless earbuds. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/">Get the Galaxy Buds3 Pro for just $190 and beat the Prime Day rush.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-ghazban-ogress-mark-rosewater-2000629186</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/head-magic-the-gathering-designer-apologizes-for-misogynistic-card-from-27-years-ago.1309887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> has finally come clean about one of the bigger stains on its legacy. Veteran head designer Mark Rosewater recently apologized for the misogynistic treatment of a low-level pro player in the ’90s that he immortalized as a printed card called Ghazbán Ogress. “I have had a hand in creating thousands of Magic cards over the years, and Ghazban Ogress is the one I most regret making,” he <a href="https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/795689646039367680/there-was-a-video-posted-yesterday-about-the-card">wrote</a> in a new blog post.</p> <p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ugl/60/ghazb%C3%A1n-ogress">Ghazbán Ogress</a> was a parody of an existing card called <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/arn/49/ghazb%C3%A1n-ogre">Ghazbán Ogre</a>, but its real inspiration was a woman named Catherine Nicoloff, an aspiring pro player who also dated several different top players in the ’90s <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> competitive scene. Part of the 1998 Unglued side-expansion, which was designed entirely by Rosewater, the card’s description read, “When Ghazban Ogress comes into play, the player who has won the most <em>Magic</em> games that day gains control of it.” It essentially took slut shaming that was happening in private and immortalized it in print.</p> <p>This darker chapter in the card game’s history was explored in a recent video on the <a spellcheck="false" href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheTranquilDomainMTG">The Tranquil Domain</a> YouTube channel in which Nicoloff was interviewed about it for the first time. “I just wanted to be one of the guys at the time,” she said. “That was the biggest compliment you could get is if you were one of the guys and man, when people say guys don’t gossip, boy are they lying. So, the attention was mixed, but you were always being watched. I could not go anywhere without being watched. If I went to lunch with a friend, there would be a rumor the next day that I was seen with so-and-so and I was dating him, even if I wasn’t, even if it was nothing more than a lunch where we were talking about decks or cards or draft strategy or whatever.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I laughed at and shared that joke at the time, when I was a teenager, and it certainly can’t have made women feel welcome in the community. I think one of the worst habits that Magic embedded in me was choosing my social circle based largely on peoples’ perceived skill.</p> <p>— Brian Kibler (@bmkibler) <a href="https://twitter.com/bmkibler/status/1395410046394060802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2021</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Nicoloff said Rosewater took her aside during one event to give her a heads-up that the Ghazbán Ogress card would be coming out. “Mark Rosewater wielded enormous power over the game and continues to do so,” she said. “I was just, you know, a a small-time wannabe pro player. So, at that moment, it this is going to sound melodramatic, but it just kind of broke me a little because I had thought Mark was a friend. I thought he was trying to be humorous, but [that] he had the best interests of the players at heart. And now I’d been handed this tiger by the tail, and I had to either ride it or get eaten by it. That was what Mark gave to me.”</p>

 <p>She ended up signing some other people’s copies of the card while also trying to collect as many of them as possible to keep it from spreading. Nicoloff reckons she has two binder pages full of Ghazbán Ogress now. It wasn’t until a viral post about the incident four years ago by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/nh5pep/comment/hf1dq1n/?context=3"><em>Magic</em> player Brian Kibler</a> that she wanted to correct the record about what a gross thing it was. “I admit I still felt just a little bit angry and a little bit hurt by the whole thing because this was like an elephant in the room and nobody had ever apologized to me.”</p>

 <p>That changed after the video went live and people started asking Rosewater about it. In a post over on his blog he unequivocally apologized for it. “Let me start by stating unequivocally that it was a mistake to have ever printed the card. It is 100% my doing,” he <a href="https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/795689646039367680/there-was-a-video-posted-yesterday-about-the-card">wrote</a>. “I designed it and put it into the set. I take full responsibility for the card’s existence. It’s important to own up to one’s mistakes and not try to justify them.”</p> <p>Rosewater has since called Nicoloff to apologize 27 years later, an apology which he said she accepted. “This apology should have come decades earlier though, and for that I am also sorry,” he wrote. “Magic cards should be something that bring people together and help foster growth and connection,” he added. “It should never be used to tear people down.”</p>

              <p>Following the non-appearance of a new mainline <em>Pokémon</em> game this year, the <em>Pokémon TCG</em> was left with a bit of a predicament at the end of its three years of&nbsp;<em>Scarlet &amp; Violet</em> sets. So, rather than drag it on, the trading card game has opted to return to Mega Evolutions, perfectly in time with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380">giant monsters’ resurgence in the forthcoming <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a>. The first new set, out today in the U.S., is aptly and simply called Mega Evolution, and based on opening a few dozen packs, I’m delighted to report that a newfound generosity seems to have arrived.</p> <p>Now, while The Pokémon Company has chosen to save the really big guns for November’s next set, Mega Evolution: Phantasmal Flames, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-charizard-x-ex-secret-rare-card-inferno-2000628025">a Charizard card that is likely to cause riots in the streets</a>, that doesn’t mean there aren’t some big hitters in this first outing for the new era. Sure to see high demand and higher prices are Special Illustration Rares for fan favorites Mega Venusaur ex, Mega Lucario ex and Mega Latias ex, as well as one very special card: the return of Mega Gardevoir ex. I can’t hold it in any longer. I pulled it! I pulled the Gardevoir!</p> <p>OK, I’m not going to let this color my assessment of the set, but I will say I when I opened it last night I ran upstairs and woke up my son to show him in quite the display of excellent parenting. Oh, and the centering on the reverse is <em>awful</em>, so there’s no hope of a nice PSA rating. Right, moving on.</p>

For instance, the completely out-of-control reverse holos with either Poké Balls or Master Balls on them are all gone, and in fact the reverse holo has no pattern&nbsp;<em>at all</em>. There are no holo Energy cards, no Ace Spec-likes—just a very basic set of a very normal size (188 cards). As such, in this sense, it feels like an appropriate wiping clean of the slate for a new era. In another sense, other than the Mega Evolved Pokémon, it’s an incredibly&nbsp;<em>ordinary</em> set, too. The art on a large number of the Basic cards is weirdly generic, images that look so plain that you’d swear you’ve seen them before.</p>

 <p>This makes for an odd set in some ways. With no new Pokémon arriving, and the indistinct art, most of the cards feel like they could come from any era in any of the last ten years. However, when you pull something more special, they feel&nbsp;<em>very</em> special, and I’m delighted to report that in our smallish sample, that happened a lot more often than I was expecting.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000629195" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629195"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629195">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>So <em>Pokémon TCG</em> sets in recent years have been built of your regular cards with the small window of art, Double Rares that are either the older basic Vs or the more recent basic ex cards, Ultra Rares which tend to be more elaborate V/ex arts or full-art Trainer cards, then the desirable Illustration Rares (IR) which are full-art cards depicting Pokémon in their environment, followed by Special Illustration Rares (SIR) which also full-art, but mostly far more elaborately detailed. Then you get your gold cards which used to be the most prized, but more recently lost all their allure—this time out there are just two of them, with a lot more detail etched into the gold foil, and the hilarious new classification of Mega Hyper Rare. Mega Evolution sticks to this formula but with a boost, giving those Illustration Rares a big upgrade: the artworks in this set are <i data-stringify-type="italic">astonishing</i>.</p>

 <p>Each time I pulled an IR I was convinced it had to be an SIR, so gorgeous and elaborate was the art. Cards like the Clawitzer, Bulbasaur, and Ivysaur IRs would previously have easily been given an SIR rating. And yes, that means the 10 SIR cards have stepped up too, all of them (but for the Mega Absol ex, I would argue) looking like they could have been the ultimate chase card in any set on their own. Mega Latias ex is just extraordinary, while the Mega Lucario ex seems to be deliberately evoking the classic Mewtwo vs Charizard cards of the <em>Sword &amp; Shield</em> era, as the Lucario soars over a city, wheeling back to punch an attacking Venusaur. And talking of it, the Mega Venusaur ex card completes a triptych set with Bulbasaur and Ivysaur in gobsmacking artwork by very new Pokémon artist mashu. And then, yes, there’s that Mega Gardevoir ex, with a degree of intricacy not seen since <a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/crownzenith/H69.shtml">Akira Egawa’s Giratina VSTAR in Crown Zenith</a>. (Egawa designed the Mega Latias in this set.) What’s more extraordinary is that the Gardevoir card was designed by an artist brand new to the TCG, Raita Kazama, who has previously designed incredible packaging and sleeves for the franchise, but never a card.</p>

 <h2>Pull Rates</h2> <p>Pull rates over&nbsp;<em>Scarlet &amp; Violet</em> felt like they were crawling by the end, settling on a pretty desultory 1 in 5 chance of a pack having something you’d care about, even including a basic ex. Mega Evolution (and again, I stress my sample size is non-scientific) blew this out of the water for me. Of the first 40 packs, I pulled 12 cards Ultra Rare or higher! If you include the basic ex cards (which look great, by the way) that goes up to 21 pulls from 40 packs. 1 in 2?! And better than 1 in 4 for real pulls. That’s so much more appealing, and a far better use of someone’s allowance.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000629192" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629192"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629192">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>What’s The Meta?</h2> <p>As for how all this will affect the game itself, I’d say it’ll be pretty big stuff. The Mega cards are as powerful as you’d hope, and are going to absolutely flip the meta. Mega Gardevoir ex, for instance, has a one-Energy ability called Overflowing Wishes that lets you add an Energy card to <em>every</em> benched Psychic Pokémon you have at once, and a second called Mega Symphonia that’ll deliver 50 damage for every Psychic Energy attached. It’s a Stage 2, so you’re not going to be playing it out your deck, but at the same time that gives you a lot of time to build up its Energy stock while you evolve it. Meanwhile, Mega Abomasnow ex could possibly deliver the highest damage I’ve ever heard of. Hammer-lanche has you discard the top six cards from your deck, doing 100 damage for every Energy card that’s there. Load your deck with Energy and you could hit for 600! Albeit at a hefty cost for your reserves of cards, of course.</p> <p>Mega Camerupt ex can deliver a ludicrous 240 damage for&nbsp;<em>one</em> Energy if the opponent is Burned, while my favorite, Mega Mawile, can take a Huge Bite of 260 damage if an opponent is unharmed (and only 30 if it isn’t!), but also Gobble Down for 80 per prize card you’ve taken. What a finisher that would be, your opponent finally playing their stacked Mega Gardevoir with five prize cards gone, and you clobber it in one turn for 380.</p>

 <p>There are also nice twists like Wally’s Companion, a Trainer card featuring good ol’ Wally that will heal&nbsp;<em>all</em> damage from an ex Pokémon at the cost of returning Energy attached to it back to your hand. Yup, it’s not discarded!</p> <figure id="attachment_2000629193" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629193"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629193">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This is to be a very brief set, given the arrival of Phantasmal Flames as soon as November 14. It’s an even shorter time if you live outside the U.S., where Mega Evolution has been delayed by a full two weeks due to manufacturing issues—barely a month long. But it’s a lovely way to begin the new era, unless I was just ridiculously lucky!</p>
