The rest of the studio was then mostly populated with fresh graduates. “I didn’t even have a budget when I started, because it was an internal production,” Yoshida said. The <em>Legend of Dragoon</em> team would eventually be 100 strong and  end up costing Sony $16 million. </p><p>A lot of the effort by that large team went toward the game’s infamous 30 minutes of, at the time, gorgeous CGI cutscenes. While the prerendered backgrounds and polygonal character models were looking roughly on par with what Square was doing at the end of the PS1's life, the cinematics helped elevate into a much more epic and lavish-feeling game overall. The other highlight was the timed battle mechanic that turned combat into a mini-rhythm game, an evolution of what Hasebe had created for <em>Super Mario RPG</em> (and which continues in the modern <em>Paper Mario</em> games). <br></p><p>“Eventually, we recouped that (cost), thanks to sales outside Japan,” Yoshida <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-sonys-most-creative-studio-rose-from-the-ashes-1458030068?_gl=1*1cb2wzs*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjgzNzczOS4yOC4xLjE3NDI4NDEwNDAuNTguMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-sonys-most-creative-studio-rose-from-the-ashes-1458030068?_gl=1*1cb2wzs*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjgzNzczOS4yOC4xLjE3NDI4NDEwNDAuNTguMC4w">previously told <em>Kotaku</em></a></span>. “The sales in the U.S. were very strong.” Unfortunately not strong enough to manifest a sequel or spiritual successor. Fortunately, <em>The Legend of Dragoon</em> is playable today after coming to PS5 a couple of years ago, though deep down in my heart of hearts I’m still hopeful we’ll eventually get <em>The Legend of Dragoon 2</em>. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
