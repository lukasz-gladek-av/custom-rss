              <p><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>has revealed new sprays coming to the game that some fans online have been </span><a href="https://x.com/dewenjoyer/status/1968131210951241935"><span>speculating are AI-generated</span></a><span>. These </span><a href="https://x.com/ougidraws/status/1968070064403579098"><span>sprays feature new character</span></a><span> Wuyang playing competitive </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>at his computer, and Venture and Juno posing back-to-back. Both sprays reference the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-champions-series-owcs-owl-esports-dreamhack-1851189732"><span>Overwatch Esports</span></a><span> organization, with its logo included on the heroes‚Äô clothes and computer. After they were revealed, some fans started </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@inklionart/video/7551148691952864543"><span>accusing Blizzard of using generative AI in </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i></a><span> to create these sprays, as well as </span><a href="https://x.com/ougidraws/status/1968109749507072419"><span>explaining which details about the sprays</span></a><span> they felt gave them away as the product of AI. Well, we asked Blizzard if this is the case, and the company says that both sprays were made by a human artist.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Overwatch is ABSOLUTELY using AI, LOOK AT THE EYES <a href="https://t.co/Wsl7Q95qSN">pic.twitter.com/Wsl7Q95qSN</a></p> <p>‚Äî Juno üçê COMMISSIONS OPEN (2/2) (@DewEnjoyer) <a href="https://twitter.com/DewEnjoyer/status/1968131210951241935?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>‚ÄúThe sprays referenced are artist-made,‚Äù a Blizzard spokesperson said in a statement to </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>When these accusations started flying around social media in places like X and TikTok, some </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>haters </span><span>were more than willing to jump on the bandwagon, but several others argued that calling things out as AI art based on small nitpicks is only detrimental to the cause of protesting AI slop in favor of supporting artists, because you might be mistaken, distort others‚Äô perception of what is and isn‚Äôt AI-generated, and then the artists whose work is mischaracterized as AI are left with that controversy on their public record. Though yes, AI art is a plague on this planet and we should absolutely speak out against companies using it instead of hiring real artists, firing the accusation from the hip ultimately risks throwing the very artists you claim to be advocating for under the bus. Now, a Blizzard artist or maybe a contractor has seen people assume their work isn‚Äôt their own, that it isn‚Äôt even the work of a human being, and is instead the product of an algorithm scraping other artists‚Äô portfolios.</span></p> <p><span>I sympathize with the fear that your favorite thing might become lost to the slop machine. </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>is one of my favorite games, and I play it just about every day, largely because I love the work Blizzard‚Äôs creative team has put into bringing these characters to life. But vigilance shouldn‚Äôt turn these conversations into witch hunts where the artists whose work we want to support takes collateral damage. </span></p>
