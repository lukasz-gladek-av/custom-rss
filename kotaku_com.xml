              <p>You didn’t have to watch the <em>Fatal Fury</em> finals bracket at Evo 2025 to see Kazuyuki “KojiKOG” Koji writhing around onstage in front of thousands. The moment instantly went viral online. It’s already been memed to South Town and back again. But there was more to KojiKOG’s Greek-tragedy-worthy theatrics than just performing for the camera.</p> <p>KojiKOG’s epic semifinals defeat was delivered at the hands of Goichi “GO1” Kishida, who eventually went on to win the entire tournament. The former was playing Billy while the latter rolled Kain, both considered S-tier fighters in the current meta since <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> launched earlier this year. But KojiKOG was immediately up against the ropes, unable to break out of GO1’s combos. He quickly lost the first round but found a couple of openings in the second. Twice KojiKOG almost reversed fate, getting GO1 down to within a sliver of his health before ultimately failing to finish him off.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="FATAL FURY: CotW ⭐ GO1 (KAIN) vs KOJI KOG (BILLY) ⭐ EVO 2025 COTW Top 8" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dJDRnkm9Qck?start=289&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The entire semifinal lasted less than five minutes, but KojiKOG howling in dismay at his defeat lasted nearly 60 seconds. While GO1 giggled, shrugged, and eventually tried to comfort his rival, people watching at home instantly began clipping the moment and sharing it around online. It was a perfect encapsulation not only of the stakes of that specific match but of the inner screaming we’ve all felt any time we’ve tried our best and still been found wanting.</p>

The two fighting game pros met in finals during an Evo 2015 side tournament for the 2D anime fighter <em>Aquapazza</em> as well. KojiKOG lost then, too, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fatal-fury-pros-dramatic-reaction-to-losing-at-evo-2025-goes-viral-but-it-was-actually-10-years-in-the-making">and pulled a similar stunt, acting as if his leg had been cut off</a>. This time, of course, there was a lot more money and bragging rights on the line. GO1’s wins last night eventually netted him an extra $10,000 in prize pool money. He’ll also be in pole position for the $2.5 million <em>Fatal Fury</em> prize pool at the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/1mfct3j/snk_announces_snk_world_championship_2025_%E3%83%BC_41/">SNK World Championship in November</a> (brought to you by Saudi Arabia’s human rights violation slush fund).</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">youtubeに動画をアップしました。</p> <p>10年ぶりに足を切断されてしまう小路KOG vs GO1 EVO2025<a href="https://t.co/sQTu3yb2xJ">https://t.co/sQTu3yb2xJ</a> <a href="https://t.co/DyPHT39YUu">pic.twitter.com/DyPHT39YUu</a></p> <p>— 小路ＫＯＧ (@kkkog) <a href="https://twitter.com/kkkog/status/1952342197220593705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“KOG, who had his leg amputated after 10 years, vs GO1 EVO2025,” KojiKOG <a href="https://x.com/kkkog/status/1952342197220593705">posted on X</a>. While dramatic pop-offs after winning are a staple of the fighting game scene, KojiKOG may have just elevated the inverse of that into an art form all its own. Fans are already hyped to watch him lose his next big tournament.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-the-kotaku-review-1850883627"><em>Starfield</em></a> and <em>Deus Ex</em> voice actor Elias Toufexis has a very simple message to anyone thinking of using AI-powered mods to add characters he has played to other games: Don’t do that, actually. It’s a topic the actor has spoken about before, and one he is extremely passionate about.</p> <p>In early July, a user on Twitter posted that people should download a mod that replaces the main character’s voice in<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> with that of Adam Jensen, the protagonist of the two most recent&nbsp;<em>Deus Ex&nbsp;</em>games, using AI. They also suggested customizing the main character to look like the <em>Deus Ex</em> character. They claimed that if you took these steps, it would turn CD Projekt Red’s 2020 open-world RPG into a “pretty convincing” <em>Deus Ex</em> game. A month later, on August 2, this tweet came to the attention of Jensen’s voice actor, Toufexis, and he had a simple, clear reply to this idea: “<a href="https://x.com/EliasToufexis/status/1951794192512061695?">No. Do not fucking do that</a>.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">No. Do not fucking do that. <a href="https://t.co/vQolcAP3Tg">https://t.co/vQolcAP3Tg</a></p> <p>— Elias Toufexis (@EliasToufexis) <a href="https://twitter.com/EliasToufexis/status/1951794192512061695?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>When another Twitter user asked Toufexis, who voiced Sam Cole in 2023’s <em>Starfield</em>, why they shouldn’t use the AI mod to add Jensen to <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, the voice actor replied: <a href="https://x.com/EliasToufexis/status/1951804424252441040">“You going to pay me for using my voice?”</a></p>

 <p>The voice replacement mod for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>&nbsp;mentioned in the original tweet was uploaded to the internet in October 2023. Its creator states that they mean no disrespect to Toufexis and claims that if the voice actor ever reached out to them and demanded it be removed, the modder would comply. “I would never want someone to feel like I’m robbing them of their right to own and dictate when or how their voice is to be used,” <a href="https://schaken-mods.com/forums/topic/153170-adam-jensen-as-v-ai-voice-over/#:~:text=I%20would%20never%20want%20someone%20to%20feel%20like%20I%27m%20robbing%20them%20of%20their%20right%20to%20own%20and%20dictate%20when%20or%20how%20their%20voice%20is%20to%20be%20used.">explained the modder</a>. It’s not clear if Toufexis has reached out to the modder yet.</p> <p>Adam Jensen appeared in <a href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-mankind-divided-the-kotaku-review-1785610152">2011’s<em> Deus Ex: Human Revolution</em> and its 2016 sequel, </a><em>Mankind Divided. </em>The brooding cyborg badass became famous for his raspy, deep voice and has remained a fan favorite. Toufexis loves talking about the character, so much so that <a href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-3-adam-jensen-actor-stop-talking-sequel-eidos-1851252201">he was told to stop by series developers Edios Montreal in 2020</a>. In 2024, a new, unannounced <em>Deus Ex</em> game was <a href="https://kotaku.com/embracer-group-deus-ex-cancelled-eidos-montreal-layoffs-1851205890">reportedly canceled</a> by Embracer Group.</p> <p>This is far from the first time Toufexis has spoken about AI generation tools being used to replace voice actors. <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-sam-coe-voice-actor-romance-elias-toufexis-1850826699">In a 2023 interview with <em>Kotaku</em></a>, Jensen’s iconic voice actor called AI a “tool that steals from other people’s work.”</p>

 <p>“I honestly feel that AI cannot replace real actors in the long run,” said Toufexis. “But it can take away a whole slew of jobs that normally go to actors. Big roles like Sam [from <em>Starfield</em>] are probably safe. AI is just a tool that steals from other people’s work and tries to create reality. But it’s not reality, and I believe people will know the difference and want the real thing. But it may take some time. I look at it like NFTs or 3D TVs. There will be a little while where people fool around with the new tech, but eventually they’ll realize how fake it is.”</p> <p>He also explained that if he catches people using AI to recreate his voice for profit or promotion, he’ll ask them to stop. If they do, that will be the end of it. However, if they continue, he’ll go after them, telling <em>Kotaku</em> in 2023: “We have to protect actors from replacement. It’s a dangerous slope. If my voice can be replaced, that is almost literally leading to taking food out of my kids’ mouths. This is a huge part of my livelihood.”</p>
