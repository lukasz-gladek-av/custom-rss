              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-preview-beat-em-up-tribute-games-1851784757"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></a> has revealed its final two characters and its long-awaited release date. The comic book brawler arrives December 1 with Iron Man (Tony Stark) and Phoenix (Jean Grey) rounding out its roster of gorgeously pixel-art-animated superheroes.</p> <p>Dotemu released one last trailer to celebrate the impending launch which includes brief looks at the newly revealed additions and the gang fighting in front of a giant Master Mold Sentinel like the ‚Äô90s <em>X-Men</em> cartoon was turned into a <em>Mega Man X</em> spin-off.</p>

  <p>The full roster, for anyone who hasn‚Äôt been keeping track at home, includes the 15 following fighters:</p> <ul> <li>Beta Ray Bill</li> <li>Black Panther</li> <li>Captain America</li> <li>Cosmic Ghost Rider</li> <li>Nova</li> <li>Phyla-Vell</li> <li>Rocket Raccoon</li> <li>She-Hulk</li> <li>Spider-Man</li> <li>Storm</li> <li>Silver Surfer</li> <li>Venom</li> <li>Wolverine</li> <li>Iron Man</li> <li>Phoenix</li> </ul> <p>There‚Äôs a nice range of household names and Marvel back-benchers sporting a variety of different attack styles and abilities. That‚Äôs the one thing that the demo, <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-steam-demo-pc-console-2025-coolest-looking-game-2000630663">still free to try on Steam</a>, really drives home. Each of these characters plays surprisingly distinctly for a beat ‚Äôem up, especially when you account <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-hands-on-preview-mvc-impressions-2000614681">for mid-battle character switching and team-up attacks</a>.</p> <p><em>Marvel Cosmic</em> <em>Invasion</em> is coming to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch 2, Switch 1, and PC. Is December 1 enough time for me to go back and Platinum the excellent<em> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder‚Äôs Revenge</em>? We‚Äôll see.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Someone over at Game Freak knows the gays are watching. The </span><i><span>Pok√©mon </span></i><span>series has become increasingly inclusive and queer-coded over the years, with this trend most visible in character design. There are a lot of hotties, of course, but there‚Äôs also a throughline of queer aesthetics for both trainers and their monsters that has shown up in recent games, especially since the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-fairy-queer-lgbtqia-sylveon-pride-trans-flag-1850577955"><span>Fairy type</span></a><span> was introduced in Generation VI. So I have to believe that someone at Game Freak knew the toxic yuri shippers would latch onto Lebanne and Jacinthe, two of the strongest trainers in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>The player first comes into contact with these two women </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-society-battle-connoisseurs-jacinthe-2000637284"><span>after a run-in</span></a><span> with members of the Society of Battle Connoisseurs, a group of snobby, elite competitive trainers who have never been told ‚Äúno‚Äù in their lives. Jacinthe, </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>‚Äôs resident fairy-type expert, is a rich socialite who runs the SBC, and Lebanne is her personal maid. At least, that‚Äôs how it appears on the surface. In some of the early interactions with Jacinthe, Lebanne tries to warn the player of what will happen if they cross her. When she does this, her typically calm, collected demeanor changes to one of near-feral panic, but our heroes pay this no mind until it‚Äôs too late. After Team MZ blows off a tournament Jacinthe has organized, she traps them in a manufactured battle zone outside their home base and forces you to battle her lackeys, including Lebanne.</span></p>

 <p><span>When the dragon-type trainer finally enters the ring, she lets loose. All her poise goes out the window, and she reveals her true self: an angry, pent-up rage machine who commands some of the most vicious Pok√©mon in Lumiose City. This all juxtaposed against her keeping the maid outfit on while no longer maintaining the facade of being Jacinthe‚Äôs mild-mannered housekeeper. After you take her down, she levels with you. She wasn‚Äôt always waiting hand and foot on Jacinthe. Back in the day, Lebanne was a ‚Äúfighter‚Äù who only sought to fight ‚Äúthe strongest opponents‚Äù she and her dragon Pok√©mon could find. But two years ago, Jacinthe‚Äôs fairy-type Pok√©mon ‚Äútotally annihilated‚Äù her, and now she‚Äôs subjected to this daily humiliation ritual of pretending to be what Jacinthe wants her to be. It‚Äôs toxic as fuck‚Ä¶but the fanfiction writes itself.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">becoming a disposable henchwoman as punishment for losing a single fight,,, multiple years in a humiliating maid outfit; forced to bend to her every whim‚Ä¶ overwrought retribution for overconfidence,, im losing my mind‚Ä¶.. <a href="https://t.co/dE5RfOXTsk">https://t.co/dE5RfOXTsk</a></p> <p>‚Äî Tabitha ‚ú® (@_kikimari_) <a href="https://twitter.com/_kikimari_/status/1980002971275407548?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Obsessed with these two <a href="https://t.co/zVuq3fK3MF">pic.twitter.com/zVuq3fK3MF</a></p> <p>‚Äî Ghost üëª (@Ghostblobbu) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ghostblobbu/status/1979984586357825627?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lebanne and Jacinthe yuri</p> <p>pokemon za spoilers this really happens after you beat the game three times blindfolded <a href="https://t.co/jfedPkboRY">pic.twitter.com/jfedPkboRY</a></p> <p>‚Äî Percy (@keyblot) <a href="https://twitter.com/keyblot/status/1980298162134003733?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="und" dir="ltr">))))<br> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pokemonlegendsza?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#pokemonlegendsza</a> <a href="https://t.co/CVSPT2B6Pv">pic.twitter.com/CVSPT2B6Pv</a></p> <p>‚Äî Tuif (@Tuiffff) <a href="https://twitter.com/Tuiffff/status/1980719747626070449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Haven't even played this game but I know yuri when I see it and Jacinthe and Lebanne feel real familiar‚Ä¶<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonLegendsZA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PokemonLegendsZA</a> <a href="https://t.co/KsCQ3eUI0H">pic.twitter.com/KsCQ3eUI0H</a></p> <p>‚Äî Kori.‚òæ || Garofano CEO (@Korichi_Celeste) <a href="https://twitter.com/Korichi_Celeste/status/1980446851368473007?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">jacinthe + lebanne <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pokemonlegendsza?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#pokemonlegendsza</a> <a href="https://t.co/4iwyQ7qaIQ">pic.twitter.com/4iwyQ7qaIQ</a></p> <p>‚Äî yawn‚Ä¶ (@yawntchi) <a href="https://twitter.com/yawntchi/status/1980932939430125871?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Doodles of Lesbianne.

            <title><![CDATA[Game Pass Might Be Hitting Its Best 31-Day Stretch Of Releases Ever]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Game Pass‚Äô history is full of peaks and valleys. That‚Äôs the nature of a subscription-based service, and also one of the challenges Microsoft has struggled to overcome as it seeks to grow that part of its gaming empire. But right now? October 2025 heading into November 2025? This is arguably the service‚Äôs hottest stretch ever. The big question, of course, is whether this will prove to be another anomalous blip in Game Pass‚Äô chaotic and ever pricier trajectory, or a sign Microsoft has finally purchased enough of the wider gaming industry to combat churn and fuel the service for years to come.</p> <p>The month-long period is question began on October 17 with the launch of <em>Keeper</em>, the first new Double Fine game in four years. It‚Äôs a beautiful, evocative, and weirdly clever puzzle adventure that echoes back to the Xbox Live Arcade days of <em>Limbo</em> and <em>Fez</em>. It concludes on November 17 with the launch of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> which is likely to be the antithesis of <em>Keeper</em> in every way, including that it will probably go on to be the best-selling game of 2025.</p>

 <p>Within that 31-day window is a truckload of other day-and-date releases available on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or its cheaper PC equivalent. Here‚Äôs every <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/22/xbox-game-pass-october-2025-wave-2/">day-one game</a> coming over the next few weeks:</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Keeper ‚Äì </em></strong><em>October 17</em></li> <li><strong><em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em></strong><em>‚Äì October 21</em></li> <li><em><strong>PowerWash Simulator 2 </strong></em>‚Äì October 23</li> <li><strong><em>Bounty Star</em></strong><em>‚Äì October 23</em></li> <li><strong><em>Super Fantasy Kingdom</em></strong> <em> ‚Äì </em>October 24</li> <li><strong><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></strong> ‚Äì October 29</li> <li><strong><em>Football Manager 26</em></strong> ‚Äì November 4</li> <li><strong><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></strong> ‚Äì November 17</li> </ul> <p>Most of these games haven‚Äôt come out yet so I have no idea if they will live up to the hype or actually be good. But many of them are also known quantities. <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>? I think I know what to expect. Will any of them be GOTY contenders? Maybe! But I wouldn‚Äôt bet my Game Pass allowance on it. They will probably deliver most of what players expect and make up the critical mass of remaining big console releases heading into the holiday.</p>

 <p>Don‚Äôt forget, we were also supposed to get <em>Moonlighter&nbsp;2: The Endless Vault</em> on Game Pass this week before it was delayed just out of the 31-day window to November 19 because there were just too many games coming out in October. Look further outside that period and you have great day-one games like <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> and <em>Ball x Pit</em>. Look beyond the day-one criteria and you have the upcoming addition of <em>1000xRESIS</em>T, one of last year‚Äôs most mind-bending sci-fi interactive narratives, on November 4.</p>

 <p>Look, if Obsidian somehow totally flubs the quest design and character choices in <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> or the latest <em>Call of Duty</em> single-player campaign crashes and burns, this period probably won‚Äôt go down as the strongest stretch in Game Pass‚Äô history. But it‚Äôll still be close. Microsoft usually tries to sprinkle its bigger day-one releases throughout the year. See the staggered cadence of<em>&nbsp;Starfield</em> and <em>Forza Motorsport</em> in 2023 and <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> in 2024. That‚Äôs how you‚Äôre supposed to do it anyway. But the first half of 2025 also bucked this trend.</p>

 <p>Maybe the only other single-month stretch of Game Pass that can rival it was back in the spring. The end of April added <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> and <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, followed by <em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em> and<em> Doom: The Dark Ages</em> in the first half of May. Microsoft brought <em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em> back to Game Pass during that period, too, just for good measure. Will the service stay in this high gear going into 2026 or was Microsoft just shoving a bunch of stuff out the door in advance of the biggest single price hike in subscription gaming history?</p> <p>The company has been claiming for years that it‚Äôs finally about to turn the corner on its uneven development timelines and shifting release calendars. Will that change the service‚Äôs stalling fortunes or convince console gamers that $360 a year for a buffet of rentals is a price worth paying? Who knows. But it‚Äôs probably the best the service has ever been. Maybe as good as it will ever be.</p>
