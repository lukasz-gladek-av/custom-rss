              <p>Matt Ryan, the actor behind <a href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-assassins-creed-games-worst-to-best-1844019813?_gl=1*5o1ks5*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MjMwOTA2MS4yNDkuMS4xNzQyMzEwMDQyLjYwLjAuMA.."><em>Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag</em>’s</a> main character Edward Kenway, recently told a fan that they <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-voice-actor-teases-remake-1851785327">might have a reason to replay the 2013 pirate game</a>. The <em>Constantine </em>actor said this at a convention signing, and fans took this as a tease of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-4-black-flag-remake-skull-bones-1850596271">potential remake or remaster</a>. However, it sounds like Ryan wasn’t in the clear to even say this much to a fan, as Ubisoft apparently threatened legal action against him after video of the interaction spread online.</p> <p>TikTok user kylo_hd659 posted a video of them meeting with Ryan at Comic Con Manchester at his signing table. When the topic of the <em>Black Flag </em>remaster came up, Ryan explained that he didn’t realize the previous interaction was being recorded, and now that it’s put him in hot water with Ubisoft, he’s keeping his mouth shut on the matter.</p> <p>“The thing is, when that happened, someone was doing this and I was being very free and open and I didn’t know that they were actually recording me on their phone,” Ryan said. “Then the company threatened to sue me. So I say nothing.”</p>

   <p>Ryan points to the camera during this back and forth, so it seems like he’s well aware of it this time. I guess that’s one way to get the word out for people to stop asking about something you aren’t supposed to be talking about. We’ve reached out to Ubisoft for comment and will update the story if we hear back.</p> <p>While Ryan hasn’t returned to <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>or video games since <em>Black Flag</em>, he’s spent much of the decade since playing John Constantine in several DC Comics projects, both in live-action shows like <em>Legends of Tomorrow</em> and in animated shows and movies. Hey James Gunn, if you’re gonna bring the warlock to <a href="https://kotaku.com/superman-israel-palestine-woke-clark-kent-punk-rock-1851786212">the new DC Universe movies</a>, you should bring Ryan back as a personal favor to me. Please, and thank you.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/after-4-hours-with-battlefield-6-i%E2%80%99m-convinced-it-has-the-juice.1259157/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>My first introduction to <a href="https://kotaku.com/bf6-battlefield-6-leak-october-launch-early-access-beta-1851786824"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> came via a trailer in a large warehouse in Los Angeles. The video featured Limp Bizkit singing about a chainsaw. It was loud, bombastic, and frankly a bit embarrassing. But then I sat down and got to play over four hours of EA’s upcoming military FPS, and somehow, by the end, I was so won over by this new game that I almost forgot about Limp Bizkit. Almost.</p> <p>A lot of ink has already been spilled covering <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-crossover-skins-rick-morty-call-of-duty-1851786919"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a>, from the leaks to the multiple alpha tests to various rumors and reports claiming it might cost over $400 million. This is a game that has four different studios (previously five) working on it. A game that EA is seemingly betting the farm on. A game that is meant to return the franchise to greatness after it stumbled in past entries, like <em>BF 2042. </em></p> <p>And EA and Battlefield Studios’ plan to pull all this off with <em>Battlefield 6,</em> launching this October, is simple, but smart: <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-reveal-trailer-teaser-sp-ea-gameplay-1851786894">Make <em>Battlefield 4</em> again</a>, but with better visuals, improved gunplay, and a few ideas to freshen it up. That’s the fan favorite entry. The one people compare every other installment against. It might seem cynical to frame <em>BF6 </em>as “<em>BF4 Again</em>” but it’s practically what EA said during the on-stage event before I played the game. “A spiritual successor to <em>Battlefield 3 </em>and <em>Battlefield 4</em>” were exact words used by one developer. And as a fan of those games, I’m happy to report they (mostly) nailed it.</p>

 <p>I and a whole army of other journalists, critics, and content creators got to play a handful of maps and modes in L.A. as part of a preview event ahead of the game’s full multiplayer reveal that happened on Thursday. (Travel and accommodation were provided to <em>Kotaku&nbsp;</em>by the publisher.) This wasn’t a finished build, but what I played felt good enough to ship.</p> <p>Set in 2027, <em>BF6 </em>returns the franchise to a contemporary military setting. There are no crazy laser guns or robots. Instead, it’s M4s, Abrams tanks, shotguns, dusty streets, and frag grenades. This is a more grounded and gritty military shooter compared to recent <em>Call of Duty</em> entries.</p>

 <h2>Dangerous guns and different classes</h2> <p>Combat is loud and dangerous. The time to kill is fairly short, and headshots are extremely lethal. Every gun I used packed a punch and felt destructive. <em>Battlefield 6</em>, more than anything else, nails its gunplay and combat. Firefights are chaotic, but moving around the very dense but easy-to-navigate maps is a breeze thanks to improved controls.  You can jump out windows, slide, roll when landing, sprint while crouched, and even shoot guns while lying on your back. Even when I was getting my ass kicked by some popular streamer, I still had a good time when playing the franchise’s famous Conquest mode because moving and shooting in <em>BF6 </em>is a joy. But like in <em>BF4 </em>and <em>BF3</em>, you move slowly and deliberately in <em>BF6</em>. Characters feel heavy, as do vehicles, making combat feel less like a twitchy arena shooter and more like a digital simulation of a real war.</p> <p>Adding to that feeling of chaotic, gritty combat is the ability for any player to grab a downed player and drag them to safety before reviving them. I did this many times in my time with the game, often pulling fellow squad members out of harm’s way or out of the scope of a pesky sniper. It’s a small, simple, but surprisingly engaging mechanic that everybody I spoke to after the event loved. I expect some other games might steal it from <em>BF6 </em>in the future.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000614036" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614036"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614036">Screenshot: EA / Battlefield Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>Classes return to <em>Battlefield </em>after being absent from <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-the-kotaku-review-1848123654"><em>2042</em></a><em> </em>at launch (and then later shoved back in via a post-launch update), and they work like they did in <em>BF3/BF4</em>. You can play as Assault, Support, Engineer, and Recon. Each class has a few key abilities and traits that help make them feel different during combat.</p> <p>For example, the Assault trooper takes less fall damage and readies assault rifles quicker than anyone else, helping give them the edge in one one-on-one fights. Meanwhile, the Support trooper—my favorite—can place down chest-high bulletproof walls to provide cover, and can also provide ammo refills to teammates. They can also instantly revive players, which is faster than dragging them out of combat, but not as fun.</p> <p>Having the traditional classes return in <em>Battlefield 6 </em>is both a nostalgic return to what I loved before and also a great reminder that, yeah, this is the best way to do a class-based shooter. However, one big change here from <em>BF4 </em>and <em>BF3 </em>is that classes can now spawn with any weapon. While there are some advantages for picking the specific weapon type suited to each class—like snipers getting to reload scoped rifles without leaving aim-down-sight—this new open weapon system does rob the classes of some individuality.</p>

 <p>This is extremely noticeable in the smaller, more combat-focused modes that take place on specific sections of the larger maps. Here, a sniper becomes less useful, but the Recon troopers’ motion sensor is still nifty. So many players I fought during the event just swapped out a scoped rifle for an SMG. It ended up feeling less like <em>Battlefield 3</em> and more like a <em>Call of Duty </em>clone. Thankfully, EA says <em>BF6 </em>will ship with playlists that feature locked class weapons, which is nice, but I worry how that will split the game’s fanbase in the weeks and months after launch.</p> <h2>Lots of destruction, but smaller maps</h2> <p>On the plus side: <em>BF3 </em>tank lovers, rejoice. Your armored mechanical beasts are very powerful in <em>Battlefield 6.</em> When an enemy tank would appear, I’d panic and dive for cover or try to get as many walls between me and it as possible. And thanks to <em>BF6 </em>bringing back <em>Battlefield’s </em>beloved destruction, tanks and other vehicles can quickly turn the tide of battle by ripping holes in walls or even demolishing sections of buildings. One of the funniest moments involving destruction that I experienced involved someone using a tank to knock out the wall and floor of a building I was camping in, sending me falling below into debris and enemy gunfire.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000614037" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614037"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614037">Screenshot: EA / Battlefield Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>This is what EA is calling “Tactical Destruction,” which is the idea that levels should be extremely breakable and that destruction should not only look cool (which it does) but that it should serve a purpose. A single grenade or rocket can alter a shortcut or change up a hiding spot. I’ll need to see how other maps feel, but so far, what I’ve played has me excited to see how EA and Battlefield Studios design maps to be destructible in tactical ways.</p> <p>Speaking of maps, all of the ones in <em>BF6</em>‘s preview were smaller than what was found in <em>BF 2042</em>. This is a good thing. It means you spend less time looking for action and more time fighting other players in chaotic shootouts. The maps also look gorgeous, with lots of lovely details, most of which get destroyed by the end. I also felt like they all funneled players into firefights efficiently and didn’t feel too barren or busy.</p> <p>The devs at the event said they went back and got inspired by some of the classic maps fans love, and I can feel it. And all but one of the nine maps launching with <em>BF6 </em>are new. (The one exception is the return of Operation Firestorm.) This strikes me as the <em>BF6 </em>devs feeling confident in what they have made, and they should feel that way. These are some damn fine <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-bf2042-season-7-last-ea-motive-future-1851397390?_gl=1*au54e4*_ga*MjA2NzM0ODM3MS4xNzQ5ODUxOTU4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM5Mzg3MzEkbzE1JGcxJHQxNzUzOTQwNzgwJGoxMyRsMCRoMA.."><em>Battlefield</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>maps.</p> <p>I was sad when my four hours with <em>Battlefield 6 </em>were over. As someone who played way, way too much <em>Battlefield 3</em> and<em> Battlefield 4</em>, <em>BF6 </em>is exactly what I wanted. It’s a return to the slower, grittier, louder, and smaller digital battles I (and other fans) prefer. It’s not a confusing and overly large mess, like <em>BF 2042</em>. Instead, <em>BF6 </em>feels like a refined, improved, and perfected version of a game people already loved. It might not be the most original or fresh spin on <em>Battlefield</em>, and that might limit how many new players it brings in. But what’s here is <em>really </em>good, and I can’t wait to play more when <em>Battlefield 6</em> arrives on October 10. Hopefully, I won’t have to listen to Limp Bizkit before I play again.</p> <p>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-key-cards-persona-3-octopath-1851787455</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo%E2%80%99s-game-key-card-showcase-leaves-fans-severely-underwhelmed.1259151/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The line between a bad video game showcase and a great one can be exceedingly slim. Often it only takes one or two surprise reveals targeting the right genres and nostalgia centers for most players to come away with generally positive vibes. The July Nintendo Direct failed on that count. It didn’t help that a fresh flood of Switch 2 game key cards is sapping even some of the most diehard fans of any surplus enthusiasm.</p> <p>The<em> Mario</em> maker’s revelation that Thursday’s presentation would be a “Partner Showcase” instead of an all-out Nintendo Direct was the first blow to ambient online hype levels. Okay, no new 3D<em> Mario</em> announcements or<em> Metroid Prime 4</em> release date. But hey, at least fans could count on some major third-party reveals, including another raft of big ports. Surely Microsoft, rumored to be bringing the big guns to Switch 2 any day now, would show up.</p> <p>Alas, no. Instead, the July Direct offered only a few smaller new game announcements—<em>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection, Octopath Traveler 0</em>, and <em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</em>—and mostly spent its time rehashing stuff we already knew about like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, <em>Borderlands 4</em>, <em>Madden 26</em>, and <em>FC Sports 26</em>. Even a quick look at the next <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> felt thrown together and supremely underwhelming. And there was no big “oh shit!” moment like, say, <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> also coming to Switch 2.</p>

   <p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1me1wgt/gotta_say_that_rat_game_dont_look_half_bad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">litany of Switch 2 fan wish-casting</a> prior to the showcase had gotten out of control, but not even one of the numerous highly anticipated third-party updates made it into the showcase. No more footage of<em> Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, no release date for <em>Hades 2</em>, and no mention of the rumored <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> port. Switch 2 versions of other recent blockbusters were also MIA. No surprise port of <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, or <em>Lies of P</em>. There weren’t even updates on when players will be able to get their hands on the Switch 2 versions of <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> or <em>Elden Ring</em>.</p> <p><em>Chillin’ by the Fire</em>, one of the more unusual games announced during the Direct, now serves as the unlikely encapsulation of this disappointment. It’s a multiplayer game where you sit around a campfire with friends. “Your goal: Campfire Level 10,” reads the description. “The sense of accomplishment you feel when the firebed turns into bright red embers and the pillars of flame illuminate the night sky is more powerful than any scoreboard.” The gimmick is that it works with webcams to put players’ faces around the campfire. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1me35oe/peak_nintendo_switch2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fans were not impressed</a>.</p>

 <p>A Switch 2 port of last year’s <em>Persona 3: Reload</em>, one of the better pieces of news from the event, highlights the other prong of player disappointment. Diehard Nintendo fans like their physical games, RPG players more than most, but the physical version of<em> Persona 3</em> is the latest to rely on a game key card instead of an actual cartridge with the game on it. It was far from the only game key card game announced during the Direct.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo Game-Key Card Partner Showcase 😭 <a href="https://t.co/EUdnlDWPrq">pic.twitter.com/EUdnlDWPrq</a></p> <p>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1950954931621630231?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 31, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> is key card only too, as well as <em>Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac</em>. <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is a game key card on Switch 2, but fortunately it’s also coming to the original Switch where it will have a standard cartridge. Unfortunately, that version of the game <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lvbir7e7lc2l" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will not have an upgrade path</a> to the Switch 2 version, so anyone who opts for the only physical version of the game on a Nintendo platform won’t be able to take advantage of any upgraded performance from the Switch 2 version.</p>

 <p>There are still notable exceptions when it comes to the third-party publishers opting to cut corners with game key cards. At launch, the big one was<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em>, which fit the entire base game and its massive expansion on a 64GB card. <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> is another, as is <em>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion </em>which arrives in September. It can be done, and it’s unfortunate to see many of the publishers of games whose audiences care the most about that sort of the thing being precisely the ones to opt out. No one cares if<em> Madden 26</em> comes on the cartridge, but why is <em>Final Fantasy Tactics </em>on Switch 2 <a href="https://store.jp.square-enix.com/item/NXS_J_A43UA.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just a download code in a box</a>?</p> <p>Does any of this matter to the average Switch 2 owner? Probably not. The console is good and there will be no shortage of games to play this fall. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/708909/nintendo-switch-2-donkey-kong-bananza-exclusive-release-schedule" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo’s slow-drip strategy</a> is, all things considered, probably the smart thing to do. God knows there are more than enough games to keep everyone busy until long after they become worm food. But the last few years of the Switch 1 weren’t exactly blowing fans’ lids off, and the Switch 2’s first summer, with the notable exception of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, has been a bit of a snoozefest. The first Nintendo Direct since the Switch 2 launched could have jolted fans back awake. Instead, the post-launch lull continues.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-lagiacrus-tempered-underwater-1851787435</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds%E2%80%98-lord-of-the-sea-represents-a-new-level-of-challenge.1259145/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Although <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-defeat-mizutsune-bubbles-temper-1851781466">Mizutsune</a> is one of <em>Monster Hunter Wild</em>’s more difficult fights, it doesn’t hold a candle to the recently added Lagiacrus. The “Lord of the Seas” boasts some powerful attacks with considerable range, not to mention a one-of-a-kind underwater combat phase. Here are some tips to conquer the regular and Tempered versions of this aquatic lord.</p> <h2>How to find Lagiacrus</h2> <p>Your first chance to hunt Lagiacrus is with the “Trembling Blue Currents” mission, which becomes available after completing both “A World Turned Upside Down” and “Forest Doshaguma” in Chapter Five. <strong>Afterwards, Lagiacrus will begin to spawn in the Scarlet Forest, Ruins of Wyveria, and the Wounded Hollow.</strong></p> <h2>Lagiacrus’s Weaknesses</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614049" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614049"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614049">Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>As tough as this opponent is, they thankfully have quite a few shortcomings. You’re sure to have a more efficient hunt by keeping the following in mind:</p>

 <p>Elemental Weaknesses: Fire, Ice</p> <p>Weapon Type Weaknesses: Cut, Blunt</p> <p>Breakable Parts: Head, Back (weak point), Tail (can also be severed), Foreleg</p> <p>Susceptible Status Ailments: Blastblight, Exhaust, Paralysis (less effective), Poison, Sleep, Stun (less effective)</p> <p>Items and Traps: Flash Pod, Pitfall Trap, Shock Trap</p> <h2>How to Defeat Lagiacrus</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614050" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614050"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614050">Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Lagiacrus can feel a little contradicting if you’re not familiar with this giant leviathan. Even though they confidently take a Rathalos fireball to the face in their introductory cutscene, Lagiacrus is weak to Fire. They also differ from other water monsters in that they’re not weak to Thunder, and instead use Thunder element attacks. All that to say, <strong>Fire-based weapons and Thunder-resistant armor will go a long way here</strong></p>

 <p>I’ve had the most luck when keeping a +20 Thunder resistance. This hunt isn’t as bad as <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762">Arch-Tempered Rey Dau</a>’s almost endless lightning strikes, but more than half of the attacks are electric. Being afflicted with Thunderblight and subsequently getting stunned is highly likely if your resistance isn’t high enough.</p> <p>Besides a couple of projectile attacks, Lagiacrus’ physical attacks are similar to Mizutsune’s, in that they’ll cover a substantial amount of ground lunging and sweeping their entire body at you. Don’t expect a certain area to feel safer, the way you can lie low underneath <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-zoh-shia-crystals-farm-1851781913">Zoh Shia</a>. Well-timed guards and evades are incredibly important for a fight like this.</p>

 <p><strong>Prioritizing hits to the back is a smart way to restrict some of Lagiacrus’ Thunder attacks and collect the not-so-common Lagiacrus Shockspike material.</strong> Heavy Bowguns and other weapons with long reach will be fine, but Dual Blade users like me mostly have to rely on traps and mounting. A great method for any hunter to dish out damage to the back is by dodging through the monster’s massive discharge attack, since that can reveal a Focus Strike spot for a few seconds after.</p> <p>The environment is a helpful friend in a fight like this. Never hesitate to lead it towards Poisoncups, Sporepuffs, or into a turf war with another monster. On the likely chance it moves to Area 15, trigger the Dam Rubble interactable with your slinger. You’ll deal a lot of damage and knock it down for a bit.</p> <p>Lagiacrus will retreat to the newly added Area 19 at the tail end of the fight. It will briefly surface along the edge of Area 13, where you can trigger Unstable Rubble to fall and knock it out of the water. No matter if you interrupt its journey or not, you’ll track it to Area 19. Keep the hits coming to make the monster dive into the nearby water. This is when you can follow after it and fight the “Lord of the Seas” on its own turf.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000614051" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614051"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614051">Screenshot: Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Bear in mind that underwater combat isn’t as fleshed out as regular combat. While there is free movement and access to the Evade button, you’ll mainly be fighting with your slinger. You can use it to drop Submerged Rubble, collect Piercing Pods, or directly latch onto Lagiacrus in a similar interaction to <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446">Mounting</a>. The latter is the best way to deal big damage during this part of the hunt.</p> <p>Hurt Lagiacrus enough during this phase to trigger a cool cinematic of your hunter smacking the hell out of it and taking the fight back on land. If there isn’t enough damage dealt, the watery serpent will quickly create a whirlpool that unleashes a massive discharge of electricity. Swim as far away as possible to avoid losing a majority of your health or even fainting. Either way, the fight will transition back up top for the final bout. Play it smart and you’ll be done soon enough.</p>

 <p>Tempered Lagiacrus kicks the difficulty up many notches. Attacks are frequently chained together and they all hurt a lot. Evading seems to be a more manageable strategy than guarding against these attacks. I’ve seen great results using the Rey Dau <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-armor-alpha-beta-gamma-arch-1851785351">Gamma armor</a> that’s forged from fighting Arch-Tempered Rey Dau. On top of the included high Thunder Resistance, it offers many other useful skills for both offense and defense. Throw in some Evade Window and Partbreaker decorations to give yourself a real fighting chance.</p> <h2>Lagiacrus’s drops</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614052" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614052"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614052">Screenshot: The Obtainable Materials page for Lagiacrus, highlighting the Lagiacrus Claw+ material.</figcaption></figure> <p>The only thing better than defeating the “Lord of the Seas” is all the parts you get after. Below is a list of every Lagiacrus material, arranged by how often they drop.</p> <p>Lagiacrus Claw+ (100% chance for breaking the Foreleg)</p> <p>Lagiacrus Hide+</p> <p>Lagiacrus Scale+</p> <p>Lagiacrus Shockspike (100% chance for breaking the Back)</p> <p>Lagiacrus Horn+ (100% chance for breaking the Head)</p> <p>Lagiacrus Tail (100% chance for breaking the Tail)</p> <p>Lagiacrus Certificate S</p> <p>Lagiacrus Sapphire</p> <p>I would like to stress that the new Title Update 2 monsters have really scarce drop rates for the rarer materials. If you’re struggling to get the Lagiacrus Sapphire with its ridiculous 1%-2% drop rate, it might be best to wait until a hunt features the material as a Bonus Reward and then <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-investigations-farm-monster-1851785212">save that investigation</a>.</p> <p>This difficulty spike is exactly what the community has been asking for. Here’s hoping Capcom keeps it up with even more difficult monster battles in the future.</p>
