              <p>Crunchyroll will bring a bunch of the biggest manga series to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/crunchyroll-price-increase-mega-ultimate-fan-tiers-1851449985">anime streaming service</a> on October 9 with the launch of Crunchyroll Manga. While there are other manga reader services out there, the fact that lots of people already have a Crunchyroll sub and that Crunchyroll Manga brings many different publishers under a single roof has the potential to make it one of the most convenient options out there for keeping up with <em>One Piece </em>and other big series.</p> <p>The company announced on Thursday that Crunchyroll Manga will be available to all subscribers on iOS and Android, and will launch with works from AlphaPolis, COMPASS, Square Enix, VIZ Media, and Yen Press, followed by additional partners like Shueisha and J-Novel Club later on. There will also be a web version launching on October 15. Here’s the pricing breakdown:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><b>Crunchyroll Fan + Manga</b> – $11.99 USD / $15.49 CAD per month (includes Manga add-on at $4.00 USD / $5.50 CAD)</li> <li><b>Crunchyroll Mega Fan + Manga</b>&nbsp;– $15.49 USD / $17.49 CAD per month (includes Manga add-on at $3.50 USD / $5.00 CAD)</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>And here are some of the big-name series fans will have access to:</p> <blockquote> <ul data-cy="list"> <li><strong><em>One Piece</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Daemons of the Shadow Realm</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>My Dress-Up Darling</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>The Summer Hikaru Died</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Lycoris Recoil</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Delicious in Dungeon</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Sasaki and Miyano</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Tsukimichi: Moonlit Fantasy</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Maiden of the Dragon: Falling for the Demon’s Lies</em></strong></li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>The service will be ad-free and come at no extra cost to people who already have the $16-a-month Crunchyroll Ultimate Fan subscription. Perks for all subscriber tiers include “the ability to download chapters for offline viewing, light and dark mode settings, and the ability to build a personalized reading list with curated recommendations.”</p> <p>Crunchyroll has only become more dominant since it was acquired by Sony and absorbed rival service Funimation back in 2020. It’s been riding the recent hit success of <em>Demon Slayer</em> in particular to new heights. <em>Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle Part 1</em> broke records this year, leaving fans waiting for news on <em>Part 2</em> and <em>3</em>. “Well, we’ve announced that it will be a trilogy of movies, but our partners at Aniplex and Ufotable haven’t decided on dates yet,” Crunchyroll boss Rahul Purini <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/crunchyroll-ceo-demon-slayer-infinity-castle-anime-success-1236377193/">said in an interview this week</a>. “But look, there’s definitely urgency for all of us to bring more <em>Demon Slayer</em> to fans as soon as we can—because we know the urgency is there among the fan base.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Hades 2</em> is finally out of Early Access and Supergiant Games has rolled out the red carpet with patch notes showing every major change as the game enters version 1.0 on PC and comes to Switch 1 and Switch 2. The true ending to Princess Melinoë’s adventure is now live, along with fresh secrets and a bevy of balancing tweaks.</p> <p>Supergiant Games put <em>Hades 2</em> out in Early Access <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-pc-early-access-release-date-surprise-1851458365">back in May 2024</a> and it was already pretty decent. The studio’s been adding more content and fine-tuning its more ambitious scope ever since. In addition to the True Ending and Epilogue, there are also new story events, gift events, keepsakes to discover and fresh artwork and music for players to enjoy. Most of the balance changes are buffs or bug fixes. Appearance rates for resources have undergone some changes as well<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->all Prestige are now Kudos<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->and Tablet of Peace and Rod of Fishing sequences have been sped up.</p> <p>“While <em>Hades 2</em> spent more than four-and-a-half years in development, including about a year and a half in Early Access, it’s also the culmination of all the experience we’ve gained together as a team since Supergiant Games started back in 2009,” director Greg Kasavin wrote in the game’s Discord. “Early Access development was foundational to the entire idea of the original <em>Hades</em>, and proved instrumental to this latest game as well. So, from all of us, thank you for inspiring us to do our best, and we hope you enjoy your time with <em>Hades 2</em>.”</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-ii-the-kotaku-review-2000628064">Opinions may vary</a> on how well this sequel builds on the foundations of the original, but <em>Hades 2</em> is an impressive achievement for a studio that’s retained all seven of its founding members and continues releasing popular indie hits without a CEO or conventional business structure. “I don’t have some kind of magical explanation for why we’ve been able to stick around for this long while some others haven’t been as fortunate,” Kasavin <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/tech/article/hades-supergiant-games-studio-21057611.php">told <em>SFChronicle</em></a> in a new interview. “I do attribute it to the value that we place on sticking together as a team, on keeping our ambitions relatively modest. We don’t have an ambition to grow big for its own sake.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-27-inch-asus-tuf-gaming-monitor-has-never-been-this-cheap-before-now-with-3-year-warranty-included.1309164/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gamers who love multiplayer online combat games where teamwork is key — think&nbsp;<em>Helldivers II</em> or <em>Marvel Rivals</em> — are all too aware that it only takes one laggy teammate to kill an entire mission. It’s not always a slow internet connection or console either — a subpar monitor with a bad refresh time can spell doom for the whole team.</p>
<p>If you end up being&nbsp;<em>that guy</em> who says “sorry, my screen is slow” one time too many, you might find your team membership revoked. This limited-time Amazon deal <em>that guy</em>-proofs you and ensures your screen is totally ready for combat: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4321/">Act now and save 30% off the price of the 27-inch ASUS TUF gaming monitor</a>, a 1440p QHD gaming superstar with a blistering 260Hz refresh rate, Adaptive Sync technology, and many more features that will upgrade your gaming performance. It’s just $229 while this deal is in effect.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4321/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Silky Smooth, Lightning Quick</h2>
<p>First things first — the ultra-fast 260Hz overclocked refresh rate and 1 ms pixel response time. No blur, smooth frames, or delay, even in the fastest action of your favorite shooter or racing game. ASUS doubled down on killing the bluir with their ELMB Sync tech (Extreme Low Motion Blur), and adaptive sync options that keeps things moving even if your graphics card is having a hard time. That translates to less tearing.</p>
<p>The colors pop too, and the anti-glare coating is a huge plus if your rig is located with your back to a window. That, of course, comes in handy if you decide to take a break from gaming to enjoy some streaming or YouTube.</p>



<h2>Not a Space Hog</h2>
<p>The ASUS TUF monitor won’t require a total overhaul of your gaming space either. It’s razor thin and weighs only 11 pounds, meaning it’s also easily wall-mountable of you go that route. The display port and two HDMI 2.0 ports are located in the back of the unit along with an earphone jack, and it comes with DisplayPort and HDMI cables so you can go from unboxing to heavy-duty action in mere minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4321/">The 30% off deal happening right now at Amazon on the 27-inch ASUS TUF gaming monitor translates to a $100 price break</a>, and also to one of the best $230 gaming monitors you’ll find. Finding a gaming monitor with enough speed to keep up with the most intense action gaming at this price is beyond rare, but as limited time deals do, this one could end at any time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/marvel-wolverine-insomniac-logan-height-short-tall-king-2000628829</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fans-can%E2%80%99t-decide-if-the-new-wolverine-game-actually-makes-logan-a-short-king.1309137/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Folks, if I know one thing in this world, it’s the lived experience of being a short king. My 5’3” ass has always seen the world from a lower standing than my peers, and it’s rare for me to come across heroes in media who see the world from that same point of view. Wolverine, the X-Man who has pointy metal claws in his knuckles, is one of the few short kings I have to cling to in popular culture, but a lot of people don’t realize that he’s supposed to be a little guy. In the comics, he’s my height exactly, but so many people know him from the movies where he’s played by 6’2” actor Hugh Jackman. </span><i><span>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </span></i><span>makes a joke about this when, through the magic of filmmaking, Deadpool meets a “comic-accurate” version of Logan who needs a booster seat to sit at the bar. Now, however, Wolfie is getting his own game, and there’s no reason that casting a particular actor has to define the character’s stature. So has Insomniac stayed true to his short king status? Fans can’t seem to agree.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000628728" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628728"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628728">© Insomniac Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Strictly eyeballing it, Logan looks like he’s definitely of short stature in the trailer that premiered during the State of Play showcase yesterday. Some fans note that </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayWolverine/comments/1nppa0b/looks_like_they_actually_made_him_height_accurate/"><span>he definitely appears significantly shorter</span></a><span> than the enemies he’s slicing and dicing, but some don’t think that’s quite enough.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">my gripe is, why is Logan so tall? He should be short and wide <a href="https://t.co/eTMS13BXx9">https://t.co/eTMS13BXx9</a></p> <p>— ✦ JYDAWN ✦ (@_jydawn) <a href="https://twitter.com/_jydawn/status/1971009918087119247?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Sorry, I just took some mild psychic damage at reading someone say that Logan being short would make him a “twink,” and I need people to stop trying to use words they don’t understand. This is an annoying case of both tall people and straight people bastardizing my culture. Anyway, the weird part of the conversation is that people actually somehow think that a short Wolverine would be inherently weird or comical. The Hugh Jackman bit in </span><i><span>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine </span></i><span>was a joke because it showed that Jackman himself would look ridiculous if he were made a foot shorter with minimal changes to his proportions, but a 5’3” man can absolutely fuck up some mutant-hunting baddy as well as a man who towers over him.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We need to banish the idea of 5'2 Logan from existence at this point. People were seriously saying this sized Deadpool Wolverine should be the MCU one. I get it, it's from the comic, but sometimes comic things need to die <a href="https://t.co/90umBvRLYO">https://t.co/90umBvRLYO</a> <a href="https://t.co/X0AwbiohBA">pic.twitter.com/X0AwbiohBA</a></p> <p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/1971197931387785534?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wolverine being 5’2 is legit the worst piece of character lore of all time ngl</p> <p>— Matt b (@hipppyjump) <a href="https://twitter.com/hipppyjump/status/1971068452585800134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>Some of this sentiment is rooted in the fact that many people view shorter men as “less manly” or some such weird, toxic shit, which makes me very glad I opted out of all of that when I became interested in video games as a kid and men in adulthood. When people say that Wolverine should be a hulking beast of a tall guy, it’s usually because it conforms to some idealized image of what a man should look like. But that’s boring, and if that’s your problem, you should grow the fuck up. Wolverine is short in </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975">Marvel Rivals</a>,</span></i><span> and it rules, actually.</span></p>   <p><span>But is Logan a proper short king in </span><i><span>Wolverine</span></i><span>? That we probably won’t know for sure until the game is out and people can rip the models from the files and properly measure him. Insomniac made a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/insomniacleaks/comments/18s4pmr/character_scale/"><span>character scale reference sheet</span></a><span> that was part </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wolverine-ps5-insomniac-games-leak-rhysida-hack-sony-1851111188"><span>of a leak in 2023</span></a><span>, which shows Logan is noticeably shorter than Mystique, Omega Red, and Sabretooth. So it doesn’t look like the studio is trying to size him up </span><i><span>too</span></i><span> much.&nbsp; Even so, Insomniac seems </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grantpdesign.bsky.social/post/3lzmjn7pdrs2g"><span>aware that not everyone thinks he’s short enough</span></a><span>. But shrinking a character model would have a massive ripple effect on nearly every animation in the game, so I’d be very surprised if Insomniac made a real change this far into development. Maybe as a secret unlockable mode down the line, but for now, the height debate will rage on until </span><i><span>Wolverine </span></i><span>launches on PS5 in 2026.</span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/saros-sci-fi-trailer-returnal-housemarque-ps5-state-of-play-2000628274"><i><span>Saros</span></i></a><span>, the next action game from </span><i><span>Returnal </span></i><span>developers Housemarque, was one of the tentpole games during yesterday’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/state-of-play-playstation-5-sony-stream-youtube-twitch-2000628258"><span>State of Play presentation</span></a><span>. The game stars </span><i><span>iZombie </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>The Fall of the House of Usher </span></i><span>actor Rahul Kohli as Arjun Devraj, a soldier investigating a foreign planet full of vicious aliens who will kill him over and over again. Kohli has starred in a few video games, including </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/modern-warfare-3-call-of-duty-single-player-campaign-1850991005"><i><span>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stray-gods-review-musical-songs-grace-laura-bailey-1850747942"><i><span>Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical</span></i></a><span>, but this is easily his biggest game role yet, and the dude seems stoked to be there.</span></p> <p><span>In a post on Bluesky, Kohli laid out how video games have always been part of his hopes and dreams. As a kid, he wanted to make video games. He used to work in a game store, and one of his first acting gigs was in a commercial for </span><i><span>LittleBigPlanet </span></i><span>on Vita. So really, it’s all been leading up to this point.</span></p>    <blockquote><p><span>I know it’s cliche to say “this is a dream come true” but in the case of </span><i><span>Saros</span></i><span>, it really is. My first hobby/love was gaming. Before I left primary school, we were asked in assembly to tell the school what we wanted to do for a career. I played a VHS of video game trailers and said I wanted to make video games.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>One of my first jobs was working as a sales assistant at Gamestation (the UK equivalent of GameStop). One of my earliest paid acting gigs was a commercial for Little Big Planet on the PS Vita – I thought I finally made it. My next gig after starring in </span><i><span>iZOMBiE</span></i><span> was playing Fahz in </span><i><span>Gears 5</span></i><span>, I didn’t think anything could top that… until I was approached by Housemarque to play the lead in </span><i><span>Saros</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s been a long journey to get here, each moment along the way was special and the final destination isn’t just a career highlight, it’s one of the best moments of my life. Thank you HouseMarque with trusting me with your character, I hope Arjun is everything you asked for. And for the players, see you on March 20th.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>That’s sweet. I was a big fan of Kohli’s performance in </span><i><span>The</span></i> <i><span>Fall of the House of Usher</span></i><span>, so I’m interested to see what he brings to the role of Arjun when </span><i><span>Saros </span></i><span>comes to PlayStation 5 on March 20. </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-cuts-its-profit-on-this-hp-laptop-1tb-windows-11-pro-office-now-hps-clear-best-seller-2000628760</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-cuts-its-profit-on-this-hp-laptop-1tb-windows-11-pro-office-now-hp%E2%80%99s-clear-best-seller.1309089/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>HP offers laptops across every tier, from budget-friendly entry machines to premium models well above $2,000. The truth, though, is that for day-to-day life you don’t need to spend that kind of money to get a solid computer. What most people really want is a fast system that launches quickly, runs smoothly for work or study, and doesn’t choke when multitasking.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what this early Prime Day deal delivers. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4317/">the HP 15.6” (1TB SSD, 16GB RAM, Intel Celeron N4500, Windows 11 Pro, Office 2021 lifetime) is down to $369 on Amazon, a massive drop from its usual $619 price</a>. At an <strong>all-time low</strong>, this 40% cut makes it one of the sharpest choices for anyone eyeing a Windows laptop under $400.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4317/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Big Specs, Tiny Price</h2>
<p>This HP is powered by the Intel Celeron N4500 processor which is perfect for regular use. Graphics are handled with built-in Intel UHD which is more than enough for Netflix marathon binge-watching, Zoom calls, and light web-based gameplay. With 16GB of RAM paired with it, it performs remarkably well.</p>
<p>What’s more, you’re getting a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD which not only gives you vast room for storing files but it also keeps boot times and launch speeds fast. To put that into perspective, a terabyte is equivalent to about 250,000 high-definition images or hundreds of full-length movies without making you wince before downloading or saving.</p>



<p>The display hits a sweet balance for productivity and entertainment: A 15.6-inch Full HD panel with anti-glare IPS technology means crisp detail and wide viewing angles. The ultra-quiet design is another touch that makes it comfortable in libraries or shared family spaces. Two stereo speakers provide great sound for video conferencing or casual listening and the built-in HD webcam makes this an absolute no-brainer option for work-from-home and learning stations.</p>
<p>You get connectivity updated the way you want it to be. Wi-Fi 6 offers faster and more consistent wireless connectivity while Bluetooth 5.3 lets you connect the latest accessories seamlessly. For the wired, you get a full complement of ports that bend and flex: one USB-C 3.2 Gen 1, two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, HDMI 1.4b for the external monitor, Ethernet RJ-45 for hardwired internet access, headphone/mic combo port, SD card reader and of course the standard AC power port.</p>
<p>One of the biggest benefits is that it ships with Windows 11 Pro pre-installed straight out of the box, that is a version built for business and personal productivity alike. Added to that, this PC features lifetime Microsoft Office 2021 (meaning Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, and OneDrive are all included) with no extra charge. Having a WOWPC Recovery USB included is also a bonus and it makes system resets that much easier should things ever go wrong.</p>
