              <p><em>Mewgenics</em>, the new roguelite RPG battler from <em>The Binding of Isaac </em>developer Edmund McMillen and&nbsp;<em>The End Is Nigh</em>‘s Tyler Glaiel, has proven to be an extraordinary success. Launched February 10, during less than a week on sale has hit the #2 spot on Steam’s bestsellers and seen an extraordinary 115,428 simultaneous players—extraordinary because this is a single-player, offline game. At the time of writing it has more people playing than&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>. Given this, McMillen has announced that the game will be coming to consoles <em>and </em>receiving DLC. Oh, and it’s incredible soundtrack is now available to buy.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-edmund-mcmillen-roguelike-impressions-2000666865"><em>Mewgenics</em></a> is the bastard child of <em>Slay the Spire</em>, <em>X-COM</em> and&nbsp;<em>Rogue Legacy</em>, a game about taking a team of cats on an adventure to fight in a series of turn-based RPG battles, then breeding the victors to create your next crew. And while we don’t know officially sales numbers yet, it’s fair to say they’re not small. On launch day, just three hours after the game came out, Glaiel posted that <a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-steam-best-seller-strategy-roguelike-2000667706">the seven-year development budget</a> had already been recouped. Glaiel has also posted that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tylerglaiel.com/post/3mermwjydf22m">650,000 people had played the game by Friday</a>, and assuming those are all legitimate sales, that’s over $12 million&nbsp;<em>after</em> Steam’s cut.</p>   <p>There was also a moment of excitement for the pair when the game showed more players than&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>.</p>   <p>All this means there’s budget and an assumed audience to bring the game to consoles. There are no specifics yet, with updates promised for later, but given the game works well with a controller it’ll be a natural fit for Xbox, PS5 and Switch. I also cannot fathom why this isn’t already on mobile, given it’d be the perfect medium.</p>

 <p>The success also means DLC is in the works, and that’s no small feature either, given the core game is so big that the developers reckon still no one’s finished it.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mewgenics updates: <br>-OST is live on the steam page <br>-it’s coming to consoles ( updates later )<br>-there will be dlc <br>-update with some bug fixes soonish<br>-mewgenics merch here &gt; <a href="https://t.co/lKGyqrsAU8">https://t.co/lKGyqrsAU8</a></p> <p>— 🜏 Edmund McMillen 🜏 (@edmundmcmillen) <a href="https://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen/status/2023170140435796357?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Certainly not least, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4415490/Mewgenics_ULTIMATE_Original_Soundtrack_Of_All_Time/">the OST is now up on Steam</a>. It contains an astonishing 82 tracks, and only 27 of them are instrumentals. That means you can hear all the originally recorded songs that pop up while playing, with all their barmy lyrics, even if you can’t reach the second act.</p>

              <p>Given the current extended wave of Pokémon card lunacy began with Logan Paul in 2020, perhaps this weekend’s sale of the YouTuber’s Illustrator Pikachu card for a completely deranged <strong>$16.49 million</strong> could be the end of it? Bookend this nonsense with the same awful man.</p> <p>Logan Paul’s Illustrator Pikachu is without doubt one of the rarest Pokémon cards in existence. The special card, created in 1997 as part of an illustration contest in Japan, has a unique image of Pikachu with a paintbrush and saw only 41 printed. Of those, only one has ever been graded by PSA (a company that grades all sorts of memorabilia by incredible high standards) to be a 10—a card in perfect condition—and this is the one Paul bought as a stunt in 2022. He paid, in total, $5.275 million, of which $4m was in cash, and the rest in the form of a PSA 9 version of the same card. He then, infamously, <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-pauls-latest-stunt-paying-6-million-for-rare-pi-1848743633">wore the card around his neck for his appearance at Wrestlemania</a> in 2022.</p>

 <p>This was not the first time Logan Paul had pulled this stunt. In 2020, as the world collectively lost its mind during covid, Paul began spending millions on Pokémon packs for attention-seeking streams. At one point he bought a Gem Mint 10 1999 first edition holo Charizard (one of the most sought-after cards) for $150,000, then wore it around his neck to one of his pretend boxing matches against Floyd Mayweather, <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-paul-wore-a-pokemon-card-to-mayweather-fight-say-1847044171">claiming at the time that this act had caused it to become worth a million dollars</a>. Thankfully that wasn’t true, and despite the massive hike in prices across the rest of the hobby, you can still pick up the same card in the same quality <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-rare-holofoil-4-charizard-psa-gem-mtvzj4m">for not much more</a>.</p> <h2>Illustrator Pikachu’s peculiar path</h2> <p>Since 2022, the fate of the Illustrator Pikachu has been bizarrely mixed. In 2022 an Las Vegas Raiders linebacker sold a CGC (rival grading company to PSA) 9.5 for $672,000 <a href="https://kotaku.com/rare-pokemon-card-illustrator-blake-martinez-nfl-retire-1849803410">and celebrated by resigning from the NFL</a>. He’s likely kicking himself still, given in the same year <a href="https://kotaku.com/illustrator-pikachu-pokemon-card-most-valuable-record-s-1848598145">someone bought a poorer quality PSA 7 version for $900,000</a>, which at the time made it the most expensive Pokémon card sale ever, before Logan Paul got one later that year. However, a year later in 2023 a PSA 8 went up for auction at $480,000 and <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-illustrator-pikachu-charizard-ebay-auction-1850200024">didn’t receive a single bid</a>. Then last year, all sense was lost as <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pikachu-illustrator-psa9-auction-2000625686">a PSA 9 Illustrator Pikachu sold for a ludicrous $4,000,000</a>. Why was this card suddenly worth nearly four times more than Paul had sold his for three years earlier? Or six times more than the CGC 9.5? Because these small pieces of floppy cardboard are only ever worth what someone is willing to pay for them.</p>

 <p>But forget all of that now, because <a href="https://www.polygon.com/logan-paul-pikachu-illustrator-pokemon-card-auction-final-sale-price/">as&nbsp;<em>Polygon</em> reported this weekend</a>, Logan Paul just sold his one-of-a-kind PSA 10 Pikachu for $16,492,000.</p> <p><a href="https://goldin.co/buy/?Auctions=202512-1918-3018-925819e2-7bfc-4e60-a624-05d1e2f2d4a3&amp;page=1&amp;sort=Featured&amp;number_of_lots=24">Auctioned by Goldin</a>, alongside Paul’s PSA 10 1999 Charizard, a matching Blastoise, and a factory sealed box of Base Set 1st Edition cards, and a whole bunch of others, they all sold for wildly inflated prices. The headline is obviously <a href="https://goldin.co/item/logan-paul-personally-owned-1998-pokemon-japanese-corocoro-promo-raretua0w?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjAsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">the Pikapainter which went for that $16.5 million</a>, but everything else is equally ridiculous. The Charizard, as described above usually worth $150,000, <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-rare-holofoil-logan-paul-break-4-chajdvc5?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjEsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">went for $954,800</a>; the Blastoise sold <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-rare-holofoil-logan-paul-break-2-blaejo67?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjIsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">for $138,880</a> despite another identical card <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/397613597277">selling for $2000 on eBay yesterday</a>; the matching Venusaur <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-rare-holofoil-logan-paul-break-15-vegq3n7?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjMsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">fetched $75,640</a>; and that box of Base Set went for nearly half a million, <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-factory-sealed-booster-box-36-packsmrlo2?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjQsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">$496,000</a>. So why did the Base Set starters fetch so much higher? Because for some reason PSA agreed to mark the labels on these gradings with “1ST ED—LOGAN PAUL BREAK,” thus in the eyes of collectors making them unique. As for the Pikachu, there’s no rational explanation.</p>

 <p>Obviously this $16.5 million sale smashes all previous records to pieces, and surely—<em>surely—</em>will never be beaten. There has to come a point where humanity recognizes that shiny cardboard is of limited value. At approximately 1.85 grams, this card is worth 55,370 times the price of gold. Which is silly. It’s all incredibly silly.</p>
