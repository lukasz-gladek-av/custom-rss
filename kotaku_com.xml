At the center of the complaint are allegations that Krafton tried to sabotage the Early Access release for one of Steam’s most wishlisted games in order to avoid having to pay a $250 million bonus. “In the name of its bottom line, Krafton has thrown its promises out the window and ripped the game from the hands of both its creators and its community,” the lawsuit claims.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196470" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="123" data-playlist="196470,196299,195922" data-current="196470"><div><p>The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22020.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Those and other allegations are contained in a new 58-page lawsuit, a public version of which was filed in Delaware Chancery Court on July 16 on behalf of ousted Unknown Worlds cofounders Charles Cleveland, Adam “Max” McGuire, and Edward “Ted” Gill (the group’s legal team provided <em>Kotaku</em> with a copy). It details an alleged ramping-up of efforts by Krafton to delay<em> Subanutica 2</em>'s planned 2025 release in order to avoid triggering provisions from the October 2021 sale of the studio that would lead to a $250 million bonus payout if certain sales goals were met through early 2026. </p><p>According to the lawsuit, the terms of that agreement prohibited Krafton from firing any of the founders without cause or interfering in the studio’s business in any way that might impact that payout. Unknown Worlds would “maintain operational control of the Group companies in all material respects, including (for both existing and new products) product roadmap, launch, planning, partnering, budgeting and employee matters” as long as at least one of the cofounders remained employed there. </p><p>The founders claim the business relationship didn’t begin going south until earlier this year when projections for <em>Subnautica 2</em>'s sales were shared with Krafton management, one of which showed them hitting the targets required for the $250 million payout. “During the first week of April 2025, Unknown Worlds’ publishing colleagues in Krafton’s El Segundo, California office traveled to Korea to finalize the marketing and advertising strategy for <em>Subnautica 2</em>’s launch,” the lawsuit reads. “Upon their return, the El Segundo team—Krafton employees—reported to Gill that Krafton’s leadership was not focused on a successful launch, but instead on how it could convince Unknown Worlds to delay the game.”</p><p> Things came to a head in a May 2025 milestone review, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101">portions of which leaked online last week</a></span>, in which Krafton argued the game needed more content and development time against the recommendation of the founders. From there, the founders alleged that Krafton began trying to sabotage the launch by locking down all publishing resources, failing to respond to emails with third-party partners, and claiming control over the final release date decision. </p><p>“One of Krafton’s El Segundo publishing employees reported to Gill that Krafton Headquarters told all Krafton teams to stop all creative tasks related to <em>Subnautica 2</em>,” the lawsuit reads. “The employee’s supervisor even demanded that he and his team cease communication with Unknown Worlds altogether.”</p><p>Then in June, according to the lawsuit, Krafton tried to get Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill to take a lower payout while also claiming that the founders were failing in their contractual obligations to the company. “On June 25, 2025, Krafton’s Head of Corporate Development told Gill that Krafton’s plan was to remove the Unknown Worlds board and fire the Founders,” the lawsuit reads.</p><p> “She warned Gill that ‘the lawyers are ready to go.’” They were fired roughly a week later, with termination letters from Striking Distance Studios CEO Steve Papoutsis, who has since taken over Unknown Worlds, blaming the founders’ “intention to proceed with a premature release of<em> Subnautica 2</em>.” According to the lawsuit, the firings were made “without cause,” and Krafton even went so far as to offer them their “post-termination payments and benefits” for being terminated “without cause.” </p><p>The lawsuit concludes:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>In short, Krafton flagrantly breached both the letter and the spirit of the promises at the very core of its agreement to purchase Unknown Worlds. It promised to leave creative and operational control in the hands of the Founders. Promise broken. It promised to consult with the Founders before taking any action that could harm the earnout. Promise broken. It promised not to take any action with the primary business purpose of frustrating the earnout. Promise broken. And it promised not to terminate the Founders without Cause. Promise broken.</p></blockquote><p>The founders’ side of the story comes after weeks of vague statements on Reddit and confusing press releases from Krafton, who has argued that the founders were fired for failing to get <em>Subnautica 2</em> ready for a successful Early Access release. In particular, the leaked milestone review points to concerns that a lack of biomes and story content would result in the game failing to meet player expectations for a sequel. It’s denied that the prospective payout, 10 percent of which was due to some of Unknown Worlds’ roughly 100 developers, had anything to do with the management shakeup. </p><p>Caught in the middle are those working on the game who still need to deliver it, one way or the other. With <em>Subnautica 2 </em>now coming out in 2026, Krafton has promised employees that it will extend the bonus payout window to make up for the delay as well as advance them money from next year’s profit-sharing pool, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MjYwOTQyNSwiZXhwIjoxNzUzMjE0MjI1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWkdJMVNUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.eu_sHgKRf9uj-U3I1UDNgrJnNjE39Q3OcbLzDsn2xWY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MjYwOTQyNSwiZXhwIjoxNzUzMjE0MjI1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWkdJMVNUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.eu_sHgKRf9uj-U3I1UDNgrJnNjE39Q3OcbLzDsn2xWY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Bloomberg</em> reported</a></span>.

The answer: Directly address their complaints in a fun way. </p><p>Here’s the trailer, which is filled with complaints about last year’s game being too slow, not reactive enough, or lacking other important features. And EA confidently offers a solution or improvement for each one. </p><p> “<em>FC 26</em> reflects our ongoing commitment to building this game with and for our community,” said EA Sports exec John Sheppard. “We are players too, and that shared passion drives everything we do. This year brings an overhauled gameplay experience, new Tournaments and Live Events in FUT, all-new Archetype customization in Clubs, and a Career Mode that comes alive through evolving Challenges. We can’t wait for players to feel the difference this September and help shape the future of <em>FC</em>.”</p><p>Now, while we hope the game turns out great, it remains possible that when players get their hands on <em>EA Sports FC 26</em> on September 26, they won’t be happy with what EA has done. But at the very least, I’ll give EA credit for poking fun at itself and offering up a trailer that is unique and memorable. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fc-26-fifa-trailer-reveal-complaints-soccer-ea-sports-1851786431]]></content:encoded>

And now <em>Destiny 2 </em>has taken the orb to its natural conclusion: transforming players into one. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196790" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why Everybody Hates This Dragon's Dogma 2 NPC" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="142" data-playlist="196790,195326,196805" data-current="196790"><div><p>Why Everybody Hates This Dragon's Dogma 2 NPC</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196790/196790_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22347.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-edge-fate-menu-music-d1-bungie-1851786347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-edge-fate-menu-music-d1-bungie-1851786347">The newest expansion, <em>The Edge of Fate</em></a></span>, has a new mechanic called Matterspark that makes players become balls of light that roll around like little glowing Samus Arans to navigate secret tube passageways. It is without a doubt the worst thing Destiny has ever forced me to do. </p><p>That’s not hyperbole, nor is intended as a slight against the very thoughtful developers at Bungie. I simply do not like taking a break from what <em>Destiny 2</em> does very well—shooting—to do something it does very poorly—platforming as a third-person orb. It feels floaty, sluggish, and a bit chaotic, like trying to navigate a marble through a wooden labyrinth using a magnetic tether. The effect is mildly dizzying. It’s especially bad on PC. </p><p>It doesn’t help that Matterspark is one of the very first things <em>The Edge of Fate</em> campaign introduces you to. In addition to transforming into slithering sphere to reach new areas, there are also generators you can only power when you’re an electric ball, forcing you to constantly shift between forms to bring down barriers and progress the mission. </p><p>My friend came over last night for dinner. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-free-final-shape-edge-fate-expansion-ps5-1851785927?_gl=1*v4obb9*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI2NzYwMjAkbzc3MiRnMSR0MTc1MjY3NjA4MCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-free-final-shape-edge-fate-expansion-ps5-1851785927?_gl=1*v4obb9*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTI2NzYwMjAkbzc3MiRnMSR0MTc1MjY3NjA4MCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">He’s one of the people I keep trying to convince to play <em>Destiny 2</em> with me</a></span>. He saw me puttering around combat like a golf ball stuck in a sand trap and howled with laughter. There is absolutely no way I’m convincing him to buy <em>The Edge of Fate</em> now. </p><p>I was skeptical of Matterspark, since Bungie originally revealed it in a livestream in May. Turning into a ball and reaching secret places in the <em>Metroid </em>franchise is cool because those games are specifically designed around exploration, backtracking, and experimentation.<em> Destiny 2</em> is not. It’s a game about loading into a sci-fi obstacle course and ruthlessly murdering everything in sight as quickly as possible. </p><p>It’s certainly played with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-the-taken-king-kicks-ass-so-far-1731000770&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-the-taken-king-kicks-ass-so-far-1731000770">more open-ended exploration over the years</a></span>, both in terms of platforming and in terms of shooting puzzles that unlock hidden secrets. Turning into an orb, unfortunately, doesn’t play to either of those strengths. It makes platforming feel worse and disables my guns. In that way, Matterspark is part of a worrying trend in modern <em>Destiny</em>, one that pursues novelty at the risk of sidelining the reason I actually want to play the game: the best-feeling shooting of any FPS ever. </p><p><em>The Edge of Fate</em> makes a pretty poor first-impression in general. My <em>Destiny 2</em> hype train currently has a full head of steam, but it’s already threatening to be derailed. I don’t like Kepler yet, the new zone which is sparrow-less and feels overly constricted while at the same time lacking a clear vibe to spark the imagination. It’s a lot of rocks with alien pustules growing on them. I don’t like the new streamlined Ops menu that feels like a <em>Call of Duty </em>HQ funnel, or that the more creative planet map it replaces has been desaturated to signal its forced obsolescence. </p><p>It’s nice—a relief even!—seeing gear scores reset to 10 as we begin the power climb anew, but I would prefer to skip over the blues (rare loot) and get right to the good stuff again (purple legendries/exotics). The new gear chase and upcoming raid might be <em>The Edge of Fate</em>’s saving grace. A completely new system means chasing new weapons and armor in order to take advantage of the most powerful builds. The grind could be fun. It could also be incredible tedious. But I’ll take that over being subjected to another Matterspark objective. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-edge-fate-matterspark-kelper-metroid-ball-1851786415]]></content:encoded>
