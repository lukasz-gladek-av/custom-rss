              <p>Premium noise-canceling headphones are a big investment, but they can turn your commutes, flights, and focus sessions into private audio bubbles anywhere. The <strong>Bose QuietComfort Ultra</strong> headphones in <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6405/">this limited edition Deep Plum color are on sale for $279 on Amazon, down from their list price of $429</a> and it is<strong> the lowest price ever</strong> which makes them almost half the price of Apple’s Airpods Max.</p>
<p>This “Ultra” version is Bose’s ultimate model and it is (way) better than the standard QuietComfort line and has many improvements that make it worthy of the “Ultra” name. The new features are <strong>spatial audio with head tracking</strong>, <strong>CustomTune technology</strong> that changes the sound to fit the shape of your ear and <strong>Immersion Mode</strong> which combines the best noise cancellation with three-dimensional audio.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6405/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Head Tracking and Spatial Audio Make Personal Concert Halls</h2>
<p>The QuietComfort Ultra has Bose’s spatial audio technology which turns stereo tracks into<strong> immersive three-dimensional soundscapes</strong> where instruments are placed around your head in specific ways. This technology doesn’t just add fake reverb or widening effects but it actually moves audio elements around to make depth and separation that make music sound more real and interesting. Head tracking sensors know when you turn your head and change the soundstage so that vocals stay in front of you and instruments stay in their places which makes it feel like you’re in a room with speakers, where sound sources stay in one place instead of moving with your head like regular headphones.</p>



<p>CustomTune technology looks at the shape of your ears and how sound travels through your ear canals, and then it automatically changes the audio profile to make up for any differences in how sound travels through your ears. Because of the shape and size of your ears, they respond to different frequencies in different ways. This <strong>personalization makes sure you hear music the way the artist intended</strong>, not a generic tuning that works okay for everyone but not great for anyone. When you first put on the headphones, the calibration process only takes a few seconds and Tone sweeps are played through the drivers while microphones measure how your ears respond.</p>
<p>Immersion Mode uses Bose’s <strong>best noise cancellation and spatial audio processing to make it so that outside noise completely goes away</strong> and music surrounds you in three dimensions. This mode turns flights or commutes into private listening rooms where the sound of engines and people talking goes away completely and when you want to be alone but still want standard stereo imaging, Quiet Mode gives you traditional noise cancellation without spatial processing. Aware Mode sends outside sounds back through the headphones so you can hear announcements, traffic, or conversations without taking them off.</p>



<p>The microphone array uses beamforming technology to focus on your voice while filtering out background noise which means that calls sound clear even in busy streets or coffee shops. The call quality on older Bose models was okay, but <strong>the Ultra is much better because it has better signal processing</strong> that separates speech from background noise more effectively.</p>
<p>The<strong> battery lasts for 24 hours of regular audio playback</strong> and 18 hours of Immersion Mode, which is enough time for several international flights or a full work week without needing to be charged. The quick charge feature lets you listen for 2.5 hours after just 15 minutes of being plugged into USB-C which is great for when you forget to charge overnight and need to leave quickly.</p>
<p>Dropping from $429 to $279 makes the <strong>QuietComfort Ultra cheaper than the standard QuietComfort models</strong> typically sell for during sales which is a rare opportunity to get flagship features at mid-tier pricing. The combination of personalized tuning, immersive spatial processing and exceptional call quality delivers outstanding value at this discounted price point.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-era-100-bluetooth-and-wifi-speaker-drops-to-record-low-price-amazon-offloads-last-units-before-christmas-2000653537</link>
            <guid>1384162</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are a lot of Bluetooth speakers to choose from, from cheap ones to expensive ones. But Sonos always comes out on top in the mid- to high-end range, where sound quality matters more than just getting loud. The<strong> Era 100 is Sonos’s small smart speaker</strong> for rooms where full-sized speakers are too big <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5807/">and it’s now $169 on Amazon, down from its original price of $199</a>. This is the lowest price ever just before Christmas which makes it a great gift for music lovers who value good sound quality over flashy features.</p>
<p>The Era 100 has <strong>WiFi streaming, Bluetooth connectivity, and Trueplay room correction</strong> all in one small package that can fit on a kitchen counter or nightstand. It also has stereo separation that most single-unit speakers can’t match which makes it the perfect way to get started with Sonos or a useful addition to an existing multi-room setup.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5807/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Architecture with two tweeters</h2>
<p>Sonos designed the Era 100 with t<strong>wo tweeters that point outward to create real left and right channel separation in one box</strong> which makes music sound wider and more open than regular mono speakers. The two tweeters in this design let you hear instruments spread out across a soundstage instead of all coming from one point in space. The new Sonos speakers have a processor that is 47% faster than the old ones and lets them process audio more accurately, even at high volumes, so they don’t distort like other speakers do when they are pushed too hard. The<strong> midwoofer is 25% bigger and handles bass frequencies with authority</strong>, and gives you a low-end punch that you can feel in your chest without needing a separate subwoofer for most types of music.</p>



<p>Trueplay tuning technology turns the Era 100 from a good speaker into one that works best in your room by <strong>using your iPhone’s microphone to figure out how sound bounces off of walls, furniture, and other surfaces</strong>: You walk around the room waving your phone, which lets the speaker map the room’s acoustic features and change its output as needed. Trueplay makes sure that the sound quality is always the same, no matter where the speaker is. For example, a speaker in a corner sounds very different from one on a bookshelf or kitchen counter.</p>
<p>WiFi streaming is what makes the Era 100 connect: You can access music services like Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and many more directly through the Sonos app. This network-based method gives you better sound quality than Bluetooth compression and lets you play different content in each room or group speakers together. The speaker also works with AirPlay 2, which makes it easy to connect to Apple devices.</p>



<p>The <strong>small size is just under 7 inches tall and 5 inches wide</strong> and makes it easy to put almost anywhere without taking up too much space. The matte black or white finish on the Era 100 makes it look good on both modern minimalist shelves and traditional wood furniture. The top panel has touch controls for play, pause, volume, and skip, so you can interact with it even when your phone isn’t right there.</p>
<p>At this price, the Era 100 is now competitive with mid-range Bluetooth speakers that don’t have WiFi streaming, room correction, or multi-room capabilities.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sonos Offloads Beam Soundbar at Record Low, Now Cheaper Than Basic Alternative and Perfect Christmas Gift]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-offloads-beam-soundbar-at-record-low-now-cheaper-than-basic-alternative-and-perfect-christmas-gift-2000653510</link>
            <guid>1384141</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Flat-screen TVs are getting thinner and better looking all the time, but this design change means that the sound quality suffers because manufacturers can’t fit good speakers into panels that are only a few millimeters thick. A good soundbar fills this gap by giving your beautiful 4K or OLED display the sound it needs and make movie nights and music listening truly immersive.</p>
<p>The good news is that the Sonos Beam (Gen 2) <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/">soundbar is now on sale on Amazon for $369, down from its list price of $499</a>. This is the lowest price ever which makes it a great <strong>Christmas gift for yourself or anyone whose TV audio sounds flat and lifeless</strong>. This small soundbar works just as well under wall-mounted TVs or on entertainment centers and brings Dolby Atmos spatial audio and multi-room music streaming to living rooms.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Dolby Atmos</h2>
<p>The Beam Gen 2 processes <strong>Dolby Atmos audio tracks to make height channels that make sound seem to come from above and around you</strong> and adds a vertical dimension to the usual left-right stereo field. This technology for spatial audio makes it sound like helicopters are flying over you, rain is falling from the ceiling, and background noises put you in the scene instead of just in front of it. Psychoacoustic processing and carefully angled drivers that bounce sound off your ceiling make it sound like you have dedicated height speakers without actually installing them.</p>



<p>The Beam’s center channel focuses on voice frequencies to make sure you hear every word without turning up the volume, which is one of the most common complaints about TV audio. With this dedicated dialogue processing, you won’t miss important plot points when people are whispering or need subtitles to understand speech with an accent. When you watch news or dramas with a lot of dialogue, the <em>Speech Enhancement</em> feature in the Sonos app boosts voice frequencies even more. It gives you customizable clarity that works with different types of content.</p>
<p>Trueplay tuning technology <strong>uses your iPhone’s microphone to figure out how sound bounces off the walls</strong> and other surfaces in your room and then automatically changes the Beam’s output to make up for any problems with the sound. Rooms with hard floors and bare walls that make harsh reflections get tuned differently than rooms with carpet and soft furniture that absorbs sound. This calibration process only takes about two minutes, but it makes the sound much better than using generic soundbar settings that assume the same room acoustics.</p>



<p>To set it up, all you need are two cables: <strong>one HDMI eARC cable that goes from your TV to the device and one power cord that goes to an outlet</strong>. The soundbar automatically finds your TV and works with your current remote, so you don’t have to switch between controllers or set up universal remotes. With Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, or Sonos Voice Control, you can change the volume, skip songs, or switch inputs without using a remote. With Apple AirPlay 2 support, you can stream music wirelessly from iPhones, iPads, and Macs.</p>
<p>The Beam Gen 2 is now competitive with mid-range soundbars that don’t have Dolby Atmos or multi-room capabilities because the price dropped from $499 to $369. Anyone who wants to improve their TV’s sound quality beyond the mediocre built-in speakers will get a lot of value from it.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dell-i7-1tb-laptop-rated-5-5-stars-drops-73-off-on-amazon-crashes-to-all-time-low-with-200-bonus-pack-2000653526</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Smart shoppers know that paying full price on official brand websites often means leaving hundreds of dollars on the table that could stay in your pocket. A capable laptop doesn’t require a $2,000 investment when strategic shopping reveals the same specs at drastically lower prices through different retailers.</p>
<p>This Dell Inspiron 15″ touchscreen <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6406/">laptop sells for $759 on Amazon right now, marked down from its typical $2,799 price tag</a>, while Dell’s official site shows no such promotion. This is <strong>a record low that slashes over $2,000 off</strong> a machine featuring a 13th-generation Intel Core i7 processor, 16GB RAM, and a 1TB SSD that handles everything from office work to content creation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6406/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>13th-Gen Intel Core i7 Has Processing Power That Lasts for Years</h2>
<p>The<strong> Intel Core i7-1355U processor has 10 cores</strong> which are split between performance and efficiency cores which lets it handle demanding applications while still having a good battery life. This hybrid architecture gives performance cores to heavy tasks like video rendering or compilation and efficiency cores to light workloads and background processes. The processor can boost up to 5.0 GHz, which gives it the power it needs to run professional software like Adobe Premiere, AutoCAD, or Excel spreadsheets with thousands of rows.</p>



<p>The <strong>15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen</strong> is useful in a way that some touch-enabled laptops aren’t. When editing photos, adding notes to documents, or scrolling through long web pages, it feels natural to directly interact with interface elements. The WVA panel doesn’t glare, so you can still see it in bright offices or near windows where shiny screens turn into mirrors. Windows 11’s touch support is better than in previous versions and it has better palm rejection and gesture controls that are more responsive, which makes people more productive instead of annoying them with accidental inputs.</p>



<p>The <strong>85% screen-to-body ratio</strong> makes the bezels around the display as small as possible, giving the laptop a modern look and maximizing the amount of screen space within its physical footprint. The wide range of ports, <strong>which includes both legacy USB-A ports and modern USB-C ports</strong>, fixes one of the most annoying trends in modern laptops. For photographers and videographers who need to transfer footage from their cameras, <strong>the SD card reader</strong> is a must-have and <strong>HDMI 1.4</strong> makes it easy to connect to external monitors without needing dongles.</p>
<p>The Windows 11 Pro edition has business features that the Home edition does not, such as BitLocker encryption, Remote Desktop, and Hyper-V virtualization. This makes this laptop good for workplaces that need extra security. With the Pro license, you also have more control over Windows updates. With Copilot AI integration, Microsoft’s generative AI assistant is built right into the operating system and can help you write, generate code, and provide contextual help without having to switch to other apps or websites.</p>
<p>This i7-powered laptop is now in the same price range as budget Chromebooks and entry-level Windows machines with much worse specs, thanks to a savings of more than $2,000. At this price point, many laptops still come with older i5 processors, 8GB of RAM, and smaller SSDs and this Dell configuration stands out from the rest.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Hits Mini PCs Hard, Apple’s Newest Mac Mini at Record Low Price Makes Mid-Range Options Obsolete]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-hits-mini-pcs-hard-apples-newest-mac-mini-at-record-low-price-makes-mid-range-options-obsolete-2000653505</link>
            <guid>1384105</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Mini PCs are a niche category where lesser-known brands dominate by assembling components into compact machines that prioritize space-saving over brand recognition. Apple’s Mac mini faces virtually no real competition in this segment, and combines<strong> iconic industrial design with performance and connectivity that generic mini PCs struggle to match</strong>.</p>
<p>The latest Mac mini with <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">M4 chip and 256GB SSD storage currently sells for $479 on Amazon, reduced from its $599 list price</a>, and hits a record low that eclipses the competition just before Christmas. This newest generation shrinks the already-compact form factor down to five by five inches while packing a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU that outperforms most desktop computers twice its size.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Desktop Performance</h2>
<p>The M4 chip is Apple’s fourth-generation custom silicon and it <strong>has a 10-core CPU that is split into performance and efficiency cores</strong> which handle demanding tasks and background processes in a smart way. This architecture gives the Mac mini performance that is on par with Intel and AMD desktop processors, but it uses much less power.</p>
<p>This means that the Mac mini can run quietly without the loud fan noise that comes with most desktop towers. The <strong>10-core GPU can handle graphics-heavy tasks</strong> like editing photos in Lightroom, editing 4K videos in Final Cut Pro and even playing moderate games through Apple Arcade or native Mac games. Unified memory architecture gives the CPU and GPU 16GB of memory to share and gets rid of the slowdowns that happen when separate graphics cards have to move data back and forth between system RAM.</p>



<p>The new chassis is only five by five inches which is about the same size as a big coffee mug on a desk. It can do the same things that a full-size desktop tower can do. This smaller size makes the Mac mini perfect for minimalist desk setups, small apartments where space is at a premium, or workstations with multiple monitors where tower PCs would take up too much space. The aluminum construction passively dissipates heat while keeping the high quality that Apple products are known for.</p>
<p>Port configuration finally fixes one of the Mac mini’s long-standing problems by adding <strong>USB-C ports on the front and a headphone jack</strong> that makes it easier to reach around than in previous generations. The front ports make it much easier to connect USB drives, charging cables, or headphones on a daily basis. The back panel still has<strong> Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI output, and Gigabit Ethernet for permanent connections</strong>. Thunderbolt 4 can connect up to three 6K displays or one 8K display and gives creative professionals and productivity users the ability to use more than one monitor at a time.</p>



<p>With Apple Intelligence integration, AI-powered features are built right into the operating system: These features include help with writing, summarizing emails, and organizing photos intelligently without sending data to other servers. This <strong>processing on the device keeps your information private</strong> while also giving you features like smart replies, automatic transcription, and suggestions based on what you’re doing that help you get more done.</p>
<p>Right now, <strong>the M4 Mac mini is now cheaper than many prebuilt Windows desktops</strong> that don’t come with a monitor and have worse processors.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ROG Strix G16 Laptop With RTX 5070, 1TB SSD and Ryzen 9 Hits New Low, Amazon Cuts All Profit Margin]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/rog-strix-g16-laptop-with-rtx-5070-1tb-ssd-and-ryzen-9-hits-new-low-amazon-cuts-all-profit-margin-2000653501</link>
            <guid>1384054</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Serious gamers demand hardware that won’t bottleneck their competitive edge or compromise visual fidelity when maxed-out settings matter most. The <strong>Asus ROG Strix G16</strong> (2025 edition) targets this exact audience with bleeding-edge components that few laptops currently offer, including the brand-new Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 GPU powered by Blackwell architecture.</p>
<p>Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6404/">is offering this powerhouse for $1,699 right now, marked down from its $2,099 list price</a>, hitting a record low just before Christmas arrives. This represents one of the rare gaming laptops shipping with the <strong>RTX 5070</strong> and gives early adopters access to DLSS 4 technology and next-generation ray tracing performance that won’t become mainstream for months. The combination of <strong>AMD’s latest Ryzen 9 9955HX processor, 32GB of DDR5-5600 RAM, 1TB SSD and a 240Hz display</strong> creates a no-compromise gaming machine built for competitive esports and demanding AAA titles.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6404/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Changes the Game for Mobile Gaming</h2>
<p>The Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 is a big step forward in technology and its Blackwell architecture makes ray tracing and AI-powered frame generation through DLSS 4 much better. DLSS 4’s multi-frame generation can make games run three times faster by making up to three AI frames for every traditionally rendered frame and it can effectively triple frame rates in games that support it. Max-Q technologies improve power efficiency without lowering performance which means that the RTX 5070 can deliver desktop-class gaming in a portable form factor that doesn’t use up battery life right away.</p>



<p>The AMD Ryzen 9 9955HX processor has a Zen 5 architecture with a lot of cores and boost clocks that go over 5GHz and gives the CPU the power it needs to keep GPU bottlenecks from happening in competitive games. This processor can handle background tasks like streaming, Discord, and playing music without slowing down games which makes it perfect for content creators who game or streamers who need encoding power. The DDR5-5600 memory runs faster than the DDR4 memory from the previous generation and lowers latency and raises bandwidth for games that use a lot of memory and for multitasking.</p>
<p>The 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD loads things so quickly that you only have to wait a few seconds between matches or loading screens. This drive has enough space for your operating system and important apps, as well as modern games like Starfield or Baldur’s Gate 3 that require more than 100GB to install. PCIe Gen 4 speeds can reach up to 7,000MB/s for sequential reads and makes asset streaming smooth and almost completely stops texture pop-in, which is a problem with slower storage solutions.</p>



<p>The ROG Nebula Display has a 2560×1600 resolution and a 16:10 aspect ratio which means it has more vertical screen space than standard 16:9 panels, but it still has the same pixel density needed for clear images. The<strong> 240Hz refresh rate and 3ms response time</strong> get rid of motion blur and ghosting in fast-paced shooting or racing games where every millisecond counts. The new ACR film technology makes contrast ratios better and glare less, so the display can be used in brighter places without reflections washing out darker scenes.</p>
<p>The Intelligent Cooling system from ROG <strong>uses tri-fan technology, a full-width heatsink, and well-placed vents</strong> to get rid of heat without making noise like a jet engine. The advanced thermal design keeps the CPU and GPU from getting too hot during long gaming sessions, which would slow down performance if it weren’t for it. Cooler parts also make hardware last longer because high temperatures over time cause parts to wear out faster.</p>
<p>The RTX 5070 laptop is now at a price point where it competes with last-generation RTX 4070 machines that can’t match the Blackwell architecture’s performance improvements. Most gaming laptops with similar specs cost between $2,200 and $2,600, so this Asus deal is very good for cutting-edge hardware.</p>

              <p>Less than two years after it debuted, Amazon’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2s-first-real-trailer-is-here-and-its-bonkers-2000644032"><em>Fallout</em> TV show</a> is back with season 2, and even earlier than originally promised. New episodes will now kick off a whole 24 hours earlier than previously planned. The company used the Las Vegas sphere to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DSShMHRkmpY/">reveal the reverse-delay</a>.</p> <p>Originally set to launch on December 17, 2025, <em>Fallout</em> season 2 will now begin streaming on December 16 at 9:00 p.m. ET instead. New episodes will be released weekly, with the latest batch wrapping up on February 4, 2026. Walton Goggins’ Ghoul, Ella Purnell’s vault dweller, and Brotherhood of Steel squire Aaron Moten will return as the show moves the focus to New Vegas, the subject of the critically acclaimed video game spin-off by Obsidian Entertainment.</p>   <p>Season 2 adds Macaulay Culkin in an unknown role and Justin Theroux as Mr. House, the guy in charge of New Vegas. It’s unclear exactly how Lucy and the Ghoul’s roundtrip through the desert will unfold, but the show has already <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/fallout-season-2-tv-show-new-vegas-location-deathclaw/">teased Deathclaws</a> and other big monsters making brief cameos. Will we see some Super Mutants too?</p> <p>The show seems likely to wade even more deeply into wasteland conspiracies and factional disputes, but none of it will be resolved in the eight upcoming episodes. Amazon has already renewed <em>Fallout</em> for season 3, and probably will make as many more as showrunner Jonathan Nolan is able to give them. Remember, <em>Fallout</em> isn’t on Netflix or HBO. You’ll need a Prime subscription to watch. Or the password to your friend’s account.</p>
