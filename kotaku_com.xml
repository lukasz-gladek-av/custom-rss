              <p>Losing your keys, wallet or luggage creates instant panic and wastes hours of your day retracing steps or tearing apart your house. Apple’s AirTag solves this problem by turning everyday items into trackable objects through the <em>Find My</em> network. A single AirTag usually costs $29 but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">Amazon’s early Black Friday deal brings a 4-pack down to $64 from the usual $99 price</a>. That’s $16 per tracker instead of $29.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How AirTags Work in Real Life</h2>
<p>Each <strong>AirTag pairs with your iPhone or iPad with just a tap</strong> during setup, and immediately shows up in the Find My app amongst the rest of your Apple devices. An integrated speaker plays a sound whenever you trigger it through the app to help you locate items that are wedged between the couch cushions or deep in your bag. You can also ask Siri where your keys or wallet are, and the associated AirTag will start to beep-beep-beeping without your needing to open any apps.</p>



<p>The real magic happens when your item leaves Bluetooth range which extends about 30 feet in open space. Apple’s Find My network leverages hundreds of millions of iPhones, iPads, and Macs around the world that anonymously detect nearby AirTags and report their location back to you in a crowdsourced way. This kind of tracking works passively in the background on other people’s devices without them knowing or needing to do anything.</p>



<p>Lost Mode is the feature that turns on when you mark an item as missing in the Find My app. Immediately,<strong> the AirTag will alert you when any device in the Find My network detects it</strong>, and that provides real-time updates on where the item might be. You can also include a phone number with the AirTag, allowing a person who finds your lost item simply to tap their iPhone or any other NFC-capable smartphone on it and display your contact information to get in touch with you to return it.</p>
<p>The sharing feature lets <strong>up to five people track a single AirTag</strong>, which is perfect for household items that multiple family members use. Your partner can locate the shared car keys just as easily as you can, and everyone gets notifications if the item gets left behind. Each AirTag runs on a replaceable CR2032 battery that lasts about a year before needing replacement, and the Find My app notifies you when the battery runs low. The<strong> trackers are rated IP67 for water and dust resistance</strong> which means they survive splashes and brief submersion up to 1 meter for 30 minutes.</p>
<p>At $16 per AirTag in this 4-pack versus $29 individually, you’re getting the coverage you actually need at a price that makes sense.</p>

              <p>Most people can’t justify dropping $2,000 on a laptop, especially when reliable performance for basic tasks like browsing, video calls, and document work will suffice. That’s where HP’s 15.6-inch touchscreen laptop hits (Intel Core i3, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD), right between capability and affordability: Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5291/">it’s selling for $626, slashed from its usual price of $1,999</a>. That’s a discount of $1,373 that brings professional-grade specs within reach, and HP sweetens the deal even further with $299 worth of bonus accessories.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5291/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Built for Everyday Computing</h2>
<p>The Intel Core i3-1315U processor brings six cores to the table: performance cores for handling demanding tasks and efficiency cores for managing background processes. This 12th-generation chip reaches speeds up to 4.5GHz when you need some extra power.</p>



<p>That 32GB of DDR4 RAM is the real game-changer here: Most budget laptops ship with 8GB or maybe 16GB, which forces you to close applications constantly to avoid lag. This much memory future-proofs the machine by ensuring that it stays fast as software becomes more demanding over the course of several years.</p>
<p>With 1TB SSD storage, you can install your operating system, applications, photos, and videos including a music library without having to go through the inconvenience of deleting files or managing external drives. Solid-state drives load Windows and applications in seconds, while old-school hard drives take minutes.</p>



<p>The 15.6-inch HD screen adds intuitive interaction to your daily workflow. You can tap icons, swipe through photos, pinch to zoom in documents, and scroll through web pages with your fingers. Touch makes Windows 11 feel more natural and instinctive, especially for creative tasks or casual browsing. The HD resolution provides clear text and snappy images for spreadsheets, presentations, and video playback, even if it’s not quite as crisp as Full HD screens on pricier models.</p>
<p>It comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro which gives you access to features you don’t find in any Home edition, such as BitLocker encryption to keep sensitive files safe, Remote Desktop to access your laptop from elsewhere, and enhanced security tools designed for business. Thanks to fast charging technology, it gets your battery back to practical levels in a short time and minimizes any downtime when working on the go.</p>
<p>The <strong>$299 accessory kit that accompanies this deal</strong> throws in some practical extras, such as a laptop sleeve to keep it protected on the go, a wireless mouse for easier navigation, and other niceties that would cost you extra otherwise. For $626, this HP laptop gets you the specs and features most people actually need without the premium price tag.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gta-6-leaks-delay-developers-fired-rockstar-games-union-2000641525</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-6-studio-says-devs-were-fired-for-leaking-company-secrets.1345195/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, over 30 developers <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-games-union-busting-delay-2000640525">were fired from Rockstar Games</a>. A trade labor group claims the <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> studio was union busting, but Rockstar Games now claims the employees were leaking sensitive information. The dispute comes just as the long-awaited blockbuster is getting ready to ship in May 2026.</p> <p>“Last week, we took action against a small number of individuals who were found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum, a violation of our company policies,” a Rockstar spokesperson <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MjM4NDU1NSwiZXhwIjoxNzYyOTg5MzU1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNUEwS0JHUFdDTDgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.PipR6t4x9M3EqRs9jXeXrZNn3d-RZBZhXyh8pTYZhFs">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. “This was in no way related to people’s right to join a union or engage in union activities.”</p>

 <p>Rockstar did not immediately respond to a request for comment clarifying the nature of the confidential information that was allegedly disclosed.</p> <p>The ex-Rockstar developers were in a private message group on Discord with the Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) when they were fired last week for what parent company Take-Two called at the time “gross misconduct.” The IWGB has been seeking to organize developers across various UK-based gaming studios, including <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/workers-at-za-um-announce-landmark-recognition-agreement/"><em>Disco Elysium</em> maker ZA/UM</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-development-leslie-benzies-gta-bugs-union-layoffs-2000633983"><em>MindsEye</em> maker Build a Rocket Boy</a>.</p>

 <p>“Management are showing they don’t care about delays to <em>GTA 6</em>, and that they’re prioritizing union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game,” IWGB president Alex Marshall told <em>Bloomberg</em> in response to Rockstar’s new allegations. He maintained the fired employees were only discussing issues related to “exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice.”</p> <p>The IWGB did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p><em>GTA 6</em>‘s release date has already slipped once and some are <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/gta-6-launch-postponed">placing bets</a> that it could miss the new May 26 release date as well. The game has had one of the most secretive development cycles of any major blockbuster, outside of the details leaked in <a href="https://kotaku.com/gtavi-gta-vi-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leak-video-dump-1849550414">an unprecedented hack</a> back in 2022. Since then, Rockstar has only released two official trailers.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dell-begins-black-friday-with-70-off-this-1tb-ssd-windows-laptop-prime-gets-nearly-2300-off-2000641504</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell-begins-black-friday-with-70-off-this-1tb-ssd-windows-laptop-prime-gets-nearly-2-300-off.1345186/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Usually, finding a laptop that powers everything without slowing down means spending serious money. Dell’s Inspiron 16 laptop rewrites that equation completely: This machine packs <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5366/">professional-grade specs into a package that now costs $995, down from its typical $3,299 price tag</a>. That is a <strong>$2,304 discount</strong> that brings enterprise-level performance within reach of students and anyone tired of their sluggish laptop holding them back.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5366/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power That Keeps Up With Your Workload</h2>
<p>Inside is an Intel Core 7 150U processor that drives this machine up to 5.4 GHz across 10 cores split between 2 performance cores and 8 efficiency cores. This hybrid architecture essentially means the laptop knows when to unleash full power for demanding tasks and when to dial back for basic browsing, really maximizing both speed and battery life.</p>
<p>The 12 threads enable the processor to juggle multiple operations at one time, so you can render a video while downloading files and streaming music without watching everything grind to a halt.<strong> Intel’s Core 7 also includes dedicated CPU, GPU, and NPU engines</strong> that accelerate AI-powered features in Windows 11.</p>



<p>That <strong>32GB of DDR5 memory</strong> makes a tangible difference in daily use. DDR5 is the latest memory standard that’s faster and more power-efficient than older DDR4. You can have 50 browser tabs open, run Adobe Creative Suite applications and have Spotify playing in the background, then jump between everything in an instant. The 1TB SSD provides ample room for your operating system without needing to constantly manage space or use external drives.</p>



<p>The <strong>16-inch FHD+ touchscreen display runs at a 1920×1200 resolution</strong>, and provides more space vertically than the standard 1920×1080 screens. Those extra 120 pixels make spreadsheets easier to read and mean less scrolling when working with documents. With its 300-nit brightness, the screen can stay visible in bright rooms or near windows, and its anti-glare coating cuts down on reflections that cause eye strain during long work sessions. The touchscreen adds intuitive interaction: pinch fingers to zoom in on photos, swipe through documents, and navigate Windows 11’s touch-optimized interface with your fingers.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include: USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A ports for legacy peripherals, including mice and external hard drives; a Thunderbolt 4 port that enables 40Gbps data transfer to drives and enables the driving of high-resolution external monitors; an HDMI port suitable for presentations and second screens; and a universal audio jack for headphones.</p>
<p>With this Dell Inspiron laptop, performance that would normally cost three times more is available for 70% off.</p>

              <p>Apple doesn’t usually advertise big discounts on its own website but the company quietly drops deals through Amazon from time to time. The MacBook Air with M4 chip and 256GB SSD storage (which launched in March 2025) is no exception to this pattern. For the first time ever, a MacBook Air this recent is getting a serious price cut just months after its release: We saw it hit $799 during Prime Day, but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">Amazon’s early Black Friday deal brings it down to $749 which marks a brand new all-time low from its original $999 price tag</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Right MacBook for Apple Intelligence</h2>
<p>This is no ordinary laptop refresh: The 2025 MacBook Air with M4 chip is <strong>Apple’s first consumer machine built from scratch for Apple Intelligence</strong>, the suite of AI-powered features transforming how you’ll interact with your Mac. The <strong>Retina display on this 13.6-inch gadget</strong> shows sharp text and brilliant colors at a resolution of 2560×1664, with 500 nits of brightness that makes everything from spreadsheets to Netflix binges look crisp and clear.</p>



<p>Beneath the cool Midnight aluminum chassis, you’ll find 16 GB of unified memory: <strong>That’s double what Apple offered in the base models</strong> until recently. That matters because unified memory is a little different from traditional RAM. It’s shared between the CPU and GPU so that both have instant access to the same pool of fast memory, without having to copy data back and forth. What this practically means is that you can keep dozens of browser tabs open, edit large photos, run many apps at once, and get zero slowdown. The 256GB SSD storage offers you enough room for your OS, most essential apps and a solid collection of files.</p>
<p>The M4 chip itself is a beast for everyday computing and <strong>touts an 8-core CPU and 8-core GPU on a 3-nanometer process</strong> that handle everything from web browsing up to light video editing without breaking a sweat. You get up to 18 hours of web browsing and up to 15 hours of video playback from one charge, which means you really can work all day long without having to hunt down an outlet. The<strong> chip also contains a 16-core Neural Engine</strong> that’s exclusively designed to accelerate machine learning tasks, powering features such as real-time language translation, advanced photo editing and Apple Intelligence capabilities.</p>



<p>The 12MP Center Stage camera sits centered above the display and keeps you in frame during video calls: As you move around, the camera pans and zooms to follow you, making remote meetings feel more natural and professional. Touch ID is integrated into the keyboard, allowing you to unlock your Mac, authenticate purchases, and switch between user accounts using only your fingerprint<strong>. Two Thunderbolt USB 4 ports provide transfer speeds up to 40Gbps</strong>, support for external displays up to 6K resolution, as well as fast charging.</p>
<p>Weighing in at just 2.7 pounds and 0.44 inches thin, the MacBook Air slips into any bag without adding noticeable weight to your daily carry.</p>
<p>And you’re getting a machine at $749 that should stay relevant for years to come, with Apple’s history of providing software updates for seven years or more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Google unveiled its latest and greatest Pixel 10 in August this year, but last year’s Pixel 9 is still a great option to invest in if you’re looking to upgrade. In fact, with prices on newer models climbing higher, the Pixel 9 is looking like one of the better value buys you can get right now, especially with the current drop.</span></p>
<p>Amazon is being generous with<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5365/"> a 38% discount on this 2024 model, which brings the price down to $499</a>. That’s a straightforward $300 drop, and you don’t need to enter a coupon code or go through complicated checkout processes to secure the deal. The offer applies to all color options, including black, porcelain, and wintergreen. It’s also unlocked, meaning it’s going to work with all major carriers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5365/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Simple Design, But Packed With Power</h2>
<p>This slim, sleek phone features curved edges and a glass front and back for that premium look. The 6.3-inch Actua display is bright, pushing crisp, detailed visuals to make the content pop. 120 Hz refresh rate keeps everything running smoothly, whether you’re just browsing or trying to play a game.</p>
<p>The phone is packed with Tensor G4, which is Google’s most powerful chip yet. There’s 12 GB RAM for lag-free performance, plus 128 GB storage to house all your essentials. You’ll be able to store tons of media content, all your favorite apps, games, and a lot more, without feeling limited.</p>



<p>You also get a 50MP main camera and a 48MP ultrawide with Macro Focus. Google’s software takes it further with tools like Best Take (to help everyone look their best), Magic Editor (for quick editing), and Add Me (gets the whole group together in one photo). Whether you’re shooting on a bright sunny day or trying to record a scary prank at night, camera quality stays consistent throughout.</p>
<p>Gemini integration makes it even easier to get through your days and boring tasks. You can ask it to summarize content, circle an image or text to search the web, draft replies, etc. And since the Pixel 9 is fully unlocked, you’re free to use it with any major carrier, including Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, Google Fi, and more.</p>
<p>Amazon also offers a trade-in program that could get you up to $650 in savings when you send in your old phone. The value is issued as gift card credit, but note that you might not be able to combine this with the current discount, so double-check the details before checking out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lighting affects your mood, and smart lights make it easy to control both the brightness and color of your space. You can add warmth to your space when you feel like relaxing (also great for the holiday season), or go for a brighter setting for when you need to focus; all remotely.</p>
<p>Those ready to switch up the lighting situation in their home; we come bearing good news. You can now <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5364/">grab the Philips Hue starter kit for just $97 on Amazon, thanks to a 46% discount</a>. That’s a rare drop from its regular $179 price, and you’re getting three A19 smart LED bulbs, a Hue Bridge, and a Hue Smart Button in the box. The product is also rated as Amazon’s Choice on the retailer. We just recommend acting fast to grab it, because the offer might end soon!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5364/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Million Colors, Plus a Wide Temperature Range</h2>
<p>Each bulb is a 75W-equivalent A19 LED. It supports both white and full color ambiance, meaning you can adjust the white temperature or pick from over a million colors to create a vibe that reflects how you’re feeling. Need to focus on a work task? Go for a brighter setting that lets you concentrate. Feel like relaxing after a long day? A nice, warm tone should help you wind down. Hosting a gathering on the weekend? Something playful, fun is going to leave your guests impressed!</p>



<p>You can adjust the lights through the Hue app, the included button, or even just use your voice to let Alexa or Google Assistant take care of it. The app gives you more control, as you can set timers, play around with the color palette, etc. As for the button, you can place it anywhere with the included magnet and use it for quick control. It lets you customize up to 5 scenes, so you can tweak settings without pulling your phone out.</p>
<p>Then there’s the Hue Bridge, which connects directly to your WiFi router to act as a hub for your system. You can use it to control lights from anywhere, plus unlock advanced features like automations and routines.

              <p>We all rely on multiple devices to get through our days, and keeping all of them charged can get challenging. This is especially true for those who are out and about often and can’t afford to sit around waiting for one device to finish charging before plugging in the next. A multi-port, high-output charger can come in handy in these situations, and we just spotted a powerful option going for less on Amazon.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3814/">100W Baseus USB-C charger block is currently sitting at $29, after a massive 40% drop on its retail price of $49</a>. Both color options (black and white) are discounted. Even better, <strong>you can score a free USB-C cable (valued at $8)</strong> with your purchase. To claim it, click on the <em>“How to claim”</em> link next to the Get 1 free item label on the product page. In the tab that opens, add the charger to your cart, then navigate to the Benefit Item section and add the USB-C cable to your cart as well.</p>

<h2>Three Ports to Juice Multiple Devices</h2>
<p>The charger comes with two USB-C ports and one USB-A port, so you can juice up to three devices at once. Using the single USB-C port gets you up to 100W of power, and when multiple devices are plugged in, Baseus’ BPS 3.0 smart power distribution automatically allocates the required output to each connected device.</p>



<p>Support for all major fast-charging protocols (PD 3.0, QC 3.0, and PPS) translates into efficient charging for a wide range of devices, whether it’s your smartphone, iPad, MacBook, or even Steam Deck. There’s thermal control built in, as well. Baseus Cooling Technology (BCT) monitors temperature consistently in real-time to prevent any overheating problems.</p>
<p>It’s also 43% more compact than most chargers out there, so carrying it around won’t feel heavy. The pins fold down, so you can easily throw the block in your bag or even your pocket and get going. It’s great for remote workers, travelling, plus convenient home use.</p>
<p>It’s now going for just $30, and it also lets you grab a free USB-C cable with your purchase for absolutely nothing. These deals won’t be around for long, so it’s best to get your orders in fast.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last month, cosplay streamer <a href="https://kotaku.com/emiru-twitch-dan-clancy-assault-safety-investigation-2000639234">Emily “Emiru” Schunk</a> accused fellow Twitch star <a href="https://kotaku.com/mizkif-twitch-otk-allegations-apology-comeback-stream-1849944560">Matthew “Mizkif” Rinaudo</a> of sexually assaulting her. He’s now suing her and streamer <a href="https://kotaku.com/asmongold-twitch-ban-youtube-gaza-israel-hasan-piker-1851672928">Zack “Asmongold” Hoyt</a>, who covered the allegations during multiple streams, for defamation over the fallout, including loss of equity from his former media company OTK as well as management fees from associated agencies who recently cut ties with him.</p> <p>“Through the acts and omissions described below, Defendants Schunk, Hoyt, and OTK have, acting in concert, wrongfully and baselessly accused Rinaudo of serious criminal activity for no purpose other than to harm him, his reputation, and his business—and wrest from him control of the companies that he helped build,” <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/71869253/1/rinaudo-v-schunk/">the lawsuit</a>, filed in Texas District Court on November 3, reads (via <a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/top-twitch-streamer-files-defamation-lawsuit-against-fellow-streamers/">KXAN</a>).</p> <p>Emiru accused Mizkif of “psychological and domestic abuse, stalking and harassment, sexual assault, and threats of blackmail” during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUmFyCt3yU">an October 25 livestream</a>. “He started kissing me in my face and I let him do it,” she said, detailing the alleged assault. “I was still sobbing a lot. And then suddenly he tried to climb on top of me and aggressively shoved his hands down my pants and I screamed. And when I screamed he jumped off me, like a cat.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">OTK fully supports its co-owner and sister Emiru and we stand by her side and admire her strength in coming forward and sharing her story.</p> <p>While Mizkif was one of several founders of OTK, the organization terminated its relationship with him some time ago for reasons unrelated…</p> <p>— OTK (@OTKnetwork) <a href="https://twitter.com/OTKnetwork/status/1982890213031768293?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The lawsuit accuses Asmongold of piggybacking off these claims across multiple streams, calling Mizkif “the aggressor and abuser,” and saying that he should go to jail for what he “allegedly” did. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_na4AazJ0g">In his own stream</a> responding to the accusations, Mizkif appeared to admit he was controlling of her and said they would get in bad fights but denied the most serious allegations of misconduct.</p> <p>OTK <a href="https://x.com/OTKnetwork/status/1982890213031768293">later announced</a> that it stood by Emiru’s claims and that it previously terminated its relationship with Mizkif for unrelated reasons, while Mythic Talent Management has reportedly now dropped him for breach of contract and is demanding almost $1 million in fees. Mizkif’s lawsuit claims Emiru’s allegations led OTK to remove all equity he had left in the organization without compensation and is accusing its current (Emiru) and former (Asmongold) members of conspiring against him.</p> <p>“Schunk and Hoyt knew at the time that they published these statements that they were false,” the lawsuit reads. “On belief and information, Schunk and Hoyt knew they stood to benefit from Rinaudo’s ouster from OTK and the associated companies and coordinated the timing of their statements to maximize the injury inflicted to Plaintiffs.”</p> <p>Emiru and Asmongold have not yet publicly commented on the lawsuit. Emiru previously said she was in the process of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1og5bn2/emiru_is_on_the_process_of_filing_a_restraining/">getting a restraining order</a>&nbsp;placed against Mizkif.</p>
