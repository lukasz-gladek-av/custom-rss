              <p>Apple’s Mac Mini gets all the attention for compact computing but plenty of people need powerful Windows machines that don’t take up half a desk. Developers running Windows-only software, small business owners managing Microsoft ecosystems, content creators working with Adobe suites, and anyone tired of bulky tower PCs all face the same challenge: <strong>serious processing power in a tiny package that runs Windows natively</strong>.</p>
<p>The GMKtec M2 Pro S delivers exactly that: an Intel Core i7-1185G7 processor, 32GB RAM, and triple 4K display support, in a case smaller than most hardcover books. Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5306/"> has slashed this mini PC from $639 to $409, placing legitimate desktop-class performance within reach at a price</a> that makes sense.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5306/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tiger Lake Performance in a Desktop Form Factor</h2>
<p>Intel’s Tiger Lake is its 11th generation of Core i7 mobile chips but GMKtec adapted <strong>the Core i7-1185G7 chip for use in desktop mini PCs with great results</strong>. This quad-core chip runs at a base frequency of 3.0 GHz and turbos up to 4.8 GHz on single-core workloads with all four cores sustaining 4.3 GHz under full load. Those frequencies matter: They’re a determinant of how snappy your applications respond, how well your video-editing software scrubs through timelines, and how many browser tabs you can have open before things start crawling. Eight threads through Hyper-Threading technology allow the processor to juggle multiple tasks simultaneously.</p>



<p>It’s handled by the Intel Iris Xe Graphics with 96 execution units that deliver performance well above older integrated graphics and give even some entry-level dedicated GPUs a run for their money. That matters from smooth <strong>desktop animations to hardware-accelerated video encoding, plus casual gaming</strong> and the ability to run design software without throwing hundreds of dollars at a separate graphics card</p>
<p>The 32GB of dual-channel DDR4 RAM comes properly configured from the factory, and gives both the CPU and GPU maximum memory bandwidth for the best performance. Dual-channel operation essentially doubles the speed at which data flows between RAM and processor compared to single-channel configurations, eliminating a common bottleneck that cripples many budget systems. The 1TB NVMe SSD connects via PCIe 3.0, delivering read speeds around 3,500 MB/s that make your entire system feel instantaneous compared to old SATA drives or mechanical hard drives.</p>



<p>The triple display capability transforms this mini PC into a serious multitasking powerhouse: <strong>Two HDMI 2.0 ports</strong> each output 4K resolution at 60Hz, while the <strong>USB-C port with DisplayPort</strong> alt mode handles the third 4K display at 60Hz. <strong>Running three 4K monitors simultaneously</strong> gives you over 24 million pixels of workspace, letting traders monitor multiple markets, developers keep code on one screen with documentation and testing on the others, or video editors spread their timeline across displays. The <strong>60Hz refresh rate</strong> ensures smooth motion and responsive cursor movement.</p>
<p>The GMKtec mini PC now costs $409, instead of $639, which makes it far cheaper than many standalone processors.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-dual-14-laptop-screen-extender-goes-for-peanuts-amazon-clears-out-stock-before-black-friday-2000640775</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Working on a single laptop screen is like trying to prepare a five-course meal in a studio apartment kitchen: constant minimizing of windows, lost tracking of tabs, and clicking back and forth between applications until your wrist hurts from all the mouse movement. There’s a great laptop screen extender on sale at Amazon that solves this by adding two full 14-inch displays that clip right onto your laptop, instantly creating a triple-screen setup: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5305/">Amazon has dropped it from $239 to $189 which makes this the cheapest route into serious screen real estate</a> without buying separate monitors and dealing with all that cabling.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5305/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Professional Display Quality in a Portable Package</h2>
<p>Each <strong>14-inch screen delivers full HD 1080P resolution through IPS panel technology</strong>&nbsp;which means you get consistent colors and clear text from almost any viewing angle. That’s where IPS panels make all the difference; they avoid that annoying color shift and brightness drop you get from cheaper TN screens just from tilting your head a little. The 1920×1080 resolution gives you enough pixel density to keep text sharp and images detailed without having that fuzzy look budget monitors often suffer from. <strong>Both displays boast blue light filtering technology</strong> that reduces eye strain during long work sessions. That means it cuts the harsh blue wavelengths that mess with your sleep cycle and tire your eyes. The <strong>anti-glare coating scatters ambient light</strong> instead of reflecting it straight back at you so you can actually see what’s on screen even when sitting near windows or under office lighting.</p>
<p>Built-in speakers mean you get audio from the extended displays without needing separate speakers or relying on your laptop’s often mediocre sound system. At just <strong>0.24 inches thick, these screens fold flat for transport</strong> and barely add bulk to your laptop bag.</p>



<p>The connectivity covers all the bases <strong>with two USB Type-C ports and one HDMI to USB-C port</strong>, which gives you flexibility in how you connect depending on what your laptop offers. Plug and play means exactly that-no driver downloads, no software installations, just connect the cables and your operating system immediately recognizes the extra displays. You can run both screens in extended mode to genuinely expand your workspace or switch into mirror mode for presentations where you want everyone seeing the same content. <strong>The triple-screen configuration legitimately increases your visible workspace by 200%</strong>, and lets you keep email open on one screen, your primary work on the laptop display and reference materials or chat windows on the third screen.</p>
<p>This extender <strong>works with Windows, macOS, and Linux operating systems</strong> and supports game consoles like PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch to extend your game into multiple displays.</p>



<p>Studies regularly demonstrate that using a <strong>dual monitor setup increases productivity 20-42% over using a single screen</strong> and the gains are even higher when adding a third screen. This gain in productivity is realized by reduced window switching, better visibility for information, and the ability to retain tools, references, and communications visible all at once.</p>
<p>At $189, this extender is less than the cost of buying even one decent standalone portable monitor, yet you get two screens plus mounting hardware and all the necessary cables.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is it fair to call this the Big One? Of all the very many nerd conventions around the world, New York Comic Con certainly has claim to be one of the most defining events in the calendar. So of course&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>&nbsp;ensured Minerablu’s excellent team of photographers were at the event, capturing the best cosplay that appeared on the show floor.</p> <p>As you might imagine, New York Comic Con attracts a host of big-name actors and creators, with 2025 seeing the likes of Hollywood stars like James McAvoy, Elliot Page, Martin Sheen and Ming-Na Wen, alongside writers George R.R. Martin and Joe Hill, voice actors Laura Bailey and Ashley Johnson, and all-time heroes like Ernie Hudson, Seth Green and Peter Weller. But we’re not here for autographs; we’re after the most impressive cosplay to walk through the exhibition hall doors. And as ever, we have a mighty-fine selection.</p>

 <p>More unusual costumes include a spot-on Bad Bunny, a Supergirl/Sabrina Carpenter crossover, and—er—quite the Jeff Goldblum. There’s also the finest Predator I’ve ever seen, and what I hope will become a permanent fixture of these galleries:&nbsp;<em>Demon Hunters</em>‘ Derpy.</p> <p>We’ll have a video of the event soon, but meanwhile click on to enjoy the pics.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-ideapad-with-office-365-and-1tb-selling-cheaper-than-no-name-laptops-amazon-clears-stock-2000640767</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo-ideapad-with-office-365-and-1tb-selling-cheaper-than-no-name-laptops-amazon-clears-stock.1342096/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most people just want a laptop that works without drama or over-engineering. Lenovo’s <em>IdeaPad</em> line is specifically designed with all the everyday scenarios in mind and peel away the extraneous gaming trim to focus on practical computing that normal people actually need. Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5304/">has dropped the Lenovo IdeaPad 1i down to $279 from its regular $399 price</a>, bundling in a full <strong>year of Microsoft 365</strong> alongside an impressive combination of 12GB RAM, 256GB SSD storage plus 1TB of cloud storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5304/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real Computing Power for Everyday Tasks</h2>
<p>The 12GB of RAM in this configuration changes everything about how budget laptops traditionally perform. Most entry-level machines ship with 4GB that starts choking the moment you open more than a few browser tabs but 12GB gives you real breathing room for multitasking across applications. You can run Word documents (you can <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/word">download Word for free here</a>) while researching in Chrome with YouTube playing in the background, all without that frustrating slowdown that makes budget laptops feel ancient. The <strong>Intel Celeron processor handles everyday computing tasks</strong> like email, web browsing, document editing and video streaming without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>Storage comes in two forms that work together beautifully: <strong>fast local storage and massive cloud storage</strong>. The 256GB SSD provides fast local storage for your operating system, applications, and files you access regularly, delivering quick boot times and snappy performance that makes modern computers feel responsive. That is complemented by the massive 1TB of cloud storage through Microsoft 365 for backing up photos and everything else you want to keep safe but don’t need instant access to.</p>



<p>The<strong> 14-inch HD anti-glare display</strong> hits that sweet spot for portability and usability-large enough to handle comfortable work sessions without the bulk of a 15.6-inch model that barely fits into backpacks: That anti-glare coating does wonders when you work near a window or under strong overhead lighting and cuts down on the reflections that otherwise drive you to push brightness to uncomfortable levels. The <strong>screen manages to achieve an 87% active area ratio</strong>&nbsp;which means Lenovo has been able to keep the surrounding bezels quite minimal to provide more screen area in a compact form factor. <strong>Two Dolby Audio speakers</strong> flank the keyboard and stream robust sound surprisingly well for video calls, streaming shows, or background music while working.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life stretches to 11 hours on a full charge</strong> which is enough to get through a full workday or school day without hunting for outlets. WiFi-6 connectivity brings faster speeds and better performance in crowded wireless environments like apartments or dorm buildings where dozens of devices compete for bandwidth. The Flip to Start feature powers on the laptop the instant you open the lid and shaves off those annoying seconds of waiting while Smart Noise Cancelling automatically filters out background sounds during video calls.</p>
<p>Windows 11 is preinstalled and it performs all the modern computing tasks you’d want, from productivity software to entertainment apps. The bundled Microsoft 365 subscription includes all the Office applications you’d want, <strong>including Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook, along with that 1TB of OneDrive cloud storage</strong> we mentioned earlier. This software package alone usually costs about $70 per year so getting a full year included with the laptop counts as genuine added value rather than marketing fluff.</p>
<p>At $279, this Lenovo undercuts generic no-name laptops that often cost $400 or more while delivering inferior build quality and zero brand support.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Beats, a brand by Apple, makes some of the best audio gear out there. It offers bold sound, and the headphones play nicely with a range of devices. If you’re after a solid pair of over-ear headphones that do not blow your budget, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p>Amazon is being generous with a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5054/">35% discount on the Beats Solo 4 wireless headphones, which brings the price down to $129 from $199</a>. The discount applies to all color options, so you can pick one that matches your aesthetic the best.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5054/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Updated Drivers for Rich, Deep Sound</h2>
<p>The build is sleek yet sturdy, and the headphones are quite comfortable to wear. These feature an UltraPlush cushion that provides a snug fit without putting too much pressure on your ears, so it’s going to be easy to have them on for longer periods. The headband itself is foldable, meaning you can easily tuck the pair into a bag or backpack when not in use.</p>
<p>For powerful sound, there’s custom acoustic architecture with updated drivers. All the highs and lows are delivered well, across all genres. Listening to the Chester Bennington scream in Given Up or just winding down after a long day with a podcast, these headphones hold up well. Best of all, there’s Personalized Spatial Audio support with dynamic head tracking for a more immersive sound that follows you.</p>



<p>A built-in microphone makes calls clearer, and Class 1 Bluetooth makes sure you enjoy an extended range with fewer dropouts. If you want to enjoy audio just the way the creator intended, you can plug in using either the USB-C or 3.5mm audio cable. Battery-wise, you’re looking at up to 50 hours of listening time on a full charge, so you can go at least a couple of days without worrying about recharging them. And if you’re running low, Fast Fuel lets you top up with 5 hours of playback in just 10 minutes.</p>



<p><strong>These headphones work well with both Android and Apple devices</strong>, so compatibility won’t really be an issue. Pairing literally takes a few minutes, so you’ll be jamming to your favorite beats in no time.</p>
<p>All things considered, Beats Solo 4 headphones are a great option to consider if you’re after solid audio, reliable battery life, and a comfortable fit. These would normally run you around $200, but this deal lets you snag them for just $129. It might be wrapping up soon, though, so it’s better to get your orders in fast.</p>

              <p>Gaming sessions with friends hit different when everyone has a controller: There’s nothing worse than passing around one gamepad or having to troubleshoot compatibility across various devices. The Xbox wireless controller has become the go-to option for millions of gamers and right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">Amazon has it down to just $39 from its usual $64 price</a>. That’s practically half the cost of Sony’s DualSense controller, and it makes this deal all that much sweeter if you need to stock up on extra controllers for those multiplayer sessions.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Controller That Goes the Distance</h2>
<p>New in this 2025 edition of the Xbox controller are features that truly make for meaningful changes in your experience while gaming: The <strong>battery life runs as long as 40 hours on one set of two AA batteries</strong> which means you can game through several weekends without having to fear running out of power. This controller now <strong>includes a 9-foot USB-C cable right in the box</strong> for easy flexibility between wireless freedom and the reliability of a wired connection at any time.</p>
<p>These ergonomic updates to the controller have made marathon gaming sessions far more comfortable. Xbox has <strong>refined the sculpted surfaces and geometry</strong> for a better fit of various hand sizes while adding textured grips on the triggers, bumpers, and back case. These grip enhancements give you more control in high-intensity moments when your palms start sweating and this <strong>hybrid D-pad provides a nice balance between precision and comfort</strong> in fighting games and menu navigation alike. The <strong>Share button integration is really handy</strong>, too: you can capture screenshots and recordings without having to fumble through menus or break focus during crucial gameplay moments.</p>



<p>In real-world practicality, the strength of this controller comes in with cross-platform compatibility: You can pair it<strong> wirelessly via Xbox Wireless or Bluetooth to your console, PC, phone, tablet, Fire TV Stick, smart TV, or even VR headsets</strong>. That means one controller works across your whole gaming ecosystem, not different gamepads for different devices. A <strong>3.5mm headset jack</strong> lets you plug any compatible headset directly into it, and a USB-C port supports direct plug-and-play connections to your console or PC without any setup hassle.</p>
<p>At $39, you’re getting a premium controller that normally sells for $64, and this represents the lowest price we’ve tracked for this model. With over 21,000 reviews averaging 4.6 stars and more than 10,000 units purchased in the past month alone, this controller has proven itself in real-world use.</p>

              <p>Bigger doesn’t always mean better when it comes to PCs. If you’re after reliable everyday performance for your office work or even just casual use, a mini PC can do the job well without taking up a lot of desk space. Best of all? You can grab one without paying the full price right now.</p>
<p>Currently, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5301/">GMKtec Nucbox G3S Mini PC (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Intel N95 chip, Windows 11 Pro) is available for $179 on Amazon</a>, down from its regular $249 price. The only catch? This <strong>deal is exclusive to Prime members</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5301/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>That said, this might be a good time to consider signing up for Prime if you’ve been on the fence. <strong>Amazon offers a 7-day free trial</strong>&nbsp;so you can take advantage of this discount right away and also enjoy free shipping on your orders. It’s also worth noting that Black Friday and Cyber Monday are right around the corner, and a lot of the best deals will go to Prime members first. A Prime membership costs $139 per year or $15 per month, but if you shop on Amazon even semi-regularly, you’re likely to make that money back in discounts and shipping perks.</p>



<h2>Powerful Processor for Everyday Tasks</h2>
<p>The G3S runs on Intel’s 12th Gen Alder Lake N95 processor with 4 cores, 4 threads, and speeds up to 3.4GHz. When compared to entry-level chips like N100 or N5095, this one offers up to 36% better overall performance, which makes it ideal for day-to-day usage. The 16GB of DDR4 RAM makes it easy to multitask your way through busy days, while the 512GB M.2 SSD storage provides sufficient space for all your essentials. It’s not massive, but should be enough to store important work files, media content, and even a few games without feeling limited.</p>
<p>Connectivity-wise, you’ve got dual HDMI 2.0 ports that support 4K@60Hz output on two displays, which is great for anyone looking for a bigger setup. It also has three USB 3.2 ports, WiFi 5, Bluetooth 5.0, and Gigabit Ethernet for reliable wireless and wired connections. Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, which means you can get started right away without worrying about any complicated installation procedures or subscription costs.</p>
<p>This deal brings the price of the mini PC down to $179, but don’t wait too long to grab it: The offer might end any moment now.</p>

              <p>Who doesn’t love a good holiday countdown? Advent calendars build anticipation, make every single day more exciting, and are fun for both kids and adults. Of course, the whole process gets a bit more creative when it’s a LEGO set.</p>
<p>This year, LEGO is offering its Friends Advent calendar 2025, and it’s already on 40% off at Amazon, bringing the price down to just $21. It’s marked as an <em>Amazon’s Choice</em> product, but there’s no telling how long the discount will last. If you’ve been thinking about grabbing one, now’s a good time to pick it up for less. Keep in mind that all other LEGO Advent calendars are now out of stock.</p>

<h2>The Set Doubles as a Play Area</h2>
<p>The set includes a <strong>total of 237 pieces with 24 buildable surprises, for 24 days of fun</strong>. The theme is about a holiday sleepover with Lego friends; Aliya, Autumn, Liann, Nova, and Leo. Each character gets their own cozy mattress to get some beauty sleep, and the crew is also accompanied by five adorable pets, including a guinea pig, a gecko, two dogs, and a cat. To spoil these furry friends, there’s a whole bunch of accessories, like a bone, scratching post, pet bed, food station, and water dispenser.</p>



<p>The whole setup comes together with some magical holiday touches like a cozy fireplace, a sled, a sofa to lounge on, a bright lamp, and a bunch of colorful gift boxes. There’s even a little Lego brick reindeer plushie to round it all out. And since the calendar opens up to double as a small play area, kids can use it to set up the full sleepover scene and get creative with their own stories. Maybe it’s a hot chocolate night while the pets throw their own little party in the corner. Or a Christmas tree decorating session with a surprise visit from Leo on the hobbyhorse! The possibilities are endless, and the fun goes on even after Christmas.</p>
<p>Everything is compatible with other LEGO Friends sets, so it’s easy to keep building. You can even plan a fun streaming night with Lego Friends: The Next Chapter, where kids can get to know the Heartlake City crew and maybe add a few more sets over time to expand the whole setup.</p>
<p>Altogether, if you’ve been planning to treat your kids to an exciting advent calendar that fuels their creativity, this set is a great option to consider. It’s now down to just $21 for a short time, which makes it even more approachable.</p>
