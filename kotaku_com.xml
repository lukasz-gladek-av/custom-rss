              <p>When McDonald’s PR tipped me off that there would be an announcement today regarding the fast food chain and a trading card game, I assumed we were being prepared for the announcement of 2026’s annual <em>Pokémon</em> tie-in, when the entire planet <a href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-pokemon-tcg-happy-meal-chaos-2000616843">loses its collective mind</a> buying Happy Meals just to get the packs of cards. But no, these are literally McDonald’s trading cards, with a set of 24 to collect including the “beloved” Ronald McDonald.</p> <p>It’s set to launch in the UK on March 17, and we’ve chased up to find out when the equivalent is happening in the U.S. The cards feature all your favorite McDonald’s characters, like Grimace, and wait what, a sentient stool called “Cheeseburger Chair,” and, oh god, Fry Girl, who appears to be a <em>ball</em> of fries with legs and eyes. This is truly cursed stuff. She’s wearing shoes. Why is she wearing shoes? Apparently this is something to do with a 1972 campaign called Fry Kids, who were originally collectively known as “French Fry Gobblins” and seem to have popped up here and there throughout the decades.</p>

 <p>Other cards glimpsed in photos from this weekend’s London Card Show show the non-sentient Multimixer, which appears to be a milkshake dispenser, and an iconic Milkshape Dip, showing a french fry being dunked into a milkshake. And respect for that. Thankfully neither has eyes or any sense of self-awareness ahead of their being consumed, but good lord, find me the person who’s going to be excited about pulling a card showing a drink distribution system.</p> <p>An enigmatic “trailer” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DUtKkY_AYfm/">on Instagram</a> shows a teasing hint of what looks to be a foil reverse of a card featuring the M logo and absolutely nothing else. It declares this to be “A new game from The M Universe,” which is not a reality I’d previously been aware of. We’re also promised that one card will feature Pennywise’s more sinister cousin, Ronald McDonald, which we’re told will “stand out.” This is described as “the return of Ronald McDonald,” and I’ll confess I didn’t know he’d been away. Although perhaps this is some sort of day-release scheme? I imagine the card would cut off before it showed any tags on his ankles.</p>

 <p>I know the wait is going to be unbearable, but the information concludes that “the brand is keeping a few cards close to its chest, with plenty more to come. So, keep your eyes peeled…” I’m not sure why, but that really reads like a threat.</p>

 <p>The reality is, if McDonald’s has any sense and has this be a complete one-off, these cards are going to <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-paul-illustrator-pikachu-psa10-auction-pokemon-card-2000669385">be worth a billion-kerjillion bucks</a> in 20 years. Quite how the game aspect of them works is yet to be outlined, but I did read the words “Take it or Flip it game,” and that’s their capitalization. The UK gets to find out next month, and we’ll let you know when Americans can get in on the McD’s TCG action.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The PS6 Launch Could Be Delayed Multiple Years By AI Hyperscalers]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ps6-delay-memory-price-ai-switch-2-2000669410</link>
            <guid>1437199</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Companies across tech are freaking out about the worsening memory chip shortage. It’s already delayed pre-orders for <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-release-date-preorder-ai-valve-2000665802">Valve’s Steam machine</a> and could torch Sony’s planned rollout for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-chip-release-date-backwards-compatibility-ps5-1851648868">upcoming PlayStation 6</a>. The unannounced console was rumored to be arriving in late 2027, but a new report suggests Sony is considering delaying its next hardware generation until 2028 or even 2029.</p> <p>That’s according to <em>Bloomberg</em>, whose latest report on the AI-fueled memory crisis includes two sources familiar with Sony’s “thinking” who claim the console manufacturer is already “considering” pushing its PS6 launch plans back by a year or two. The report claims the delay would have big consequences for the company’s “carefully orchestrated strategy” to transition <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-sales-switch-2-earnings-ghost-yotei-memory-shortage-2000665998">users from PS5 to the upcoming hardware</a>.</p>

 <p>Alleged specs for the PS6 began <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-leak-specs-sony-handheld-price-release-date-2000614206">leaking last summer</a> and suggested Sony was prioritizing trying to keep its hardware affordable even as it ramps up power in a solo console arms race with ever diminishing returns. Speculation was that more moderate spec improvements could keep the PS6 priced at around <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-leak-specs-sony-handheld-price-release-date-2000614206">$400-to-$600 instead of $700-to-$1,000</a>. Sony is also believed to be currently working on a handheld that would be able to play PS5 and some cross-gen PS6 games, potentially scaling down performance to keep up with higher-end blockbusters.</p> <p>Why would a single component price shock delay an entire console generation? In the past, Sony might have released a much more expensive machine to compensate. But in recent years as the total footprint of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-sales-inflation-economy-2000654196">console gaming market has plateaued</a>, companies have faced pressure to be more aggressive on price to compete with free-to-play ecosystems that are still thriving on old hardware and weaker devices like smartphones. Sony actually ended up winning the recent holiday sales quarter against the newly released Switch 2 in part by slashing the price of PS5 with big Black Friday discounts.</p>

 <p>Speaking of the Switch 2, whether Nintendo will be forced to raise the price of its new console is another big question posed by the memory shortage. The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-tariff-ai-ram-stock-price-2000661382">has previously told investors</a> it has inventory and contracts to help it weather volatility in the first half of 2026, but if conditions persist it will have to re-evaluate its pricing strategy with an eye toward balancing profitability with maximizing install base. Bloomberg’s report reiterated that Nintendo is already “contemplating raising the price” of the Switch 2 this year.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-dlc-console-sales-steam-edmund-mcmillen-2000669404</link>
            <guid>1437163</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Mewgenics</em>, the new roguelite RPG battler from <em>The Binding of Isaac </em>developer Edmund McMillen and&nbsp;<em>The End Is Nigh</em>‘s Tyler Glaiel, has proven to be an extraordinary success. Launched February 10, during less than a week on sale has hit the #2 spot on Steam’s bestsellers and seen an extraordinary 115,428 simultaneous players—extraordinary because this is a single-player, offline game. At the time of writing it has more people playing than&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>. Given this, McMillen has announced that the game will be coming to consoles <em>and </em>receiving DLC. Oh, and it’s incredible soundtrack is now available to buy.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-edmund-mcmillen-roguelike-impressions-2000666865"><em>Mewgenics</em></a> is the bastard child of <em>Slay the Spire</em>, <em>X-COM</em> and&nbsp;<em>Rogue Legacy</em>, a game about taking a team of cats on an adventure to fight in a series of turn-based RPG battles, then breeding the victors to create your next crew. And while we don’t know officially sales numbers yet, it’s fair to say they’re not small. On launch day, just three hours after the game came out, Glaiel posted that <a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-steam-best-seller-strategy-roguelike-2000667706">the seven-year development budget</a> had already been recouped. Glaiel has also posted that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tylerglaiel.com/post/3mermwjydf22m">650,000 people had played the game by Friday</a>, and assuming those are all legitimate sales, that’s over $12 million&nbsp;<em>after</em> Steam’s cut.</p>   <p>There was also a moment of excitement for the pair when the game showed more players than&nbsp;<em>Hades 2</em>.</p>   <p>All this means there’s budget and an assumed audience to bring the game to consoles. There are no specifics yet, with updates promised for later, but given the game works well with a controller it’ll be a natural fit for Xbox, PS5 and Switch. I also cannot fathom why this isn’t already on mobile, given it’d be the perfect medium.</p>

 <p>The success also means DLC is in the works, and that’s no small feature either, given the core game is so big that the developers reckon still no one’s finished it.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mewgenics updates: <br>-OST is live on the steam page <br>-it’s coming to consoles ( updates later )<br>-there will be dlc <br>-update with some bug fixes soonish<br>-mewgenics merch here &gt; <a href="https://t.co/lKGyqrsAU8">https://t.co/lKGyqrsAU8</a></p> <p>— 🜏 Edmund McMillen 🜏 (@edmundmcmillen) <a href="https://twitter.com/edmundmcmillen/status/2023170140435796357?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Certainly not least, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4415490/Mewgenics_ULTIMATE_Original_Soundtrack_Of_All_Time/">the OST is now up on Steam</a>. It contains an astonishing 82 tracks, and only 27 of them are instrumentals. That means you can hear all the originally recorded songs that pop up while playing, with all their barmy lyrics, even if you can’t reach the second act.</p>

              <p>Given the current extended wave of Pokémon card lunacy began with Logan Paul in 2020, perhaps this weekend’s sale of the YouTuber’s Illustrator Pikachu card for a completely deranged <strong>$16.49 million</strong> could be the end of it? Bookend this nonsense with the same awful man.</p> <p>Logan Paul’s Illustrator Pikachu is without doubt one of the rarest Pokémon cards in existence. The special card, created in 1997 as part of an illustration contest in Japan, has a unique image of Pikachu with a paintbrush and saw only 41 printed. Of those, only one has ever been graded by PSA (a company that grades all sorts of memorabilia by incredible high standards) to be a 10—a card in perfect condition—and this is the one Paul bought as a stunt in 2022. He paid, in total, $5.275 million, of which $4m was in cash, and the rest in the form of a PSA 9 version of the same card. He then, infamously, <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-pauls-latest-stunt-paying-6-million-for-rare-pi-1848743633">wore the card around his neck for his appearance at Wrestlemania</a> in 2022.</p>

 <p>This was not the first time Logan Paul had pulled this stunt. In 2020, as the world collectively lost its mind during covid, Paul began spending millions on Pokémon packs for attention-seeking streams. At one point he bought a Gem Mint 10 1999 first edition holo Charizard (one of the most sought-after cards) for $150,000, then wore it around his neck to one of his pretend boxing matches against Floyd Mayweather, <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-paul-wore-a-pokemon-card-to-mayweather-fight-say-1847044171">claiming at the time that this act had caused it to become worth a million dollars</a>. Thankfully that wasn’t true, and despite the massive hike in prices across the rest of the hobby, you can still pick up the same card in the same quality <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-rare-holofoil-4-charizard-psa-gem-mtvzj4m">for not much more</a>.</p> <h2>Illustrator Pikachu’s peculiar path</h2> <p>Since 2022, the fate of the Illustrator Pikachu has been bizarrely mixed. In 2022 an Las Vegas Raiders linebacker sold a CGC (rival grading company to PSA) 9.5 for $672,000 <a href="https://kotaku.com/rare-pokemon-card-illustrator-blake-martinez-nfl-retire-1849803410">and celebrated by resigning from the NFL</a>. He’s likely kicking himself still, given in the same year <a href="https://kotaku.com/illustrator-pikachu-pokemon-card-most-valuable-record-s-1848598145">someone bought a poorer quality PSA 7 version for $900,000</a>, which at the time made it the most expensive Pokémon card sale ever, before Logan Paul got one later that year. However, a year later in 2023 a PSA 8 went up for auction at $480,000 and <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-illustrator-pikachu-charizard-ebay-auction-1850200024">didn’t receive a single bid</a>. Then last year, all sense was lost as <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pikachu-illustrator-psa9-auction-2000625686">a PSA 9 Illustrator Pikachu sold for a ludicrous $4,000,000</a>. Why was this card suddenly worth nearly four times more than Paul had sold his for three years earlier? Or six times more than the CGC 9.5? Because these small pieces of floppy cardboard are only ever worth what someone is willing to pay for them.</p>

 <p>But forget all of that now, because <a href="https://www.polygon.com/logan-paul-pikachu-illustrator-pokemon-card-auction-final-sale-price/">as&nbsp;<em>Polygon</em> reported this weekend</a>, Logan Paul just sold his one-of-a-kind PSA 10 Pikachu for $16,492,000.</p> <p><a href="https://goldin.co/buy/?Auctions=202512-1918-3018-925819e2-7bfc-4e60-a624-05d1e2f2d4a3&amp;page=1&amp;sort=Featured&amp;number_of_lots=24">Auctioned by Goldin</a>, alongside Paul’s PSA 10 1999 Charizard, a matching Blastoise, and a factory sealed box of Base Set 1st Edition cards, and a whole bunch of others, they all sold for wildly inflated prices. The headline is obviously <a href="https://goldin.co/item/logan-paul-personally-owned-1998-pokemon-japanese-corocoro-promo-raretua0w?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjAsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">the Pikapainter which went for that $16.5 million</a>, but everything else is equally ridiculous. The Charizard, as described above usually worth $150,000, <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-rare-holofoil-logan-paul-break-4-chajdvc5?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjEsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">went for $954,800</a>; the Blastoise sold <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-rare-holofoil-logan-paul-break-2-blaejo67?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjIsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">for $138,880</a> despite another identical card <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/397613597277">selling for $2000 on eBay yesterday</a>; the matching Venusaur <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-rare-holofoil-logan-paul-break-15-vegq3n7?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjMsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">fetched $75,640</a>; and that box of Base Set went for nearly half a million, <a href="https://goldin.co/item/1999-pokemon-base-set-1st-edition-factory-sealed-booster-box-36-packsmrlo2?queryId=eyJxdWVyeUlkIjoiMWVmM2JiY2FjNTFiODNhNmVmNWFlNjNiYjhiYWY5MDAiLCJjYXJkSW5kZXgiOjQsImV2ZW50SW5kZXgiOiJsb3RzLXByb2QtbG90X251bWJlcl9hc2MifQ%3D%3D">$496,000</a>. So why did the Base Set starters fetch so much higher? Because for some reason PSA agreed to mark the labels on these gradings with “1ST ED—LOGAN PAUL BREAK,” thus in the eyes of collectors making them unique. As for the Pikachu, there’s no rational explanation.</p>

 <p>Obviously this $16.5 million sale smashes all previous records to pieces, and surely—<em>surely—</em>will never be beaten. There has to come a point where humanity recognizes that shiny cardboard is of limited value. At approximately 1.85 grams, this card is worth 55,370 times the price of gold. Which is silly. It’s all incredibly silly.</p>
