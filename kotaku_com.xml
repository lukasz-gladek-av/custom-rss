And although the opening fortnight’s craziness is beginning to calm down, it’s still a surprisingly pricy collection.</p><p>Cards have held their value well into the second week, when we’d normally see them crashing down, though I still strongly suspect we’ll see a bunch of those prices dropping by the end of November.</p><p>However, I think what we’re seeing with Surging Sparks is another of the <em>Pokémon TCG</em>’s occasional peaks, those moments when it grabs the zeitgeist once again and everyone’s jumping in for a bit of speculation. That’s likely driven in part by the expectations for January’s new set, Prismatic Evolutions—a set that has already sold out on early pre-orders because of its focus on Eevee-lutions. Everyone always goes nuts over those, and it’s likely to see prices that make Surging Sparks’ look minimal.</p><p>I’ve ripped open about 60 packs of Surging Sparks (in part thanks to The Pokémon Company, who sent <em>Kotaku</em> a hefty pile), and haven’t had good luck at all. Pull rates seem about standard for 2023-24, a disappointing one in five for a standard ex or better, and far lower if you want to see any of the astonishing number of gorgeous artworks in the set.</p><p>It’s getting to a point where it just feels silly to let artists create so much beautiful work, and then make it so phenomenally difficult for anyone to see any of it. And given Pokémon isn’t seeing any of the profits made by those reselling them, the financial incentive is only in hoping that people will just buy more packs to try to find them. But given that everyone’s getting used to the horrible chances, that’s not a great long-term strategy. Grimly, I managed to get <em>three</em> of the ghastly full-art Bruxish cards (the art is great, the Pokémon is hideous), and comprehensively missed out on any of the 35 different cards I’d hoped to pull. The full-art Castform is lovely, though, and I’m pleased to have it.</p><p>Still, you may have been far luckier. Usually when we put these articles together, there’s one card teetering at around a hundred bucks, and then it’s down into the teens by card five or six. Not so in Surging Sparks.</p><p><em>As ever, all prices are correct at the time of writing, but these things change pretty rapidly.

God knows why anyone’s paying <strong>$26 </strong>for a gold version of a bland  Trainer card, with the useful but not exciting ability to pull a Pokémon or Energy card from your discard pile. While gold cards used to hold some collectability, that faded with Sword &amp; Shield, with TPCi desperately trying to reinvigorate interest with a series of quickly abandoned alternatives. (Those green and gold ones? Bleurgh.)</p><p>Even sillier, there’s a much nicer Alolan Exeggutor ex gold card that’s in 12th place, at $23, and Night Stretcher is even out-pricing the Ultra Rare version of the Pikachu ex card everyone’s going so nuts over, which is in 11th place at $24. Ludicrous.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6894dc95201f0e1f10f402cfaa4baaa1" data-recommend-id="image://6894dc95201f0e1f10f402cfaa4baaa1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jasmine’s Gaze Special Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jasmine’s Gaze Special Illustration Rare." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6894dc95201f0e1f10f402cfaa4baaa1" data-recommend-id="image://6894dc95201f0e1f10f402cfaa4baaa1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jasmine’s Gaze Special Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The art on this card is just so special. It’s a style that the TCG has never seen before, looking like something from an animated Disney short. It’s also such a perfectly captured moment, Jasmine caught mid-bite of an epic sandwich. Also, play spot the Alcremie.</p><p>In a normal set, the “other” special art with the girl on it would normally be fetching around 15 bucks, but in the extra-expensive Surging Sparks, this is still going for <strong>$36</strong>, crashing down from its early high of $83.</p><p>It’s also a very useful Trainer card, given it gives all your cards a 30HP buffer.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e930cdf1728d1816f7304504718de57d" data-recommend-id="image://e930cdf1728d1816f7304504718de57d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Latios Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Latios Illustration Rare." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e930cdf1728d1816f7304504718de57d" data-recommend-id="image://e930cdf1728d1816f7304504718de57d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Latios Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Quite how TPCi determines which cards are “Illustration Rare” and which are “Special Illustration Rare” is deeply mysterious. This stunning Latios is somehow not given the Special status, despite being one of the most striking cards they’ve ever printed, and indeed seeming like the perfect companion to the Latias ex we’ll be meeting soon.</p><p>It’s still fetching the sort of price you’d expect for a card this good in any other set, right now selling for <strong>$42</strong>, down only ten bucks from its peak.</p><p>It’s a fantastic card, too, with the ability to pick Pokémon off the opponent’s bench, and a big 110 attack for a Basic card.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3172b5be250a1a8b663b1493e7969125" data-recommend-id="image://3172b5be250a1a8b663b1493e7969125" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Alolan Exeggutor ex Special Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Alolan Exeggutor ex Special Illustration Rare." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3172b5be250a1a8b663b1493e7969125" data-recommend-id="image://3172b5be250a1a8b663b1493e7969125" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Alolan Exeggutor ex Special Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I’m really enjoying how artists are experimenting with the obligatory color palette of the tera-type Pokémon for these SIRs. Yuriko Akase takes things in a very pastel direction, and it’s so effective.</p><p>The card itself is part of the current meta of requiring multiple color energies to deliver mighty attacks, but <em>bloody hell</em>, this card is <em>ridiculous</em>. A 150 attack AND you can attach <em>any number</em> of energy cards to <em>any</em> of your Pokémon! Sorry for the italics, but <em>good grief</em>, because that’s the <em>minor</em> attack. Swinging Sphene then gives you a 50:50 chance to knock out your opponent’s active Pokémon (albeit Basics only), and even if it misses you knock out one on the bench!</p><p>Sorry, I’ve got to go build an Exeggutor deck immediately. Uh, the card’s currently <strong>$51</strong>.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0875b4efbc8e6a0b3f2aaba118802392" data-recommend-id="image://0875b4efbc8e6a0b3f2aaba118802392" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lisia’s Appeal Special Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lisia’s Appeal Special Illustration Rare." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0875b4efbc8e6a0b3f2aaba118802392" data-recommend-id="image://0875b4efbc8e6a0b3f2aaba118802392" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lisia’s Appeal Special Illustration Rare." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Yup, it’s the obligatory waifu card.

It’s already idiotically inflated, given it’s just a decent ex card with quite a pretty piece of art that just caught fire due to the mimesis of collectors. It’s obviously no more powerful than the $8 regular version, which is what you should buy if you want that 300 attack in your deck, and if you’ve got the SIR to sell, sell it now before everyone entirely comes to their senses.

While each outlet has its own internal processes for how it handles submitting nominations, some that <em>Kotaku</em> spoke to explained they had to have votes in at an even earlier date so they could tally those votes for submission. The result is several overlapping deadlines that affect which games actually have a reasonable chance of being nominated for The Game Awards. A game like <em>The Veilguard</em>, which can take up to 60 hours to complete and launched less than two weeks before ballots were due, is affected more by timing than any other factor. Voters didn’t have as much time to play it as they did similarly epic games like <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em> which launched much earlier, nor does it benefit from brevity the way some games do, like <em>Astro Bot</em>.</p><p>Because of the lack of distance between the eligibility cut-off and votes being due, timing is everything in determining whether or not some games even get on the ballot. Oftentimes, the Game Awards are less a celebration of the best and brightest the industry has to offer than they are a representation of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/game-awards-2024-nominations-snubs-surprises/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/game-awards-2024-nominations-snubs-surprises/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most popular and mainstream games that voters actually got around to</a></span>. Games that aren’t even out yet are technically eligible, but it’s unlikely that many voters will have had much time with these, if any. Sure, someone might have a review copy, but one or two people at a publication trying to convince their colleagues who haven’t touched a game that they should give it a space on their single ballot to the biggest award show in the industry is a near-impossible task. The lack of a meaningful gap between the eligibility cut-off and when ballots are due is especially damaging to games that technically fall within the window but are only available to a select few jurors, and only for a brief time before their votes must be cast.</p><figure id="" data-id="e8bfce1bb95f46fda671477c79237017" data-recommend-id="image://e8bfce1bb95f46fda671477c79237017" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A render of The Game Awards' trophy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of The Game Awards' trophy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Game Awards</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e8bfce1bb95f46fda671477c79237017" data-recommend-id="image://e8bfce1bb95f46fda671477c79237017" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A render of The Game Awards' trophy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For example, <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 </em>launched today, November 20, and while I don’t think it would have been nominated for much, under The Game Awards’ current structure, it was technically eligible. But a game that only a select few of the jury has been able to put reasonable time into will never have a fair shot because statistically, almost no one on the jury would have been able to play it. As long as the show’s eligibility window ends within a hair’s breadth of when the ballots are due, games that launch close to the show itself are sprinting after competition that’s had a months-long head start. Sometimes a game like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-spider-man-2-review-ps5-venom-miles-morales-1850929271&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-spider-man-2-review-ps5-venom-miles-morales-1850929271"><em>Spider-Man 2</em></a></span><em> </em>manages to make its way into multiple categories despite releasing late in the window because it’s a huge, first-party IP that you can complete in a comfortable 20 hours. Other games end up like <em>The Veilguard</em>,<em> </em>launching at a time so disadvantageous that you only get one nomination in Accessibility, chosen by a specialist panel whose role in the awards is to be tuned into that pillar of game design.<br></p><p>Compare this to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.recordingacademy.com/news/2025-grammys-online-entry-process-how-to-guide-now-open&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.recordingacademy.com/news/2025-grammys-online-entry-process-how-to-guide-now-open" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Grammys</a></span>, one of the biggest awards ceremonies in the music industry. This next one is set to take place on February 2, but the eligibility criteria is months removed from the actual show. The 2025 Grammys will recognize music released from September 16, 2023 to August 30, 2024. Nominations weren’t even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.grammy.com/news/2025-grammys-nominations-full-winners-nominees-list&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.grammy.com/news/2025-grammys-nominations-full-winners-nominees-list" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced until November 8</a></span>. Look at all that time and space to actually consider what should be nominated. I’m not going to go to bat for The Grammys’ actual nominations because that show has its own institutional problems and a very narrow view of what’s worth recognizing. However, the structure of its eligibility and nomination process sure does sound like it would solve some of The Game Awards’ problems.</p><p>A lot of other video game award shows, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattgardner1/2024/06/20/2025-bafta-games-awards-opens-for-entries-with-new-fairer-rules/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattgardner1/2024/06/20/2025-bafta-games-awards-opens-for-entries-with-new-fairer-rules/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like the BAFTA Games Awards</a></span>, also don’t do this, and instead put months of distance between the window of eligibility and the date of the actual show. So why does The Game Awards do things this way? We reached out to the show for comment and didn’t receive an answer in time for publication, but I would hypothesize that much of it boils down to the show <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-awards-keighley-e3-trailers-1851083267&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-keighley-e3-trailers-1851083267">feeling like an ad for games</a></span> rather than a celebration of them. December is a strategic time for publishers to want their games to be adorned with accolades as people are looking to make their Christmas lists. I have to wonder if The Game Awards is even capable of this kind of restructuring, given how embedded it is in the industry’s marketing cycle. But if the show even considered how its structure inevitably undermines games like <em>The Veilguard</em>, it might make for a better, more representative event.</p><p>Inevitably, there will be those who say <em>The Veilguard </em>wasn’t snubbed and that it just didn’t deserve recognition. Pushing aside the bad-faith transphobic and racist nonsense that’s been surrounding the games for months, there’s a discussion to be had there. It is, without a doubt, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-reviews-metacritic-score-bioware-1851683347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-reviews-metacritic-score-bioware-1851683347">one of the more divisive games</a></span> in BioWare’s catalog. But anyone who thinks its timing didn’t play a factor in its complete absence is kidding themselves, and this kind of fundamental failing will affect games you like just as much as ones you don’t one day. Justice for Gareth David-Lloyd, you deserved a Best Performance nod for your work as Solas.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
