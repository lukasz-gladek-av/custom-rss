              <p><span>It doesn’t feel like Nintendo just released a new console. Last year around this time we were inundated with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-reveal-release-date-reddit-1851725408"><span>weekly leaks</span></a><span> about the Switch 2. They all pointed to the same thing: it would be a bigger, more powerful version of the console we already knew and loved. Nintendo kicked 2025 off by showing us a Switch 2 that was exactly that. It launched in June to significant fanfare and hype, and there has been surprisingly little to say about the Switch 2 ever since.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It looks lean, feels sleek, and runs older blockbusters and even some newer ones surprisingly well. But its boldest innovation is a video sharing feature that feels </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-one-will-play-uno-on-a-console-really-why-bother-looking-back-at-uno-the-xbox-live-arcade-hit-that-thrust-social-play-onto-the-360-generation"><span>plucked out of 2006</span></a><span> and which I never hear anyone talk about. The quintessential smartphone upgrade of video game consoles, the Switch 2 set launch sales records but dominated the conversation less than anyone expected.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Nintendo’s latest flagship console doesn’t break the mold. It remains, first and foremost, a machine for playing Nintendo games, most of which are sequels to franchises that have been around since the last millennium. And it does that splendidly, even if the games themselves haven’t always cleared the lofty bar set by the Switch 1’s first year. Do I sound a little disappointed? I’m trying not to be.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>2025 was a transition year for Nintendo’s hardware; one that feels less like a clear passing of the baton than an extended farewell where everyone spends an extra 15 minutes gossipping at the door while putting on their coats before actually saying goodbye. The Switch 1 was a must-buy in 2017. In 2025 the Switch 2 is more of a nice-to-have.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>The Hardware</h2> <p><span>You can tell when a certain line of hardware has matured by what people focus on. The raw specs? A refined form factor? New software features? With the Switch 2, it’s a satisfying but mostly inconsequential gimmick. One of the first things anyone will do with the new device is feel the tug of magnets as the new Joy-Con click into place on the sides of the console. A hundred times later, it still delights me and yields an unwarranted flash of joy. If only the thumb-stick nubs weren’t still garbage.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The other thing that stands out most about the Switch 2 is how much faster it charges. While the battery life overall isn’t very impressive, and is still sapped surprisingly quickly even in sleep mode, it’s now possible to get a mostly full charge in just one hour. This isn’t a reason to upgrade a console, but it’s one of the things I spend the most time doing with my Switch 2 besides playing it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The screen, slightly larger than that of its predecessor, also feels surprisingly revelatory. It’s like you’ve been driving with the sun visor down and then you lift it up to reveal the rest of the horizon. The addition of those few inches of space feels like having a blast shield lifted from your face. It’s not OLED, but the resolution is sharp, the colors are vibrant, and the overall build quality feels nice. Setting HDR correctly, though, is a pain.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000656191" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656191"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656191">Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Most importantly, the guts of the machine delivered the type of next-gen upgrade you’d want from a device that costs $150 more than its predecessor did at launch. It kept up well with modern third-party blockbusters like </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Star Wars Outlaws,</span></i><span> and ran first-party Nintendo games with sprawling worlds, like</span><i><span> Mario Kart World </span></i><span>and</span><i><span> Donkey Kong Bananza</span></i><span>, with no major issues, at least in docked mode.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The old Switch, meanwhile, is harder than ever to go back to. The screen is small, the bezels feel that much larger, and the OS lags more than my two-year-old on a one-mile walk around the neighborhood. The hardware has held up well mechanically, but is hanging off the edge of a cliff when it comes to actual game performance.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Fans have been seeing the original Switch show its age with new releases for years now, but </span><i><span>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</span></i><span> are likely to serve as the final nails in the coffin for anyone trying to stick it out on the less capable last-gen machines. Are the games busted on Switch 1? Not at all. Can you enjoy them? Definitely. Would I recommend just holding off until you eventually buy a Switch 2? Absolutely.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s worth noting that, like the Switch 2, the original Switch also saw a price hike in 2025. It now costs $40 more than it did at launch. The used prices for the old hardware, thankfully, have remained surprisingly low. A secondhand Switch Lite for $100 was probably the best deal in games this year.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>The Software</h2> <p><span>The Switch 2 interface remains stubbornly barebones in an era when the Xbox Series X/S and PS5 continue to add new bells and whistles to their home screen experiences. Customization options are minimal. The row of icons constantly jiggles around based solely on what you played last. Tons of blank real estate above and below is still a wasteland, with no backgrounds to swap to besides night mode.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>GameChat, the Switch 2’s actual big back-of-the-box feature, performs fine, but feels unmoored from the broader console experience. Meanwhile, the console itself can play </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span> better than its predecessor, but compared to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, the Switch 2 remains just as fundamentally uninterested in being a social hub as the Switch was.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s the only major gaming platform not to be integrated with the biggest communication platform for gaming: Discord. Sharing game capture and images now requires a dedicated smartphone app from Nintendo’s ever-growing repository of console features outsourced to second screens. It’s not a terrible idea in principle, but it doesn’t feel sane or streamlined in practice.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000656193" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656193"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656193">Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>2025 was the year that Nintendo tried to divorce itself from the increasingly unstable broader internet. It set up a dedicated Nintendo Today! news app that is sometimes the only place to find out about things like the upcoming </span><i><span>Zelda</span></i><span> movie, but is more often than not just a glorified calendar for sharing existing character art.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s also a dedicated app for parental controls, music, and more. None of it is organically integrated into the actual device fans just spent a ton of money on. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-store-app-music-too-many-switch-2-iphone-phone-2000641401"><span>The whole setup</span></a><span> is, frankly, insane.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>There were some bright spots for Nintendo’s on-system user-experience in 2025, however. It established virtual card sharing to allow users to lend out digital games across different devices as long as they’re linked by a family group or share a user profile. It’s a process that looks more complicated on paper than it feels in practice.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It makes the experience of jumping back and forth between the original Switch and the Switch 2 a lot more seamless than it was with any previous generational leaps in Nintendo’s history. The only downside is that cloud save syncing can’t always keep up. It’s a step in the right direction, but still a far cry from Microsoft’s brave new “play anywhere” future.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Another bone Nintendo threw to older Switch owners was GameShare, a way to use multiplayer across multiple devices in the same room. While GameShare works online via GameChat for Switch 2 owners, it also works locally for those with the old handheld hybrid. It works surprisingly well for things like</span><i><span> Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</span></i><span> multiplayer, streaming the game to an old Switch for player two. It runs at lower resolution and framerates, but is a nice option that adds utility to the older hardware, even if it’s probably going to stay a niche feature over the long run.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>The Services</h2> <p><span>Switch Online expanded in a big way this year with the addition of GameCube games. Exclusive to Switch 2, the new classic console experience kicked off with </span><i><span>F-Zero GX</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Soulcalibur II</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</span></i><span> in June, followed by</span><i><span> Super Mario Strikers</span></i><span> in July, </span><i><span>Chibi-Robo!</span></i><span> in August,</span><i><span> Luigi’s Mansion</span></i><span> in October, and </span><i><span>Wario World</span></i><span> in December.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Games like </span><i><span>Super Mario Sunshine</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</span></i><span> remain MIA for now, and it’ll be interesting to see how much the library expands into third-party releases. It added a lot of value to the existing $50-a-month Expansion Pack subscription, which also gained access to paid Switch 2 upgrades for Switch games like </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</span></i></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000656192" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656192"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656192">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>But one thing Nintendo didn’t do was bring back Virtual Console, or some other mechanism for buying old games a la carte. Entire months still go by without any new classics added to any of the console back catalogs. And glaring omissions like</span><i><span> Super Smash Bros. 64</span></i><span> raise questions about whether some games will ever be added to the service.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Switch Online, which is still just $20 a year, will become mandatory for GameChat access starting after March 31, 2026. At the same time, users are getting other benefits like new music in Nintendo’s Spotify-like app for game soundtracks. Practically every week gets new tracks for games ranging from </span><i><span>Metroid 2</span></i><span> to </span><i><span>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</span></i><span>, though obvious albums like </span><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span> are still missing.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Meanwhile, other benefits have been dropped from the service. Just in time for the new console’s release, Nintendo ditched its gold coins system that gave players cash back on eShop purchases, and is similarly sunsetting its Switch Game Vouchers program, a series of coupons that let fans get new games at a discount. Done right, it was one way to keep gaming on Switch more affordable. Instead, being a Nintendo fan is only getting more expensive amid tariffs, $80 games, and Switch 2 upgrade fees.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>The Games</h2> <p><span>It was an eclectic year for Switch and Switch 2 releases, if not one that will be remembered like 2017, when Nintendo launched a new console into one of the best lineups in its history. </span><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span> initially dazzled but doesn’t feel as full-bodied as </span><i><span>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</span></i><span> does after years of post-release updates and DLC. Despite issuing a number of balance updates, the company has been weird about actually letting fans play the game the way they want to online.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>New add-ons for </span><i><span>Mario Party Jamboree</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</span></i><span> were nice upgrade incentives but hardly groundbreaking. </span><i><span>Kirby Air Riders</span></i><span>, for all of director Masahiro Sakurai’s pre-release hype, was nice, fun, </span><i><span>fine</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>Donkey Kong Bananza</span></i><span>, an unexpected highlight, provided a novel gimmick and a crowd-pleasing ending to bookend an otherwise B+ experience. </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</span></i><span>, despite the nearly decade-long wait, was also less than transformative.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000000903" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000000903"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000000903">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> delivered for</span><i><span> Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon</span></i><span> fans, bolstering what would have been an otherwise disappointing inaugural holiday season for the Switch 2, but it did not quite transform the franchise the way Switch 1 iterations of some long-standing series did. There was certainly no shortage of new Nintendo releases in 2025, from </span><i><span>Mario Galax</span></i><span>y remasters to </span><i><span>Tears of the Kingdom</span></i><span> upgrades, but nothing that quite lived up to the sky-high expectations attached to the new hardware around this time last year.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But Nintendo has done a good job of building up the Switch 2’s initial base of third-party support. Ubisoft showed up with ports that underpromised and over-delivered, even as others like </span><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span> were indefinitely delayed. </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Hitman: World of Assassination</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Street Fighter 6</span></i><span> all showed the breadth of what fans might expect heading into this new Nintendo console generation, which is access to many of the biggest modern games around, available with fewer compromises than expected, at least early on.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If you look at the 10 highest-rated releases of the year according to Metacritic, seven of them are available on Switch and four of them, including </span><i><span>Hades 2</span></i><span>, are console exclusives. It’s not hard to see the rest, including </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </span></i><span>and</span><i><span> Blue Prince</span></i><span>, eventually coming to the platform in 2026. At least for now, Switch 2 is shaping up to have a broader powerhouse library of games than its predecessor. The only real question is whether Nintendo can raise the bar again, or has hit its current ceiling.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>The Future</h2> <p><span>There were four things that made the first year of the original Switch so special: portability, indie games, a great</span><i><span> Mario</span></i><span> game, and a groundbreaking </span><i><span>Zelda</span></i><span>. The Switch 2 benefited from none of those things in quite the same way. It still feels like we’re in the warm-up phase. Nintendo isn’t one to rest on its laurels, but it’s also looking beyond just games these days.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Nintendo’s biggest release of 2026 probably won’t be on Switch 2. If it performs as well as the first one, </span><i><span>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</span></i><span> will, in terms of cultural reach and box office prowess, outshine anything that the company can stick on a cartridge. It opened a new Super Nintendo World theme park location in Orlando this year, and continues branching out into real-world experiences, new stores, more toys, and other transmedia products.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The Switch 2 feels like the Switch 1 all grown up, and it is both more useful and more boring as a result. It wears a half-zip, pays its bills on time, and always shows up on time at the bar. It has its shit together. Give it your money. It’s the gaming equivalent of investing your 401k in an index fund.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But can Nintendo still flood it with imaginative possibilities that surprise and delight the way it did with releases like Labo and </span><i><span>Ring Fit</span></i><span> on the Switch in its early years? Will it give us fresh gameplay ideas and new franchises, or reinvent the old ones to the point where they feel almost unrecognizable? That will be the test for the Switch 2 in 2026 and beyond. Especially if Nintendo is going to start charging more for it, as some analysts are </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/hardware-prices-will-not-fall-industry-analysts-are-extremely-concerned-about-console-prices-wouldnt-be-shocked-if-the-nintendo-switch-2-costs-more-in-2026/"><span>currently speculating aloud</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The Switch 2 is good enough, but it still has a lot to prove. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s a new way to experience Nintendo’s fantastic <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-the-kotaku-rev-1792885174">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>.</em> A completely free virtual reality mod for the open-world RPG is out now, letting you hop into Hyrule like never before, and it looks amazing.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/Crementif/BotW-BetterVR"><em>BetterVR</em> is a newly released mod</a> for the Wii U-emulated version of <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-breath-of-the-wild-helped-me-love-food-again-1842385671"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> that lets you play through the entirety of the game through the eyes of Link himself. You’ll need a copy of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> on Wii U, a somewhat powerful PC, the Cemu emulator, and, of course, a virtual reality headset like the Meta Quest 3. But if you have all that, you can now virtually explore <em>Breath of the Wild</em> in a whole new way.</p>

  <p>This is a fully stereo-rendered VR experience with 6DOF and no alternated eye rendering. <em>BetterVR</em> also supports full hand and arm tracking, letting you chop down trees and fight monsters by flailing around. (You can also use normal button commands if you prefer, of course.) It also features customized VR controls, like reaching behind your back to grab your sword, so it should play and feel like a native VR game.</p>

 <p>I’m not surprised this VR mod is so good. The team behind it, Flat2VR, are the same folks who created the <a href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-2-vr-mod-alyx-pc-valve-steam-gordon-freeman-1849603782">excellent<em> Half-Life 2 VR</em> mod that is as good as Valve’s very own</a><em> Half-Life: Alyx.</em> The team has also ported other games to VR and has even developed commercially released ports of titles, like <em>Roboquest VR.</em> Even with all that experience, however, making this mod wasn’t easy, as explained in a thorough writeup on the mod’s GitHub page. They had to reverse engineer a lot of how<em> Breath of the Wild</em> worked and then translate that into something that could be rendered and played in VR. The end result is impressive as heck, and I’m almost tempted to download this mod and set up an emulator to check it out. I wasn’t a big fan of <em>Breath of the Wild,</em> but maybe this would change my mind.</p>

 <p>As for how Nintendo lawyers will react to this, who can say? The project seems confident enough that it will be fine, <a href="https://x.com/Flat2VR/status/2005107315041513621">as the team has been posting about it publicly for days</a> before it launched on Tuesday. Seeing as the mod itself contains zero <em>Breath of the Wild</em> files, I’d say <em>BetterVR</em> is probably safe, but you never know with Nintendo.</p>

              <p>2025 is almost over. The internet is full of <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">GOTY lists</a> recommending dozens of stellar releases. You can find many of the games on those lists currently on sale on the PlayStation store. It’s not a bad time to catch up on that game or two you missed that everyone was buzzing about this year and see what all the fuss is about while you’re nursing that New Year’s hangover.</p> <p>Below is a quick rundown of some of the biggest releases of 2025 that are all currently discounted on PSN:</p> <ul> <li><em><strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</strong></em> – $35 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign</strong></em> – $30 (25 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong></em> – $40 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Battlefield 6</em></strong> – $49 (30 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Arc Raiders</em></strong> – $32 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></strong> – $50 (29 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></strong> – $16 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Borderlands 4</em></strong> – $56 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Dying Light: The Beast</em></strong> – $48 (20 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</strong></em> – $56 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Split Fiction</em></strong> – $37.50 (25 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Silent Hill f</em></strong> – $42 (40 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></strong> – $49 (30 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></strong> – $33.50 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em></strong> – The Ivalice Chronicles – $40 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></strong> – $38.50 (45 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em></strong> – $35 (50 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>Standout deals include <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, and <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> which are all essentially half off. <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> is the cheapest overall on the list at $16 and probably has the best player value quotient when it comes to how many times a game can kill you without making you quit. Games that didn’t get as much fanfare in 2025, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-the-kotaku-review-2000630341"><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em></a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-review-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000638368"><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505"><em>Silent Hill f</em></a> are all well worth a look, too.</p>

 <p>If you didn’t catch <em>Gears of War</em>, <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, or <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> when they launched on Xbox, they’re all on sale as well. <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> is $20 (half off), <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> is $36 (40 percent off), and<em> Indiana Jones</em> is $49 (30 percent off). If you’re looking for some Soulslike action, <a href="https://kotaku.com/first-berserker-khazan-review-anime-soulslike-rpg-1851771917"><em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em></a> is $42 (30 percent off) and <a href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-gooner-souls-pc-steam-reviews-1851786856"><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em></a> is $40 (20 percent off); both of those are very good. Finally, there’s <em>Hell Is Us</em>, a sci-fi horror action-adventure about war and time-loop monsters <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/767993/hell-is-us-review-ps5-xbox-steam">that’s more than the sum of its parts</a>. At just $36 (40 percent off), it’s currently at its lowest price yet.</p>

              <p>Over the weekend, I went out to the theater and saw <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-ash-runtime-revealed-three-hours-long-sega-outer-worlds-2-2000643471"><em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em></a>. Even as a big <em>Avatar</em> sicko, I walked out disappointed. But I don’t want to talk about that. Instead, I want to highlight a moment I was forced to watch <em>twice</em> due to some snafu at my local AMC. The moment in question involves some children hooking up a tube to a monkey’s face and farting into the other end. Hey Hollywood, what the fuck?</p> <p>We arrived to see <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-and-ash-trailer-fire-clan-james-cameron-1851787146"><em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em></a> about 15 minutes before the movie started, and to our surprise, my wife and I noticed the trailers were already playing. Strange! We sat down and I caught a new trailer for Sony’s upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/zootopia-2-nick-judy-relationship-romance-abortion-comic-2000649147"><em>Zootopia</em></a> knock-off, <em>GOAT</em>, which is a basketball movie about talking animals or something. Approximately one minute and 49 seconds into this trailer, I was surprised to see two young rhino girls using a tube and a gas mask to funnel a fart from one of the animals’ asses to the face of a sleeping monkey man.&nbsp; Here’s the moment in question.</p>

  <p>I looked around the theater, which was basically empty as we’d arrived fairly early, and questioned if I’d actually seen what I thought I’d seen. I mean, sure, animated movies for kids are filled with fart jokes, so it hardly seemed impossible that Sony’s <em>GOAT </em>would feature one. But having cartoon animal kids basically recreate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7c_GK40Dsjg">the fart mask stunt from <em>Jackass 2</em></a>&nbsp;as a silly moment caught me off guard. I shook it off and soon was lost in the opening minutes of <em>Fire and Ash</em>, the&nbsp;<em>GOAT&nbsp;</em>trailer a distant memory. Or so I thought.</p>

 <p>About 10 minutes later, someone seemingly complained that the movie had started early, and so the AMC restarted everything, trailers included. Mildly annoying, but it did make me giggle at all the people who had arrived late specifically to avoid trailers then being forced to watch them anyway. It also meant that I’d have a second chance to catch the fart joke. And yup, to my surprise, <em>GOAT</em> does indeed include a recreation of<em> Jackass 2’s</em> fart mask bit, complete with the victim retching and losing it.</p>

 <p>Folks, I’m not a prude. I love the <em>Jackass</em> movies. And I’m not above laughing at a fart joke or someone getting hit in the groin. But it feels like <em>GOAT </em>and the people involved were desperate to one-up all the other fart jokes in kids’ movies these days and, in the process, created something that feels like it crosses a line that I’m not even sure I can properly put my finger on. At the very least, moving forward, I’d like a warning before any trailers that feature kids recreating gross-out pranks from <em>Jackass</em> movies, okay?</p>
