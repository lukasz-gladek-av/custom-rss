When Fisk asks why Murdock stopped being a vigilante, our blind hero answers, “A line has been crossed,” before we see his cracked Daredevil mask fall to the ground. From the sounds of it, Murdock is struggling with the common vigilante paradox of how enacting violence may debatably stop some violence but also blurs the line between justice and retribution. Obviously he gets back to bone-crushing action before all is said and done (and, by the looks of it, breaks many, many bones indeed), but the season could find him struggling to reconcile his thirst for vengeance with his duty to protect. </p><p>Another aspect of the new trailer that should pique everyone’s interest is the dynamic between Murdock and Mayor Fisk. The trailer reveals it was Murdock who invited Fisk to meet at the diner. But more importantly, we see Fisk’s almost sentimental connection to his archnemesis, displayed when he remarks, “It’s not entirely unpleasant seeing you again.” Looks like there may be a mutual level of respect between the two men who both succumb to their violent sides to serve their individual purposes.  </p><p>Something tells me there’ll be some common enemy or convoluted entanglement of circumstances that invariably leads to Fisk and Daredevil temporarily teaming up. We’ll find out if I’m right when the series premieres on March 4. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

My case is about 5 years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I’ve been working on this. I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I’m going away next month.”</p><p>Fortune’s Run has been in early access for over a year at a price of $20. It currently has just over one hundred user reviews with a Steam rating of 90 percent. It’s due to receive more updates and content, but there’s no telling when, if ever, the game will actually be completed at this point. “It’s a shame, but it’s the consequences of my actions,” the developer continued. “I was a very violent person and I hurt a lot of people in my life. Unfortunately, the sentence isn’t going to help with that at all, but I guess we all know that. So the game isn’t TOTALLY dead, but unfortunately due to even further bad things happening, it’s unclear what will happen.”</p><p>The game is a boomer shooter take on PC classics like <em>Deus Ex</em> and <em>Thief</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>with the grimy post-apocalyptic punk visual style of the early <em>Fallout</em> games. It’s mission-based instead of an open-ended sandbox, making it a unique blend of old-school PC gaming sensibilities. <em>Fortune’s Run</em> is the kind of game about which people constantly write things like, “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmersiveSim/comments/16y788y/how_is_nobody_talking_about_fortunes_run/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmersiveSim/comments/16y788y/how_is_nobody_talking_about_fortunes_run/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How is nobody talking about Fortune’s Run?</a></span>” It was already a cult hit with the potential to be a lowkey GOTY-contender whenever it came out of early access.</p><p>“I know many of you will be upset and disappointed but please understand that there’s absolutely nothing I can do, these wheels were in motion long before I started making this game and it’s just been slowly unraveling in my face the whole time,” Dizzie wrote. “I want to underline that I’m no longer in financial dire straits since our game actually sold OK, so I should be able to afford rent once I get out, so there’s a chance that if you wait a few years I’ll be able to cap off the release. In fact, there’s not very much content left to work on, I’ve been making stubs and prototypes of the missing levels in my spare time.”</p><p>Before going to prison, the developer left players <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240?emclan=103582791470559969&amp;emgid=532087801681805320&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240?emclan=103582791470559969&amp;emgid=532087801681805320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with one last update</a></span>. It includes new missions, story sequences, puzzles, objects in the environments to interact with, and “hundreds upon hundreds of bug fixes.” However, it’ll break players’ existing saves and there’s no one to QA it. It’s unclear if Dizzie will be communicating with fans again before development goes on hiatus or if this is the last communication for some time. The game remains available to buy on Steam.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In them, Batman and Superman show up to finish Braniac off and reveal that the Justice League members the player killed were actually just clones. Everyone except Wonder Woman seemingly, who ended up getting killed at the hands of the Superman clone. Batman’s pivotal death? Also a clone. It was all part of the caped crusader’s master plan, apparently. It sounds about as well put together as the live-service pitch for the underlying game. </p><p>The Suicide Squad members remove their bomb implants and leave the planet to explore outer space, while the remaining Justice League members travel to all of the universes Braniac ruined to set things right and “atone.” The whole thing last less than two minutes, and despite being entirely an exposition dump, still feels like it leaves a lot unexplained. It’s also hard to know how much ofthis was Rocksteady’s original plan for the story’s year-one conclusion, and how much of it was cobbled together last-minute as the studio pivots to new projects. </p><p>“That was the most disappointing ending I’ve seen,” wrote one commenter on YouTube. “Pissed off the entire fandom, sullied their legacy,  only for it to go the ‘none of it mattered’ route just for the sake live gaming and money,” wrote another. Many pointed out that Robin is also technically dead in the Arkhamverse now too. “I did kindaaaa hope that they would go out with bang but obv that didnt happen, just killed brainiac and im more confused then satisfied,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideSquadGaming/comments/1i18yte/that_was_kinda_ass_ngl/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideSquadGaming/comments/1i18yte/that_was_kinda_ass_ngl/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> a player on Reddit. Even some players on the game’s official Discord who loved <em>Suicide Squad</em>’s gameplay and have stuck with it for nearly a year were let down by the ending. </p><p>The bizarre clone twist caps of nearly 12 months of rough going for a big-budget blockbuster from one of the most acclaimed studios in games. Bad reviews and fan frustrations with the base campaign’s main story rolled into underwhelming post-launch content plans that offered very little in the way of fresh mission types or new story beats. The new playable characters rotated into each season, beginning with the Joker and ending with Deathstroke, also didn’t win players back. </p><p>By June, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-arkham-1851522893?_gl=1*zkd93a*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjk1MDQyOS45MS4xLjE3MzY5NTI4MDUuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-arkham-1851522893?_gl=1*zkd93a*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjk1MDQyOS45MS4xLjE3MzY5NTI4MDUuNjAuMC4w"><em>Bloomberg </em>reported</a></span> that Rocksteady had already pivoted to other projects, like a <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> director’s cut, and in recent months the studio has suffered two rounds of layoffs.

Where that leaves the <em>Batman: Arkham</em> universe remains to be seen. A VR spinoff, <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow </em>arrived just last year to decent reviews. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
