            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  Save $70 on a 3-pack of the Eero mesh Wi-Fi 7 routers over at Amazon for a limited time.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>Now that we’re in the thick of the holiday season, there is much gift shopping to be done. While it makes sense to hold out until Black Friday and Cyber Monday to see what sorts of deals all the major retailers are showcasing, you can actually get ahead of things and find some excellent savings opportunities right now. Perhaps it’s time to help your parents finally update their home Wi-Fi. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5757/">Amazon has its Eero 7 dual-band mesh Wi-Fi routers on sale right now for about 20% off.</a> For a limited time, you can save $35 on the one router which brings the price down from $170 to just $135.</p>
<p>Now the real value of a mesh Wi-Fi router can be attained with only one of them. You want to create a mesh Wi-Fi network by having multiple units working together. Luckily, Amazon has the Eero 7 dual-band mesh Wi-Fi routers available in bundles of two and three. The 2-pack normally goes for $280, but has been discounted down to $220 — saving you $60. then we have the 3-pack which is usually sitting at $350 now going for just $280 — saving you $70. So at its best value, you can secure yourself three of these mesh Wi-Fi routers for as little as $93 per router.</p>

<h2>Total Coverage of Your Home</h2>
<p data-start="0" data-end="655">Unreliable internet can be one of the most annoying things to deal with at home. Few things are more frustrating than web pages that won’t load or devices constantly dropping their connection. A Wi-Fi 7 mesh system can make a huge difference. The Eero 7 mesh network is designed to deliver stable, high-speed coverage throughout your home. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5757/">Each Eero 7 node can cover up to 2,000 square feet and handle more than 120 connected devices.</a> With a three-pack, you can blanket up to 6,000 square feet and connect over 360 devices at once. And if your home needs even more range, you can easily expand your network later by adding additional nodes.</p>


<p data-start="657" data-end="1188">Between the three router units, you’ll get six Ethernet ports in total, giving you plenty of wired connection options. The Eero 7 can deliver speeds of up to 2.5Gbps (that’s 2,500Mbps), so streaming 4K video from anywhere in your house is no problem. Even cloud gaming becomes smooth and consistent, especially with the growing number of devices that support the Xbox app, such as Fire TV sticks and Samsung smart TVs. You can play games with minimal lag — even without owning a console — thanks to the strong, fast Wi-Fi connection.</p>
<p data-start="1190" data-end="1393" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Setup is also a breeze. The Eero app walks you through every step, making it quick and easy to get your mesh network running smoothly so you can finally say goodbye to dead zones and dropped connections.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today, during Xbox’s latest digital showcase event, Poncle announced <em>Vampire Crawlers</em>, a <em>Vampire Survivors</em> follow-up coming to Xbox and PC in 2026. But instead of being a top-down idle shooter or “reverse bullet hell” game like <a href="https://kotaku.com/castlevania-roguelike-vampire-survivors-steam-itch-io-1848402308">2021’s <em>Vampire Survivors,</em></a> this newly revealed game is a dungeon crawler with roguelike elements and cards.</p> <p>On November 20, during Xbox’s Partner Preview event, Poncle revealed the first look at<em> Vampire Crawlers.</em>&nbsp;Here’s the trailer, which is filled with a lot of the same enemies, jokes, and chaos you’d expect from <em>Vampire Survivors.&nbsp;</em></p>

  <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/vampire-crawlers-xbox-partner-preview/">In an Xbox interview with Poncle founder &amp; CEO Luca,</a> the creator behind <em>Vampire Survivors</em> explains that they have been working on this sequel/spin-off for roughly four years, starting work on it shortly after the OG game exploded on Steam. It is one of many possible spin-offs and experiments the team is working on. This just happened to be the first one to “hit its goal,” hence why it’s getting released first in 2026.</p>

 <p>When asked what kind of game <em>Vampire Crawlers</em> is, Luca joked that it’s a totally new genre called “Action TurboTurn™ Game (Turbo Turn System).”</p> <p>“Jokes aside, this game is just a dungeon crawler you play with cards,” admitted Luca. “It’s about mowing down hordes of enemies using cards, while you explore dungeons, playing as slowly or as fast as you prefer. You can take your time and be tactical, or play cards as fast as you humanly can, because the game is built to always provide accurate logical outcomes, regardless of the visual chaos that your abilities might cause.”</p>

 <p>Interestingly, Luca tells Xbox that <em>Vampire Crawlers</em> will launch as a full game, and not in early access, though Poncle does have plans to update it after launch if players like <em>Crawlers</em> and want more content and features.</p> <p>“Just like <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, we’ve built the game so that it could eventually be expanded,” said Luca. “We’ll leave it to the community to tell us if they want even more, and what they actually want from it going forward.”</p> <p><em>Vampire Crawlers</em> launches sometime in 2026 on Xbox, Game Pass, and PC. It will be available day one on Game Pass and will support Xbox Play Anywhere.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/black-friday-2025-game-sale-kingdom-come-monster-hunter-2000645834</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/12-of-this-year%E2%80%99s-biggest-games-are-getting-decent-black-friday-discounts.1359694/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The season for patient players and procrastinators has arrived. Anyone who held off on buying new games this year can now get them for much cheaper. Not every new release is steeply discounted <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/black-friday-2025">for Black Friday 2025</a>, but there are definitely some exceptional deals this time around.</p> <p>In years past, when there were more AAA releases and physical games were more prevalent, the Black Friday deals were easier to pinpoint. Now, everything is on sale almost all the time, so it’s harder to figure out what’s worth paying attention to and actually grabbing at that new discounted price.</p>

 <p>Below is a quick list of 12 of the biggest games that came out this year and how cheap they are on various storefronts and platforms:</p> <ul> <li><strong><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$30</strong> (57 percent off) at Amazon/GameStop</li> <li><strong><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$50</strong> (29 percent off) at Best Buy</li> <li><strong><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X) – <strong>$35</strong> (50 percent off) at Microsoft / $40 (43 percent off) at Target</li> <li><strong><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$35</strong> (50 percent off) at Best Buy</li> <li><strong><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$33.50</strong> (33 percent off) at Microsoft / $40 (20 percent off) at Best Buy</li> <li><strong><em>Death Stranding 2</em></strong> (PS5) – <strong>$50</strong> (29 percent off) at Target</li> <li><strong><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></strong> (PlayStation/Xbox) – <strong>$25</strong> (38 percent off) at Amazon</li> <li><strong><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></strong> – <strong>$30</strong> (57 percent off) at Amazon and Best Buy</li> <li><strong><em>Split Fiction </em></strong>– <strong>$40</strong> (20 percent off) at Amazon and Target</li> <li><strong><em>Silent Hill f</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$50</strong> (29 percent off) at Best Buy</li> <li><strong><em>Avowed</em></strong> (Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$47</strong> (33 percent off) at Microsoft</li> <li><strong><em>Borderlands 4</em></strong> (PS5/Xbox Series X/S) – <strong>$48</strong> (31 percent off) Amazon</li> </ul> <p>Anything that came out this year and is already half off or more is a decent pick-up. That includes <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em> and <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, both of which are exceptionally crafted, sprawling games that you can snag for just $30. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> and <em>Doom: The Dark ages</em> are also both half-price, though only the digital version for Xbox when it comes to the latter.</p> <p>At the other end you have games that came out more recently and aren’t quite ready to hit that bargain bin status. Of these, <em>Borderlands 4</em> is the most decent find at less than $50 despite only being a couple of months old. <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>at just $20 off is borderline, but not too shabby for <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">a GOTY contender heading into awards season</a>. The biggest steal on this list is probably <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-forsaken-hollows-artorias-dark-souls-2000643101"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></a><em>. </em>At $25 it’s not the biggest discount but it was already just $40 to begin with and it’s hands-down the best multiplayer action-RPG around right now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday are approaching fast, but you don’t actually have to wait until then to start saving. Some products are already seeing some early Black Friday Discounts over a week ahead of schedule. If you’re thinking about upgrading your old monitor or putting together a brand-new desk setup, the Asus TUF gaming monitor is definitely worth a look. Whether you play games regularly or just want a solid everyday display, this 27-inch QHD screen checks all the important boxes—and right now it comes with a surprisingly large discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5755/">For a short time, Amazon is taking 28% off the price. It normally sells for $249, but the current deal drops it to just $179, giving you a full $70 in savings.</a></p>
<p data-start="609" data-end="1082">The Asus TUF gaming monitor offers a comfortable 27-inch size that feels spacious without overwhelming your desk. It delivers a 2560 x 1440 QHD resolution, which is pretty much the sweet spot for a display of this size. HDR support helps produce rich, punchy colors with standout whites and dark, deep shadows. On top of that, the 180Hz refresh rate is impressively fast, and compatibility with both G-SYNC and FreeSync keeps your visuals smooth by reducing screen tearing. It utilized Asus Extreme Low Motion Blur Sync (ELMB Sync) which works to eliminate ghosting, increasing clarity for games with high frame rates.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5755/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>It’s 1ms response time will keep the games you play feeling fast and snappy, allowing you to react nearly instantaneously. Since making the jump from being a console gamer to PC gamer, I’ve come to realize just how important this is. I didn’t know how bad I had it on my old Vizio TV until I played through <em>Silksong</em> on my gaming laptop, and then tried booting it up on my TV. Felt unplayable. I breezed through many of the platforming sections on my laptop but struggled with the simplest jumps when moving to my TV.</p>
<p data-start="1433" data-end="1683">The monitor plays nicely with a wide variety of devices—your gaming PC, laptop, Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, or nearly anything else you’d want to plug in. It features two HDMI 2.0 ports and a DisplayPort connection, giving you plenty of flexibility.</p>


<h2 data-start="1433" data-end="1683">Game on for Longer</h2>
<p data-start="1685" data-end="1864" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">The stand supports both height and tilt adjustments, letting you fine-tune the viewing angle so you can stay comfortable, even during long workdays or late-night gaming marathons.</p>
<p data-start="1685" data-end="1864" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5755/">Even if you’re not into gaming, this monitor is genuinely impressive for the price—especially with the 28% markdown.</a> You’ll even receive three free months of Adobe Creative Cloud with your purchase.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gopro-hero-13-just-dropped-by-90-joining-amazons-early-black-friday-sales-2000644665</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gopro-hero13-black-falls-to-the-loweset-price-that-only-black-friday-could-make-happen.1359688/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Planning on going on an adventure and filming it? Your smartphone might not be the best gear for the job. You need a solid action camera that helps you film like a pro, even when things get complicated (hiking, swimming, cycling, etc).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5635/">The GoPro Hero 13 is made for just that, and Amazon is offering a chance to grab it for less right now.</a> This $400 camera is now going for $310, which is also the lowest price we have seen it drop to in 30 days. It’s an early Black Friday deal, which means it’s likely going to expire soon. Now is the time to improve your filming experience without shelling out big bucks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5635/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Sharp, Clear, and Stable Footage</h2>
<p>This tiny but mighty camera shoots in 5.3K at 60fps, which offers 91% more resolution than 4K and over six times the detail of standard 1080p. That means sharper, brighter footage for all your adventures, whether you’re filming in the day or at night. You will also be able to shoot slow-motion videos. In fact, the Hero 13 is GoPro’s slowest slow-mo camera yet, capable of capturing video slowed down by up to 13x. Use it for high-action shots where every frame counts!</p>
<p>For stunning photos, it offers 27MP still image capture, so you don’t need a separate camera for high-quality shots. It even turns into a webcam or live streaming camera when needed, which can be quite useful for remote workers.</p>



<p>There’s HB-Series lens compatibility as well, which lets you set up your camera for a wide range of specialty shots. Even better, the camera automatically detects which lens or filter you’ve attached and fine-tunes the settings for it. This way, you can spend more time doing what you love instead of worrying about complicated camera settings.</p>
<p>HyperSmooth 6.0 stabilization keeps the footage impressively stable, even when you’re on the move. Bumpy rides or a bit of chaotic running won’t leave you with shaky footage that’s tough to watch or headache-inducing. All things considered, the GoPro Hero 13 can be a great option for anyone who needs a reliable action camera to record all their indoor and outdoor adventures.</p>
<p>It offers high-quality footage, stunning stills, impressive stabilization, and a lot more. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5635/">The current deal drops the price to just $310, making the upgrade quite affordable. Grab it while the offer is still live.</a></p>
