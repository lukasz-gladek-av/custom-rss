              <p>The right speaker can bring life to any party, and even make those weekend solo sessions way more enjoyable. But you don’t have to spend big to get quality, room-filling sound paired with a solid battery life. If you’re in the market for a good Bluetooth speaker that doesn’t cost an arm and a leg, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5022/">The Anker Soundcore 2 portable Bluetooth speaker is now down to just $28 on Amazon, after a massive 38% discount.</a> This deal only applies to the Black color, but some other options are discounted as well. Just note that the discount is a limited-time one, so we recommend acting fast to grab it. The retailer might be pushing the price back up sooner than you think!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5022/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Richer Sound, Both Indoor and Outdoor</h2>
<p>The build is truly portable and comes with a basic, no-fuss design. You’ll find all the controls at the top, so getting the party started is fairly simple. You’re getting dual 6W neodymium drivers that blast rich sound that captures all the highs and lows well. The BassUp technology offers more depth at all volume levels. You can crank it all the way up or keep it low-key for a self-care night. Either way, you’ll get clear sound without distortion.</p>
<p>The Bluetooth 5.0 connectivity offers a stable 66-foot range, which translates into clearer sound even when you’re not super close to the speaker. Prefer keeping things wired? There’s a built-in AUX port for plugging your devices. The battery life is just as solid; you’re looking at about 24 hours of playtime on a single charge. For reference, that’s going roughly 500 songs without worrying about plugging it in. Everyone’s favorite playlists get a chance!</p>



<p>The speaker is also rated for IPX7 waterproof, so it can handle a few splashes and light rain easily. You can take it to the beach, hang by the pool, or even bring it into the bathroom for a private shower concert. It also supports wireless stereo pairing, meaning you can pair two of these for bigger, wider sound if you’re planning to host larger gatherings.</p>
<p>All things considered, this is a great speaker for anyone looking to boost sound on a budget. It’s compact and easy to carry, plus it offers superior sound. Anker has made it outdoor-friendly, so it can handle dust and water quite well. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5022/">It’s down to just $28 right now, and definitely worth grabbing while the deal’s still live.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Apple Quietly Clears Out the M4 MacBook Pro With Hundreds Off After the M5 Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-m4-macbook-pro-is-being-pushed-onto-the-sales-rack-go-grab-one-now-2000639133</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-quietly-clears-out-the-m4-macbook-pro-with-hundreds-off-after-the-m5-launch.1335784/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s new-product drops are huge events, and understandably so. The debut of a new Apple device like the M5 laptop sends thousands and perhaps millions of people to stores to be the first to have it. But the more economical reaction is to start watching the price of the device it’s replacing: in this case, the M4 line of laptops. Sure enough, those prices are coming down — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5023/">Amazon is now selling the 14-inch M4 MacBook Pro for just $1,600</a>.</p>
<p>It’s not like the M4 MacBook Pro is some kind of dated or outmoded device — it debuted exactly one year ago, with all the bells, whistles, and accompanying hype we’re now seeing for the M5 models. And that hype has been totally justified — the average Amazon review of the M4 MacBook Pro is a stellar 4.8 out of 5 stars.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5023/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Thing of Beauty</h2>
<p>Apple products in general and MacBooks in particular have made their bones for years thanks in no small part to their exceptional design. Frankly, they’re just really good-looking machines. That of course would wear off quickly if they didn’t have anything going for them under the hood, but that’s never been the case with the MacBooks.</p>
<p>The display is where the true beauty lies with the M4 MacBook Pro, because it’s a 14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR screen with up to 1600 nits of peak brightness that is simply stunning. Creative work like photo and video editing will never look better, nor will your streaming or video calls. There’s also never any worry about lag or glitching out, because the M4 chip and its integrated graphics driver are designed to deliver peak visuals.</p>



<h2>(Almost) the Latest</h2>
<p>Everything else in and about the M4 MacBook Pro is either Apple’s very latest tech and features, or close enough to it to still be about the best laptops on the market. First and foremost is Apple Intelligence, the advanced artificial intelligence assistant that is the perfect combination of power, speed, and security — not even Apple can see your searches or search history. When you start exploring Apple Intelligence, you won’t want to stop, and with the M4 MacBook Pro’s battery life extending almost 24 hours on a single charge, you won’t have to.</p>
<p>There’s no shame in your game if you’re a one-generation-ago shopper, especially when that previous-gen tech is only a year old and possessing nearly all of the features of its successor model. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5023/">That’s the deal that presents itself with the M4 MacBook Pro, because it’s worth every penny of its newly reduced $1,600 Amazon price.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anker’s New 160W Prime Charger Just Hit Record Low for the First Time, and It’s Already Running Low on Stock]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-new-160w-prime-charger-just-hit-record-low-for-the-first-time-and-its-already-running-low-on-stock-2000639096</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker%E2%80%99s-new-160w-prime-charger-just-hit-record-low-for-the-first-time-and-it%E2%80%99s-already-running-low-on-stock.1335760/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We all use multiple devices every day; for both work and play. Our phones keep us connected, laptops handle the typical 9-to-5, and tablets come in handy for some on-the-go productivity. But juggling chargers for everything? That’s where it can get messy.</p>
<p>Carrying separate blocks and wires for all your devices is inconvenient. Things get bulky fast, and there’s no guarantee you’ll find a spare outlet for each device when you’re not at home. The solution? An efficient, but safe-to-use multi-port charger that works well with a range of devices.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5020/"> The 3-port Anker Prime charger does a great job at that, and you can now grab it for just $110 on Amazon, after a nice $40 discount.</a> The only catch? This deal is limited to Prime members. Non-Prime members can still get it at the regular price of $150, or wait it out for another future drop.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5020/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Charge Multiple Devices at Once</h2>
<p>You’re getting three charging ports and a total output of 160W. It can deliver up to 140W from a single port, which is great for power-hungry devices like MacBooks. When using all three, the power gets split up depending on the devices you’re juicing up. For example, it can deliver 70W + 70W + 20W when you’re charging two laptops at once, or 100W + 30W + 30W if you want to prioritize one main device, while also powering two more.</p>
<p>There’s a smart display on top, which gives you an insight into exactly how much power is being delivered to each device in real time. For more custom modes, you can connect the charger to the Anker app via Bluetooth. It lets you customize your control, plus switch charging modes as per your needs.</p>



<p>Compactibility is impressive. It plays nicely with just about everything, including iPhones (12 through 17 Series), iPads, MacBooks, AirPods, Apple Watch, Samsung Galaxy phones, and even Steam Deck, ThinkPad X1, etc. And despite all this power, the charger stays compact and lightweight. It’s no larger than an AirPods Pro case, meaning you can toss it into your backpack and carry it around without feeling like you’re carrying something heavy. ActiveShield 4.0 monitors temperature 120 times per second to prevent overheating, so safety won’t be a concern either.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5020/">Altogether, this efficient charger replaces three with one. It fits into your hand, and still packs enough power to juice all your essentials quickly at the same time.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-obsidian-flaws-consumerism-skip-dialogue-2000639250</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-review-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000638368"><i>The Outer Worlds 2</i></a> is available for all starting on October 29, 2025. Those who’ve purchased the premium edition, however, can get in on the action early with “advanced access.” And if you do, you’ll get treated to a unique “Flaw” for your character (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/the-outer-worlds-2-fans-punished-by-obsidian-with-hilarious-debuffs-for-everything-from-dialogue-skipping-to-consumerism-if-they-purchase-the-usd100-premium-edition/">h/t <i>GamesRadar</i></a>) literally titled “Consumerism.” Flaws grant the player a double-edged sword of buffs and debuffs that can impact certain in-game actions or decisions, or specific character builds. And “Consumerism’s” description amusingly reads, “You’re the reason our marketing works. Promotions and sales have riddled your brain, and you’re more interested in buying the next big thing than financial planning.”</p> <p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-review-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000638368"><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>: The&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></p> <p>Well, while it might double as a subtle reminder for some of us (re: me) to dig into that “financial planning,” at the very least the Flaw nets the player a permanent 15-percent discount on all vendors in the game, at the cost of earning 10 percent less for any item sold.</p>

    <p>But that’s not the only amusing Flaw Obsidian packed into the game. Racing through all the dialogue in the game will earn you “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theouterworlds/comments/1og6q38/skipping_through_dialogue_in_rpgs_finally_bit_me/">Foot-in-Mouth Syndrome</a>,” where you’ll earn 15-percent extra experience on everything at the cost of having your dialogue choices made for you at random.</p>

 <p>Another amusing Flaw triggers when you invest in your skill points a little too evenly. “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/theouterworlds/comments/1ogm9cd/is_this_a_good_flaw/">Easily Distracted</a>” seems to trigger when you spread out your skill points across five different skills. This Flaw lets you raise skills more quickly, though it’s much harder to invest in one skill over any others as it only lets you “add skill points into your lowest non-zero Skill or any Skill you have no points in already.”</p> <p>I’m sure these are far from the only nuggets of meta-humor Obsidian has packed into this game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-clears-out-4-5-star-mini-pc-for-nearly-nothing-compared-to-the-mac-mini-as-black-friday-nears.1335730/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>PC upgrades don’t have to be bulky or complicated. Those looking for a no-fuss, low-profile desktop setup for their everyday work and play sessions should consider investing in a mini PC. These blocks quite literally fit in your hand, take practically no space at all, and even travel with you.</p>
<p>Like traditional PCs, these compact options also come in a range of configurations. If you’re mainly focused on everyday use (browsing, streaming, regular office work, studies), you don’t need anything over the top.<strong> A mini PC with at least an Intel N-series processor, 8GB of RAM, and a solid-state drive (SSD) will do the job well,</strong> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5019/">which is exactly what Kamrui AK1PLUS Mini PC offers, and it’s now available for just $146 on Amazon.</a> That’s a straightforward 19% discount on this powerhouse, but this deal is only available to Prime members. Non-Prime members can get it at its retail price of $190. And since Prime members also get free delivery, you’re saving a good chunk on both the price and the shipping.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5019/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Modest Specs for Day-to-Day Use</h2>
<p>This mini PC is powered by a 12th Gen Intel N95 processor with a clock speed of up to 3.4GHz. It offers a 30% performance bump over earlier chips like the N5095 and N5105, so it’s fast enough for most day-to-day tasks. There’s 8GB of DDR4 RAM for speedy multitasking, plus a 256GB M.2 SSD that offers sufficient space to store all your important files. The memory isn’t exactly massive, so it won’t be able to handle heavy gaming or resource-intensive creative tasks, but should be enough for regular usage. And if your storage needs grow over time, you can add a second 2.5-inch SATA SSD or HDD, or upgrade the existing M.2 SSD to as much as 2TB.</p>



<p>It also supports 4K at 60Hz via Intel UHD Graphics, and lets you connect up to two monitors simultaneously with dual HDMI ports for a bigger setup. Other connectivity options include two USB 3.2 Gen 2 ports, two USB 2.0 ports, a Gigabit Ethernet port, dual-band WiFi (2.4GHz + 5GHz), and Bluetooth.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5019/">Despite all this power, the Kamrui mini PC stays fairly quiet while working, thanks to its built-in smart cooling fan.</a> It also includes a VESA mount, so you can attach it to the back of your monitor for a cleaner setup. Just be sure to get your orders in fast, since the deal might end any moment now.</p>
