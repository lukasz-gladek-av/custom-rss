This journey sees the return of protagonist Sam Bridges after his journey connecting the United Cities of America to the Chiral Network. Taking place 11 months after the events of the first game, Sam now ventures to Australia to do pretty much the same thing as he did in the first game.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196411" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="378" data-playlist="196411,196646,196215" data-current="196411"><div><p>A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21958.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-review-is-it-good-ps5-playstation-5-1851784852&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-review-is-it-good-ps5-playstation-5-1851784852"><em>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach</em>: The <em>Kotaku </em>Review</a></span></p><p>The first game took about 40 hours to complete the main story. Is <em>Death Stranding 2 </em>similar? Well, Kojima Productions confirmed that the sequel is larger than its predecessor. Does that necessarily translate to a longer gameplay length? Let’s talk about it.</p><h2 id="h39974"><a id=""></a>How long is <em>Death Stranding 2</em>?</h2><p><em>Death Stranding 2 </em>is a sprawling open-world action adventure game that sees Sam Bridges make a bunch of cargo deliveries across Australia. There are 17 chapters in Death Stranding 2, with the first 16 chapters playing out the game’s entire story. The final chapter is simply just a transition to the game’s post game where you can roam the open-world to your heart’s content.</p><figure id="" data-id="f6ef7c5dfdbfd38722b5558e46eddb98" data-recommend-id="image://f6ef7c5dfdbfd38722b5558e46eddb98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sam hitches a ride on a transport." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sam hitches a ride on a transport." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f6ef7c5dfdbfd38722b5558e46eddb98" data-recommend-id="image://f6ef7c5dfdbfd38722b5558e46eddb98" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sam hitches a ride on a transport." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The amount of time you spend in<em> Death Stranding 2 </em>all depends on how much time you’re willing to invest in leveling up each facility and terminal to unlock rewards. However, <strong>if you’re only here to experience the story, then you should expect to clock in between 40-60 hours.</strong></p><p>However, if you’re looking to unlock the coveted <em>Death Stranding 2</em> Platinum trophy, you’ll need to put in as much time as it took for the first <em>Death Stranding</em>’s Platinum trophy. This clocked in about <strong>80 to 120 hours depending on how efficient you are with your cargo deliveries</strong><em>.</em> In <em>Death Stranding 2</em>, you’ll need to maximize your connection ratings for all facilities, and discover some of the secret areas to unlock specific Trophies. The Platinum trophy doesn’t seem hard to unlock, but it will be time consuming. So expect at least 80 hours, if not more.</p><hr><p><br>If you’re a fan of the first <em>Death Stranding</em>, you should have no issues getting your money’s worth out of its sequel. The story is much more coherent than the first, and the gameplay has been improved in almost every single aspect, from the delivery mechanisms to the combat.</p><figure id="" data-id="0038a8fca95151a4e752502e13c87b48" data-recommend-id="image://0038a8fca95151a4e752502e13c87b48" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Neil sits on a motorcycle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Neil sits on a motorcycle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0038a8fca95151a4e752502e13c87b48" data-recommend-id="image://0038a8fca95151a4e752502e13c87b48" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Neil sits on a motorcycle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Death Stranding 2</em> costs $70 and is currently exclusive to PS5. Sony hasn’t announced whether it’ll come to subscription services, but it could be in a few years as the first game and its <em>Director’s Cut</em> version are on PlayStation Plus. The first game is also both available on PC and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p>No, as of right now the game hasn’t been announced for PC or Xbox.</p><p><em>Death Stranding 2</em> is now available on PS5.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-how-long-to-beat-sequel-story-hltb-1851785232]]></content:encoded>

A pair of wildly impressive mods for the <em>Legendary Edition</em> remaster of everyone’s favorite Xbox 360-era space opera trilogy contains so many exciting tweaks and so much new material that even I, someone who thought I was probably never gonna play those games again, is now thinking about how I’m gonna clear hard-drive space to hit the stars once more. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196131" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="328" data-playlist="196131,196299,197589" data-current="196131"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21668.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>For those who don’t have 17 minutes to check out the video, let me break down the highlights of what’s on offer in these super neat mods: </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>4 new combat missions</li><li>1 new hub map</li><li>12 new cutscenes</li><li>8 altered cutscenes</li><li>3 new apartment decorations</li><li>6 updated character appearances</li></ul><p>And there’s more than just what’s in that list. From making subtle changes like replacing the textures on dead bodies to be more accurate to the lore of the world, to performing incredible feats of digital archaeology in restoring cutscenes that were only referred to in snippets of code in the original game’s beta, the mods are packed with tons of new things to see and explore. The mods also expand how you can take in the world. For example, at the Purgatory night club from <em>Mass Effect 2</em>, you can now order drinks that were featured in <em>Mass Effect: The Official Cocktail Book</em>. </p><p>Unfortunately, though it’s well-deserved after such hard work, modder Tydeos is going on a hiatus now that his work on these mods is complete. However, according to the deep dive video, should he return in the future, he hopes to expand the four brand new missions the mod adds to the game to match the scale found in official, BioWare-brewed quests.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-legendary-best-mods-le3-spectre-1851785265]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ever since we learned the Switch 2 would have an LCD screen instead of a fancier OLED panel, discourse around Nintendo’s latest console has often turned sour when it comes to its display. Of course, once folks were able to get the new hardware in their hands, the Switch 2 revealed itself to be packing an impressively bright and vibrant LCD. Those <em>do </em>exist; they’re still not as great as fancy as an OLED, but liquid crystal display tech is still more than capable of meeting and exceeding expectations for producing a quality image in 2025. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>But now a new controversy over the Switch 2’s display has emerged, this time wielding scary terms like “ghosting” and “refresh rate,” as critiques spread asserting that fast-paced games look blurry in motion and concerns rise from some arguing that the HDR display packed in with Nintendo’s new hybrid console isn’t <em>really</em> HDR. Are they right? Kind of, yeah! Should you regret your decision to buy a Nintendo Switch 2? Probably not! Let’s talk. </p><h2 id="h191322"><a id=""></a>It’s really all just one picture at a time, but very fast</h2><p>I’m sorry to tell you that video games are an illusion. Mario isn’t actually moving when he jumps. As you probably already know, GPUs crunch out one image at a time and these images, when played very fast, create the illusion of motion. We’re seeing several images of Mario, with each image showing him in a slightly different location. And our screen needs to display those images cleanly, at a rapid, matching pace.</p><p>That’s a very brisk and incomplete explanation of how video games deliver the visuals we know and love, but it’s more or less how it all works. The way the image gets delivered to your eyes relies on coordination between how fast the GPU can pump out images and how often your monitor refreshes, which is measured in Hertz. Should those things be out of sync in some way, you’ll spot some screen tearing, which is when there’s a mismatch between how many images the GPU spits out per second and how many times the monitor refreshes too (in case you didn’t know, all monitors are actually turning on and off at very fast speeds that give the illusion of staying on).</p><p>But we can also measure the refresh rate in milliseconds, and that’s where we can really lock into some specificity and understand what’s going on. The lower the millisecond response time, the cleaner the motion of something moving across the screen looks. Ratchet that response time up and things start to look a little blurry in motion. </p><h2 id="h191323"><a id=""></a>Wait, the Switch 2 has a 120Hz refresh rate. That should be more than enough, right?</h2><p>120Hz is a swell refresh rate for a gaming display. The problem with the Switch 2, however, is that the millisecond response time of its screen is a bit slow compared to those of many other gaming displays on the market. Compounding the problem is that we actually can’t fully test the Switch 2’s screen as efficiently as we can other displays. </p><p>The Switch 2 doesn’t allow for external video input. So, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/nintendo-switch-2-screen-blur-hdr-analysis#&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/nintendo-switch-2-screen-blur-hdr-analysis#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as <em>PC Mag</em>’s Will Greenwald discusses</a></span> in his breakdown of the latest Switch controversy, folks have been taking to measuring how quickly pixels change color on the Switch 2 screen using optical sensors and cameras, among other tools. This is technically not the same thing as measuring the refresh rate as mentioned above, but it does offer insight into how fast the screen performs. </p><p>The results of these tests revealed a 17.1 millisecond response time on the Switch 2 in a best case scenario, and a 33.3 ms response time at worst. As Greenwald mentions, gaming displays should ideally aim for below 10 ms. </p><p>So no, it’s not just in people’s heads. Maybe they’re being picky! But in reality, the Switch 2’s response time isn’t great compared to other gaming displays. Knowing that fact, though, shouldn’t keep you from having fun with your console. </p><h2 id="h191324"><a id=""></a>What about HDR?</h2><p>By 2025, many are likely familiar with what High Dynamic Range is: an expansion of how just how bright or dark a screen can display colors. An HDR display (with a signal to match) looks far more vivid and lifelike than an SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) screen does. And it’s awesome. To my eyes, HDR is more of an upgrade than 4K resolution could’ve ever dreamed of being. </p><p>But comparing the Switch 2’s HDR to a fancier HDR screen is sort of like comparing organic food to certified organic food. Technically speaking, the Switch 2’s brightness range at less than 1,000 nits falls short of what is needed to portray a true HDR image. So it’s got a High<em>er</em> Dynamic Range than SDR, but is arguably <em>not</em> true HDR. </p><h2 id="h191325"><a id=""></a>What are you saying here? Is my Switch 2 just a hunk-a-junk?</h2><p>Yeah, you know what? Nothing’s ever good enough for you. Let’s just burn the whole thing down—<em>sorry</em>, I dunno where that came from. Silly me. </p><p>No, as anyone who’s seen a Switch 2 in person can attest, the screen looks great! Games look bright and colorful as we’d expect them to. Sure, if you have a serious eye for detail and you’re a numbers nerd, you may feel the screen could’ve hit higher benchmarks. And sadly, hooking your Switch 2 up to a better display via the dock doesn’t seem to fix the problem as, according to <em>PC Mag</em>, external display output of the Switch 2 seems to stay true to what its internal screen can display. </p><p>Coming from someone who has formative, joyous memories of <em>GTA IV</em>, <em>Halo 3</em>, <em>Mass Effect</em>, and <em>BioShock</em> from my old Xbox 360 hooked up to an old, tiny, somewhat faulty CRT in the corner of a basement, inferior tech doesn’t always mean an inferior experience. Objectively, the Switch 2’s screen might have some shortcomings, but your experience with it is subjective. So tune all the noise out if it upsets you, enjoy another lap on <em>Mario Kart World</em> and stop thinking about all this ms-time and HDR nonsense.</p><p><br>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-screen-hdr-response-time-1851785261]]></content:encoded>
