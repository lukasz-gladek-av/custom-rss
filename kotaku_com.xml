After a messy run with Zack Snyder, the new plan was to reboot the DC film franchise, connect the shows and movies to it, and give creators more freedom to make varied projects in different genres. And the two said that the goal is to create a universe that feels interconnected, but with films that still feel separate and standalone. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/dc-movies-tv-shows-updates-superman-batman-1236145240/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/dc-movies-tv-shows-updates-superman-batman-1236145240/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As covered by <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a></span><em>,</em> who attended the recent DC Studios press event, Gunn doesn’t want people to feel like they need to do homework and watch a bunch of past content before they see the next big DC show or film. </p><p> “We remain steadfast that each of these projects work as a standalone project,” said Gunn. “So you can see <em>Superman</em>, you can watch <em>Lanterns</em>, without having to see both of them. Although if you can, there will be special things in there for people who have seen both.” </p><p> And this is all part of a larger six-year plan, which the duo confirmed will culminate in an <em>Avengers: Endgame</em>-like crossover movie. Neither exec had any more details to share about this big movie, which is not likely to hit theaters until 2030, but Gunn has experience producing these kinds of superhero event films, having served as an executive producer on Marvel and Disney’s <em>Endgame </em>in 2019. </p><p>To reach the point where such a project is viable in the new DC universe, Gunn and Safran laid out a plan that calls for a lot of content. According to the DC Studio bosses, the company will produce two-live action movies, two live-action shows, and two animated shows every year, some of which will be created exclusively for WB Discovery’s Max. </p><p>It’s an ambitious plan and I worry that it might be too much, too fast, but Gunn and Safran are committed to making sure every movie has a solid script before production begins. Likewise, they admitted they are flexible and will change the plan as needed. </p><p>For example, in 2023, they had no intentions of making a movie about Batman villain Clayface. But then Mike Flanagan, the filmmaker behind works such as <em>Doctor Sleep </em>and <em>Midnight Mass</em>, pitched them one and wrote a script they both loved and it got greenlit. Of course, I’ve not seen <em>Clayface</em>, but it at least sounds like Gunn isn’t too worried about changing plans or fiddling with canon if it means getting a cool movie. That might be the key to defeating superhero fatigue and competing with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-cinematic-universe-mcu-best-worst-movie-avengers-1851765913&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cinematic-universe-mcu-best-worst-movie-avengers-1851765913">Marvel’s massive MCU</a></span>. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Three years later, the game has been brought over the finish line by the rest of the team at Indonesian studio Pikselnesia, with a result that feels unavoidably prescient. Though <em>Afterlove EP </em>isn’t without its flaws, its meditation on the mundane ways grief distorts us, and the unglamorous journey of finding our way back to the light, offers an understated catharsis.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Afterlove EP </em>follows Rama, an indie band frontman who loses a part of himself when his partner Cinta unexpectedly passes away. He spends a year in self-inflicted isolation, and by the time he’s ready to crawl out of his apartment and try to be a person again, he’s surprised to see how much of the world has moved on without him. Or, at least, tried to. His bandmates have felt trapped in his indecision, so they’ve been looking for lifeboats off a sinking ship with new projects and career paths. Rama expected everything to be where he left it a year ago. <em>Afterlove EP </em>spends much of its time underlining that while grief deserves sympathy, it doesn’t become a free pass to treat people however you want.</p><p>Grief requires some grace. No one handles the loss of a loved one “perfectly,” and a story that criticizes someone going through that pain can be a tough sell, and easy to fuck up if its characters come off as irredeemable or its approach feels insensitive. <em>Afterlove EP </em>starts out with Rama hearing the disembodied voice of Cinta encouraging him to get back out there and perform again, but as the game goes on, it becomes clear it’s less an echo of a lost loved one and more a manifestation of Rama’s inner monologue. Cinta is defensive and accusatory, and puts Rama’s feelings above everyone else’s. As I lived out Rama’s life, I gradually became frustrated when Cinta would weigh in. This wasn’t the compassionate person her grieving friends described, it was someone who almost always defaulted to Rama’s point of view, siding with him even when his friends had grievances that were more than reasonable.</p><figure id="" data-id="865e57745c4bc2283aacd048dc239032" data-recommend-id="image://865e57745c4bc2283aacd048dc239032" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Adit says &quot;I mean, you're rally pissing me off, Rama.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Adit says &quot;I mean, you're rally pissing me off, Rama.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pikselnesia / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="865e57745c4bc2283aacd048dc239032" data-recommend-id="image://865e57745c4bc2283aacd048dc239032" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Adit says &quot;I mean, you're rally pissing me off, Rama.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If that disconnect between player and protagonist sounds frustrating, it is, but it makes Rama’s growth and the story’s pay-off so much sweeter. Rama starts off sympathetic. He’s grieving the loss of someone who was clearly close to him, but the longer I played <em>Afterlove EP</em>, the more it became clear he was myopically obsessed with his own pain and ignoring how others were affected by his absence. The identification I felt with him gradually gave way to alienation as I stood by and watched his relationships unravel, like I was a friend powerless to stop someone I care about from falling further down into despair. <em>Afterlove EP </em>gave me plenty of opportunities to argue with my friends who felt abandoned by me, but for most of the game, I couldn’t find dialogue options that resembled an apology for my absence, my belligerent musician’s ego, or the selfish way I talked about my grief as if it was more important than anyone else’s. I spent hours of <em>Afterlove EP </em>watching people who cared about each other nearly lose one another because Rama couldn’t see past his own pain. Every time I met up with bandmates trying to pick up where things left off, it felt like the ties between them were one wrong word away from snapping as he insisted on his own vision of the music and the band’s future, and was indifferent to his friends’ pain after they lost a friend, too. Rama can be a frustrating character to pilot in a dialogue-based game, and Cinta’s inability to challenge him made me skeptical of her from the beginning, but <em>Afterlove EP</em>’s commitment to its damaged hero and his dysfunctional friend group is a crucial piece of the story it’s telling.</p><p>There’s a fine line between a sympathetic protagonist and a selfish one, and <em>Afterlove EP</em> balances on it so well that by the time I was hours into Rama’s story—watching him be so fixated on his own shit that he was hurting those closest to him—I only felt sorry for him. He couldn’t see the forest for the trees, even in the face of so many possibilities for forming new connections and repairing old ones.</p><figure id="" data-id="b5644e10117f08e8ba44c07ee33e64d9" data-recommend-id="image://b5644e10117f08e8ba44c07ee33e64d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rama and Satria listen to music." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rama and Satria listen to music." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pikselnesia / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b5644e10117f08e8ba44c07ee33e64d9" data-recommend-id="image://b5644e10117f08e8ba44c07ee33e64d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rama and Satria listen to music." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Afterlove EP </em>plays like a <em>Persona </em>game in which you manage relationships and work each day, deciding whether to spend your limited time seeing friends, busking for money, going to therapy to unpack all the discord within your social circles, or possibly building a relationship with a new suitor. I spent most days hanging out with Satria, a record store shopkeeper who knew exactly how to push Rama’s buttons. He’s part of a queer community that plays music in the local park. Rama hasn’t explored this side of himself, and that kind of self-discovery isn’t made easier by having the disembodied voice of your ex talking to you while you try to form new connections. However, <em>Afterlove EP </em>doesn’t reach for the low-hanging fruit I expected it to when it comes to Rama finding new love. Given Cinta’s hold on him, I feared that Rama moving on to a new partner might see the game create a toxic love triangle in his mind, but instead, things play out quite differently. It was a welcome change after Rama’s mourning had gotten in the way of him moving forward for most of the game. Grief is the foundation <em>Afterlove EP </em>is built on, but its waxings on the topic aren’t the only thing it has to say.</p><p>The thread connecting all these relationships is the indie rock music Rama plays. When you’re not chatting with friends and potential lovers, <em>Afterlove EP </em>is a rhythm game with some really catchy tracks that capture the spirit and gusto of young performers who want a life for themselves outside of the bars and kitchens they work at now. Even if I can’t understand the Indonesian lyrics, I feel the pain and yearning in Rama’s voice and the heavy riffs underneath.</p><figure id="" data-id="f7c649b4fdcfebbc14704a197c6ec77a" data-recommend-id="image://f7c649b4fdcfebbc14704a197c6ec77a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rama and Satria perform in front of a crowd." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rama and Satria perform in front of a crowd." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pikselnesia / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f7c649b4fdcfebbc14704a197c6ec77a" data-recommend-id="image://f7c649b4fdcfebbc14704a197c6ec77a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rama and Satria perform in front of a crowd." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That being said, <em>Afterlove EP</em>’s rhythm game segments are exceptionally hard to read. Each note you play runs down a sheet music-like track, prompting you to press one of the four directional buttons when it reaches the center of the screen. The way it’s presented can be disorienting and frustrating—its use of directional inputs comes with a muscle memory expectation that some of the movement you’re seeing should correlate to which button you’re pressing. Instead, I tripped up a fair bit as notes came from the right side of the screen but required me to press up or down. Rhythm games, like playing a real instrument, are meant to be instinctual. You train yourself on something long enough and it becomes muscle memory embedded in your fingertips. <em>Afterlove EP</em>’s UI design is minimalistic, and doesn’t communicate its mechanics well, so it never quite reaches that level of intuitive rhythm you need to get lost in the music.</p><p>Like Rama’s music, <em>Afterlove EP </em>balances the thorny and heartwarming parts of love and loss. Given what the Pikselnesia team went through to make it happen, it’s not surprising that it understands all the ugly and beautiful parts of losing someone you care about. A lot of <em>Afterlove EP </em>guides you by the hand through the mundane parts of becoming a person again. When you lose parts of yourself, finding something new, good, and healthy to fill that void isn’t always glamorous or fun. It can be awkward and uncomfortable, and require talking to people who see through your bullshit and call you out on it when you can’t see past it yourself. <em>Afterlove EP </em>is sympathetic to the fact that none of us handle grief in a way that is easy to swallow for everyone around us, but its best moments come when it’s willing to slap you across the face and tell you to do better.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Many of these games look great—like Blendo Games’ new FPS <em>Skin Deep,</em> which is set in a giant spaceship—but only one of them has 2025's song of the year and that’s<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbE1uRDdHYUV0b25WaVVtYU9WaXE2UVhDckNfUXxBQ3Jtc0tsOVcxX0ozaUVkS3U4VGdzMzAxWDBka2dveDR1QmpDTzRrU01LU19BazdKMGhXTU5EQ2h4ZFZqaUIwODA4dDhNSEtkWkJtYlVZaV90Q3gtMW9QN0hKYzVydWQyaXRpRTJZck1ENkdRVks5TzFFWkZ6SQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1875320%2Fto_a_T%2F&amp;v=E-QlrrC4vFk&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbE1uRDdHYUV0b25WaVVtYU9WaXE2UVhDckNfUXxBQ3Jtc0tsOVcxX0ozaUVkS3U4VGdzMzAxWDBka2dveDR1QmpDTzRrU01LU19BazdKMGhXTU5EQ2h4ZFZqaUIwODA4dDhNSEtkWkJtYlVZaV90Q3gtMW9QN0hKYzVydWQyaXRpRTJZck1ENkdRVks5TzFFWkZ6SQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1875320%2Fto_a_T%2F&amp;v=E-QlrrC4vFk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>To a T, </em>which is coming out this May</a></span>. </p><p>Let’s watch the trailer and enjoy:</p><p>So what is <em>To a T</em>? Good question, because as cute and wonderful as this trailer and its song might be, I wasn’t sure what the game actually was. Its really confusing that at the end there is a note mentioning that this new game isn’t actually <em>about </em>food or cooking despite the giraffe’s catchy song. </p><p>According to Annapurna Interactive, <em>To a T</em> is being developed by <em>Katamari Damacy </em>creator  Keita Takahashi and is described as a “colorful” “narrative adventure” game. Here’s the official description: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>To a T </em>is a charming, colorful adventure game about a teen navigating life in a small town with their cute dog companion. While their body is stuck in a T-pose, they do their best to make the most of it. </p></blockquote><p>I’m down to play this. I mean I was in the moment I heard “The Giraffe Song” by Rebecca Sugar (<em>Steven Universe</em>). The game is set to launch on PS5, Steam, and Xbox Series X/S on May 28.</p><hr><p>Beyond <em>To a T,</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/5XTSFLFV7e8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/5XTSFLFV7e8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Annpurna showcase</a></span> also had some great trailers for some other cool-looking games.

I guess the name of the game gives that away. </p><p>It’s actually kind of strange that as we’ve reached a point where video game visuals, especially those depicting nature, can look nearly photoreal, we’ve not seen more of these photo sim games. I can’t afford to visit all of these locations and take photos of their gorgeous landscapes. But I can do just that in <em>Lushfoil Photography Sim</em>, which is planned to launch on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on April 15. </p><p>And if you want to watch the whole showcase, which featured a new trailer for <em>Wanderstop </em>and news of a PS5 port of<em> Sayonara Wild Hearts</em>, you can watch the entire event below. It’s about 25 minutes long. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
