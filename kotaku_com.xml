At a glance, those picks aren’t that odd. <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>had starters that originated in regions different from the Sinnoh one it was set in. However, given two of them are from Gen II’s Johto region, fans are wondering why Cyndaquil, the fire-type porcupine-ish little guy who also debuted in <em>Gold </em>and <em>Silver</em>, wasn’t part of the starting roster alongside Chikorita and Totodile. The most plausible reasons for the omission aren’t that interesting, but the more outlandish conspiracy theories forming around it are very funny.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,195519,195905" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>If you somehow missed it last year, <em>Pokémon </em>developer Game Freak was subject to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688">a massive leak in October</a></span>.

The internet had a field day with it and the fire starter’s reputation hasn’t recovered from the scandal. Now, fans are spinning tales that the reason Cyndaquil isn’t joining its Johto starters in <em>Legends: Z-A </em>is that Game Freak may have thought it was too soon to put it back in the spotlight. The more likely explanation is that Cyndaquil was a starter in <em>Legends: Arceus</em>, and Game Freak probably didn’t want to double-dip in the same subseries. But nevertheless, fans are running with the theory, and while some think the Typhlosion jokes are dead, I am still laughing.</p><p>Typhlosion has gotten some recent love, so it’s not like Cyndaquil fans are starving. The Pokémon got a brand new Hisuian form in <em>Legends: Arceus</em> that is arguably even cooler than its Johto region variant. But even if he’s not a starter this time, hopefully the little guy still shows up in <em>Legends: Z-A</em> as an obtainable Pokémon when the game launches later this year.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While you could argue that the Ancient Alacrity is truly the best, it can’t be obtained until the final stretch of the game’s main story, making it a difficult recommendation. Meanwhile, The Long Touch can be found early and should make for an excellent weapon throughout the majority of your adventure.

She can be found within the Militia Headquarters, which is located in the northeastern segment of this upper-class area.</p><p>The militia merchant sells The Long Touch for 4,320 coins, which is quite a lot of dough early in the game. Sell anything you don’t need from your adventures and try to save up for it if necessary. You should find plenty of gems and weapons even during this opening part of your journey, so you’ll be able to snag it in no time. I believe in you.</p><p>With The Long Touch now in your possession, head on back into the great big world of <em>Avowed</em> and start sniping bonces. And don’t forget to use those Power Shots for faster speed and fine aiming for more crit chance!</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It could seemingly double that by the time the weekend hits, putting it number one over the ubiquitous <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> and potentially even beating out both<em> Black Myth: Wukong </em>and <em>Palworld</em> for the all-time number 2 spot on the Valve-owned storefront. This is walloping the performance of previous games in the series: <em>Monster Hunter World </em>peaked at around 330,000 concurrent players, and <em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>’s all-time peak was 230,000.</p><figure id="" data-id="9ec3965b4c646bfd6c53957afe54e738" data-recommend-id="image://9ec3965b4c646bfd6c53957afe54e738" data-format="png" data-width="1217" data-height="755" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows concurrent players on Steam.

It currently has a rating of just 47 percent, with the majority of reviews giving<em> Monster Hunter Wilds</em> a thumbs down over PC problems.

But rarely do those same games then go on to break franchise and Steam records.</p><p>It might be because many of the reviews read like this: “This game is absolutely amazing - but has the worst optimization I’ve ever seen.” A common thread is that players who had no real problems with the game’s pre-launch open betas are now struggling to get decent framerates at higher resolutions. “If I can run <em>KCD2</em> and <em>Cyberpunk</em> on maxed out settings comfortably, then there is no reason this game should be running like this,” another review reads. Others were more glib. “I paid 70 dollars to boot a crash report,” wrote one person. “My grandma runs better than this game,” wrote another.</p><figure id="" data-id="c1d54fce6eba02cd177c172138414193" data-recommend-id="image://c1d54fce6eba02cd177c172138414193" data-format="png" data-width="914" data-height="867" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows negative Steam reviews.

As with everything on PC, it’s hard to know how much of this needs to be sorted out on Capcom’s end vs. players fiddling with their own drivers and settings to get better results out of their hardware.<em> Digital Foundry</em>’s assessment didn’t mince words though with a video titled “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yhacyXcizA&amp;t=176s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yhacyXcizA&amp;t=176s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Profound perf problems must be addressed</a></span>.” Capcom has so far responded with the usual troubleshooting guide. </p><p>That said, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> certainly doesn’t look perfect on PlayStation 5 either. A <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4HloDRmvJs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4HloDRmvJs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry analysis</a></span> there showed how the game can look very muddy at higher framerates. I spent most of my time with the game during my review playing at a less fluid, more cinematic 30fps for exactly that reason. On the whole though, I’ve experienced no bugs or crashes in my 40 hours with the game on console so far. </p><p>We’ll see how much of this can be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-difficulty-social-hub-free-update-1851766839&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-difficulty-social-hub-free-update-1851766839">addressed in post-launch updates</a></span> and how much of it is baked into the game at a more fundamental level. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is Capcom’s first entry in the franchise on the RE engine it uses for <em>Resident Evil</em> (and most other games at this point). It could also be a reflection of just how dense bespoke monster animations and interactions are in the game. It’s nowhere near as immediately dazzling as, say, <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, but there’s a liveliness and vibrancy on display few other games have shown us. Either way, it seems like <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> could be this year’s <em>Helldivers 2</em> when it comes to being an online multiplayer phenomenon. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
