But if this new film has you all excited about the series again and you want to play a <em>Mission: Impossible</em> video game, well, bad news: It’s been over 20 years since the last one. That’s not cool. It’s time for a new <em>MI</em> game!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197567" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="104" data-playlist="197567,197565,197564" data-current="197567"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23091.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>This article was originally published on July 13, 2023. It has been updated as part of Kotaku’s</em> <em>Mission: Impossible Week. </em></p><p>The <em>Mission: Impossible</em> franchise technically started as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_(1966_TV_series)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_(1966_TV_series)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a spy-themed television series from the 1960s</a></span>, which got a sequel series in the ‘80s. But when most people talk about the <em>Mission Impossible</em> franchise in 2025, they are likely referring to the long-running action film franchise starring Tom Cruise that has grown into something much larger and over-the-top than the old TV shows. These films, which began in 1996, typically showcase Cruise risking his life in at least three or four large stunts and also, bizarrely, have only gotten better with each release. A globe-trotting action-adventure franchise that makes tons of money, is loved by critics, and has a massive fanbase seems like ideal material for a video game adaptation. Oddly, that’s not been the case.<br></p><p>Since the beginning of the franchise, only <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mission:_Impossible_video_games&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Mission:_Impossible_video_games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">five <em>Mission: Impossible</em> video games have been released</a></span>. (Confusingly, four of them are just named <em>Mission: Impossible</em>.) The first game launched in 1990 for the NES. The second game was released the following year for DOS. These two were based on the 1980s sequel series that aired on ABC.<br></p><p>Then in 1998, two years after the first Tom Cruise film, another <em>Mission: Impossible</em> game launched on the Nintendo 64. This one has some fans, and played a lot like a third-person spin on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/goldeneye-007-n64-xbox-switch-port-bugs-60-fps-patch-1850041167&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/goldeneye-007-n64-xbox-switch-port-bugs-60-fps-patch-1850041167">Rare’s popular<em> GoldenEye 007</em> game</a></span>. Two years after that, right before the second film hit theaters, a very short and not-good <em>Mission: Impossible</em> game landed on Game Boy Color. However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/C9qqtcDVHw8?t=294&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/C9qqtcDVHw8?t=294" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this game did include a neat feature</a></span> that let players use the Game Boy as a remote control.</p><p>Finally, in 2003, <em>Mission: Impossible — Operation Surma</em> launched on PlayStation 2 and later GameCube. This third-person action-adventure spy-thriller takes place between the events of <em>Mission: Impossible II</em> and the third film, but is also never directly referenced in the films and doesn’t even feature the likeness of Tom Cruise. It was essentially a <em>Metal Gear Solid/Splinter Cell </em>clone and in 2025 has been mostly forgotten, like the rest of the<em> M:I</em> video games.<br></p><h2 id="h544726"><a id=""></a><strong>It’s time for a new <em>Mission: Impossible</em> video game</strong></h2><p>And…that’s it! After 2003, we stopped getting new<em> Mission: Impossible</em> games. I understand that the film series hit a six-year lull between the second and third, but after<em>&nbsp;</em>2011’s <em>Ghost Protocol</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/mission-impossible-movies-ranked-tom-cruise-mcquarrrie-1850610860?_gl=1*1vdevzg*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDc4NDY2NjIkbzg0JGcxJHQxNzQ3ODQ2NzEyJGoxMCRsMCRoMCRkTGhKQ1VESkJYd2lqTzFUMTlocEx1a0ptWERkbVBiM21jZw..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/mission-impossible-movies-ranked-tom-cruise-mcquarrrie-1850610860?_gl=1*1vdevzg*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDc4NDY2NjIkbzg0JGcxJHQxNzQ3ODQ2NzEyJGoxMCRsMCRoMCRkTGhKQ1VESkJYd2lqTzFUMTlocEx1a0ptWERkbVBiM21jZw..">the franchise kept getting bigger and better</a></span> with each entry. 2018’s <em>Mission: Impossible Fallout</em> is probably the best film in the series. (<em>Dead Reckoning</em>, sadly, couldn’t keep the trend going.)</p><p>And yet, even as the franchise grows bigger and bigger, no new video games are on the horizon. What a shame! So many moments in recent <em>MI </em>films feel almost like setpieces from AAA video games of the last decade. It makes sense to me that this series would translate well into a modern video game.<br></p><p>I understand that over the last decade or so, we’ve stopped getting crappy games based on popular films. And I’ve been mostly fine with that, as the vast majority of games based on films were awful and not worth playing. Then again, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hitman-studio-s-project-007-will-feature-a-new-james-bo-1846137133&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-studio-s-project-007-will-feature-a-new-james-bo-1846137133">we <em>are</em> getting a new <em>007</em> game</a></span> from the <em>Hitman </em>devs, and a new <em>Avatar</em> one from Ubisoft, so it’s not like games based on movies are impossible to make these days.<br></p><p>And I think a <em>Mission: Impossible</em> game—if done right and given enough time and resources—could be amazing. Honestly, a game where you just recreate all the famous and dangerous stunts from the films would be great, like a new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuntman:_Ignition&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuntman:_Ignition" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Stuntman</em></a></span> but based entirely on <em>Mission: Impossible</em> scenes. Actually, it’s been a long time since we got a good <em>Stuntman </em>game, too.<br></p><p>Okay, new plan: Someone convince the right people to fund the development of a new <em>Stuntman</em>-like game based on Tom Cruise’s wildest <em>Mission: Impossible</em> stunts. That’s the game I want. Thank you. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Let’s ignore that it should obviously have been called Xbox Retro Arcade, and instead focus on the new app. </p><p>According to Xbox, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/retro-games-arcade-xbox-x-s-antstream-mortal-kombat-1850669127&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/retro-games-arcade-xbox-x-s-antstream-mortal-kombat-1850669127">Retro Classics is powered by Antstream Arcade’s streaming game tech</a></span>, which is a mostly solid way to instantly play tons of old games across many different platforms. The new app supports challenges, multiplayer, multiple saves, weekly tournaments, user profiles, and leaderboards. And yes, Retro Classics has achievements. Finally, you can get a nifty Xbox achievement for playing <em>River Raid. </em></p><p>“This initiative is a step in our commitment to game preservation and backwards compatibility, allowing players to experience many timeless games on modern devices,” said Xbox in a post on the company’s website. </p><p>So what games are currently available on the Retro <strike>Arcade</strike> Classics app? Here’s some I spotted and tested: <em>Kaboom!, Pitfall, Pitfall 2, River Raid, Grand Prix, Commando, Barnstorming, Fishing Derby, </em>and <em>Mech Warrior 2. </em>Oh and <em>Freddy Pharkas: Frontier Pharmacist</em> is available, too. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1712924798815248487&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1712924798815248487" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That’s a game that a young Geoff Keighley helped test back in the day</a></span>, long before he had a whole game award show. </p><p>According to Xbox, this is just the start. It plans on adding more Acitivison and Blizzard games to the app in the future. While I’m not a huge fan of streaming old games like this, and would prefer actual downloads and offline play, this is still better than nothing. It’s nice to see Xbox finally digging into Activision’s deep library of classic games and doing something with them after buying the publisher back in 2023. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-game-pass-1850923561&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-game-pass-1850923561">If Microsoft wants to own the entire game industry</a></span>, the least it can do is make it easier to legally play the old stuff it gobbled up in the process.</p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What a waste. </p><p>It’s not a shock that Sony is pulling the plug. Almost no PlayStation 4 or PS5 players really seemed to use PlayStation Stars, despite being able to get 4 percent back on purchases on the PlayStation Store. The biggest issue was that no aspect of the program was integrated directly into the console experience. You couldn’t access your quests for earning more points or show off your collectibles on PS4 or PS5. </p><p>When the entire program when down for a month last year <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-stars-outage-broken-down-fixed-1851570048&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-stars-outage-broken-down-fixed-1851570048">no one batted an eye</a></span>, which is a shame really. The PlayStation ecosystem used to be one of the more robust on console but has been lagging behind both Xbox and Switch in some ways in recent years (Game Pass has quests and Switch now has game sharing). For the amount of time (and money) players spend on PS5, they deserve a version of PlayStation Stars that’s actually good.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to them, the plan was always to set this game a big, open world with connected tracks. And it was never going to be called <em>Mario Kart 9</em>, as this time around they wanted to “take the series to the next level.” </p><p>“We were thinking about what to do for the next <em>Mario Kart</em> game even during the development of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8-10-year-anniversary-1851507678&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-8-10-year-anniversary-1851507678"><em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em></a></span>, and we began prototyping in March 2017,” said <em>Mario Kart</em> <em>World </em>producer Kosuke Yabuki. “It was at the end of that year when we officially started work on it as a project. I felt that in <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, we were able to perfect the formula that we’d been following in the series up to that point, where players race on individual courses. That’s why, this time, we wanted the gameplay to involve players driving around a large world, and we began creating a world map like this.”</p><p>At the time, the devs were developing this bigger, more open <em>Mario Kart</em> game for the OG Switch console. As the Nintendo devs explained, their process is to first design a game and what they want it to do, and <em>then</em> make it work on the hardware. However, to get 24-player races and the open world working on Switch was challenging, and involved a lot of compromises. </p><p>“When we were developing for the Nintendo Switch system, it was difficult for us to incorporate everything we wanted, so we were always conscious of what we were giving up in return,” said programming director Kenta Sato. “We discussed things like toning down the visuals, lowering the resolution, and we even considered dropping the frame rate to 30 FPS in some cases. It was a tough situation.”</p><p>According to Sato, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/3ds/mario-kart-7/1/3/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/3ds/mario-kart-7/1/3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo considers it very important that <em>Mario Kart </em>games run at 60 FPS</a></span>, likely because this provides players with a solid sense of speed and makes the game feel more fluid and responsive. So instead of halving the framerate, they just...waited for a new console.</p><p>“We worked on [<em>Mario Kart World</em>] while kicking the can down the road in terms of deciding what to give up on, so at some point, we knew it was going to get messy,” said Yabuki. “But as we’d decided to release <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe — Booster Course Pass</em>, we thought that would give us a bit more time to continue development. That’s when the conversation of moving it to the Nintendo Switch 2 system came up, and this suddenly opened up a bunch of possibilities on what we could do. It was truly a ray of hope.”</p><p>It’s very interesting to see Nintendo so openly discuss framerates and how important they can be in high-speed games like <em>Mario Kart</em>. And yeah, they made the right call. <em>Mario Kart</em> at 30 FPS sounds depressing. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502"><em>Mario Kart World </em>and the Switch 2 are set to launch in United States on June 5.</a></span> GameStop says it will have some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-in-stock-target-best-buy-gamestop-preorder-1851781532&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-in-stock-target-best-buy-gamestop-preorder-1851781532">Switch 2 consoles available in stock</a></span> for fans who weren’t able to get a pre-order.
