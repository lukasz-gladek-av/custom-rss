              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-dev-returns-with-a-cozy-rpg-about-haunte-1847912361"><em>Haunted Chocolatier</em></a> is the next game from the creator of <em>Stardew Valley</em>, one of the most successful and adored cozy RPGs ever made. Not surprisingly, fans are getting antsy to hear more about the upcoming release. But the wait is leading to <a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-concerenedape-haunted-chocolatier-update-1851778392">all sorts of speculation,</a> so developer Eric “ConcernedApe” Barone recently took to the game’s website to dispel the unfounded rumors in a new blog post.</p> <p>“Hey everyone, good news: I’ve been very productive lately on <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em>,” he <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2026/01/28/update-im-still-working-like-always/">wrote this week</a>. “Yep, it’s taking a while to finish the game. That’s oaky. I know, I know, I shouldn’t have announced the game so early. But I had my reasons.” From there he went on to debunk some popular fan myths and set the record straight on<em> Haunted Chocolatier</em>‘s development.</p>

 <h2>1.<em> Haunted Chocolatier</em> will not be abandoned and added to <em>Stardew Valley</em> instead</h2> <p>He promised this wouldn’t happen, but said that even if he did end up abandoning his new game it would be absurd to think it would get added to the existing one. They were made in different engines and “you can’t just copy and paste <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em> into <em>Stardew Valley</em>.”</p> <h2>2. Ideas for <em>Haunted Chocolatier </em>are not being tested inside <em>Stardew Valley</em></h2> <p>Barone once again reiterated that these are “separate” games even if they might share the same aesthetic. Furthermore, he said he doesn’t want to spoil anything being worked on in <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em> by teasing it early in <em>Stardew Valley</em>.</p>

 <h2>3. He’s not working on <em>Stardew Valley</em> to avoid working on <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em></h2> <p>Barone maintained that the only reason he keeps releasing new <em>Stardew Valley</em> updates is because it’s still an incredibly popular game, not because anything with <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em> has gone awry.</p> <h2>4. <em>Haunted Chocolatier </em>doesn’t have a 2030 release date</h2> <p>The developer previously said he “hoped” that <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em> would be out in the next five years. That was taken by some to mean it won’t be out before then. He re-confirmed there is no actual set release date and it will just be done when it’s done, like all good things worth waiting for.</p>

 <p>Welp, glad that’s all settled. The <em>Haunted Chocolatier</em> subreddit can go to sleep now until the game is out, or better yet just keep playing <em>Stardew</em> Valley.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Borderlands 4 Reminds Fans It’s Alive In 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-2026-road-map-updates-cross-save-new-loot-dlc-level-cap-increase-2000664254</link>
            <guid>1420456</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> launched last year with many, myself included, praising the game’s combat and open world, but criticizing a myriad of technical problems and performance issues. Since then, Gearbox has continued to update the game, and the studio has a big roadmap planned for 2026 that includes level cap increases, cross saves, and more.</p> <p>On January 29, <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/en-GB/borderlands-4/update-notes/">Gearbox pushed out a new major update for <em>Borderlands 4</em></a> across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. This update adds a new photo mode, something people have been asking about for a bit now. Finally, you can take gorgeous cinematic images of yourself blasting apart rippers and aliens with a four-barreled assault rifle. Alongside that new feature came a long list of various tweaks, changes, and fixes as you might expect from a big update for a modern game in 2026. The bigger news, however, is what’s coming to <em>Borderlands 4</em> over the next few months.</p>

 <p><a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/2026-roadmap/">In a blog post,</a> Gearbox outlined its roadmap for 2026, and it includes some previously teased features as well as some new additions that should make any<em> Borderlands 4</em> player happy. First, Gearbox <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pearls-roadmap-takedown-dlc-free-update-2000621708">reconfirmed that Pearlescents</a>, a higher loot rarity level seen in past games, would be added to <em>Borderlands 4</em> when the game’s first expansion, “Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned,” arrives in March. And you won’t have to buy the DLC to start finding these rarer pieces of loot once they’ve been added to the looter shooter in an upcoming update. This is also when the game’s first new Vault Hunter, C4SH, will be added.</p> <h2>The biggest news from<em> Borderlands 4</em>‘s 2026 roadmap</h2> <p>Meanwhile, Gearbox confirmed that it is working on three highly requested features for <em>Borderlands 4.</em> The studio didn’t share release dates or windows for when to expect these three features in its new roadmap, but they will arrive in 2026.</p>

 <ul> <li> <blockquote><p>Level cap increases are coming in future updates for “all players.” Gearbox added that it looks “forward to seeing even more build variety and interactions made possible by the additional skill points!”</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Cross-platform saves will be added later this year, allowing players to bounce between platforms without having to restart a new character. Hopefully Gearbox has plans for people like me who have high-level characters on two different platforms.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Shared world progression between characters is also coming. Gearbox is going to add an option in a future patch that will let you share all your open-world progression, like extra backpack slots, discovered Vault Fragments, and vehicle unlocks, across all your characters. I do hope this is optional, as I’d like to return to <em>Borderlands 4</em> one day and be able to start all over with a new playthrough and not inherit all the upgrades I unlocked before.</p></blockquote> </li> </ul> <p>Besides all that, Gearbox has also promised more free events. Though if they are anything like the <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-halloween-event-borderlands-4-sucks-bad-horrors-of-kairos-2000638842">not-so-great Halloween event from last year,</a> I’m not sure how excited I am about that. Also coming in 2026 to<em> Borderlands 4</em> is more endgame content, including a new raid boss and a super-hard-to-complete Takedown mission in Q2 2026. (<a href="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/2016921486435520663?">This was previously teased for a Q4 release</a>, so it appears to have been moved up, which is nice.) Gearbox says it’s working on “additional endgame activities that’ll add a new layer of challenge and mastery to existing content.”</p>

 <p>So <em>Borderlands 4</em> isn’t “dead” as so many on the internet like to claim. The real question is whether all this new content and free updates will arrive on time and be worth the wait. For now, I’m going to go take a cool screenshot of me shooting Claptrap with a rocket launcher using that new photo mode.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[No Rest For The Wicked Will Cost As Much As Baldur’s Gate 3 When It Leaves Early Access: ‘I’m Not Trying To Do Any FOMO Marketing Here’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/no-rest-wicked-co-op-free-steam-sale-early-access-ps5-2000664252</link>
            <guid>1420444</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last year, Moon Studios boss Thomas Mahler was threatening that his company <a href="https://kotaku.com/ori-moon-studios-no-rest-for-the-wicked-review-mahler-1851780166">might have to shut down</a> if players didn’t stop review-bombing his new action-RPG&nbsp;<em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> on Steam. Now his team is celebrating a major turnaround after a recent update brought multiplayer co-op to the top-down Soulslike. With a fresh spotlight on the Early Access project, Mahler took the opportunity to confirm that while the game is currently steeply discounted, it’ll cost as much as<em> Baldur’s Gate 3</em> once it’s fully released.</p> <p>“I’m not trying to do any FOMO marketing here, but yes: when we hit 1.0, <em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> will move to <span>$60</span>, because it’s a premium title,” he <a href="https://x.com/thomasmahler/status/2016906516754808905">wrote on X</a> on Thursday. “We’ve announced this a long time ago and repeated it several times.” He compared it to the hit <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-based CRPG which remained full-price throughout Early Access. Unlike that, <em>No Rest for the Wicked</em> is typically $40 in its own Early Access period. At the moment, it’s even cheaper than that thanks to an ongoing Steam Sale. It’ll be 40 percent off until February 5.</p>

 <p>“The reason the game launched at <span>$40</span> was simple: <span>Early Access players should get a discount</span>,” Mahler wrote. “<em>BG3</em> launched into Early Access at full price, and personally I never loved that approach. If you support a game early, you should get some extra love. I’m only saying this now so nobody’s surprised or upset later. If you’ve been on the fence about <em>Wicked</em>, the current sale is genuinely a good time to jump in.”</p> <h2>A free-to-play Steam weekend coup</h2> <p>And a bunch of players clearly have been. <a tabindex="0" role="button" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1371980/view/518610613985871419"><em>No Rest for the Wicked</em>‘s Together update</a> went live just last week on January 22. In addition to the usual bevy of quality-of-life improvements, bug fixes, and re-balancing, it brought full, shared-world co-op to the game that transformed the otherwise grim and solemn affair into something much more social. In addition to fighting through a brutal and bloody fantasy setting together, players can also fish, forage, and partake in other, more chill distractions.</p>

 <p>New players have been flocking to the game ever since with an major influx of positive Steam reviews over the weekend when the game was briefly free-to-play. It peaked at over 60,000 concurrents and was temporarily the best-selling game on Steam. Mahler said the game’s been selling tens of thousands of new copies every day since.</p>

 <p>It’s a far cry from last summer’s ominous warnings that the <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/ori-blind-forest-will-wisps-sexism-toxic-moon-studios-m-1848673622">Ori and the Blind Forest</a></em> maker might not be “around in a couple of months to do anything anymore” if existing players kept complaining about the direction of the game. The game is currently slated to arrive on PlayStation 5 when it hits 1.0, but so far there’s no set timeline for when that will happen.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Save Kittens And Blast Away Demons In This New $15 FPS]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/meowgun-review-boomer-shooter-retro-fps-cats-quake-2000664236</link>
            <guid>1420414</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are many, many, <em>many</em> retro-themed first-person shooters, aka <a href="https://kotaku.com/cruel-boomer-shooter-retro-fps-pc-steam-2025-review-1851737479">boomer shooters</a>, on the market. Some might say there are too many. I’m inclined to agree with that, if only because there’s a lot of crap and slop out there pretending to be solid throwbacks to fast-paced FPS action. <em>MeowGun: Hell Denizen, </em>out now on Steam, isn’t one of those disappointing games.</p> <p><em>MeowGun’</em>s biggest strength is that, like some other <a href="https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-morrowind-doom-engine-mohtra-review-pc-steam-fps-boomer-shooter-2000647667">great retro shooters</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/wrath-is-a-retro-shooter-done-right-1841067258">including <em>Wrath</em></a>, it is built using an open-source version of a classic FPS engine. In this case, <em>MeowGun</em> uses FTEQW, which is an excellent open-source version of the original <em>Quake</em> engine. And as is usually the case with these boomer shooters built on the tech of the past, it helps make <em>MeowGun</em> feel fantastic.</p>

  <p>Every gun in <em>MeowGun</em> is snappy, loud, and deadly. You move fast, but always feel in control. And blowing away demons with pistols, shotguns, bombs, and grenade launchers is a joy. It helps that <em>MeowGun’s</em> developers understand that people play boomer shooters to blow shit up and kill lots of enemies while sprinting through various levels that should never be too big. I also appreciate that <em>MeowGun’s</em> starting pistol is quite powerful and proves useful in fights for picking off enemies or saving ammo. This ain’t a peashooter you’ll never use after you get a new weapon.</p> <p><em>MeowGun’s</em> voice acting is at times distracting, especially as the main character–a half cat/half demon woman named MeowMeow–speaks almost entirely in movie quotes and pop culture references. And they start to repeat pretty quickly. Thankfully, I was often blowing up so much shit that I rarely could hear these lines. But if a talking protagonist is too much for you, <em>MeowGun</em> might be a grating experience. On the other hand, if you love cats, there are small and very adorable kittens to find and save. Yes, before you ask, you can pet the cats you save. Oh, and there’s a dedicated button to make your character meow. I’ll let you decide how that makes you feel.</p>

 <p>To be clear: <em>MeowGun: Hell Denizen</em> isn’t some revolutionary first-person shooter that I’m going to come back to year after year to enjoy. But it is a damn good retro FPS that understands what people want out of these kinds of games: Lots of enemies to kill, fast music, satisfying guns, and short load times. And <em>MeowGun</em> delivers on all of that and costs less than $15. In 2026, I can’t ask for much more.</p>
