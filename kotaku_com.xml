But this year, in 2024, we had to expand the list to 15. And we cut stuff from this list! What a bad, horrible year, huh? Anyway, here’s some of the worst, most awful, or just plain annoying gaming-related news from the past 12 months. Hopefully 2025 is better.</p></div></div><div><p>When the more powerful <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-graphics-opinions-1851648372/slides/4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-graphics-opinions-1851648372/slides/4">PlayStation 5 Pro</a></span> was announced in September, it sparked a lot of controversy. Its $700 price point, and the reality of how much (or little) it would actually improve games, were the two big points of contenti0n. Still, if it did make most games look and run better, Sony would be able to mostly come away victorious. </p><p>Alas, that’s not been the case. While a lot of games do look better, there have also been games, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-pssr-update-silent-hill-2-remake-dragon-age-1851701776&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-pssr-update-silent-hill-2-remake-dragon-age-1851701776"><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Alan Wake II, </em>and<em> Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em></a></span>, that looked <em>worse </em>after receiving fancy PS5 Pro patches. Some of this has been fixed already, but it does seem like devs are still figuring out how to use the Pro’s upscaling tech, and that’s leading to some of these issues. Hopefully, in a few months, we won’t see games looking worse on PS5 Pro. That doesn’t change that all of this has soured any potential excitement around the prospect of the Pro, and probably damaged the console’s already shaky public image forever.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d3693d1c920f21ff99baae6fac843949" data-recommend-id="image://d3693d1c920f21ff99baae6fac843949" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="787" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d3693d1c920f21ff99baae6fac843949" data-recommend-id="image://d3693d1c920f21ff99baae6fac843949" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="787" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Generally, when something feels too good to be true, it’s because it isn’t going to last for much longer. That was very much the feeling around Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass, which made the launch of the Xbox Series X/S feel like such a great deal.  There was this extraordinary library, including day-one releases of Microsoft-published titles, to delve into for just ten bucks a month.</p><p>Over the years since, the prices have climbed, albeit at the same time as massive international financial issues were occurring following the covid pandemic. In 2023, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-game-pass-price-increase-ps5-microsoft-1850561048&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-game-pass-price-increase-ps5-microsoft-1850561048" target="_blank">Game Pass for console went up to $11</a></span>, while the Ultimate version that also got you access to PC games  went up two dollars to $16.99. Which still felt like a pretty decent deal, and despite talk of the increase coinciding with Microsoft’s outrageous purchase of Activision Blizzard for $69 billion, was actually a slightly below-inflation rise.</p><p>But then came 2024. I<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866">n July, it was revealed that Game Pass Ultimate</a></span> was going up from $17 to $20, a whopping 18 percent increase, and now massively above inflation. But worse—far worse—Microsoft simultaneously killed off the more affordable $11 console-only tier. It was replaced with a new tier called Game Pass Standard, which would no longer include day-one game releases, and was priced at $15! Yup, an almost 50-percent price increase for a <em>far</em> worse version.</p><p>What this meant, really, is that the price of Game Pass—for anyone who was using it as a means to access the full library and play the day-one Microsoft games—went from $11 to $20 a month. And this time, with the $69 billion Activision Blizzard deal having somehow gone through, it <em>really did</em> feel like it was a factor.</p><p>In 2024, Game Pass went from one of life’s great deals to one to somewhat resent, now a whopping $240 a year, with no discounted annual pricing. Which royally sucks. - John Walker</p></div></div><div><p>At the end of 2023, Rockstar Games ended a decade of waiting and released the first trailer for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-vi-gta6-first-trailer-gameplay-footage-details-leak-1851005265&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-vi-gta6-first-trailer-gameplay-footage-details-leak-1851005265"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a></span>. It quickly racked up millions of views and was pulled apart by every <em>GTA </em>YouTuber and outlet for as many details as possible. Now, it’s a year later and uh...well, Rockstar is radio silent on <em>GTA 6. </em></p><p>Since December 2023, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-first-trailer-2-a-year-later-1851714995&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-first-trailer-2-a-year-later-1851714995">Rockstar has not released a single screenshot or teaser about its big 2025 <em>GTA </em>sequel. Nothing</a></span>! Fans held out hope that a new trailer would arrive at The Game Awards, but that was always unlikely as Rockstar rarely attends shows like that to show off its upcoming games. </p><p>So, we enter 2025 with no new trailer. Now the question for 2025 is: When does <em>GTA 6</em>'s trailer arrive, and will Rockstar’s big sequel make it out this year or get delayed like nearly every other one of its past games?</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d4a0fac0a9e67f652df5c57f05e0d93e" data-recommend-id="image://d4a0fac0a9e67f652df5c57f05e0d93e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1294" data-height="728" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows Homer running away from a giant finger.

Sony made a series of bad calls, and the people who suffered for it were the ones who were doing exactly what they were told to do. It seems the people who make the bad calls are never the ones who have to answer for it. - Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a7056cd94b7cd59169efc95304fd0143" data-recommend-id="image://a7056cd94b7cd59169efc95304fd0143" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="740" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A photo shows Mario peeking out from behind a curtain.

It’s paying for something before it exists, and before there’s any information on whether it was worth existing in the first place. In 2023, pre-ordering somehow got even worse and more pricey.

The game’s finished! You know that, because it’s being sold to people who paid more for it before any reviews could warn them not to. It’s just being artificially held back for everyone else who wasn’t willing to pay more than the full price for a game that wasn’t done yet.</p><p>And yet, as with everything dreadful in video games (DRM, online-only single-player games, no ability to re-sell online purchases), we protest them in their infancy, and then just get used to them, like frogs in ever-more revolting boiling water. It’s now become the absolute norm that if you’re willing to fork out tens of dollars more for a game, you can be among the people to play it three days before everyone else. For…kudos? Playground fame? YouTube hits? It’s such a revoltingly cynical exploitation of FOMO. </p><p>Pre-orders have gone from offering a cheaper price in return for the risk of buying something that might not be worth getting, to a way to pay <em>far more</em> for something that might not be worth getting, for the reward of getting to find that out a few days early.

Over 14,600 people who make video games lost their jobs in the past 12 months. Things have become so bad that Geoff Keighley, the king of saying how good a year it’s been for video games even if it hasn’t been, had to acknowledge them on stage at The Game Awards.</p><p>The truth is, every year is a good year for video games themselves, but as corporate greed and poor business decisions become more and more prevalent every year, the people who make the  games we celebrate have suffered. As more institutional knowledge is lost to senseless job cuts, the games are going to suffer, too. It doesn’t have to be this way, but so long as corporate greed takes precedence over talent, this is the result. - Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b97193a43c7c70c85c49111cc6ebf00c" data-recommend-id="image://b97193a43c7c70c85c49111cc6ebf00c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A promo image of Borderlands.
