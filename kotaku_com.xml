              <p>If you like sharing your adventures with the world and are ready to go beyond what your smartphone or a traditional camera can shoot, you need a high-quality drone camera in your setup. These don’t come cheap, but Amazon is making it easier than ever to pick one right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6348/">The DJI Flip (RC-N3) drone with a 4K camera, which usually sits at $439, is currently going for just $349 at the retailer.</a> That’s after a nice, and quite rare, 21% drop. This is also the lowest we have seen this drone drop to in a long while. The deal is open to all shoppers, but it wraps up soon. We recommend getting your orders in sooner, before that happens.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6348/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Dynamic Angles, Six Shooting Modes</h2>
<p>Don’t let the look overwhelm you. At just under 249 g, it’s a lightweight drone that doesn’t need FAA registration or Remote ID in America. It’s convenient to travel with, and much easier than most models on the market to use. You can choose between multiple shooting modes for different types of adventures. Getting started couldn’t be simpler; just unfold the arms of the drone, select your desired shooting mode, and send it off.</p>
<p>The foldable propeller guard offers ultra-reliable close-up coverage for when you want to take a detailed look at something, while subject tracking keeps you the center of attention, always. Flip offers MasterShots and six Quickshot modes that deliver simplified cinematic footage for dynamic angles. The modes include Drone, Circle, Rocket, Spotlight, Helix, and Boomerang. Maybe go for the circle mode when you’re trying to capture your furry friend, and the Helix mode during some early morning outdoor walks! Stabilization comes from the 3-axis mechanical gimbal, plus up to level-5 wind resistance. These come together to provide smooth footage, even in chaotic, windy environments.</p>



<p>Picture quality is stunning, thanks to the large 1/1.3-inch CMOS sensor that’s capable of capturing more light for clearer images with vivid detail. Similarly, 4K/60fps HDR gets you breathtaking videos where every little detail is taken care of. The drone also supports vertical crops at 2.7k resolution; great for sharing your adventures on social media instantly. Even better, the dedicated app comes with beautification features that edit the shots on its own when exporting the footage. What’s more, the camera records audio with noise reduction via your phone. It does a good job of focusing on your audio while cutting out background distractions, but for an even better experience, it’s best to pair the drone with a DJI mic (sold separately).</p>
<p>You’ll also enjoy up to 44000 feet/13 km of 1080/60fps video transmission. Pair that with a battery that lasts up to 31 minutes on a single charge, and explore far-off areas without a worry. The DJI Fly app makes managing the drone easy, and also supports voice control for when you’re not in the mood to tweak settings manually. Just say something like “Hey Fly, follow me” or “Hey Fly, start recording”, to begin. The box includes the DJI Flip, DJI RC-N3 remote controller, one Intelligent Flight Battery, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6348/">This deal brings the price of this top-rated drone camera down to $349, making the upgrade quite affordable.</a> You might also be able to enjoy free delivery with your purchase if you order today.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Disney Is Feeding Your Favorite Characters To The OpenAI Woodchipper For $1 Billion]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/disney-open-ai-sora-deal-star-wars-frozen-2000652583</link>
            <guid>1379758</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The Walt Disney Company and tech bro Sam Altman’s OpenAI have signed a massive deal that will allow users to create AI slop videos centered around their favorite Disney characters starting early next year.</span></p> <p><span>News of the $1 billion deal (h/t </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/disney-openai-deal-200-characters-to-sora-video-invests-1-billion-1236606401/"><i><span>Variety</span></i></a><span>) comes just days after Altman was on Jimmy Fallon’s </span><i><span>The Tonight Show</span></i><span>, claiming that AI could help people raise their kids. According to the rather fluffy </span><i><span>Variety</span></i><span> report, the deal makes Disney the “first major licensing partner on Sora,” which is OpenAI’s generative AI video platform. Users will be able to make videos featuring more than 200 characters across Disney, Marvel, Pixar, and </span><i><span>Star Wars, </span></i><span>and a variety of “costumes, props, vehicles, and iconic environments” that they can then share on social media.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Importantly, the deal </span><span>does not</span><span> include “talent likenesses or voices,” so you won’t be seeing a mostly accurate Harrison Ford building a snowman with </span><i><span>Frozen</span></i><span>’s Elsa, or whatever weird digital amalgamation Disney adults decide to type into the slop machine. </span></p>

 <p><span>Characters people </span><i><span>can</span></i><span> use in their <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-energy-demands-water-impact-internet-hyper-consumption-era/">quest to rob the planet of water</a> include:</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Ariel from </span><i><span>The Little Mermaid</span></i></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Belle from </span><i><span>Beauty and the Beast</span></i></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Cinderella</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Mickey Mouse</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Minnie Mouse</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Baymax from </span><i><span>Big Hero 6</span></i></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Simba and Mufasa from </span><i><span>The Lion King</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Black Panther</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Captain America</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Deadpool</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Groot</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Iron Man</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Thor</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Thanos</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Importantly, the deal allows for “iconic animated or illustrated versions of Marvel and Lucasfilm characters,” so a cartoon version of Harrison Ford building a snowman with Elsa appears to be in the cards. </span></p>

 <p><span>It’s unclear what kinds of guardrails Disney (<a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-epic-fortnite-project-mickey-mouse-1851666530">notoriously protective over how its characters are used in media</a></span><span>) will put on Sora, which had to readjust back in October after users created videos of&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/sora-2-update-pokemon-nintendo-openai-sam-altman-ai-2000632089" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Altman grilling </a></span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sora-2-update-pokemon-nintendo-openai-sam-altman-ai-2000632089"><span>and eating Pikachu</span></a><span>. Considering that the depravity and stupidity of AI knows no bounds, I expect Disney will be regretting this deal sooner rather than later.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The corporate conjunction also means Disney will be folding OpenAI into its daily operations, including “deploying ChatGPT for its employees.” It’s unclear if that means AI-generated content will be in the next </span><i><span>Moana</span></i><span> film. Disney is investing $1 billion into Altman’s AI company, so it clearly wants to get its money’s worth.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Disney CEO Bob Iger rang the “AI is good” bell in an official statement, saying, “Technological innovation has continually shaped the evolution of entertainment, bringing with it new ways to create and share great stories with the world. The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence marks an important moment for our industry, and through this collaboration with OpenAI we will thoughtfully and responsibly extend the reach of our storytelling through generative AI, while respecting and protecting creators and their works.”</span></p> <p><span>Today, </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/disney-google-ai-copyright-infringement-cease-and-desist-letter-1236606429/"><span>Disney sent Google a cease-and-desist letter,</span></a><span> accusing the company of using AI to engage in copyright infringement on a “massive scale.” LOL. LMAO, even. </span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[You Won’t Believe How Cheap It Was To Make Clair Obscur: Expedition 33]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-budget-cost-goty-sandfall-2000652590</link>
            <guid>1379710</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Much has been said about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> success and the business calls that made it an unexpected frontrunner in the 2025 Game of the Year race. Now we’ve learned that the game was somehow made for less than $10 million.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/11/arts/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sandfall.html"><i><span>The New York Times</span></i></a><span>, Sandfall Interactive co-founder and CEO Guillaume Broche said that </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>’s budget was a tiny fraction of your average AAA game, coming out to “less than $10 million.” To put that into perspective, Insomniac’s </span><i><span>Spider-Man 2 </span></i><span>cost around </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/what-hacked-files-tell-us-about-the-studio-behind-spide-1851115233"><span>$300 million</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> managed to avoid those ballooning budgets by aiming for a much smaller scale and refusing to chase the modern open-world bloat that has some games costing huge fortunes and taking half a decade to make.</span></p>

 <p><span>As Broche lays out, Sandfall made a string of creative decisions that would allow the studio to create a lot with fewer resources, a smaller team, and a reasonable budget. One major example is how the game’s overworld is a miniature recreation of a map, rather than a full-blown open-world space. This allowed the devs to present an explorable universe to players without having to create something on the scale of open-world games that show off every detail as players walk through it.</span></p>

 <p><span>Sandfall </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070"><span>is an independent studio</span></a><span>, but much of </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>‘s funding came from publisher Kepler Interactive, and some parts of development (including battle animations and localization) were outsourced. The result is that </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span> manages to have all the polish of a prestige AAA game at a budget that a lot of other publishers would have you believe can’t possibly produce games of its quality.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s still a false narrative floating around the internet that </span><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-clair-obscur-expedition-33-wasnt-made-by-30-people"><span>only 30 people</span></a><span> made Sandfall Interactive’s breakout debut RPG. While yes, the company itself may be smaller than your average studio, </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>was also </span><a href="https://vgbees.com/if-you-dont-count-everyone-else-all-devs-are-solo-devs/"><span>developed in collaboration with contractors</span></a><span>. The numbers don’t lie, though. When blockbuster development costs are ballooning,</span><i><span> Clair Obscur</span></i><span> proves you can make a hit that still looks and feels impressive without breaking the bank.</span></p>

 <p><span>It also, thankfully, is not a massive time sink. I rolled credits at around 30 hours, while most RPGs last at least twice as long. Broche told </span><i><span>The New York Times</span></i><span> he hopes </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>‘s success will help bring the cost of developing AAA games back to a more reasonable range.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We have the tech now to make those games with a relatively small team,” Broche said. “Games like this are coming. We are lucky to be early.”</span></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-geoff-keighley-tickets-trailers-clair-obscur-2000652243"><span>The 2025 Game Awards</span></a><span> are tonight, and </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825"><span>has 13 nominations</span></a><span> across multiple categories, which is the most any game has earned in the event’s decade-long history.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-microsd-card-returns-at-0-07-per-gb-expand-storage-on-nintendo-switch-phones-or-tablets-for-almost-nothing-2000652287</link>
            <guid>1379707</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="168" data-end="915">Storage has become one of the most frustrating limitations of modern tech. No matter how much space manufacturers promise, it never feels like enough. Our phones eventually fill up with new photos and videos, our PCs balloon with game downloads and media files, and our gaming consoles never seem to have enough room for the next title we want to install. Because of this ongoing struggle, storage deals tend to be some of the best and most reliable purchases you can make. When SSDs, external drives, or microSD cards go on sale, it’s usually smart to grab one. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6346/">Right now, the Samsung EVO Select line of memory cards is discounted by as much as 25%, making it a great time to upgrade your device’s storage without spending much.</a></p>
<p>Amazon has a handful of options at various capacities all on sale at the moment. The 64GB version of the Samsung EVO Select microSD is only&nbsp; $15 at the moment. But what’s this? So is the 128GB version. You can double the storage for no extra charge. Beyond that, the 256GB version is down to $23, and the full 1TB option has dropped from $93 to just $70.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6346/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Download More Game to Your Nintendo Switch</h2>
<p>For gamers in particular, especially those who own a Nintendo Switch, a microSD card is practically a necessity. The original Nintendo Switch model launched with only 32GB of internal storage, which disappears remarkably fast once you start downloading games. While Nintendo titles tend to be smaller than the enormous triple-A games common on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC—many of which exceed 100GB—Switch games can still add up quickly. For instance, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> weighs in at around 18.2GB, which is more than half of the system’s default storage all by itself. Add a couple more games and your space is gone in an instant.</p>
<p>That’s why ya gotta upgrade. With the Samsung EVO Select 1TB MicroSD card currently available for just $70, you can multiply your Switch storage many, many times over without needing to delete and redownload your favorite titles. 1TB gives you enough room to store a massive library of games, screenshots, captures, and save data, ensuring you’ll never need to stress about running out of space before a big download ever again.</p>



<p>However, if you’re playing on the Nintendo Switch 2, I hate to be the bearer of bad news. These particular microSD cards will not work with the latest Nintendo console. Nintendo’s next-generation console uses the newer microSD Express format, which offers significantly faster read and write speeds. Because of this difference, inserting a Samsung EVO Select MicroSD card into a Switch 2 will be met with nothing but an incompatibility message. Or maybe just nothing at all, I haven’t personally tested it.</p>
<p>The good news is that the EVO Select cards remain fully functional with the former lineup of Nintendo systems: the original Nintendo Switch, the Switch Lite, and the Switch OLED model.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, the Samsung EVO Select series delivers read and write speeds up to 160MB/s. While that doesn’t meet the more demanding requirements of the Switch 2, it exceeds what’s needed for the original Switch family, which only recommends speeds up to 90MB/s. In practical terms, this means smooth loading times and reliable performance for everything you play. Unless you’re playing a&nbsp;<em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>game because nothing can help those perform well.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Goes Into Full Clearance Mode on Its Soundbar as the S100F With Bass Reflex Speaker Hits an All-Time Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-goes-into-full-clearance-mode-on-its-soundbar-as-the-s100f-with-bass-reflex-speaker-hits-an-all-time-low-2000652293</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You can’t really enjoy an immersive viewing experience without great sound to match the visuals. If you’re looking to make holiday movie nights better but your current TV doesn’t have solid built-in speakers, adding a soundbar to the setup can be a smart move. And thanks to Amazon, picking one up doesn’t break the bank today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">The Sony S100F 2.0ch soundbar is currently going for just $98 at Amazon, after the retailer took a whopping 39% off its usual price of $160</a>. Shipping is free as well, so you’re not adding anything on top of the sale price. Even better, orders placed today will arrive before Christmas, so you can have fun streaming marathons with friends and family with fuller, richer audio that fills the room. Note that it’s only around for a short time, so it’s best to grab yours before the offer expires.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Surround Sound Experience</h2>
<p>The slim design blends into every entertainment setup well, matching the aesthetics of any room. You can place it on your console right below the screen, or mount it on the wall if you prefer a cleaner setup. It punches well above its weight, though. Sony has packed the soundbar with a two-speaker setup that delivers front surround sound by handling the full audio range without requiring additional subwoofers or speakers. It produces audio as a stereo mix for a wider soundstage that fills the entire room, instead of just blasting from the front.</p>
<p>The bass reflex speaker does an incredible job of delivering punchy, deep bass without compromising on the details, even when you have pumped the volume all the way up. You will be able to vibe to all your favorite tunes, plus immerse yourself in thrilling scenes like never before. S-Force Pro, on the other hand, emulates cinema-style sound fields for better clarity and a 3D experience. Translation? Cars in F1 race past your couch, gunfire erupts right in your living room, and the Grinch’s footsteps feel like they’re actually coming from behind you. Whether you’re planning to watch an action-packed series or stream some good old Christmas title, it makes you feel a part of what’s happening on the screen.</p>



<p>There’s a voice enhancement feature that automatically improves dialog clarity, even in those loud, chaotic scenes. It also comes in handy when you’re catching up with friends on a bigger screen; you will be able to hear everyone on the conference call clearly. Connectivity couldn’t be easier. A single HDMI ARC connection between the TV and the soundbar gets the party started. You can control both the TV and the soundbar with a single remote. Best of all, it supports Bluetooth connections just as well, which is great for when you want to pair your smartphone wirelessly with it. Maybe play some songs or a podcast in the background as you set holiday decorations up!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5987/">On a regular day, this speaker would run you around $160, but this deal lets you grab it for $98, which is quite affordable considering all the features it gets you.</a> If you’ve been after better sound, this soundbar can be an excellent addition to your setup. Snap it up quick, though, as the discount is a limited-time one. The retailer hasn’t specified an end date, but we’re not expecting it to last long. Placing your orders now will also allow you to get it before Christmas!</p>
