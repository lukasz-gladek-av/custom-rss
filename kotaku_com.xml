              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136"><em>Highguard</em> players</a> were aghast that the raid hero shooter launched without an FOV slider on console. Well, now it has one, and some other small fixes to help with its launch week woes.</p> <p>“We’ve just pushed out a patch with a number of improvements, including FoV sliders for consoles, toggle options for ADS and Crouch, many video settings, and more,” reads the <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2016938033938108505">1.0.4 update</a> from Wildlight Entertainment. “The team is also working on optimization improvements, they just need a few more days to cook.”</p> <p>Players on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S can now adjust the field-of-view to 110, while a number of new visual settings help PC players limit rendering load to improve framerate. You can’t yet disable motion blur and depth of field but that’s coming down the road. A gnarly bug on PS5 that was crashing the game after leaving matches has also been addressed.</p>

 <p>The first round of many promised improvements comes as <em>Highguard</em> struggles to hang on to its slice of multiplayer mindshare after coming to PC and console earlier this week. An avalanche of <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-already-has-over-7000-negative-reviews-on-steam-2000663220">negative reviews on Steam</a> and the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/">collapse of the concurrent player numbers on PC</a> aren’t promising, but I’ve also heard anecdotally from friends on console that they’ve been enjoying it more as they continue playing and come to understand the nuances of the genre mashup.</p> <p>Here are the full <em>Highguard</em> 1.0.4 Patch Notes:</p> <blockquote>  <div data-block="true" data-editor="83hv9" data-offset-key="fvds1-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="fvds1-0-0">Note: in an effort to release these changes to our players as quickly as possible, a number of menu options are not yet localized in languages other than English.

This is disorienting on controller. PC players are recommended to rebind scope swap if using Toggle ADS. We will continue to look into adding this for console players who can’t rebind buttons yet, but we will need more time.</span></p> </div>  <ul data-offset-key="88afk-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="83hv9" data-offset-key="88afk-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="88afk-0-0">Console users can now adjust FoV to 110.</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="83hv9" data-offset-key="1hja3-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="1hja3-0-0">Low scalability settings for shadows and reflections are tuned for even more performance at the cost of some image quality.</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="83hv9" data-offset-key="ad4qs-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="ad4qs-0-0">Low shadow setting now also disables volumetric fog.</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="83hv9" data-offset-key="b7u3s-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="b7u3s-0-0">Added a new “View Distance Quality” setting that controls skeletal mesh LODs, which can be another useful control to tune GPU and CPU usage.</span></p> </li> </ul> <div data-block="true" data-editor="83hv9" data-offset-key="fro5e-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="fro5e-0-0">Players now have the ability to toggle the following features on or off, irrespective of other quality options:</span></p> </div> <ul data-offset-key="15pqq-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="83hv9" data-offset-key="15pqq-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="15pqq-0-0">Anisotropic Materials</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="83hv9" data-offset-key="ar0o0-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="ar0o0-0-0">Chromatic Aberration</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="83hv9" data-offset-key="bfqs9-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="bfqs9-0-0">Bloom</span></p> </li> </ul> <div data-block="true" data-editor="83hv9" data-offset-key="d4ugb-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="d4ugb-0-0">Motion Blur and Depth of Field need more testing to disable safely.

              <p>The disappointing saga of <em>Mighty No. 9</em> has reached its long, meandering conclusion. Blizzard has big plans for <em>World of Warcraft</em> in 2026. And <em>Diablo</em> veterans are working on their own not-<em>Diablo</em> ARPG rival. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> is getting <em>Fortnite</em>-ified. The tactical shooter teased Solid Snake <a href="https://discordapp.com/channels/@me/1458090158170570805/1466485455578075342">as its next operator</a>. I doubt it’ll be as lucrative for Konami as those <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/2016797054304231572">millions of <em>eFootball</em> downloads, though</a>.</p> <h2>The messy, sad saga of Comcept finally comes to a definitive end</h2> <p>Legendary <em>Mega Man</em> artist Keiji Inafune launched his own independent studio in 2010 after leaving Capcom following the cancelation of <em>Mega Man Legends 3</em>. It was called Comcept and one of its early projects was a spiritual successor to <em>Mega Man</em> called <a href="https://kotaku.com/mighty-no-9-tries-real-hard-but-no-1782427135"><em>Mighty No. 9</em></a>. It was a 2D action platformer that relied on Kickstarter backing and ended up being a disaster both as a game and in terms of the promise of crowdfunding.</p>

 <p>Comcept was eventually acquired by Level-5 in 2017. In 2024, the company announced Inafune had departed amid a reboot of life sim RPG <i>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time. </i>Oversight of the project shifted back to Level-5’s Osaka Office. It came out last summer and was very good. But the last trace of Inafune’s legacy there is no more. The final, official dissolution of what remained of the studio was <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/comcept-shuts-down">announced this week</a>.</p> <h2><em>Hytale</em> lays out an ambitious update schedule</h2> <p>The <em>Minecraft</em> clone that has early players importing all sorts of wild modes and creations is promising a rapid update pipeline to help the Early Access release grow and iterate quickly while still experimenting. “Going forward, we’ll use the pre-release patchline to be a bit more adventurous,” Simon Collins-Laflamme, founder of developer Hypixel, <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2016619068242219093?s=20">wrote on X</a>. “It will be updated weekly and may be unstable by design; this is where new features, larger changes, and iterations happen. FYI, we might skip a week from time to time for holidays, PTO, or other reasons.”</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </em>gets a mode that’s been MIA for seven years</strong></h2> <p>Safeguard, which first debuted in <em>Black Ops 3</em>, is back for season 2 beginning February 5. It’s essentially escorting the payload from <em>Overwatch</em> but with a robot. There will of course be new maps, cosmetics, and other unlockable with the new content drop as well.</p>

 <h2><em>Darkhaven</em> is a new ARPG from <em>Diablo</em> veterans</h2> <p>It’s got a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3571870/Darkhaven/">spiffy retro-looking trailer</a> and promises a twitchier combat and traversal loop than your average loot clicker. “From the very beginning, we wanted <em>Darkhaven</em> to feel good to play,”<em> Diablo</em> co-creator Erich Schaefer <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/darkhaven/arpg-diablo-veterans">told <em>PCGamesN</em></a>. “Being able to jump over attacks, climb cliffs, dash out of danger, or swim across a lake that may or may not be infested with riverfangs changes how combat feels in this kind of game. It’s not just about numbers fighting numbers any more. It’s much more engaging. For me, it becomes more about skill, finding flow, and making smart decisions in the moment. I’ve never had more fun making and playing an ARPG.” No release date yet.</p> <h2><em>World of Warcraft</em> is getting massive new dungeons</h2> <p>They’re called Labyrinths and they’ll launch in the 12.1.5 patch slated for fall 2026, Blizzard revealed in <a href="https://youtu.be/pkFMkdZWxdk">a Thursday showcase</a>. The event outlined what fans of the MMORPG can expect in the year ahead beyond the upcoming March 3&nbsp;<em>Midnight</em> expansion.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/bg3-swen-vincke-highguard-concord-steam-reviews-metacritic-2000663800">The <em>Highguard</em> backlash is a collision of a bunch of different things that have been brewing for some time</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-says-no-to-toxic-dong-on-switch-2-as-dispatch-devs-confirm-censored-content-2000663868"><em>Dispatch</em> on Switch is censored</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/code-vein-2-review-ps5-xbox-steam-soulslike-jrpg-anime-2000663834"><em>Code Vein II</em> is Soulslite-slop with a fun JRPG at its core</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>
