The actor, who was discovered dead in his home at the age of 95 this week (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gene-hackman-death-investigation-prescription-pills_n_67c1ee2ee4b0abc2b3eed500&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/gene-hackman-death-investigation-prescription-pills_n_67c1ee2ee4b0abc2b3eed500" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">under bizarre-sounding circumstances</a></span>), appeared in dozens of movies and won two Oscars. He did comedies, thrillers, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4X0vypRdHU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4X0vypRdHU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at least one kids movie</a></span>. He was also the best Lex Luthor we’ve ever had. </p><p>We took the occasion of his passing to look back at some of his best movies. There are of course the all-time classics like <em>French Connection</em> and <em>The Conversation</em> in which Hackman showed his range, subtlety, and fierceness.  But there’s also the more obscure thrillers like <em>No Way Out</em> in which he plays a Secretary of Defense caught up in a murder plot investigated by Kevin Costner. I watched it last night and my interest ebbed and flowed until the last 30 minutes cemented it as one of my favorite political thrillers from the era. </p><p>Sam Raimi’s <em>The Quick and the Dead</em>, a Western in which Hackman plays a diabolical sheriff opposite an all-star cast that includes Sharon Stone, Russell Crowe, and Leonardo DiCaprio, also comes highly recommended. I’m putting it on this weekend. Here are seven of our other favorite Hackman movies. </p></div></div><div><p>Richard Donner’s 1978 <em>Superman </em>is not only the first modern-day superhero blockbuster; it’s one of the few enduringly great superhero movies, and that’s due in large part to its ebullience. It’s just a fun, joyful movie, radiating classic comic-book enthusiasm and energy from start to finish. And Gene Hackman’s portrayal of Superman’s archnemesis Lex Luthor is an essential part of that. Here’s the key to Hackman’s version of Luthor: he really seems to be enjoying himself. He’s constantly delighted by his own evil ingenuity, explaining his nefarious schemes to Superman with obvious glee while Christopher Reeve, as the Man of Steel, looks on disapprovingly with that wholesome, Boy Scout stare of his. If anything, Hackman’s Luthor is only more fascinating today than ever, as so many of us feel the ways in which we’re at the mercy of oligarchs who view the world as their own personal plaything, something to be manipulated and destroyed for their gain, no matter the cost to millions of others. — Carolyn Petit</p><p><strong>Where to stream it:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.max.com/movies/superman-the-movie/de1897ac-3fff-48e7-98a1-9247f3a0e40b?utm_source=universal_search&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.max.com/movies/superman-the-movie/de1897ac-3fff-48e7-98a1-9247f3a0e40b?utm_source=universal_search" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Max</a></span></p></div><div><p>The 1970s are when Hackman established himself as not just a great actor but a movie star capable of carrying a film on his own, with acclaimed performances like his Oscar-winning turn in <em>The French Connection </em>and his legendary work as surveillance expert Henry Caul in Francis Ford Coppola’s <em>The Conversation</em>. But my favorite Hackman film from this period is <em>Night Moves</em>, a morally slippery, sun-dappled Hollywood neo-noir from <em>Bonnie and Clyde </em>director Arthur Penn. Hackman is at his most enjoyably complex here as Harry Moseby, a football player turned private eye who’s hired by an aging actress to find her missing teenage daughter Delly, played by Melanie Griffith. As his pursuit of Delly takes him into the shadowy underbelly of the film industry and beyond, Moseby is also coming apart at the seams due to problems in his marriage. Be warned, you won’t find a traditional whodunit and a conventionally satisfying conclusion here; <em>Night Moves </em>has other things on its mind. It’s a distinctly 1970s American film—disillusioned, ambiguous, rich with character and fantastic dialogue—and it demonstrates why Hackman was an ideal actor for this fascinating era in American cinema. — Carolyn Petit</p><p><strong>Where to stream it:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tcm.com/watchtcm/titles/84889&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tcm.com/watchtcm/titles/84889" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TCM</a></span></p></div><div><p><em>The Birdcage </em>is a ‘90s comedy starring Nathan Lane and Robin Williams as a gay couple in Miami who pretend to be straight to deceive a conservative senator in order to help their son who is trying to marry the politician’s daughter. It’s a very funny movie that feels ahead of its time in a lot of ways for how it depicts LGBTQ people.</p><p>And here’s how good Gene Hackman is at acting and being funny: He’s able to stand out and deliver a memorable performance in a movie starring Robin Williams and Nathan Lane. That’s impressive. So many other actors playing (literally) the straight man in a wacky comedy like <em>The Birdcage</em> would have disappeared and been overshadowed completely by the zany leads and their incredible onscreen chemistry. But not Hackman, who plays Republican senator Kevin Keely perfectly as a believably grumpy conservative who’s put into a very uncomfortable situation and comes out the other side somewhat changed. And Hackman’s comedic chops are on full display, especially in scenes featuring Lane. Track this one down and watch it ASAP.  — Zack Zwiezen</p><p><strong>Where to stream it:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Birdcage-Robin-Williams/dp/B004AZKI6W?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/gene-hackman-movies-stream-hoosiers-enemy-state-1851767152&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B004AZKI6W" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Prime Video</a></span></p></div><div><p>Few things in cinema are as pleasurable as seeing two towering actors butt heads in a film with a whip-smart script that gives their clash real stakes. The actors have never been better, and the stakes never higher, than they are in <em>Crimson Tide</em>, Tony Scott’s 1995 submarine-set pressure cooker in which a commanding officer (Hackman) and his executive officer (Denzel Washington) clash, with a potential nuclear crisis hanging in the balance. <em>Crimson Tide </em>is irresistibly compelling for so many reasons: the complexity of its lead performances, the circumstances that drive these men to collide, and the intelligence with which it engages with the nuclear threat. As Washington’s character puts it at one point, “In the nuclear world, the true enemy can’t be destroyed…in my humble opinion, in the nuclear world, the true enemy is war itself.” Hackman is pitch-perfect as the cigar-chomping human embodiment of the opposition to this idea, an old-school navy officer with the capacity to kick off World War III. — Carolyn Petit </p><p>  <strong>Where to stream it:</strong> Rent or buy it</p></div><div><p>I’m not a big sports movie guy, but I’m a big fan of <em>Hoosiers, </em>and a big reason for that is<em> </em>Gene Hackman’s powerful performance as high school basketball coach Norman Dale. What I particularly like about Hackman in <em>Hoosiers </em>is that he nails the power and ferocity that tough coaches in high school tend to have, but he never seems like a jerk. In fact, he’s someone you root for just as much as the team of misfits he’s leading. Even if you don’t watch basketball or like sports, check out <em>Hoosiers </em>to see Hackman doing what he does best and proving that he was one of the greats. — Zack Zwiezen</p><p><strong>Where to stream it: </strong>Rent or buy it </p></div><div><p>Will Smith in his prime opposite a seasoned, paranoid Gene Hackman made <em>Enemy of the State</em> an instant classic. Hackman has always felt like an old actor, but he rarely got to play one. <em>Enemy of the State </em>let him school an electric Smith on the emerging surveillance state with grizzled wisdom and curmudgeonly charm. Plus the movie’s MacGuffin is a digital camera recording wedged into a Game Boy, because all technology is fun and whimsical until it accidentally implicates you in a conspiratorial coverup. — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Where to stream it: </strong>Rent or buy it </p></div><div><p><em>The Royal Tenenbaums </em>isn’t director Wes Andersen’s best movie but it’s certainly his most watchable, possibly because Hackman forced him to make it that way. It was his third-to-last movie appearance and one of his most charismatic, letting him seamlessly shift between humor and drama, dry, sardonic line deliveries and heartfelt admissions that land like an ocean liner. Hackman r<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://nytimes.com/2025/02/28/movies/gene-hackman-royal-tenenbaums.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://nytimes.com/2025/02/28/movies/gene-hackman-royal-tenenbaums.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eportedly hated making the movie</a></span>, which probably made it all the better. — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Where to stream it: </strong>Rent or buy it<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Instead, it’s slowly built up a decently-sized library of first- and third-party retro games from across multiple console libraries. However, subscribers in Japan will be losing a retro game in March, even if they already downloaded it. </p><p>On February 27, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000023175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000023175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Japan quietly announced</a></span>  that Super Famicon game <em>Super Formation Soccer </em>will be removed from the Japan’s Nintendo Switch Online service on March 28.</p><p>Nintendo confirmed that even players who have already downloaded and installed the game on their Switch consoles will no longer be able to play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Soccer&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Soccer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">S<em>uper Formation Soccer</em></a></span> after March 28. </p><p>At the moment it appears that this title is only being removed from Nintendo Switch Online in Japan. In America the game was released as <em>Super Soccer </em>for the SNES. So far Nintendo hasn’t announced plans to remove this version from  NSO’s classic catalog over here. That might be because while <em>Super Formation Soccer </em>was published by Spike Chunsoft in Japan, worldwide the game was published by Nintendo. So it would appear that whatever deal was in place to license the game is expiring soon in Japan, but that deal likely doesn’t apply in regions where<em> Super Soccer </em>was published by Nintendo itself.</p><p>While I doubt there was a giant audience for <em>Super Soccer </em>on Nintendo Switch, it’s still bad news to see a game removed from the classic catalog. </p><p>Although games are removed from Game Pass and PS Plus all the time, people can still buy those games digitally. With Nintendo, these games are locked behind the NSO subscription service and once removed, you can no longer play them on Switch. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-virtual-console-switch-online-classic-retro-1851760770?_gl=1*1dotjpl*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDc3NjIzNy4yMTguMS4xNzQwNzc3NDIwLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-virtual-console-switch-online-classic-retro-1851760770?_gl=1*1dotjpl*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDc3NjIzNy4yMTguMS4xNzQwNzc3NDIwLjYwLjAuMA..">Just another good reason why Nintendo needs to bring back the Virtual Console for Switch 2</a></span>. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Games always ask you to calibrate this before playing by making you play a little watermark-balancing mini-game, but I found that baseline to be wildly over-tuned. Turning the first two brightness sliders all the way down and keeping the third slider where it would normally be helped up the contrast for me and cut down on the sludge graphics, at least a little bit. </p><h2 id="h735909"><a id=""></a>Juice that saturation on your display</h2><p>This setting isn’t in the game but specific to whatever display you’re using. I jacked up the saturation and contrast to try and bring out more definition and color and that also helped. Now, if you like <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>’ more washed-out look, then by all means embrace it. But these are two things you can do to help mitigate it if you choose. The game also looks way better overall <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ethangach/status/1895554770813010257&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1895554770813010257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">during the world’s daytime and when there aren’t storms</a></span>, so another hack is to just try to prioritize hunting during those times (unfortunately certain beasts only emerge when it’s ugly out). </p><h2 id="h735910"><a id=""></a>Turn off motion blur</h2><p>If you play a lot of games you probably instinctively do this already. If not, here’s your perennial reminder to toggle motion blur off so the game looks sharper and less blurry during combat. </p><h2 id="h735911"><a id=""></a>Turn on Felyne Language</h2><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> defaults to your Palico pals speaking in English, but you can change it so they speak in their native cat tongue instead. This way they’ll meow and purr at you during combat and exploration but you can still understand what they’re saying thanks to subtitles. It makes the experience much more immersive. Also yay cats!</p><h2 id="h735912"><a id=""></a>Boost the field of view</h2><p>Hunting monsters is hard when they’re taking up the whole screen and you can barely glimpse the read of the battlefield. You can dial back the camera to show you more of the world by bumping up the camera distance up. There are definitely times when it can be fun and cinematic to have things more zoomed in, but on the whole the wider lens helps a lot. </p><h2 id="h735913"><a id=""></a>Just say no to Seikret auto explore</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-tips-guides-items-pause-weapon-1851766658&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-tips-guides-items-pause-weapon-1851766658">The Seikret is amazing</a></span> but also loves to wonder off on its own when you don’t have a next objective selected. This default for the mount to auto explore the area can be turned off so you’re not constantly fighting it or confused if it’s actually taking you where you want to go or just randomly wandering around for no reason. </p><h2 id="h735914"><a id=""></a>Turn off some of the UI</h2><p>Exactly how immersive do you want to make <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>? That’s a question every player has to answer for themselves. Once you have the controls down pat, especially the quick commands, you can get away with very little onscreen help. But in the beginning I recommend at the very least turning off the control scheme help in the top right corner. You’d think it would disappear on its own after the tutorial but it doesn’t. Once you have your radial dial commands figured out, you can turn the item bag bar off too. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
