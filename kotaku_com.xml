            <link>https://kotaku.com/lgs-32-inch-4k-monitor-priced-like-a-no-name-monitor-black-friday-got-here-early-2000644001</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lg%E2%80%99s-32-inch-4k-monitor-priced-like-a-no-name-monitor-black-friday-got-here-early.1352683/</guid>

              <p>Buying a quality monitor usually means choosing between paying premium prices for trusted brands or gambling on unknown manufacturers that might deliver terrible color accuracy and dead pixels. LG stands as one of the most prestigious names in display technology and finding their products at bargain prices rarely happens outside of major sales events.</p>
<p>Amazon just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5563/">launched an early Black Friday deal that brings the LG 32UR500K-B down to $199, slashed from its usual $299</a>. This record-low pricing puts a<strong> 32-inch 4K UHD monitor</strong> from a reputable manufacturer at the same cost as generic no-name displays that flood the market with questionable quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5563/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Display Quality That Justifies the LG Name</h2>
<p>The <strong>32-inch 4K UHD display lets you experience 3840 by 2160 resolution</strong> that reproduces sharp text and detailed images across the whole screen. This kind of pixel density means you can see fine details in photos, read small text without zooming and enjoy crisp lines in spreadsheets or design work. The panel expresses up to <strong>90% of the DCI-P3 color gamut</strong> – that’s the cinema-grade color space used in professional content creation and high-end displays. You’re seeing colors that match what directors and designers intended rather than the washed-out or oversaturated visuals that come from cheaper monitors that have poor color reproduction.</p>



<p>HDR10 support elevates compatible content by expanding the range <strong>between darkest blacks and brightest whites</strong>. HDR takes advantage of the ability to create realistic lighting and shadow details in modern games, 4K video content, and streaming services that are impossible on flat SDR content. You’ll notice the dramatic visual immersion when watching HDR movies or playing supported games.</p>



<p><strong>Built-in stereo speakers</strong> with <em>Waves MaxxAudio</em> save desk space and eliminate the need for separate speakers if you’re using a minimalist setup. The audio quality is also quite a step above the tinny sound most monitor speakers produce; it’s big and bold, making movies and games actually enjoyable without headphones. For video calls or casual consumption of content, this solution works perfectly.</p>
<p><em>OnScreen Control</em> software gives quick access to monitor settings <strong>without having to fumble around with physical buttons</strong> on the back of the display. You are able to split your screen into different zones for multitasking, tune brightness and contrast with mouse clicks, and switch between preset modes optimized for different tasks.</p>
<p>The <strong>ergonomic stand allows for tilt adjustment that lets you angle the screen to match your eye level and viewing position.</strong> Proper monitor positioning reduces neck strain during long sessions of work and prevents glare from overhead lights or windows. The borderless design maximizes screen real estate while creating a modern aesthetic that looks clean on any desk.</p>
<p>Multiple connectivity options include<strong> two HDMI ports and one DisplayPort</strong> for flexibility in hooking up gaming consoles, PCs, or laptops or media devices all at the same time. You can also easily switch inputs to avoid constantly plugging and unplugging cables, which is a plus if you use the monitor with multiple systems.</p>
<p>At $199, you’re paying what generic 32-inch 4K monitors cost while getting LG’s established reputation for reliability.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you want to play the latest AAA titles with immersive visuals, or work on heavy creative projects like 4K editing or 3D rendering without pushing your machine to its limit, investing in a dedicated gaming laptop makes a lot of sense. The best options out there, however, don’t usually come cheap. In fact, those packed with next-gen internals and high-end specs often run well over $3,000. Thankfully, that changes today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5553/">Amazon has dropped the price of the Asus TUF F16 Gaming Laptop to $2,200. That’s after a massive 46% discount off its original MSRP</a>. It’s highly rated on the platform, and this early Black Friday deal is offering the perfect opportunity to snag it up without paying the full price. Best of all, the laptop comes with a bunch of free accessories that are sure to improve your gaming experience even further.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5553/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Run All Your Favorite Titles, or Push Creative Boundaries</h2>
<p>Starting off with the power; you’re getting the Intel Core i7-14650HX processor inside, which is capable of delivering turbo speeds up to 5.2GHz across 16 cores and 24 threads. You can trust it to not flinch even when you’re working on multiple resource-intensive tasks or gaming for long.</p>
<p>The processor is paired with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 GPU (8GB GDDR7). It’s much more powerful than the RTX 4070 generation, and you can expect smoother performance with advanced ray tracing and DLSS 4, even for the upcoming games. There’s a whopping 64GB of DDR5 RAM (5600MHz) to help you multitask during your busy days with ease. This is more than enough to use a bunch of applications at the same time, have multiple tabs open simultaneously, streaming while gaming; all without slowing down.</p>



<p>Then you have a 4TB SSD that’s not just big; it’s massive. You’ll have enough space to keep all your favorite titles, media content, and work documents in a single place. Future downloads will be covered, too!</p>
<p>As for the display, the laptop flaunts its 16-inch FHD+ panel (1920 x 1200) with a 165Hz refresh rate and 16:10 aspect ratio. There’s support for NVIDIA G-SYNC and Adaptive-Sync for an even more immersive experience that pulls you into action. The machine is also quite sturdy and comes with a built-in cooling technology that keeps the temperature in check as you work or play.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5553/">The free accessory kit includes Windows 11 Pro (pre-installed), data cable organizers (6-pack), a gaming mouse, and an RGB mechanical feel gaming keyboard.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-animal-crossing-switch-2-nintendo-direct-2000625331"><i><span> Pokopia</span></i></a><span> is making a play for the cozy game market next year by giving us what is essentially an </span><i><span>Animal Crossing </span></i><span>game in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe. You play as a Ditto that transforms into a human and attempts to spruce up an island until it’s a suitable community for Pokémon. Most of these monsters look the same as they ever have, but in a new trailer, we learned the game will introduce new forms for some old Pokémon, including a white Pikachu that’s never been in the main games.</span></p> <p><span>This news came as part of an extended </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>trailer that gave fans an overview of how Ditto will work with its growing Pokémon community to create a new home for them on an abandoned island. Some of the big announcements included that Ditto can transform into other Pokémon like Lapras and Dragonite to get around the island faster, the citizens of your island will give you quests that seem to fill out the mysteries of the island, and through Gameshare you can play cooperatively with others, even across Switch console generations, without each person having to own the game.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But perhaps most excitingly, throughout the trailer we saw a few new forms for monsters like a moss-covered Snorlax, a graying Tangrowth that acts as the game’s Professor, a paint-covered Smeargle, and most mysteriously, a white PIkachu that is shown powering up the street lights on the island.</span></p>  <p><span>This pale, droopy-eared Pikachu is called Peakychu. It’s a female Pikachu, as you can see from her heart-shaped tail, but why does she look like she’s ill? We don’t know yet, but I want to help her however I can. Coincidentally, there was </span><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_unused_Pok%C3%A9mon_and_character_designs#White_Pichu"><span>supposed to be a White Pichu</span></a><span> in </span><i><span>HeartGold </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>SoulSilver</span></i><span>, but it was scrapped in favor of the spiky-eared variant that made it into the RPGs as an event giveaway. Given that some of these monsters’ standard forms are probably recruitable villagers, it’s good that the actual characters have some defining features. I wouldn’t be surprised if these variants end up in games like </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span> or the RPGs as a bit of cross-promotion. At the very least, </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>seems to have some intriguing mysteries happening alongside all the town management. We’ll find out more about Peakychu and these other forms when </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>launches on March 5.</span></p>
