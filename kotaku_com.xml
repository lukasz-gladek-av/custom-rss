From the few early critic previews of the film floating around, we know that anyone even remotely interested in <em>The Wonderful Wizard of Oz</em>, or the theater production in general, will find themselves in for a treat. They’re calling it a “masterpiece” and a “marvel.”</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Wicked </em>tells the story of Elphaba, known as the Wicked Witch of the West, and Glinda, the Good Witch, in their earliest days as college students at Shiz University in the Land of Oz. With her unusual green skin and lack of understanding regarding her unique powers, Elphaba becomes the target of hostilities. However, an unlikely friendship between Elphaba and Glinda forms before the two encounter a crossroads that will alter their destinies and change the landscape of Oz forever.<br></p><p>Over on IMDB, <em>Wicked </em>is slowly dropping in popularity, though it’s still in the top 50 upcoming releases, making it a top choice for the fall season. On Rotten Tomatoes, it’s too early to tell. No official critic or fan reviews are available, leaving the film’s rating unavailable.<br></p><p>From director Jon M Chu (<em>Crazy Rich Asians</em> and <em>In The Heights</em>) and starring Cynthia Erivo (<em>Bad Times at the El Royale</em>), Ariana Grande (<em>Don’t Look Up</em>), and Jeff Goldblum (<em>Jurassic World Dominion</em>), <em>Wicked </em>officially hits theaters on Friday, November 22. It’s a musical fantasy adventure with a runtime of two hours and 40 minutes, making it somewhat challenging for those with young children who can’t sit still in the theater.<br></p><p>Whether you’ll have a kid with you or not, some early previews of <em>Wicked</em> indicate childlike wonder awaits at the theater:<br></p><p>Variety, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/katcystephan/status/1851655301659042111&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/katcystephan/status/1851655301659042111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Katcy Stephan</a></span>:<br></p><p>“I was ‘pessimistical’ going in, but...WICKED is a masterpiece. Ariana Grande makes Glinda sparkle: she milks every moment with gusto, humor and hair flips. Jon M. Chu added so much new life to the story that I can see why it needed to be 2 parts! Well worth the 20-year wait.”<br></p><p>Vanity Fair, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/christress/status/1851668671518867629&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/christress/status/1851668671518867629" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chris Murphy</a></span>:<br></p><p>“I have seen the Wicked movie not once not twice but three separate times now and believe me when i say it is a complete and utter slay you will be gagged beyond belief. Everything you think the film looks like from your cracked iphones is wrong. Cynthia and Ari truly are impeccable.”</p><p>We Live Entertainment, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ScottDMenzel/status/1851678132614672477&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ScottDMenzel/status/1851678132614672477" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Scott Menzel</a></span>:<br></p><p>“Wicked is a cinematic spectacle that serves as one of the very best big screen adaptations of a Broadway musical ever. Jon M. Chu perfectly captures the magic of the Broadway show while adding in some of his own unique flourishes to the source material. Ariana Grande and Cynthia Erivo completely knock it out of the park as Elphaba and Galinda. Jonathan Bailey is also quite phenomenal in the film. Wicked lives up to the hype and often succeeds it. Oh, and there is one scene that fans of the Broadway show are going to absolutely lose their minds over. Wicked is hands down one of the year’s best films.”<br></p><p>WBAL-TV, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DCfilmgirl/status/1851672802534834295&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DCfilmgirl/status/1851672802534834295" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren Veneziani</a></span>:<br></p><p>“One of the most perfect musical adaptions to ever exist. 💚💗 #WickedMovie exceeded my expectations. Cynthia Erivo &amp; Ariana Grande are a match made in cinematic musical heaven, one dance scene in particular had me so emotional. Wow. Can’t wait to see it again! It’s the Shiz!!”<br></p><p>The Wrap, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DrewTailored/status/1851675076124643422&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DrewTailored/status/1851675076124643422" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Drew Taylor</a></span>:<br></p><p>“#Wicked is solid — sumptuously realized, occasionally quite moving (both leads are amazing). But it also falls into some of the traps of the Disney live-action remakes that diminishes its power — overlong, noisy, over-designed. Overall I liked it a lot and can’t wait for part 2🧹.”<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
