Remember, publishers and other companies are going to pass the cost of tariffs onto consumers. “What a mess,” added Piscatella.</p><p>And if you’re thinking, “Well, I’ll just buy games digitally to avoid the price increase,” that might not be possible. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3lgb3euyyik2e&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3lgb3euyyik2e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As pointed out by Piscatella last year</a></span>, publishers would either raise prices on digital games to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgb3il5nws2e&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lgb3il5nws2e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reach parity with the higher cost of physical games</a></span> or, as mentioned already, simply give up entirely on producing and sell discs.

On March 4, a day after the Trump administration’s tariff against China became active, Ahmad posted that, despite some mitigation efforts, 75 percent of consoles are produced and imported from China. These consoles will be hit by the tariffs and will likely cost more to buy in the United States. It’s also likely that fewer will be produced, which could lead to supply shortages.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901">As we reported in January</a></span>, the president’s tariffs could see the price of consoles jump dramatically. A Switch could potentially go from $300 to $400. A PS5 Pro could see its price leap from $700 to $1000. And the Switch 2 could be slapped with a higher-than-expected price tag due to the ongoing tariffs, making a console that was potentially already going to be hard to buy in its first year even trickier and more expensive to obtain.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And, in a series first, it comes with a mode that removes many choices, instead adhering to one “canonical” narrative path. Now Ubisoft has explained why this option was added and also clarified that you’ll still be free to kiss whoever you want even if you pick the Canon Mode. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,195776,196165" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-always-online-steam-deck-ubi-connect-1851767074&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-always-online-steam-deck-ubi-connect-1851767074"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a></span>, set in feudal Japan and starring two very different protagonists, launches later this month. When fans boot it up, they’ll have an ironic choice to make: During your playthrough, do you want to make choices or not? You can play <em>Shadows </em>like most RPGs, choosing what to say to certain people to affect the outcome of a questline or story arc. Or you can choose Canon Mode, which removes such choices and tells a set story created by Ubisoft. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-canon-mode-1851719396&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-canon-mode-1851719396">But why is this previously confirmed Canon Mode</a></span> even in the game? Well, Ubisoft says it’s because of fan “disappointment” over the way all the dialogue options in games like<em> Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</em> and <em>Valhalla </em>prevented the creation of a single “canonical” record of how those stories played out.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-canon-mode-creation-why/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-canon-mode-creation-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a recent interview with <em>Gamerant</em></a></span>, creative director Jonathan Dumont talked about the Canon Mode in <em>Shadows</em>. According to him, while many fans have loved the RPG choices in recent <em>AC </em>games, others missed the fact that there was no longer a single, agreed-upon metanarrative. </p><p>  “When we introduced a choice of characters and dialogue choices in <em>AC Odyssey</em>, many of our fans loved the idea, but some expressed their disappointment in not having a definitive and canon narrative for the game that could be embedded in the <em>AC</em> lore meta story, “ said Dumont. </p><p>“After speaking with our fans during development, we decided to add a mode that takes out all the choices for <em>Shadows </em>and that can serve as a reference story within the franchise. This way players can enjoy the more RPG style of narrative or a more linear one, if they prefer.” </p><p>It’s yet another example of how Ubisoft is extremely focused on ensuring that both old school <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>fans—who prefer linearity and stealth—and newer fans—who prefer RPG-flavored open-world action—are happy when they play <em>Shadows</em>. </p><p>For those who crave a more traditional <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> experience, you can turn on instant assassinations,  play almost entirely as classic assassin Naoe, and  turn off all dialogue choices, too. On the flip side, you can play the game like <em>Valhalla </em>and mostly fight your way through crowds of enemies with big swords while making hard decisions. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-4-hour-preview-hands-on-review-1851745403&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-4-hour-preview-hands-on-review-1851745403">As I experienced in my preview with the game earlier this year</a></span>, <em>Shadows </em>truly feels like an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> designed from the ground up to make all fans happy. </p><p>However, regardless of whether you play in canon mode or not, Ubisoft will let you romance and kiss any romanceable character you desire. This was confirmed by associate narrative director Brooke Davies while speaking to <em>Gamerant</em>. </p><p> “Because Naoe and Yasuke are different people, they each have unique romance possibilities and connections,” said Davies. “None of our love stories is canon, so players can choose for themselves who—or who not—to pursue.” </p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 20. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
