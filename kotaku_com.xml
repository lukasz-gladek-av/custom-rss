            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Pokémon FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> are finally on Switch, bringing a taste of the series’ retro roots to a modern platform for <em>Pokémon</em>‘s 30th anniversary. Millions of fans and newcomers are downloading the game to start a brand new adventure in the Kanto region. They’ll all be faced with the same timelessly perplexing choice: Which starter Pokémon is the best to pick?</p>

 <p>Bulbasaur, Charmander, or Squirtle—who should lead your team to catch ’em all and defeat the Elite Four? The answer is whichever one you personally like best. The point of playing <em>Pokémon FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> is to have fun, not to Excel-spreadsheet the hell out of decade-old Game Boy Advance games. But even so, there may be a little gnawing voice of doubt in the back of your head convincing you listen to something other than your heart. If that’s the case, here’s my advice for which starter to pick. Let’s quickly go through the three choices.</p> <h2>Bulbasaur</h2> <p>The poison grass-type is tough as nails and not easily downed. Bulbasaur evolves into Ivysaur at level 16 and Venusaur at level 32. That’s four levels earlier than the other starters for the final transformation. Bulbasaur is also great against the first two gym leaders, Brock and Misty, both of whom field teams weak to grass-types. What Ivysaur and Venusaur lack in speed and raw attack power, they make up for with high HP and tons of status ailment attacks that can win almost any war of attrition.</p> <p>Sleep Powder is boring but effective in a wide array of match-ups, especially when combined with Leech Seed and Solar Beam. Paired with Giga Drain and Sludge Bomb, it’s a great choice for the master tactician.</p>

 <h2>Charmander</h2> <p>The fire-type has always been a favorite due to the fact that it’s the most badass. Charmander evolves into Charmeleon at level 16 and Charizard at level 36, the last of which&nbsp; is also a flying-type. That extra versatility also brings with it some added vulnerability, but Charizard is great in the late game for quickly sweeping most opponents from the field. Charmander, on the other hand, struggles in the early game, especially against the first couple of Gyms. It does have Metal Claw, however, which can get it past Brock’s rock-types.</p>

 <p>Flame Thrower and Slash are great meat-and-potatoes attacks. Later on you can teach it Earthquake to add another devastating move to its arsenal. Fire Spin and Toxic also pair nicely for cutting off oxygen, even against opponents with a match-up edge.</p> <h2>Squirtle</h2> <p>The water-type is the cutest and has a lot of versatility early on and in the later stages of the game. Squirtle evolves into Wartortle at level 16 and Blastoise at level 36. It’s decently easy to train and has no problem against Brock. Plus Squirtle has the best defense throughout the game, though it struggles around Gyms three and four. It can learn Bubble Beam from Misty though which gives it an early go to special attack for the first half of the game.</p>

 <p>Hydro Pump and Skull Bash are powerful late-game attacks, and Blastoise also benefits from being able to learn moves like Ice Beam and Blizzard to make short work of dragon-types. It’s a nice compromise between the glass cannon offense of Charizard and the slow, situational effectiveness of Venusaur.</p> <h2 id="which-starter-should-i-pick-in-pok-eacute-mon-firered-and-leafgreen">Okay but for real: Which starter should I choose in <em>Pokémon FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em>?</h2> <p>My final answer is: Bulbasaur. It has great survivability and provides lots of options to go with any team you want to build. The early game, up through Surge, is super easy and you have plenty of time to train up the rest of your squad by the time you get to a grass-type showdown in Celadon City. Another thing Bulbasaur has going for it is that there’s really not any other great grass types. Starmie is a great water-type substitute for Blastoise, and Arcanine is a great fire-type substitute for Charizard. Plus, Sleep Powder is a big boon when it comes to capturing other Pokémon on your journey.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Polymarket Bravely Defends Betting On World War 3 As A Valuable Public Service]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/polymarket-ww3-bomb-iran-trum-prediction-market-2000674772</link>
            <guid>1449646</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>In the early hours of February 28th, the U.S. and Israeli military began an unprovoked air strike against Iran after weeks of tense posturing. Sources indicate these plans had been in development for months, despite occurring in the middle of nuclear deal negotiations to replace the one Donald Trump tore up in 2017. Civilian death tolls continue to rise and the scope of this grotesquery has yet to reveal itself. But if you put your chips on the right Polymarket page, you’re in the money.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>As a new, unfathomable war in the Middle East emerges, Polymarket betters are hoping to fathom enough for a jackpot. The gambling platform, which lets you bet anonymously on anything from basketball games to bombing campaigns, has been an unending source of controversy. Justifying letting the world wager on mass death, Polymarket claims they also act as a public service, an “unbiased forecast” for people to rely on.</span></p> <p><span>At the top of the betting pages regarding Iran, Polymarket has posted an editorial note:&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“The promise of prediction markets is to harness the wisdom of the crowd to create accurate, unbiased forecasts for the most important events to society,” says Polymarket. “That ability is particularly invaluable in gut-wrenching times like today. After discussing with those directly affected by the attacks, who had dozens of questions, we realized that prediction markets could give them the answers they needed in ways TV news and 𝕏 could not.”</span></p>   <p><span>It goes without saying that the people who are eagerly wagering on human suffering are, in fact, very biased. The site naturally attracts a certain set of online person, whose sway or skin in the game do not reflect reality. Even if </span><a href="https://www.newsweek.com/canada-election-odds-mark-carney-pierre-poilievre-2064930"><i><span>Newsweek </span></i><span>believes the gambler’s instinct</span></a><span> on matters like the 2025 Canadian federal election, the Pierre Poilievre–sympathetic crowd did not prevent him from not only failing to become the prime minister, but even from failing to hold on to his own seat in parliament. To spell things out even&nbsp; more clearly, Polymarket betters were in revolt after wagers on whether </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/openai-says-hell-yea-to-to-helping-government-with-fully-autonomous-weapons-as-trump-bombs-more-countries-2000674755"><span>Sam Altman</span></a><span> or Elon Musk would be crowned </span><i><span>TIME</span></i><span>’s Person of the Year award </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/time-person-of-the-year-ai-musk-altman-kalshi-bet-lost-millions-angry-2000652622"><span>lost on a technicality</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>While know-nothings are unreliable sources, the other obvious issue with platforms like Polymarket are gamblers who know </span><span>too</span><span> much. Since the trend emerged, professional sports leagues are struggling to keep up with online betting scandals, </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/08/29/nx-s1-5517979/unpacking-the-scandal-around-baseball-player-shohei-ohtani-and-his-interpreter"><span>such as Shohei Ohtani wagering on, uh, himself</span></a><span>. Only a few days ago MrBeast video editor Artem Kaptur was fined by the gambling platform Kalshi </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-editor-insider-trading-kalshi-artem-kaptur-2000674023"><span>for a winning streak based around his own workplace</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>If you think there would be stricter security around matters of immense global importance, you just lost another bet. Last June, when Israel previously fired missiles towards Iran, several high-stakes bets from first-time users were placed around the bombing campaign. </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/ng-interactive/2026/jan/30/polymarket-prediction-markets-betting"><span><em>The Guardian</em> believes these bets were made by people in the know</span></a><span>, capable of predicting these horrors with insider information.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The proliferation of betting is bad enough, but the potential for anonymous betting on sites like Polymarket raises insidious stakes. Bets placed on the attacks against Iran have already swelled up on the site’s front page, pushing the evergreen “Will the US confirm that aliens exist?” thread to the fifth row. The existing financial incentives to unleash war on the Middle East, from weapons manufacturing in the U.K. to resource grabbing in the region, are a revolting reality. Giving anonymous high rollers even more windfall is insane. The only thing predictable hereon is suffering.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Markiplier Warns Hollywood Against Ignoring YouTubers After His $50 Million Horror Hit Iron Lung]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/markiplier-iron-lung-hollywood-youtube-horror-2000674769</link>
            <guid>1449631</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Mark Fischbach, better known as Markiplier, is one of the most successful, long-running YouTubers in the field. His turn behind the camera has yielded similar success, as he directed and starred in the feature film adaptation of the horror game </span><i><span>Iron Lung</span></i><span>. The film has netted $50 million on a roughly $4 million budget, competing with studio offerings on a legitimately grassroots distribution campaign. Fischbach now warns Hollywood to ignore fellow YouTubers at its peril.</span></p>

 <p><span>“At least a lot of Hollywood was willfully ignoring the potential of YouTubers here,” Fischbach told the Lemonade Stand podcast (via </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/markiplier-says-hollywood-was-willfully-ignoring-the-potential-of-youtubers-before-his-film-iron-lung-made-usd50-million-at-the-box-office/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span>). “There is that level of respect that I just haven’t met yet.”</span></p> <p><span>Fischbach has been posting videos since 2012. Best known for let’s plays of horror games like </span><i><span>Five Nights at Freddy’s</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Amnesia</span></i><span>, he has not </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/youtube-mrbeast-networth-pewdiepie-net-worth-subscriber-1849784966"><span>faltered in popularity</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pewdiepie-rescinds-50-000-pledge-to-jewish-charity-aft-1838070628"><span>spiraled out</span></a><span> like many of his contemporaries. In 2023, he stated his intention to write, direct, star and distribute a film based on David Szymanski’s game </span><i><span>Iron Lung</span></i><span>, in which the player pilots a claustrophobic, windowless submarine in a deep ocean of blood. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>“They said it shouldn’t be done. Not that it couldn’t be done,” </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/markiplier-iron-lung-theatrical-release-date-1236599072/"><span>Fischbach told </span><i><span>Variety</span></i></a><span>. “People have made movies before, just that it would be ‘woefully unwise’ to tackle writing, directing, acting and editing a movie myself.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Unassuming, independent films have stunned the box office in the past. With a leaner budget and a mighty return, </span><i><span>Iron Lung</span></i><span> joins the ranks of hits like 2002’s </span><i><span>My Big Fat Greek Wedding</span></i><span>, the independent Canadian comedy that twisted a $5 million budget into a nearly $400 million box office haul. One of the films </span><i><span>Iron Lung</span></i><span> competed against was </span><i><span>Send Help</span></i><span>, the latest gross-out thriller from Sam Raimi, who stormed Hollywood with his own shoestring 1981 horror classic </span><i><span>The Evil Dead</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>But what seems to stick in the paw of YouTubers like Fischbach isn’t commercial success. In all likelihood, content creators at his level make more money than most working Hollywood directors. It’s the more elusive prestige factor that haunts them. </span></p>

 <p><span>The umbrage is reminiscent of that expressed by Kevin Perjurer (aka Defunctland), who dovetails his </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b_rjBWmc1iQ"><span>very good video about unaccredited TV jingle composers</span></a><span> with a grievance about online documentaries not holding the same space as conventionally produced ones. Given that the documentary space largely filters towards Netflix true-crime specials, I wonder if these creators are agonizing for a status that rarely exists for anyone, even within the current system.</span></p>

 <p><span>Additionally, it may have been the case in 2023, but Hollywood studios do not seem to be ignoring YouTubers anymore. In 2025, NEON released </span><i><span>Shelby Oaks</span></i><span>, a horror film from YouTuber Chris Stuckmann, though the film’s impression on critics and the box office was far more modest. </span></p> <p><span>Elsewhere, A24 recently unveiled the trailer for </span><i><span>The Backrooms</span></i><span>, a big-screen adaptation of the liminal YouTube phenomenon, helmed by 20-year old Kane Parsons, who’s responsible for the viral videos. I have also been told in private conversations that online hitmakers are optioned by Hollywood pretty frequently for their creations, but that they often die on the vine before reaching the public.</span></p>

 <p><span>For his film, Fischbach says he’d hesitate adapting another video game, preferring not to pigeonhole himself like </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> helm and ultimate wife guy </span><a href="https://postgame.substack.com/p/the-resident-evil-auteur-in-his-own"><span>Paul W.S. Anderson</span></a><span>. Less surprisingly, Fischbach added that studio reception to him has changed since </span><i><span>Iron Lung</span></i><span>’s success, saying he’s already met with executives, though they largely just want to know how he pulled it off. “They’re all asking me the same thing,” says Fischbach. “’How’d you do it? How’d you do it?’”</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-30th-anniversary-pikachu-plush-scalpers-2000674775</link>
            <guid>1449628</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>February 27th marked <em>Pokémon</em>’s 30th birthday, and The Pokémon Company revealed a bunch of new merch to mark the occasion, including a black and white, original </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-30-anniversary-merchandise-pikachu-plush-charms-2000674009"><span>Game Boy-inspired Pikachu plush</span></a><span>. The rush to grab one of these limited-time exclusive plushies hit one particular Poké Center in Japan particularly hard, though, with one onlooker describing the chaos as “total war.”</span></p>

 <p><span>User aeroflotlove shared a video of the commotion at the Tokyo Bay Poké Center on </span><a href="https://x.com/aeroflotlove/status/2027568670860578884?s=20"><span>X</span></a><span>, along with their account of the ensuing panicked attempts to snag the limited-edition stuffed Pikachu (machine translated from Japanese). “There were no tickets or lines, so I turned around at 10 a.m., and there was a lot of people rushing into the store from all the entrances, pushing each other, fighting, screaming, children crying because they were being hit by other customers, it was total war.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">ポケセントーキョーベイ、整理券も整列もないとこだったので10時によーいどん、あちこちの入口から大量の人がダッシュで店内にすごい勢いで入ってきて押し合いやら喧嘩やら叫び声聞こえる、子供が他の客にたたかれて泣いてるなど戦争だった💦… <a href="https://t.co/Br7rM9tIZN">pic.twitter.com/Br7rM9tIZN</a></p> <p>— まゆ@⚡️o'ᆺ'o⚡️2026今年も宜しく (@aeroflotlove) <a href="https://twitter.com/aeroflotlove/status/2027568670860578884?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 28, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Chris Explorer, a content creator living in Japan, captured </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DVSNjzGiWlk/"><span>a different angle</span></a><span> of the bedlam from outside the Tokyo Bay store. The worker shouting at shoppers through a megaphone really adds an extra layer of pandemonium to the whole affair. It seems the Tokyo Bay Poké Center wasn’t the only location hit by swarms of Pikachu-crazed fans, though, as users on X have stated that both the </span><a href="https://x.com/carduus06/status/2027656219771736295?s=20"><span>Yokohama</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://x.com/Mypoke_501/status/2027670710769119549?s=20"><span>Osaka</span></a><span> Poké Centers had a rough go of things as well.</span></p>   <p><span>Several posts online have blamed the ongoing <em>Pokémon</em> scalping epidemic for the desperate scenes. However, if that is true, fans can take solace in the fact that, less than 24 hours later, </span><a href="https://x.com/pokemoncenterPR/status/2027584536473739336?s=20"><span>The Pokémon Company announced</span></a><span> that the monochrome Pikachu plushie will be available to order through their website in the near future.</span></p>

 <p><span>In fact, several <em>Pokémon</em> card shops in Japan have reported going out of business due to lower-than-normal demand in the past year, leading to speculation that the scalping-fueled ‘Mon bubble </span><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-cards-are-finally-becoming-accessible-to-kids-again-as-japans-speculative-bubble-collapses/"><span>is set to pop</span></a><span>. Hopefully that’s still the case, and the 30th anniversary chaos is just an outlier caused by the celebrations, because I’d like to be able to order <em>Pokémon</em> cards without having to rely on a Discord stock alert server in the near future.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>This week has been jam-packed with game anniversaries: </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-marriage-candidates-new-update-1-7-qi-2000674093"><i><span>Stardew Valley </span></i><span>turned 10</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-day-30-anniversary-go-anime-cosplay-stream-2000672824"><span>Pokémon turned 30</span></a><span>, and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> turned 40 — though nobody would blame you if you missed that last one. Zelda’s anniversary earlier this week was met with little fanfare; no new games or remakes were announced, nor any news on the upcoming live-action movie. All we got were some </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-mostly-ignored-the-legend-of-zeldas-40th-anniversary-but-heres-some-toy-versions-of-classic-weapons"><span>miniature weapon replicas</span></a><span>, and even those are only available in select stores in Japan.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Since Nintendo is apparently too busy </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-30-anniversary-stream-recap-winds-waves-2000674383"><span>celebrating Pokémon</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-zelda-turns-40-voice-actress-patricia-summersett-reveals-hopes-for-the-future-and-clarifies-her-thoughts-on-link-and-zeldas-gorgeous-relationship"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span> has taken up the mantle of honoring the legendary Zelda franchise through an interview with Zelda’s voice actress, Patricia Summersett.</span></p> <p><span>Summersett is a lifelong fan of the Zelda series and has been the voice of Princess Zelda for a decade. She starred in both </span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Tears of the Kingdom</span></i><span>, plus the spinoffs </span><i><span>Age of Calamity</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Age of Imprisonment</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>Inside the Casting for Princess Zelda</h2> <p><span>When asked about the auditioning process, Summersett says that she had no idea she was going for the role of Princess Zelda: “The best way to describe it was as a bleached script, which is when you have a certain amount of information about what the archetypes of the character are, the general world — for example, that it looks like an RPG fantasy — but you have no idea what the actual roles are going to be or what the game is. And there would’ve been no way of predicting that it was Zelda because she didn’t have a voice before. I just would never have assumed that was the game that I was auditioning for.”</span></p> <p><span>Summersett also explains that Zelda’s British accent wasn’t a note from Nintendo, but a choice inspired by Summersett’s schooling in London and Zelda’s royalty status. “It’s a little more comfortable to say this is a Hylian accent versus just a particular version of a UK accent,” she says.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>Thoughts on the Live-Action Movie</h2> <p><span>About the upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-live-action-movie-link-bragason-ainsworth-leak-2000644816"><span>live-action Zelda adaptation</span></a><span>, Summersett says, “Obviously Bo Bragason is going to kill it, she’s going to be amazing. I’m happy to have contributed in any way, without knowing where it’s all headed, other than the fact that it’s now been 10 years. I’m just floored by the fact I’ve been involved in this franchise for a quarter of it.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Obviously [the movie] is going to be a large collaboration between people who are new to the series and those deeply schooled in the series. [I think] you’re going to see a strong Zelda. I’m sure you’re going to see a powerful lead character in Zelda. And Link I have no idea, is he going to speak? They certainly haven’t alluded to the fact that he does, yet.”</span></p> <h2>So, Are Link and Zelda Officially Dating? (No)</h2> <p><span>Previously, Summersett shared her personal thoughts on the nature of Link and Zelda’s relationship, which were then </span><a href="https://x.com/Summersett_/status/1660658772824530944"><span>misconstrued</span></a><span> in a popular article. “I have all sorts of personal theories about what [their relationship] might be, but I think there’s something beautiful in the way that it’s left ambiguous, it’s left in a kind of — if there are romantic undertones, it’s left in an unrequited state. There’s obviously a deep friendship and a protectorship between the two of them. It’s a gorgeous relationship and it continues to evolve and be left open in so many iterations of this.</span></p>

 <p><span>“And what that means for me, as somebody who represents the character at things like conventions, is that anybody can come up to me with their version of what they think Link and Zelda are. And a lot of it comes in the form of coupleship — people proposing to each other and getting engaged with Zelda as a theme, or they feel like it’s something that they want to just celebrate with family or friends. It can mean kind of anything, and I love that it lives in that space.”</span></p> <h2>Summersett is a Bigger <em>Legend of Zelda</em> Fan than You</h2> <p><span>When asked about her favorite Zelda games, she says, “I am partial to </span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span>, but </span><i><span>Ocarina of Time</span></i><span> is really the ground zero of what the series means for me. And then maybe I’d say the original, though I was a child watching other people play that. And then I really liked </span><i><span>Twilight Princess</span></i><span> as well, just the art style of that one. So those are probably the top three.”</span></p> <p><span>“I see a lot of cosplay from</span><i><span> Twilight Princess</span></i><span> at conventions, and I also write in </span><i><span>Twilight Princess</span></i><span> Hylian, so I feel a little more connected to that game when I’m writing that in notes to people.”</span></p>

 <p><span>You read that right — Summersett can write in </span><i><span>Twilight Princess</span></i><span> Hylian! “It’s something I did early on when I was recording [</span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span>] and I was just starting to look through [series companion book] </span><i><span>Hyrule Historia</span></i><span> at the different versions of the languages from all the previous games. Obviously, </span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span> wasn’t out yet, so I didn’t know what would be in that game. But I saw </span><i><span>Twilight Princess</span></i><span> Hylian and it’s so beautiful. I thought I could probably learn those characters, which is essentially just the alphabet, and started practicing that over coffee. So now I can kind of write fluently and use it all the time.”</span></p>
