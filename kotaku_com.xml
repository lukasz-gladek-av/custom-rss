              <p>The theatrical version of <em>Star Wars: A New Hope,</em> released as just <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-and-worst-parts-of-every-star-wars-movie-1850406311"><em>Star Wars</em></a> back in 1977, is seemingly being restored in 4k by Disney for a future release, according to new leaks. This version of George Lucas’ sci-fi blockbuster hasn’t been officially released by Lucasfilm since 2006, and that was a crappy transfer from a Laserdisc.</p> <p>Over the last few months, rumors and leaks have been circulating online about Disney working on a remastered and fully restored version of<em> Star Wars</em>. Then, recently, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ysOeFio">video clips surfaced</a> of this not-yet-officially-announced 4K restoration of the theatrical version of <em>Star Wars</em>. Those clips were promptly deleted, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsLeaks/comments/1o52vaa/star_wars_theatrical_ot_leaked_restoration/">but leaked screenshots are still floating around</a> and show new, highly detailed scans of <em>A New Hope</em>, and also <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> and<em> Return of the Jedi,</em> implying the entire OG trilogy is being restored. And the best part? The leaked information claims that these restorations are being done properly, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ctHBnCF">using original film negatives</a> and with an effort to preserve grain and color grading. This doesn’t appear to be a quick 4K AI upscale like we’ve seen in recent years.</p>

 <p>This is a big deal because the last time Lucasfilm officially released the original theatrical version of the films, without all of Lucas’ special edition tweaks and changes, <a href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Original_unaltered_trilogy">was way back in 2006</a>. The DVD versions of<em> Star Wars</em> released back then included the original theatrical cuts as a bonus feature. Sadly, these were poorly transferred copies from the Laserdisc versions of the S<em>tar Wars</em> movies. And the transfers on Laserdisc weren’t great either.</p>

 <p>And while fans have done incredible work restoring the original cuts of<em> Star Wars</em> via projects like <a href="https://www.thestarwarstrilogy.com/project-4k77/"><em>4K77</em>,</a> these efforts have always been limited by having to work with old film stock and not having access to the original negatives or higher-quality prints. So it’s very exciting that Lucasfilm and Disney are properly restoring the OG cuts of the original trilogy, as they alone have access to the best source material around and the resources to pull this off.</p>

 <p>We already know that Disney plans to bring back <a href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-50th-anniversary-theatrical-release"><em>A New Hope</em> to theaters in 2027, to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the franchise</a>. In the announcement of those plans, Disney didn’t specify which version would be shown. But it looks like it might actually be the long-awaited theatrical cut. If that’s the case, I’ll be there for sure. I also hope these versions get proper 4K UHD releases and are made available on Disney+.</p> <p><em>Star Wars</em> is one of the most influential films in history, and it deserves to be seen in its original form in the best quality possible. I’m happy that Disney, possibly looking to win back old fans, is finally doing this after decades of Lucas not caring. Now, let’s just hope this is all real and the company doesn’t fuck this up between now and release.</p>

              <p>I consume a firehose of online content every day as part of my job. At some point in the last week, through a post, comment, or video I can no longer remember, I became aware of a shortcut for tinkering with the brightness on my Switch 2. Turns out this existed on the original Switch as well. All you have to do his hold down the home button to instantly bring up the slider. Eureka!</p> <p>I’ve had the old Switch since it launched back in March 2017. I still remember passing through the food court at the mall to pick it up from GameStop. Thousands of hours later, it feels slightly embarrassing to report that I never knew about this settings menu shortcut.</p>

 <p>I change my brightness settings a lot depending on where I’m sitting, the time of day, how bright it is outside, and who’s around me. To cut down on the glare in my porch room, I boost it to the max. To save battery on long car rides with the kids, I toggle it way down. In bed with my partner and two-year-old while grinding runs of <em>Hades 2</em>, I also keep the screen dim to not wake them up.</p>

 <p>And every damn time I did it, I was going back to the home screen, clicking on the settings, and going to the screen brightness bar. Was this the biggest hassle in the world? Obviously not! But I love games and I love gaming hardware and one of the cornerstones of that hobby is min-maxing and I felt a little pang of humiliation when I realized I’d been using my Switch sub-optimally all these years.</p> <p>No longer! Don’t be like me! Take the knowledge of this home button shortcut and go control your screen brightness the way Nintendo intended.</p>

              <p><span>Ever since </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>stopped including every monster in every game with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-fans-i-need-yall-to-shut-up-about-dexit-1839949110"><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i></a><span>, someone’s favorite probably gets left behind in each new release. Sure, they might show up in the next game or two, but there are over 1000 of these guys now, and everyone’s bound to get benched now and then. Up until last week, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/only-three-pokemon-are-catchable-in-every-game-but-not-1850461272"><span>only three Pokémon could claim to be catchable in every single RPG</span></a><span>. Now that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is out, two of those are off the list, leaving only one left in every game. And no, it’s not Pikachu, the electric mouse and mascot of the whole franchise.</span></p> <p><span>Magikarp is, as of this writing, the only Pokémon you can obtain normally in every </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>RPG. This means without trades, hacks, or anything outside the scope of the game. The floundering fish that evolves into one of the most fearsome monsters in the franchise has kept this streak for almost 30 years, thanks to a salesman in </span><i><span>Pokémon Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White</span></i><span> who would give you the water Pokémon. </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>was the combo breaker for almost every other Pokémon because its dex was made up almost entirely of brand new Pokémon from the Unova region, meaning Pikachu, Charizard, and many other mainstays were only available in the post-game. Psyduck and Magnemite were also catchable in </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>through some extremely roundabout means, but they were there, too.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000638880" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638880"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638880">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Now, however, Psyduck and Magnemite are nowhere to be found in </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>. This might change with the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC, as they were both reinstated to the ranks of Magikarp through </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>’s DLC, but for now, there’s no sign of the headache-ridden duck or the sentient magnets, making Magikarp the reigning champ. For now, at least. Things might change in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><span>Gen X games that are reportedly coming next year</span></a><span>.</span></p>
