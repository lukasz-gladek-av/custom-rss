<p>Another game worth checking out is this year’s&nbsp;<em>Marvel’s Deadpool VR</em>. This title puts your inside the head of everyone’s favorite merc with a mouth—shredding through enemies, guns a blazing—all while you get to enjoy the voiceover provided by none other than Neil Patrick Harris. This one is not part of the Meta Quest+ subscription package, but may still be worth dipping into as it’s the biggest VR release of 2025.</p>



<p data-start="2185" data-end="2651">The Meta Quest 3S is an impressive upgrade from its predecessor, the Meta Quest 2. It’s powered by the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset, which delivers faster performance for smoother gameplay. The addition of outside sensors allows for full-color passthrough, letting you see the real world around you while using the headset. A new action button makes it easy to toggle between virtual reality and mixed reality.</p>
<p data-start="2653" data-end="2899" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6531/">With current discounts offering up to $50 off, now is the perfect time to grab the Meta Quest 3S</a>. The 128GB model is available for just $250, while the 256GB model is down to $350, making it a great deal for anyone looking to jump into VR gaming.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-crashes-playstation-portal-pricing-in-a-sudden-clearance-push-making-remote-ps5-gaming-cheaper-overnight-2000654542</link>

              <p>PlayStation Portal Remote Players are great for streaming your favorite titles directly from your console over Wi-Fi, without relying on a bigger screen. These are great for gaming anywhere you want, from the comfort of your cozy bed to the lounge, or even away from home. On a regular day, you’d pay around $200 to snap one, but that changes today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5815/">Amazon is currently offering the PlayStation Portal Remote Player for just $179, after taking 10% off its usual price.</a> The offer applies to both white and black models, but there’s a catch. The discount is only available today, as it wraps up at midnight. If you’ve been thinking of picking one, now is the time to act. Just note that these are likely going to be shipped after Christmas. If you’re looking to gift it to a loved one, it’s important to keep this timeline in mind and plan accordingly.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5815/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Remote Access</h2>
<p>The remote player comes with a nice 8-inch LCD, Full HD screen that pushes vibrant, detailed visuals for all your favorite titles. This thing is capable of delivering smooth gameplay at up to 60fps with exceptional image clarity on its 1080p resolution screen for an immersive experience. These visuals are thoughtfully paired with the Tempest 3D AudioTech for better sound. Connecting a compatible audio device, either wirelessly via PlayStation Link or wired via the 3.5mm audio jack, gets you that realistic, room-filling audio that pulls you into action. Adaptive triggers and haptic feedback take the experience a bit further by creating sensations that actually make you feel like a part of the digital world.</p>
<p>Portal Remote Player requires broadband internet Wi-Fi to stream the compatible games installed on your PS5 console. Your Wi-Fi should have at least 5Mbps speeds to get started, but a high-speed connection of at least 15Mbps will give you a smooth gaming experience. Getting started couldn’t be simpler. All you need to do is connect the console the a broadband internet connection, and turn it on in Rest Mode. Ensure Remote Play is enabled in Settings &gt; System &gt; Remote Play. Then, power your portal on, log into your PSN account, and choose the pairing option. You can also tap your console from the home screen to establish a connection.</p>



<p>Note that titles that require a VR headset or additional peripherals (except DualShock 4, DualSense, or DualSense Edge wireless controller) won’t work with the player. PS Plus Premium membership is supported, but only for the games that are installed on your console. The membership gets you instant access to hundreds of games from the Game Catalog and Classics Catalog. New titles are added every month, so you’ll never be out of worlds to explore.</p>
<p>Taking everything into consideration, those who have been looking to enjoy their favorite titles remotely can benefit from having <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5815/">the PlayStation Portal Remote Player in their setup. It normally runs for $200, but you can now snap it up for $179.</a> Both white and black versions are discounted, so there are options to choose from. Remember, the offer ends at midnight, so you only have a few more hours left to save. Grab it as fast as you can to avoid last-minute rush and chaos.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/wordle-new-york-times-crosswords-josh-wardle-app-ios-an-1848455748"><i><span>Wordle</span></i></a><span>, the word-guessing game that has been a daily fixture in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-pope-american-leo-wordle-words-with-friends-gamer-1851779977"><span>many people’s lives</span></a><span> since 2021, had a more difficult word than usual today, December 19. I don’t play </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span>, so I didn’t think much of it when my coworkers were chatting about how tough today’s word was. That is, until I looked outside of the </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>Slack and to the rest of the internet, where I saw that </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span> players were absolutely crashing out about today’s word.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>The word for today is “myrrh,” which, for those who don’t know about the cool shit Jesus was given when he died, is a “fragrant gum resin obtained from various Arabian and African trees and used in perfumery, medicines, and incense.” For a lot of players, the go-to </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span> strategy is to start by guessing vowels as a basis and then filling in consonants based on where the vowels fall. As you can see, myrrh has no vowels, so players were already at a disadvantage. Many tried and failed to figure out the word, and it just about ruined their day.</span></p>

   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">playing today's wordle and there's no vowels <a href="https://t.co/zyq9l37IuP">pic.twitter.com/zyq9l37IuP</a></p> <p>— Ace♡ (@trashwoman_ace) <a href="https://twitter.com/trashwoman_ace/status/2001894340810182825?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">how people gonna be talking about today's wordle <a href="https://t.co/KhgqsrP8Ce">pic.twitter.com/KhgqsrP8Ce</a></p> <p>— DD | Major (@MajorSSB) <a href="https://twitter.com/MajorSSB/status/2001932790154301497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Guys please trust me and go play the wordle right now it is actually the hardest wordle ever made, what the fuck was that</p> <p>— chloechu 💞 (@imchloechu) <a href="https://twitter.com/imchloechu/status/2001793461662441473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">If you're having a good day today, don't play wordle</p> <p>— Marques Brownlee (@MKBHD) <a href="https://twitter.com/MKBHD/status/2002080868207386827?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Wordle today for no reason <a href="https://t.co/Tzukl5q8Ns">pic.twitter.com/Tzukl5q8Ns</a></p> <p>— Enten 🂡 (@WielderOfEnten) <a href="https://twitter.com/WielderOfEnten/status/2002017970214572456?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>These are just a few of the social media reactions I saw, as they were the most tame. What I wasn’t expecting was some of the other responses I came across that we elected not to share here. I know edgy humor and wild comparisons are common in most gaming spheres, but I did not expect some of the vile shit I saw </span><i><span>Wordle </span></i><span>players calling the game’s developers. So if you’re down to see some truly off-the-wall, excessive reactions to a simple word game, you can search for that yourself.</span></p>

 <p><span>At any rate, maybe they’ll bring “myrrh” back to </span><i><span>Wordle </span></i><span>when </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wordle-jimmy-fallon-game-show-host-nbc-savannah-guthrie-2000632667"><span>Jimmy Fallon’s game show</span></a><span> version comes along, and we’ll see someone crash out on live television.</span></p>
