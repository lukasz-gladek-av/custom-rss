But with the introduction of Free Roam mode in <em>Mario Kart World</em>, which has everything you would see in a regular open-world title, like random challenges, hidden collectibles, and the vastness of the world around you, there’s so much more to do in this classic kart-racing series.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196698" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Princess Peach’s Leading Role And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="196698,196055,196626" data-current="196698"><div><p>Princess Peach’s Leading Role And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196698/196698_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22254.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The open-world is especially nice when you don’t want to race anybody or just want to take a break from focusing on speed in general. Here are six things you can do while you’re driving all over the <em>Mario Kart World</em> map.</p><h2 id="h49469"><a id="1"></a>Collect and unlock new outfits</h2><figure id="" data-id="aca62b32579d5747c64415cfc5db3950" data-recommend-id="image://aca62b32579d5747c64415cfc5db3950" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yoshi sits on a bike outside of a restaraunt.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are outfits littered around every race track in <em>Mario Kart World</em>, allowing you to build wardrobes for every character.. Each outfit is tied to certain foods packed into smiling lunch bags called Dash Food sitting outside of Yoshi’s restaurants. Sometimes, Dash Food can also be found on top of pickup trucks with ramps. Dash Food works similarly to Mushrooms, too: In addition to changing your appearance, you’ll get a speed boost.</p><p>However, not everyone who eats the same food item will unlock the same outfit. For example, if you’re racing as Mario, Luigi, Peach, Daisy or Yoshi and you pick up a burger, you’ll get the Touring outfit. If you’re playing as Bowser, Wario or Waluigi, the burger will trigger the Biker outfit. Eat cake while you’re playing as any of the eight aforementioned characters plus Toad and Koopa and you’ll be wearing the Pro Racer outfit, but do so with Donkey Kong and you’ll get the All-Terrain outfit.</p><h2 id="h49470"><a id="2"></a>Complete challenges</h2><figure id="" data-id="390eba98d1d5f1e1e16aa23ac410b225" data-recommend-id="image://390eba98d1d5f1e1e16aa23ac410b225" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yoshi sits on a bike in a snowy environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Yoshi sits on a bike in a snowy environment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Cristina Alexander / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="390eba98d1d5f1e1e16aa23ac410b225" data-recommend-id="image://390eba98d1d5f1e1e16aa23ac410b225" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Yoshi sits on a bike in a snowy environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While driving around the world map, you’ll come across the giant blue P-Switches that are found either on the side of the road or are lying somewhere off-road.

Others will test your timing on using certain items, like the Feather, which allows you to jump up to five feet in the air to reach high places and avoid incoming projectiles. You can replay the challenges as many times as you want to beat your record if you so desire. </p><h2 id="h49471"><a id="3"></a>Rack up coins</h2><figure id="" data-id="c016355b09436a39efc73de957baa3a5" data-recommend-id="image://c016355b09436a39efc73de957baa3a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pricness Peach sits in a kart in a snowy environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pricness Peach sits in a kart in a snowy environment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Cristina Alexander / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c016355b09436a39efc73de957baa3a5" data-recommend-id="image://c016355b09436a39efc73de957baa3a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pricness Peach sits in a kart in a snowy environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For the hustlers out there, you can find piles of coins hidden in every nook and cranny of the tracks. Keep your eyes peeled behind Yoshi’s restaurants, on top of billboards, in bushes, atop hilltops, and on boardwalks, just to name a few places. </p><p>Coin piles vary in size, from a stack of five coins to a money bag’s worth of 100 coins (or more). Don’t be surprised if you see a small stack of coins every once in a while. No matter what the size of the coin pile, they all add up to unlocking more new karts and other sweet rewards, like stickers.</p><h2 id="h49472"><a id="4"></a>Find Question Mark panels</h2><figure id="" data-id="d2a89377941b2fa7128b18eabdea2a29" data-recommend-id="image://d2a89377941b2fa7128b18eabdea2a29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Princess Peach stands near a question-mark panel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Princess Peach stands near a question-mark panel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Cristina Alexander / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d2a89377941b2fa7128b18eabdea2a29" data-recommend-id="image://d2a89377941b2fa7128b18eabdea2a29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Princess Peach stands near a question-mark panel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Each track has five Question Mark (“?”) panels hidden in various places. The panels don’t exactly do much when you run over them except give you new stickers to put on your karts. These are fun to collect. </p><p>And if you want an extra challenge: Activating 10 ? panels, is one of the ways to unlock Mirror Mode, which lets you race a track backwards.</p><h2 id="h49473"><a id="5"></a>Collect Peach medallions</h2><figure id="" data-id="7a33a53245b650ba87b7daf54fdd114f" data-recommend-id="image://7a33a53245b650ba87b7daf54fdd114f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Princess Peach rides a motorcycle near the shore." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Princess Peach rides a motorcycle near the shore." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Cristina Alexander / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7a33a53245b650ba87b7daf54fdd114f" data-recommend-id="image://7a33a53245b650ba87b7daf54fdd114f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Princess Peach rides a motorcycle near the shore." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you love collecting foreign coins in the real world, you’ll love collecting Peach Medallions. They’re basically giant coins that have a beautiful silhouette of Princess Peach’s profile engraved on them. They’re mostly found in high-rise places, like construction rails, musical blocks, thin columns, and aerial loops that you need to fly through. You can also find them in places you least expect, like a little islet beside the raging sea.</p><p>Peach Medallions are more like talismans than medallions because they lack a chain, but they’re medallions nonetheless. Unlike stocking up on rare coins IRL, collecting 10 of Peach’s coins will also unlock Mirror Mode.</p><h2 id="h49474"><a id="6"></a>Just take a relaxing drive!</h2><figure id="" data-id="8020eaf2c2c35b063096676f18c6ee5d" data-recommend-id="image://8020eaf2c2c35b063096676f18c6ee5d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Princess Peach goes for a drive in the desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Princess Peach goes for a drive in the desert." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Cristina Alexander / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8020eaf2c2c35b063096676f18c6ee5d" data-recommend-id="image://8020eaf2c2c35b063096676f18c6ee5d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Princess Peach goes for a drive in the desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Free Roam is perfect if you want to take a break from races and party battles with other players. Go for a relaxing road trip around the world and forget about the worries of the world. No races, no battles, no challenges–just you, your vehicle of choice, and the wide open road to help you take in the sights and sounds of every track you visit and the people you meet along the way–just like a real-life road trip would do.</p><p>You can also park somewhere to take a picture of yourself with Photo Mode. Like many other games, this feature lets you customize your character’s expressions and poses as they sit by the sunset, the mountains, the beach, or any breathtaking locale you take them. Those pictures will make great wallpapers for your PC or phone later on. Just make sure you remove the control guides before you snap any pics.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The movie was a bit of a flop at the time, but has since gone on to become a classic among Cameron fans and sci-fi nerds. </p><p>At one point in the film, a rat is placed in a small tub of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_breathing&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_breathing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">breathing fluorocarbon liquid</a></span>. At first, the rat struggles and panics because it thinks it’s drowning. But eventually it calms and starts breathing the liquid, which contains oxygen. Five rats were used, and they all lived. However, many found the scene disturbing, and in the UK, this scene was banned and removed from all versions of <em>The Abyss </em>at the request of the RSPCA. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rspca.org.uk/-/fears-of-streaming-loophole-as-disney-plus-airs-prohibited-rat-abuse-scene&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rspca.org.uk/-/fears-of-streaming-loophole-as-disney-plus-airs-prohibited-rat-abuse-scene" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But this scene was later included in the Disney+ version of the movie</a></span>, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://filmstories.co.uk/news/the-abyss-rspca-expresses-concern-over-uncut-rat-scenes-appearance-on-disney/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://filmstories.co.uk/news/the-abyss-rspca-expresses-concern-over-uncut-rat-scenes-appearance-on-disney/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was added to the service in April</a></span>.</p><p>Here’s the scene, but be warned that this is a real rat struggling to breathe and some might find it hard to watch. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/disney-plus-removes-a-classic-james-cameron-sci-fi-movie-after-featuring-a-troubling-scene-that-was-cut-from-previous-releases/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/disney-plus-removes-a-classic-james-cameron-sci-fi-movie-after-featuring-a-troubling-scene-that-was-cut-from-previous-releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On June 17, GamesRadar</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/disney-removes-hollywood-film-controversial-31873734&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/news/tv/disney-removes-hollywood-film-controversial-31873734" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other outlets</a></span> reported that <em>The Abyss</em> had been removed from Disney+ after the RSPCA called out the media giant for including the scene and taking advantage of a “loophole” that allows streamers to ignore some local film and TV regulations. </p><p>“This isn’t about cancel culture—we’d welcome Disney Plus reinstating the film to their platform, just with this troubling scene removed—as is already the case in cinemas, on TV, and on DVD,” the RSPCA’s Head of Public Affairs said in a statement.</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>This was instead about highlighting a loophole that currently exists, allowing animal abuse scenes deemed unacceptable elsewhere to be streamed freely and legally into our homes—and protecting the public from having to see this animal abuse content.</p></blockquote><p> For many years, the film was difficult to watch, as it wasn’t available on streaming platforms and physical copies were out of print. But last year, a 4K version of the movie was finally released. Like some of Cameron’s other 4K releases, it makes some visual changes that people aren’t happy with, but overall, it is a fine way to watch <em>The Abyss</em>. However, in the UK, you can no longer watch this version on Disney+ because of that single, short scene involving a rodent. Hopefully, Disney adds the movie back with that scene removed so folks in the UK can enjoy this underrated Cameron classic once more. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It can be a little tricky to nail this move at first. <strong>The secret to Rail Riding is to either drive over them when they’re already underneath you (such as with train tracks) or to land on them from above after using a ramp or a charge jump.</strong> Your aiming needs to be great here because while your kart will only magnetize to them if it’s very close.</p><p>Landing on a rail from a ramp or high jump is pretty easy. If you find yourself just missing the mark, try performing a spinning trick by pressing R + left or right. This is a great way to nudge yourself slightly to the side when you’re in the air. If you’re having trouble with Charge Jumps, remember that you need to be driving straight. Charge Jumps are done by holding down R until you notice blue sparks coming out from the back tires. Letting go of R will launch you straight into the air or up and to the side if you move left or right at the same time.</p><p>Grinding on rails is a pretty on-rails technique (heh), with your kart simply following along without any input. That doesn’t mean you’re forced to sit there and watch. You’ll steadily build up a turbo charge just like drifting, but you can only use the boost by jumping off. It’s also possible to trick jump in place, although this seems more beneficial for dodging enemy <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bullet-boo-flower-shell-bob-omb-kamek-1851783874&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bullet-boo-flower-shell-bob-omb-kamek-1851783874">power-ups</a></span> than gaining any speed.</p><h2 id="h508344"><a id="2"></a>How to Wall Ride</h2><figure id="" data-id="928caf138c916397df80a4fc2a6a8591" data-recommend-id="image://928caf138c916397df80a4fc2a6a8591" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A purple Yoshi collects coins while wall riding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A purple Yoshi collects coins while wall riding." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="928caf138c916397df80a4fc2a6a8591" data-recommend-id="image://928caf138c916397df80a4fc2a6a8591" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A purple Yoshi collects coins while wall riding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Next up is another mechanic that can feel a little finicky, but be activated in similar ways: Wall Riding. <strong>This works by launching yourself at a wall after using a ramp or Charge Jump.</strong> Your kart will seemingly magnetize to the surface and leave you driving sideways for a few seconds.</p><p>This technique works in more places than you’d think. As long as the surface is a bit bigger than your kart and relatively flat, you can wall ride along the likes of buildings, natural terrain, and even big trucks on the road. Wall riding builds up your mini-turbo incredibly fast, so it’s great to use these for some quick boosts when appropriate. Keep in mind that not every wall will be a benefit in every race. The same can also be applied to rails, as I’ve grinded quite a few and been taken off course.</p><p>Trying to ride on every rail and wall you see in Free Roam mode is a must. Besides being a ton of fun and helping you master these techniques, it can be necessary for collecting some Peach Medallions or completing specific P-Block challenges.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
