            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning and welcome back to yet another Monday. I’m so sorry. I don’t control the days of the week. But I do control this post, and so I can say: I’m rooting for you. Anyway, welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about. Today, we take a peek at a controller leak, get some advice from a veteran game maker, and hear what Hideo Kojima thought of <em>Predator: Badlands</em></p>

 <h2>The new Steam Controller looks big and chonky</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The new Steam Controller will look like this when it launches</p> <p>Im told that it can also detect how far your hands are from the handles using a simple capsense feature</p> <p>Similar to the index controllers, but not full finger tracking in the grips <a href="https://t.co/loIqpJb0YZ">pic.twitter.com/loIqpJb0YZ</a></p> <p>— Brad Lynch (@SadlyItsBradley) <a href="https://twitter.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1987644108765380813?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Fans of the Xbox Duke controller will likely be happy to hear that Valve’s next Steam Controller will reportedly be similarly large and in charge. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1osxuwk/sadlyitsbradley_the_new_steam_controller_will/">On Sunday, reliable Valve insider Brad Lynch shared an AI-generated image</a> of what the not-yet-officially-announced new Steam controller will look like. And yeah, it’s big, complete with two touch pads, like the Steam Deck, and even does some basic finger tracking. Leaks and info about this controller and other Valve hardware keep happening, and rumors are swirling that a reveal of something from the company is coming soon.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Modern Warfare 2 Remastered</em> likely coming to Game Pass soon</strong></h2> <p>2020’s <em>Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2: Campaign Remastered</em> will likely be added to Xbox’s Game Pass service, according to a leaked ad that was spotted by fans. It’s hard to make out, but it does seem like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1ory64g/mw2_coming_to_game_pass/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><em>Modern Warfare 2′</em>s cover art is included in a dashboard ad</a> that appeared on one player’s screen. It’s possible this was just a mistake, but Xbox and Activision have been regularly adding <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-mw3-july-xbox-1851601479">old<em> Call of Duty</em> games to Game Pass since 2024.</a></p>

 <h2><strong><em>Mega Man</em> designer Keiji Inafune wants devs to stop clinging to the past</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://www.thisisgame.com/articles/406514">Over the weekend, as reported by<em> This Is Game,</em></a> <em>Mega Man</em> character designer and <a href="https://kotaku.com/mega-mans-creator-quits-capcom-update-5676403">former Capcom producer Keiji Inafune</a> appeared at the Console Game Developer Conference in South Korea and advised attendees not to rely solely on sequels and established franchises.</p>

 <p>“To be clear, it’s not that games that continue a series or build off an existing famous genre are bad,” said Inafune via Google Translation. “What I mean is that <em>only</em>&nbsp;that is not enough.”</p> <p>“If you make a hit, yes, you’ve succeeded, but it can also place a tremendous burden on you. Does success always seem like a good thing? It is good. You can’t succeed when you’re in a state of anxiety. You need confidence, and that confidence requires a foundation. A past success can provide that foundation. But few people who succeed once go on to succeed again. Success brings positive effects, but it also brings side effects. I’ve seen many people who cling only to past success. They cling to how things were done at that time and adopt a defensive attitude.”</p>

 <p>“In the games industry, many people have succeeded once and that’s it, haven’t they? How often did their sequels succeed too?” asked the veteran developer. “I don’t want to boast, but I take pride in having many representative works – not just <em>Mega Man</em>, but <em>Lost Planet,</em> <em>Onimusha</em>,<em> Dead Rising,</em> and so on. The genres were diverse, too. Because I didn’t rest on past successes.”</p>

 <h2><b>Kojima suffered through a back injury to watch the new <em>Predator</em> movie</b></h2> <p>Hideo Kojima has seen the new <em>Predator</em> movie and <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1987437583430045778">really liked it, despite a painful back injury</a>. Thankfully, Kojima brought a “secret weapon” to the theater: an inflatable lumbar pillow.</p> <p>“[<em>Predator: Badlands</em>] represents a new direction for Hollywood entertainment led by a new generation of filmmakers who have inherited the global ‘memes’ of manga, anime, and gaming culture,” said Kojima on Sunday. “I especially hope young anime fans who usually steer clear of live-action Western films will give this one a try. Even with Dek’s ‘ugly’ face, you’ll find yourself emotionally invested from the opening scene. You’ll definitely get hooked.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><strong>Check out our excellent review of <em>Arc Raiders</em></strong></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-infinite-no-more-updates-operation-halo-studios-xbox-2000642195"><strong><em>Halo Infinite</em> is officially going on life support</strong></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/ball-x-pit-vampire-survivors-balatro-roguelike-2000642155"><strong><em>Ball x Pit</em> creator thinks y’all are being too nice</strong></a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Star Wars collectibles rarely go on sale, especially character-driven sets like this one that often remain desirable well after their initial release. But right now, the LEGO <strong>Star Wars Grogu with Hover Pram</strong> set is bucking that trend, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5425/">selling for an all-time low of just $62 on Amazon (down from its typical $99).</a> This buildable display model <strong>includes 1,048 pieces</strong> and almost never gets discounted, which makes this 37% off sale a really exceptional offer. LEGO’s website still sells the set at retail price, so Amazon’s deal is far and away the best way to get this Mandalorian merchandise without having to pay premium collector prices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5425/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Mandalorian Magic</h2>
<p>The engineering behind this buildable figure shows just why LEGO can command premium prices in the first place.<strong> Grogu’s arms move through dial-operated mechanisms</strong> buried within the body, in a manner that allows you to pose those small hands into gestures that capture both the innocent curiosity and mischievousness of the character.</p>
<p>The head rotates smoothly through an entire range of motion while the oversized ears articulate independently, yielding a wide range of expressions and moods. These parts turn what is otherwise a display model right into an interactive one, whereby one is able to change Grogu’s pose to their favorite scenes from The Mandalorian or create entirely new moments. The level of detail extends to a subtle texture in the robe, facial features that genuinely look like the on-screen character, and proportions that manage to feel accurate despite being constructed completely out of rectangular plastic bricks.</p>



<p>The hover pram itself is more than just a figure base, with its spherical design accurately depicting the protective pod that Grogu rides around in throughout the series. Opening panels showcase the interior space where the Child sits, and you can display Grogu inside with the canopy closed for that iconic traveling look or open everything up to show off the figure a bit better. It’s got a stand to provide stable support while still keeping up the illusion of hovering for a dynamic display that looks more interesting than figures on flat bases.</p>



<p>Accessories add a lot of storytelling possibility to increase the appeal of this display. The brick-built Sorgan frog references the memorable episode where Grogu hunted local wildlife despite Mando’s disapproval, and you can position it in Grogu’s hand as if he’s about to enjoy a crunchy snack. The shifter knob from the Razor Crest cockpit represents one of Grogu’s favorite toys throughout the series-a simple object which the Child finds endlessly fascinating. The cookie is another food accessory that captures Grogu’s constant appetite and childlike enthusiasm for treats.</p>
<p>The<strong> 1,048-piece count is that sweet middle ground</strong> where the building process remains engaging without being tedious. You’ll be able to work through the construction in several hours and find that meditative flow state that makes LEGO building so appealing for adults as a means of screen-free relaxation. The building techniques range from simple stacking for structural elements to smart solutions for curved surfaces and mechanical linkages.</p>
<p>With <strong>hundreds of reviewers giving it 4.9 out of 5 star</strong>s, there’s confirmation that it certainly does deliver on its promise.&nbsp;At $62, this is the lowest price this set has ever reached and puts it within the budget of a fanbase that might have found a $99 retail price harder to justify.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dont-buy-your-ipad-at-an-apple-store-amazon-just-dropped-the-base-wifi-model-to-pocket-change-2000642394</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-buy-your-ipad-at-an-apple-store-amazon-just-dropped-the-base-wifi-model-to-pocket-change.1348903/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tablets have become essential tools for everything from streaming shows to taking notes in meetings but finding one that delivers premium performance without premium pricing remains a challenge. Apple dominates the tablet market because of the tight ecosystem integration and refined hardware; the 11-inch iPad with the A16 chip is the most affordable entry point into that experience. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">Currently priced at $299 on Amazon after its standard $349 retail price, this 2025 WiFi 128GB model</a> delivers the core iPad experience at the lowest this configuration has ever reached<strong>. Apple’s own website still sells this exact model at full price</strong>, which makes Amazon’s discount genuinely noteworthy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>The Sweet Spot for Most Users</h2>
<p>The A16 chip powering this iPad comes straight from Apple’s iPhone lineage and brings smartphone-class efficiency and processing power to tablet computing. This processor nudges along multiple running apps with ease: You seamlessly flip between Safari tabs, respond to messages, edit photos, and stream video without the sluggish performance that plagues cheaper Android tablets. The neural engine within the A16 Bionic greatly accelerates machine learning tasks, including photo recognition, voice processing and augmented reality applications.</p>



<p>The 11-inch Liquid Retina display strikes an ideal balance between portability and usable screen space. The 2360 x 1640 resolution delivers sharp text that remains readable even at smaller font sizes, making this iPad viable for extended reading sessions or document work. <strong>True Tone technology automatically adjusts the color temperature in the display based on the surrounding light</strong>&nbsp;and reduces eye strain when you move from bright outdoor environments into warm indoor lighting.</p>
<p>The <strong>camera system is actually far better than what most would expect from tablet cameras</strong>: The 12MP rear camera captures surprisingly good photos and 4K video, making this iPad capable of documenting events, scanning documents, or recording video content when your phone isn’t handy. The front 12MP camera, finally situated in a landscape orientation, puts the lens where it should be for video calls, centering you in frame when the iPad sits naturally on a desk or in a stand.</p>



<p>The 128GB of storage handles normal use patterns without requiring constant file management. You can have a good library of Netflix shows downloaded for offline viewing, store thousands of photos, install dozens of apps, and keep important documents locally accessible. Of course, cloud storage integration through iCloud allows you to easily expand beyond local storage for files you don’t need immediate access to. Having 128GB on board eliminates the anxiety that comes with 64GB models, which fill up frustratingly fast. This capacity hits that sweet spot whereby most users never feel constrained but aren’t paying extra for storage they’ll never use.</p>
<p>WiFi 6 connectivity itself offers faster wireless speeds and better performance in crowded networks compared with older WiFi standards which makes a noticeable difference when you download large files, stream high-resolution video, or use the iPad in environments with many competing devices on the same network. Furthermore, the increased efficiency means better battery life on network-intensive tasks as the WiFi 6 radio can transmit data faster and return to low-power states more quickly.</p>
<p><strong>The iPad is better integrated into the ecosystem of Apple devices</strong>, and creates great continuity between them. You can start typing something in an email on your iPad and then just finish it on your iPhone or Mac. Or copy text or an image on one and paste it into another using Universal Clipboard, start something on one device and pick it up where you left off with Handoff. It works so transparently that you stop thinking about which device you’re using and focus instead on what you’re trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>A rating of <strong>4.8 out of 5 stars based on over 12,000 reviews</strong> shows real end-user satisfaction in this iPad’s performance and reliability. That feedback comes from real buyers who use the device daily, providing confidence that the experience matches Apple’s promises.</p>
<p>At $299, this is Apple’s most accessible premium tablet offering to date, and bringss the iPad experience within reach of buyers who previously considered it too expensive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Bethesda creative director Todd Howard knows the wait for the next <em>Elder Scrolls</em> RPG has been “too long.” But in a new interview, he once again asked fans to be patient, and hinted that maybe <em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> or some other Bethesda game in the future might shadow-drop without warning.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview">In an interview with&nbsp;<em>GQ Magazine</em></a>&nbsp;mainly focused on the 10th anniversary of<a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-the-kotaku-review-1743410637"><em> Fallout 4,</em></a> Howard talked about the studio’s next game: <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-vi-6-tes6-update-release-date-bethesda-1851363646">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>.</em> First announced officially in 2018 via an E3 teaser, this next entry in the RPG franchise will be the first sequel since 2011’s <em>Skyrim</em>. And while Howard admits working on Starfield after <em>Fallout 4</em> was a nice “reset” for the team, he also acknowledges that the gap between sequels is too big.</p>

 <p>“I do like to have a break between them, where it isn’t like a ‘plus one’ sequel,” said Howard. “I think it’s also good for an audience to have a break – <em>The Elder Scrolls</em>&nbsp;has been too long, let’s be clear. But we wanted to do something new with&nbsp;<em>Starfield</em>. We needed a creative reset.” Howard also made it clear that <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> is still a “long way off.”</p>

 <p>“I’m preaching patience. I don’t want fans to feel anxious,” Howard told the outlet. Previously, the creative director suggested that Bethesda had announced the new RPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-elder-scrolls-vi-6-2018-e3-teaser-early-1850770820">too early.</a></p> <h2><em>Elder Scrolls 6</em> (or something else…) might get shadow-dropped</h2> <p>Elsewhere in the interview, after admitting that <em>Fallout 4</em>‘s dialogue system wasn’t well received by fans, Howard talked about letting some folks who donated to Make-A-Wish play<em> Elder Scrolls 6</em> early via a recent playtesting session. And yes, Bethesda is playtesting the RPG a lot now as it’s the studio’s next big project. But it seems like Howard isn’t a fan of spending years and years teasing and talking about Bethesda’s next game.</p>

 <p>I like to just announce stuff and release it,” said Howard. “My perfect version–and I’m not saying this is going to happen–is that it’s going to be a while and then, one day, the [<em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em>] will just appear.”</p>

 <p>When the interviewer pointed out that Bethesda shadow-dropped <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesdas-oblivion-remaster-is-out-now-on-xbox-ps5-an-1851777265"><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> earlier this year</a>, and it was a big hit, Howard vaguely teased: “You might say that was a test run. It worked out well.”</p> <p>Now, I don’t actually think Bethesda and Xbox will just launch the next mainline <em>Elder Scrolls</em> game without a marketing push. That would be wild. But I do think <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> proved that many of Bethesda’s past games are popular enough already that you don’t need to do much marketing to get people excited about a new version of a past classic. And over the last year or two, we’ve heard rumors and reports of a <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_3_remaster"><em>Fallout 3</em> remaster</a> being cooked up. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/7-years-after-it-was-announced-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-says/#google_vignette">And <em>VGC</em> reports that a <em>Fallout 3 r</em>emaster is in development.</a> Is Howard’s answer here alluding to that rumored remaster dropping without warning in the near future? Perhaps. <a href="https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-bethesda-fallout-day-fallout-5-tease-event-remaster-2000638661">We know more <em>Fallout</em> projects are coming</a>. Just what those are and when we should expect them are still officially unknown.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-offloads-its-27-inch-dolby-atmos-soundbar-now-selling-at-a-new-record-low-on-amazon-only-2000642388</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bose-offloads-its-27-inch-dolby-atmos-soundbar-now-selling-at-a-new-record-low-on-amazon-only.1348843/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Modern flatscreen TVs give you crystal-clear pictures but their razor-thin designs leave almost no room for decent speakers, so you end up with tinny audio that degrades your viewing experience. The B<strong>ose Dolby Atmos soundbar remedies this basic problem</strong>&nbsp;and makes your TV’s sound go from underwhelming to truly immersive, and<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5419/"> right now it’s just $399 at Amazon, down from its usual $499</a>. That’s a n<strong>ew all-time low</strong> on Bose’s compact all-in-one soundbar that crams theater-quality audio into a 27-inch frame.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5419/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>How Bose Packed Theater Sound Into 27 Inches</h2>
<p>The acoustic engineering inside this soundbar defies what you’d expect from such a compact unit: <strong>Bose squeezed five separate transducers into the frame</strong>&nbsp;including two upward-firing drivers that bounce sound off your ceiling to create height channels for Dolby Atmos content. This upward projection simulates the overhead audio effects you’d get from ceiling-mounted speakers in a proper home theater, making helicopters sound like they’re flying above you and rain feel like it’s falling from the sky. The <em>TrueSpace</em> technology takes this further by analyzing non-Atmos content like standard stereo or 5.1 surround mixes and intelligently upmixing them into immersive multi-channel experiences. That means even<strong> older movies, regular TV shows, and music benefit from spatial processing</strong> that adds depth and dimension to the soundstage.</p>



<p>AI Dialogue Mode addresses one of the biggest beefs with modern content: mumbly dialogue mixed too low beneath music and effects. This <strong>smart processing evens out vocal frequencies against background noises</strong> which brings conversations to the front of the mix without making the dialogue sound artificially separated or processed. You’ll finally catch every word of dialogue on those prestige dramas when the actors are whispering dramatically, and you won’t miss any plot-critical conversations during action sequences.</p>



<p>The streaming capabilities baked into this soundbar make it <strong>more than just a device to improve your TV audio</strong>. Bluetooth allows you to stream music directly from your phone, while Apple AirPlay 2 offers higher-quality wireless audio if you’re using an iOS device, along with multi-room audio if you have other AirPlay speakers. Spotify Connect lets you start music on your phone and then hand off playback to the soundbar, so you can use Spotify’s app as a remote control while the soundbar pulls audio directly from the service for better quality than Bluetooth streaming.</p>



<p>Setup simplicity makes this soundbar approachable even if you are not particularly tech-savvy: A single HDMI connection to your TV handles both audio from the TV and pass-through for connected devices like game consoles or streaming boxes, eliminating the tangle of cables that usually comes with traditional surround sound systems. The soundbar automatically detects when you’ve turned on your television and powers up accordingly, providing a seamless experience where you’re not thinking of the audio system separately from your television. The <strong>compact width of 27 inches fits comfortably in front of most televisions</strong> without blocking much of the view or overwhelming smaller entertainment centers and the low profile maintains a clutter-free aesthetic in your living space.</p>
<p>The<strong> sound quality this bar produces competes with multi-speaker setups</strong> costing considerably more. The bass response reaches surprisingly low for a soundbar without a separate subwoofer, offering enough low-end impact for most content without adding another box to your room. The clarity across the frequency range ensures instruments remain distinct in complex musical passages and that sound effects maintain their character rather than blurring together.</p>
<p>At $399, it’s the most affordable way into premium TV audio from Bose with the brand’s signature sound at the lowest price this model has ever seen. It checks off all the boxes that include Dolby Atmos support.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-black-firday-sales-2025-mario-zelda-2000642413</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-reveals-its-black-friday-deals-and-they-aren%E2%80%99t-great.1348840/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I guess it’s that time of year again already. Nintendo just announced its sales for Black Friday 2025 and they are…not that impressive. Unsurprisingly, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-impressions-launch-games-comparison-1851785748">the Switch 2</a> remains full price. But there’s also no discounted Switch bundle in sight, and the slate of Switch games that are on sale for up to $30 off aren’t exactly the cream of the crop.</p>

 <p>Let’s start with which deals the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251110046253/en/Nintendo-Announces-Holiday-Offers-for-Black-Friday-and-Cyber-Monday-2025">Nintendo Black Friday 2025 sale</a> does include. First, Samsung MicroSD Express Cards for Switch 2 will be $20 off at select stores starting November 30. Second, a handful of <em>Zelda</em> and <em>Street Fighter</em> 6 amiibo will be $10 off. Finally, here are the Nintendo games that will be discounted starting November 23:</p>

 <ul> <li><strong><i>Princess Peach: Showtime! </i></strong>– $40 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom </i></strong>– $40 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD </i></strong>– $40 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>Luigi’s Mansion 3 </i></strong>– $40 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>Kirby’s Return to Dream Land Deluxe</i></strong> – $40 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>Super Mario Odyssey</i></strong> – $30 (50 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>Nintendo Switch Sports </i></strong>– $30 (50 percent off)</li> <li><strong><i>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door </i></strong>– $30 (50 percent off)</li> <li><i><strong>Splatoon 3</strong> </i>– $30 (50 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>Most of these are either B-tier releases or came out quite a while ago. There’s no <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> or <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, and <em>Mario Kart</em> is MIA as well. Other retailers might run their own discounts on physical Nintendo games, but it seems pretty clear the company is treating much of its back catalog as functionally brand-new releases for potential new Switch 2 owners this holiday.</p>

 <h2>RIP Switch Black Friday bundles</h2> <p>While Walmart, Target, and other retailers could still do their own deals, it’s disappointing that Nintendo seems to have retired the Switch bundles that it had been hauling out every Christmas for <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-black-friday-2024-deals-mk8-zelda-totk-1851696187">the last couple years</a>. There’s no <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> bundle for the OG Switch or Switch OLED, and no returning Switch Lite sale. Combined with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-inflation-tariffs-2000614220">price increases over the summer</a>, the older hardware will actually be more expensive this holiday than last.</p> <p>The lack of any special Switch 2 deals from Nintendo isn’t surprising at all. In fact, the $500<em> Mario Kart World</em> bundle the console launched with was essentially already that, giving you the hardware and game for $30 below the regular MSRP. I guess fans should just be thankful that Nintendo hasn’t raised the price of the Switch 2 yet and has plenty of stock for the end of 2025. The company said it doesn’t <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-sale-discount-2000642086">foresee any more price hikes</a> in the immediate future, unless another unexpected trade war erupts.</p>
