At last, players were able to dig into its moody mashup of loot, extraction shooter, and roguelite elements, and what they found wasn’t great. From its grueling boss fights to haphazard exploration, it was widely panned. The team behind the co-op game has now released a roadmap for upcoming fixes and new content drops, however, and says it has “no regrets” about soft-launching the game when it did. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196663" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="429" data-playlist="196663,196086,195189" data-current="196663"><div><p>The Top 10 Most Played Games On Steam Deck: February 2024 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196663/196663_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22220.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p> “There is no amount of time you can spend in isolation that will make the game great,” lead producer at Heart Machine, Michael Clark, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/despite-a-teamwide-oops-guess-we-made-it-too-hard-moment-hyper-light-breaker-has-no-regrets-about-its-mixed-response-early-access-launch-and-now-its-got-a-roadmap-so-everyone-can-git-gud/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/despite-a-teamwide-oops-guess-we-made-it-too-hard-moment-hyper-light-breaker-has-no-regrets-about-its-mixed-response-early-access-launch-and-now-its-got-a-roadmap-so-everyone-can-git-gud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>PC Gamer</em></a></span> this week. “You get the best version of a game by maximizing the amount of feedback-and-iteration loops you can go through, and Early Access is the way to do that for a title like this.”</p><figure id="" data-id="c672bcbd2a80495d6a52d47fec2daea9" data-recommend-id="image://c672bcbd2a80495d6a52d47fec2daea9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Hyper Light Breaker's roadmap.

The gameplay just isn’t there yet, even for an Early Access game. </p><p>The new roadmap caters to many of the complaints currently littering the Steam page, especially the game’s difficulty, which has clearly struck many players less “very challenging” and more “sloppy and not fun.” At the same time, it’s an ambitious timeline for fixes that may be difficult to deliver on, given the project’s past delays as well as some layoffs at the studio late last year. If Heart Machine does deliver on its latest promises, <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em> could become the game fans of the studio were hoping to play in just a few months. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, today’s main boss has been the game’s main menu, past which no player managed to reach. </p><p>The next test is due to start at 10 p.m. ET tonight, which at least gives FromSoft and Sony a chance to meddle with servers and check code ahead of the next attempt. And, as we say, this is <em>why</em> you do network tests of online games, and why you should never, ever charge for them (which FromSoft has not). These sorts of disasters will hopefully iron things out ahead of the official (as yet unannounced) release.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
