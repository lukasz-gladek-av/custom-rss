That will only get you a regular model, however, and not a pre-release Space World 2000 version of the machine.</p><p>Of all the various special edition GameCubes that appeared during the console’s heyday 24 years ago, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/25-year-old-prototype-space-world-gamecube-listed-on-ebay-for-100000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/25-year-old-prototype-space-world-gamecube-listed-on-ebay-for-100000" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as <em>IGN</em> reports</a></span>, the Space World is the rarest. Hence the astonishing (and yet still rather hopeful) price tag.</p><p>This particular model was a prototype design, one of five, that appeared at Nintendo’s annual Space World trade show in Japan in the year 2000. It was to be the penultimate Space World, but also the beginning of the adorable machine’s life, as it was unveiled at the event—alongside the Game Boy Advance. The prototype was lost for a couple of decades, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-gamecube-space-world-direct-japan-2000-zelda-1850402685&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-gamecube-space-world-direct-japan-2000-zelda-1850402685">and then rediscovered in 2023</a></span>. It’s apparently 1mm bigger in all dimensions than the final retail GameCube, has a different-shaped vent at the back, and, well, didn’t have a CPU or GPU inside.</p><p>Which is to say, yes, this is a $100,000 GameCube that can’t play games. As the eBay description reads, “This is a display unit. The only thing that works is the little LED on top.” And honestly, I’m impressed the light still turns on a quarter of a century later.</p><p>The current owner says they’re selling the model in order to fund a place where people can gather to play games, “where the entire family can enjoy, people can meet other people, talk with people who feel uncomfortable with other people, and make the visitors feel young again.” Which sounds lovely.</p><p>But be sure before you buy. The sales page makes clear there’s no-takes-backsies.</p><p>“I do not run a shop, please, no refunds if the console is not to your liking.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We made a bet, and I said I’ll fly over there and choke you out. And here he is! I showed up! I showed up to his damn job and I had to wait for him to finish his job. So now, Im’ma choke your ass out. A bet’s a bet!”</p><p>Above you can watch the video of him choking out the young man who he met in <em>Fortnite</em>. To be clear, the person in the video seems to be consenting to the chokehold and laughs about it after he passes out, but the clip is still a bit disturbing to watch as you see his arms go limp and his body and head twitch. </p><p>“Still want to play with me ??
