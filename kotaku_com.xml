              <p><strong>Amazon’s Labor Day sales have officially launched</strong>&nbsp;and some of the best offers are not on everyday essentials but on real tech upgrades. That’s exactly the case with the <strong>Samsung 9100 Pro 4TB SSD</strong>, which only went on sale a few months prior for $550. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3720/">Now it has dropped to as little as $372 (37% off)</a> which is an all time low for a brand new item. Samsung’s smaller 1TB and 2TB versions are seeing price drops as well right now but they come with less dramatic dives.</p>

<h2>4.8 Out of 5 Stars Rating</h2>
<p>This is a <strong>PCIe 5.0 drive</strong>&nbsp;which means you’re effectively stepping into the latest generation of storage technology. On paper, it can push sequential read speeds up to <strong>14,800 MB/s and write speeds of around 13,400 MB/s</strong> (double the Samsung’s legendary 990 Pro). Launching games, opening massive video projects or crunching through workloads tied to AI applications and content creation happens almost instantly.</p>
<p>What’s equally impressive are the random read and write numbers as it can reach up to 2,200K and 2,600K IOPS. Sounds like computer lingo, but what it really translates to is seamless multitasking with a whole lot less waiting. <strong>Edit 4K or 8K footage, train AI models</strong> or load intense workstation applications: this drive maintains your system responsiveness even at high load. Gamers benefit too with incredibly fast in-game loading and virtually zero stutter while streaming assets in-game.</p>



<p>There’s a<strong> fresh 5nm controller inside which cuts power consumption by nearly 50% compared to the 990 Pro</strong>&nbsp;and that’s gigantic for laptops that sit through long sessions and desktops trying to keep temperatures under control. There’s <strong>integrated advanced thermal management</strong> which prevents overheating and throttling even when you’re hammering the drive with constant workloads.</p>
<p>On the software side, Samsung continues to support its drives with its <em>Magician</em> software suite which updates firmware automatically, contains helpful drive health monitoring and offers extra layers of encryption for workstations that deal with sensitive information.</p>
<p>If you’ve been waiting for a reason to jump into PCIe 5.0 speed, this Labor Day is the perfect time.</p>

              <p>If you’ve ever found yourself scratching your head wondering why you’re shelling out so much money just to have your iPhone charged, this deal will be a bargain. On Apple’s website, <strong>a simple vanilla 20W charger sells for $19</strong> – and that only comes with one block, not the cable.</p>
<p>Great news, you can currently purchase not one but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/">two Anker 20W USB-C charger blocks and corresponding cables on Amazon for the low price of $11</a>. That’s under six bucks apiece, the very same low price we did last Black Friday and Prime Day but with a Labor Day flavor. No wonder this two-pack is the <strong>#1 best-seller in Amazon’s entire charger section</strong>.</p>

<h2>Speed and Safe Charging</h2>
<p>These are <strong>20W USB-C (and USB-A) charging blocks</strong> that are meant to charge in a hurry. The virtue of rapid charging is that you’re not wasting so much time alongside a power outlet, and with these, you can <strong>recharge your iPhone 16 or 15 series battery up to 50% in roughly 30 minutes</strong>. If you’ve been stuck using those older 5W chargers, the difference is night and day. Anker has tuned its PowerIQ technology to keep speeds consistent while staying safe for your battery.</p>
<p>Since this set comes with <strong>two chargers and two matching USB-C to Lightning cables</strong>, it’s ready to cover multiple needs at once. You can have a person sleep by your bedside, the other in your bag or at the office desk so that you’ll get rid of those annoying frustrating minutes of <em>“where did I place my only charger?”</em> The braided build of the cables also renders them more resilient than what you’d otherwise receive in the package.</p>



<p>Compatibility isn’t something to fret about either. Just because the purchase is marketed for iPhone 16 and 15 devices doesn’t signify that exact <strong>20W PD (Power Delivery) output won’t perform with iPads, AirPods, and even some Android models or smaller USB-C devices</strong>.</p>
<p>You’re getting Apple Store quality at less than a third of the unit cost, with the added advantage that Anker actually includes the cables, something that Apple charges extra for. Deals such as these won’t stay on the shelves long when they hit this record-low price, make sure you don’t miss the opportunity on Amazon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’ve played </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-previews-sonic-resident-evil-play-days-1851784271"><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</span></i></a> <span>twice now, and both times, I had the same fleeting thought: “What if </span><i><span>Sonic</span></i><span> outruns </span><i><span>Mario Kart </span></i><span>and has the better kart racer this year?” </span><i><span>Mario Kart World </span></i><span>is pretty good. It is a really solid One of Those, and it will no doubt be a mainstay in the Switch 2’s long lifetime–but it plays things safe, has several frustrating things going on under the hood, and by God, 24 players is too damn many.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>After playing about a dozen hours of </span><i><span>World </span></i><span>with friends since the Switch 2 launched in June, playing </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>for even an hour was refreshing, as it feels like Sega is not only taking some cool risks to shake up the formula, but also making calculated choices that rein in chaos and allow for more strategic racing.</span></p> <p><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span>’ biggest shake-up is the introduction of the Gadget Panel, which is essentially an overhaul of </span><i><span>Team Sonic Racing</span></i><span>’s Bonus Box system. Before each race, you can use your panel to create a loadout of upgrades, usable items, and stat boosts to fit your playstyle. Some upgrades take up more space than others on your panel. My typical arsenal included the option to start each race with a monster truck transformation item that gives you a significant speed boost and also lets you trample over enemies in your path. Having something like that takes up multiple slots on your panel, but it’s an excellent way to get a head start at the beginning of a race.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>While that’s a one-and-done boost, a lot of the upgrades help you throughout a race, such as performing speed boosting air tricks faster, making your drift a little smoother, or offensive-based upgrades like giving yourself a boost every time you collide with an enemy kart. You can race in cars or the Extreme Gear hoverboards, which will define your playstyle, but your Gadget Panel lets you fine-tune it into something unique and personalized. I use the monster truck at the beginning of the race, but after I’ve gotten my head start, I want to make sure I have a smooth ride as I pass the rest of these slowpokes, so I use the rest of my panel to make my drifts faster and get a speed boost when I bump into others.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds | Competition Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1nIhfo2X0oI?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Having all those spinning plates on screen at once would overwhelm </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>if it had taken </span><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span>’s 24-player races as a challenge. However, </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>maintains a 12-player limit on its races, and after all the </span><i><span>World </span></i><span>I’d been playing, it’s become pretty clear to me that this is the sweet spot.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Yeah, having 24 players on a track at once is a good technical showcase for the Switch 2 and feeds into the usual “bigger = better” mentality that permeates through most video games, but it has also turned out to be one of </span><i><span>World</span></i><span>’s biggest frustrations. By design, if there are more racers on a track, the slightest setback will inherently give more players a chance to pass by you. One well-timed blue shell can send a first-place winner back a dozen placements with not enough time or resources to regain the lead. So much of </span><i><span>Mario Kart </span></i><span>is determined by the luck of the draw. If you get the right item, you can Bullet Bill your way to the front of the pack, but you might get something less useful. </span><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds </span></i><span>has the same item-based play, but its Gadget loadouts leave your playstyle less to chance, and its 12-player races mean that the slightest misstep isn’t punished by being tossed down the rankings into an oblivion you can’t drive out of. It adds fun complexities without becoming chaotic and convoluted to the point where only the sweatiest among us can reach first place.</span></p> <p><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span> is doing a lot of things right, and in light of a relatively lukewarm reception for its biggest competitor, </span><i><span>Mario </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>are potentially on an even playing field, and the blue blur could come out on top for the first time in a while. I may not be thrilled with the crossover slop this time around, but I’m eager to get on my board as Shadow when </span><i><span>Crossworlds </span></i><span>launches on September 25.</span></p>
