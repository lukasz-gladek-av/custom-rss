            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure</span></i><span>, the latest game in the narrative-driven adventure game series,</span> <span>ended on a cliffhanger </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review-max-chloe-1851685215"><span>in 2024</span></a><span>. It’s little surprise, then, that despite some </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-strange-double-exposure-award-gdc-2025-layoffs-1851771282"><span>strife at developer Deck Nine Games</span></a><span>, it seems–based on a leaked PEGI rating that has been since yoinked off the rating board’s official site–to be getting a sequel. Despite Square Enix’s efforts to plug the leak, the </span><a href="https://x.com/DomTheBomb/status/2009008464127721907"><span>internet remembers all</span></a><span>, so we know the game is apparently going to be called </span><i><span>Life Is Strange: Reunion</span></i><span>, and we also know a bit about the game’s premise thanks to an accompanying synopsis. Some folks are probably celebrating what </span><i><span>Reunion</span></i><span> might entail, but I have questions.</span></p>  <p><span>The full summary that was removed from the PEGI site reads as follows:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>Chloe Price was Max Caulfield’s partner in time… Losing her is Max’s greatest regret. Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max’s help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>So there’s a lot to unpack in these few sentences, but to get the obvious out of the way, the “reunion” the game’s title seems to refer to is one between Max and Chloe, the two leads of the original </span><i><span>Life Is Strange</span></i><span>. At the end of that game, you make a choice that either sees Chloe die or sees the two ride off to an unknown future together, though if you choose the latter, the events of </span><i><span>Double Exposure </span></i><span>find the two characters taking some time apart. The decision was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-chloe-relationship-1851673763"><span>unpopular with long-time fans</span></a><span>, but </span><i><span>Double Exposure </span></i><span>did suggest that the two may reunite down the line, and even if I was bummed that Chloe wasn’t in the game, I admired </span><i><span>Double Exposure</span></i><span>’s commitment to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-endings-chloe-1851538397"><span>respecting both endings</span></a><span> of the original. Now, however, it sounds like Chloe will be part of </span><i><span>Reunion</span></i><span>, perhaps regardless of whatever the player did in the 2015 original?</span></p>

 <p><span>The fact that Deck Nine had players import the Chloe choice into </span><i><span>Double Exposure</span></i><span> through an early dialogue option makes me hopeful the team isn’t just throwing away the possibility that Chloe died at the end of the first game in reaction to the backlash it got for omitting Max’s foul-mouthed, punk rock best (girl)friend. The line in the synopsis about Chloe being “haunted by nightmares and impossible memories” makes me wonder if some time travel nonsense could be used to make Chloe show up in </span><i><span>Reunion </span></i><span>even if you did choose the ending in which she dies. Perhaps these “impossible memories” are ones involving both versions of events? </span><i><span>Double Exposure </span></i><span>has a lot of timeline jumping; maybe this could have affected Chloe as a character existing in many quantum states due to Max’s time traveling?</span></p>

 <p><span>Whatever the case, games that undermine player choice are a pet peeve of mine, which is a big reason why I’m anxious about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-n7-day-bioware-blog-teaser-url-krogan-2000642122"><i><span>Mass Effect 5</span></i></a><i><span>. </span></i><span>There are a lot of fans who would be content if BioWare just declared one of the original trilogy’s final decisions canon and picked it up from there, so it seems like a real possibility, but I’m not one of them. It was encouraging to see Deck Nine make a big hoopla of maintaining </span><i><span>Life Is Strange</span></i><span>’s continuity in </span><i><span>Double Exposure</span></i><span>, and I hope the team has put in the effort to carry it through to </span><i><span>Reunion </span></i><span>as well. Hopefully we don’t have to wait too long to find out more about this game. The thought of speculating about this for several months is already making my head hurt.</span></p>

              <p>There is still some good left in this world. We’re getting a new, still officially untitled, <a href="https://kotaku.com/goat-trailer-fart-joke-jackass-sony-zootopia-funny-teaser-2000656133"><em>Jackass</em></a>, and we don’t have to wait a decade like last time. The new comedy is set to arrive in June.</p> <p>On January 8, <em>Jackass</em> ringleader Johnny Knoxville <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTPFikrEXfX/?img_index=1">posted the iconic skull and crutches logo</a> for the franchise on Instagram, with the date June 26 below it. In the text for the post, he confirmed that, yes, a new <em>Jackass</em> movie is a go. Expect lots of wild stunts, gross moments, and of course, some injuries.</p>   <p>“Well, a wang dang and hot damn doodle, we are starting the year off with a bang,” said Knoxville on Instagram. “We wanted to let you know that this summer, Jackass is back!! We will see you in theatres June 26th. More to come, but wanted you to hear it from us first!”</p> <p>That’s all the official information we have at the moment. We don’t know who is returning or which guest stars will be making an appearance in the upcoming comedy flick. In the last movie, 2022’s<em> Jackass Forever</em>, most of the original <em>Jackass</em> crew from the 2000s era TV show on MTV returned, with the notable exceptions of Bam Margera and Ryan Dunn. Margera has struggled with substance abuse issues for years, and while sober now, has had a rocky relationship with the <em>Jackass</em> crew and is likely not returning in the next film. Dunn sadly died in 2011. His last <em>Jackass</em> movie was 2010’s <em>Jackass 3. </em>For <em>Jackass Forever, </em>the crew also added some younger talent to help out. No word if they will be returning this time around.</p>

 <p>The <em>Jackass</em> franchise is a big success for Paramount, with the four main films, and the <em>Bad Grandpa</em> spin-off, bringing in over $560 million worldwide at the box office on relatively tiny budgets. <a href="https://kotaku.com/jackass-forever-the-game-ps2-review-psp-mtv-knoxville-1848487592">There was even a <em>Jackass</em> video game released in 2007. It was bad. Don’t play it.&nbsp;</a></p>

              <p>Do you find yourself routinely trying to improve your computer setup, but you have too many cables to make it feasible? You might want to think about getting a multiport. They’re affordable, and thanks to the deal we’ve located, you can get one even cheaper than usual. Plus, you can set up your workstation using just a single USB-C port.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6707/">Get the UGREEN USB C Hub 5 in 1 Multiport at Amazon for only $9.99 (from $15.99), which is a $6 discount and approximately 38% in savings</a>.

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6707/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An affordable way to improve your compact PC setup</h2>
<p>Here’s how it works. This multi-port adapter instantly adds additional ports to your existing device’s USB-C port when plugged in. When connected via USB-C you can add peripherals like a keyboard, a mouse, a flash drive or external hard drive to your central device, all without needing to swap cables every few minutes. It can essential help turn thin laptops and tablets into more powerful desktop setups when needed. For example, it’s useful whether you’re moving between a home office, a classroom or coffee shop.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can connect your device to a monitor, television or projector for a better viewing experience on a larger screen. This is beneficial for watching movies on a larger screen, displaying slides in a professional environment or extending your display to keep multiple windows open simultaneously.</p>



<p>As compact as they are, most hubs are designed to direct cable flow away from your hands to maintain a clean and organized workspace. The small and lightweight design of the UGREEN USB C Hub 5 in 1 Multiport makes it easy to fit into a laptop case or backpack pocket and allows you to take it wherever you go without giving it a second thought.

It’s a practical and affordable upgrade that gives you plenty of space to work with when it comes to compact setups. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6707/">And perhaps most importantly, it’s just $9.99</a>. That’s super affordable, and well worth picking up whether you shop for yourself or others as a gift. Anyone can appreciate the gift of efficiency, especially in a world where complex computing can be the norm.</p>
