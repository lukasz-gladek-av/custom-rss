              <p>Rockstar Games seems to be playing cat-and-mouse with some <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-online-the-kotaku-review-1844188338"><em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em></a> players who are using newly added tools to recreate the assassination of Charlie Kirk in the extremely popular online open-world crime simulator.</p> <p>In September of last year, right-wing commentator <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-helldivers-bullet-engraving-2000625439">Charlie Kirk was shot in the neck and killed</a> during a public appearance at a college in Utah. In the weeks that followed, many people, <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-announces-jimmy-kimmel-return-tuesday-boycott-back-abc-not-canceled-2000627662">including Jimmy Kimmel,</a> found themselves in trouble for commenting or joking about it. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ready-or-not-community-manager-fired-for-responding-to-charlie-kirk-assassination-with-nothing-was-lost-2000627182">Some even lost their jobs</a>. Then, in December, right before the new year, Rockstar added a mission creator to<em> GTA Online,</em> letting players make their own solo missions. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cinemascrubs/video/7582722056542784799">And it didn’t take long for</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1143251116647159/posts/1673819406923658/">some creators to start recreating Kirk’s killing in <em>GTA Online</em></a>, leading to an ongoing situation where it seems Rockstar is trying (and failing) to stop these assassination-themed missions from spreading.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Rockstar Games has added the term "Charlie Kirk" to the profanity filter in GTA Online after someone created this mission: <a href="https://t.co/oEubYl6TG6">pic.twitter.com/oEubYl6TG6</a></p> <p>— GTA 6 Info (@GTASixInfo) <a href="https://twitter.com/GTASixInfo/status/2010798891269243103?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On January 12, <a href="https://x.com/gtasixinfo/status/2010798891269243103?s=46">the Twitter account GTA 6Info posted</a> a clip of what appears to be a user-created <em>GTA Online</em>&nbsp;mission called “We Are Charlie Kirk” that features the player being tasked with killing a man standing outside behind various props in a location that looks like a college campus. Once the man is killed, the mission is completed. GTA 6Info also claimed in the tweet that because of this mission, Rockstar Games has now added “Charlie Kirk” to <em>GTA Online’</em>s profanity filter. The tweet went viral, but it’s unclear if Rockstar did, in fact, add Kirk’s name to any such filter and if that particular mission is the reason.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted Rockstar Games for more information.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000659042" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659042"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659042">©Rockstar Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>However, while <em>Kotaku</em> can’t confirm the specific claim in that tweet, it can verify that if you try to search for “Charlie Kirk” on the official custom jobs site for<em> GTA Online</em>, you’ll be greeted with an error regardless of which platform you pick. This also happens if you try to search for a slur or other vulgar term blocked by Rockstar. You can still search for <a href="https://socialclub.rockstargames.com/jobs/Charlie/?dateRangeCreated=last7&amp;platform=ps5&amp;sort=likes&amp;title=gtav">Charlie</a> or <a href="https://socialclub.rockstargames.com/jobs/Kirk/?dateRangeCreated=last7&amp;platform=ps5&amp;sort=likes&amp;title=gtav">Kirk separately</a>, and doing so will reveal that previously shared Kirk-themed maps, like the one from that viral video, seem to have been removed from <em>GTA Onlin</em>e sometime between December 10, when the mission creator tool was added to the game, and today. Players appear to be using “Charlie Pink” or mashing his first and last names together to try and get around what appear to be Rockstar’s attempt to make it much harder to find and share these missions.</p>

 <p>The question now is whether Rockstar Games will continue to play cat-and-mouse with creators trying to build and share recreations of Kirk’s murder.&nbsp; And if so, for how long will this trend continue in the live-service game? If I know the internet, Rockstar has a hard job ahead of it, especially as rumors of a banned topic spread online and entice more creators to try their luck at getting around any possible filters. <a href="https://kotaku.com/nba-2k26-charlie-kirk-character-creator-neck-tattoo-2000629891">We saw something like this happen in<em> NBA 2K26 </em>last year,</a> with players using the in-game creator tools to create bloody characters referencing the killing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>An indie developer behind a <em>Balatro</em>-looking <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-gen-ai-larian-bg3-reddit-ama-2000658429">AI-generated</a> roguelike card game that launched in 2025 has announced that he is deleting the game from Steam after a girl he’s been dating for a bit helped him realize it was a “disgrace to all game makers.”</p> <p>On January 10, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3435450/view/525364745339929910">the store page for indie card game <em>Hardest</em> on Steam posted a surprising update</a>. According to developer Eero Laine, he’ll be removing <em>Hardest</em> completely from the Steam store on January 30. According to the update, <em>Hardest</em> was made in Summer 2025 using free tools provided by the developer’s university, and according to him, at the time, he didn’t realize the effect that AI tech can have on people’s jobs and the environment. <em>Hardest</em> was released on Steam in July 2025 and is free to play.</p> <p><wbr>“I made [<em>Hardest</em>] during the summer in couple months [sic] and thought to use AI because in university there is so much brainwashing on students and all the tools are given for free, so I could generate unlimited images for free,” said the developer on Steam in a post titled AI Is Bad. “But I have realized the AI is not actually free, and it has a major effect on the economy and environment. Some AI companies can use this game just existing as a reason the get more investment for their AI companies[sic], that benefit no one, but rather suck resources from the economy from hard working people.”</p> <p>According to Laine, he coded “everything” himself in <em>Hardest</em>, so in the future, he might try to build a new game with “real assets” using his past non-AI code. Laine concluded the Steam update with:&nbsp;<wbr>“But the game existing in its current form is a disgrace to all game makers and players. Ethically only logical reason is to delete the game from Steam. The girl I’ve been dating for a month made me realize this.”</p> <p>I’m not 100 percent sure, but I think this might be the first time someone has deleted a game from Steam because their new partner convinced them it was a disgrace and should be removed from the planet. Harsh, but in the case of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ai-generated-rpg-pixel-art-viral-elder-scrolls-daggerfall-2000616694">AI-generated</a> slop, accurate. Kudos to that young woman for doing some good work. And I hope Laine’s next game is great and not filled with ugly AI-generated art.&nbsp;<wbr><wbr></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-2-tlou-remastered-review-1851167660"><i><span>The Last of Us Part II</span></i></a><span> may soon get a mod that supports multiplayer gameplay. Modder Speclizer </span><a href="https://x.com/speclizer_/status/2010075024838013235"><span>shared</span></a><span> recent test gameplay of their work-in-progress that showcased two Ellies bounding through a field together. As the PC mod is still in development, the Ellies aren’t currently able to do much other than hang out and run around but it’s already making fans pine for a proper multiplayer mode.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The mod aims to eventually add PvP combat to </span><i><span>TLOU2</span></i><span>, and would not feature multiplayer support for the game’s story mode or any interactions with NPCs. Speclizer also </span><a href="https://x.com/Speclizer_/status/2010121847032123734"><span>implied</span></a><span> that the mod is exploratory, and not guaranteed to be completed. It might become the unofficial version of the online mode fans have wanted for the sequel, or might just end up another failed fan project.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our first test of our multiplayer mod for The Last of Us 2 on PC, very broken and not a lot has been implemented yet.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheLastofUsPartII?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheLastofUsPartII</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Factions?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Factions</a> <a href="https://t.co/mTwLSjhDV8">pic.twitter.com/mTwLSjhDV8</a></p> <p>— Speclizer (@Speclizer_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Speclizer_/status/2010075024838013235?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 10, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Many fans are still mourning </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/last-us-online-factions-multiplayer-ps5-naughty-dog-1851101434"><span>the cancellation of </span><i><span>The Last of Us Online</span></i></a><span>, an official multiplayer spinoff of the beloved franchise which Naughty Dog terminated two years ago. The decision to cancel </span><i><span>The Last of Us Online</span></i><span>—previously known by fans as </span><i><span>Factions</span></i><span> based on the original 2013 PlayStation 3 game’s multiplayer mode—was made in order to prioritize developing future single-player titles, such as the upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-last-of-us-naughty-dog-1851721022"><i><span>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</span></i></a><span>. Speclizer’s mod is an exciting peek into what could’ve been.</span></p>

 <p><span>Other </span><i><span>The Last of Us Part II </span></i><span>mods from Speclizer include a battle mode mod that allows players to design their own encounters; a “Spare or Kill” ending that lets players choose to murder Abby; restorations of deleted game features like a Listen Mode alternative; and a dog companion mod. Speclizer also modded </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span> to make Kratos gigantic.</span></p>

 <p><span>While Speclizer’s latest mod may not necessarily contain robust features—let alone ever be completed—it’s a notable step forward in the </span><i><span>TLOU2</span></i><span> modding community. It could even potentially provide the groundwork for future multiplayer mods, or at least inspire future development. Perhaps </span><i><span>The Last of Us Online</span></i><span> will one day exist as an entirely fan-made project.</span></p>
