              <p><span>After six years, the clowning is over. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-september-release-date-trailer-2000619152"><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong </span></i><span>is coming to a PC, Switch, Xbox, or PlayStation near you on September 4</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>has been conspicuously absent from industry events for so long that the act of anticipating the elusive Metroidvania has become a meme in and of itself. Now that it’s imminent, what does the internet do with all that pent-up energy? They draw, yell, and celebrate.</span></p> <p><span>So far, the most prominent reaction to the </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>news beyond keyboard smashing is art that represents the end of a meme.

The joke got so popular that someone </span><a href="https://stufa.itch.io/hollow-knight-clown-skin"><span>modded it into the original game</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-gamescom-2025-livestream-what-time-fallout-black-ops-7-2000618270"><span>Geoff Keighley even referenced it</span></a><span> ahead of Gamescom’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460"><span>Opening Night Live show</span></a><span>, where </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>made an appearance.

              <p><em>Star Trek: Voyager</em> is a very unlikely subject for one of the best games of the turn of the millennium. And yet, that game exists! <em>Star Trek Voyager: Elite Force</em> was one of the best FPS games of its generation! Heck, <em>Elite Force II&nbsp;</em>was pretty damned good, too, and there was almost a Looking Glass game based on the franchise in the mid-90s! Clearly German publisher Daedalic is hoping to capture a little of the same magic with its announcement of <em>Star Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown</em>, a “story-based survival strategy game” set on board the spaceship lost on the other side of the galaxy.</p> <p>With some very hefty&nbsp;<em>FTL</em>&nbsp;vibes, <em>Star Trek Voyager: </em><em>Across the Unknown</em> (<em>VATU</em>) is played on a sublimely lovely cutaway view of the side of Voyager, presented as if on a&nbsp;<em>Star Trek</em> display screen. We’ll be captaining the ship as it explores “12 vast sectors” of the Delta Quadrant, the farthest point in the galaxy from our own Alpha territory. This involves managing the ship’s systems and crew, doing all that good&nbsp;<em>Star Trek</em> diplomacy, and facing a bunch of moral decisions that will apparently shape how you experience your run through the game. And yes, run through, because this is intended to be replayed,&nbsp;<em>FTL</em>-style, with the ship rearranging its layout and apparently even being “re-imagined” based on the path you take through the quadrant.</p> <p>The trailer, which mostly features lovely images of the USS Voyager swishing and swooping around in space, gives an incredibly brief glimpse of the game itself, which seems a bit of an odd shame given how lovely it looks when you see it. Also, note that somehow Daedalic doesn’t seem to have been able to license the original theme tune, which is very odd.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Star Trek: Voyager - Across the Unknown | Announcement Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s-0brgSYDEM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>So why&nbsp;<em>Voyager</em>? For those who failed to become stranded in the Delta Quadrant in 1995, this was the third ’90s <em>Trek</em> series, starting when&nbsp;<em>The Next Generation</em> had come to an end, and midway through the run of <em>Deep Space Nine</em>. However, it quickly separated itself (mostly) from the overlapping storylines of those shows by having the fancy new ship leave DS9 to head to the Badlands to investigate the naughty actions of Starfleet rebels, the Marquis. Except, when it gets to them it gets attacked by some wobbly space wave and finds the remains of its crew, and the remains of the Marquis members, flung across the galaxy to completely uncharted space. The two opposing halves have to form a functioning crew and, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons_(TV_series)"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> cartoon-style, endlessly try to find their way home.</p> <p>Given that the adventures all took place far from Starfleet and thus Voyager was unable to be aided by other friendly ships in the faction, it does make sense to use the show for your <em>FTL</em>-like. On the other hand, though, you’re limiting your audience to people who remember a 30-year-old TV show. Yes, I know <em>you</em> remember it, and you’re thinking, “How can anyone not remember&nbsp;<em>Voyager</em>?! It had Seven of Nine in it!” But let me assure you that nearly everyone born in the last 30 years is wondering why you’re shouting out numbers with that creepy look in your eyes. “This game isn’t about nostalgia,” says the game’s director at developer gameXcite (that’s the one time I’ll capitalize their studio name as they want us to), in a press release promoting the game based on the decades-old license loved by nerds in their 40s and 50s. “It’s about giving players the conn and letting them chart their own course through the unknown.”</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619163" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619163"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619163">© Daedalic</figcaption></figure> <p>Which then does rather raise the next big oddity. Gives us the conn? But shouldn’t Captain Janeway have the conn? The descriptions of the game that have appeared so far seem very ambiguous about this, especially as it does seem to be using the original crew as characters.</p>

 <p>The big selling point here are some very grand promises to let you rewrite the story of <em>Voyager</em> quite significantly. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2643390/Star_Trek_Voyager__Across_the_Unknown/">game’s description on Steam</a> suggests it’ll be granting all manner of “what if?” scenarios, including the consequences of Voyager adding Borg technology to its systems as it attempts to recover from the initial disaster. “Did you ever wonder what would have happened had Captain Janeway decided differently?” asks the blurb. “If an important crew member had followed a different path? Or what the outcome would have been had the crew of the <i>U.S.S. Voyager</i> embraced Borg technology to increase their chances of survival?” Uh, no, but I can if you want.</p> <blockquote><p>“Wonder no more: <i>Star Trek Voyager: Across the Unknown</i>&nbsp;allows players to take control and shape the journey of the&nbsp;<i>U.S.S. Voyager</i> as they want. Take a risky approach or play it safe. Be diplomatic or let phasers do the talking. Research technologies that were shunned by the crew. But: Be prepared to deal with the consequences of your actions! The game features rogue-like elements, so in each run you will encounter different situations and even iconic characters might meet an early end if you don’t react accordingly.”</p></blockquote> <p>There are also promises of ship-to-ship combat and away missions, although again it’s not yet entirely clear whether the latter will be under your direct control, or play out as an off-screen event whose outcome is based on the team you selected and the orders you gave. Combat, however, is a bit clearer. “From the bridge, you give commands for offensive and defensive maneuvers, targeting enemy ship systems and using special weaponry,” we’re told. “And even during ship combat, the individual skills of your crew members come into play: Assign battle stations to crew who bring precious skills to the table and trigger them in crucial moments to maximize your combat effectiveness.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000619164" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619164"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619164">© Daedalic</figcaption></figure> <p>This all sounds very ambitious, and I’ve certainly been burned&nbsp;<em>far&nbsp;</em>too many times by games that promise wish-fulfillment variety when what they really mean is a different icon appears on the screen. I’m also a smidge concerned that the team behind it have previously only made a trio of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asterix"><em>Asterix</em></a>-themed products, making this a big step forward. Still, the early footage looks incredible.</p> <p>Right, so what “what if?” scenarios would I like to see for <em>Voyager</em>? I want to do a run where we continue Janeway and Paris’s post-evolution relationship as lizards, where we see them raise their young together and learn how this form is superior to their paltry pre-warp-10 human incarnations. I want one where the crew never brings on Seven of Nine and so people remember <em>Voyager</em> for anything other than there being a pretty robot lady with big boobs. And I want to do one where, on the first encountering of Q, they just tell him to stop fucking around and send them home, and he agrees, and that’s that.</p> <p>There’s no release date yet, but hopefully we’ll soon get some footage of the game actually being played.</p>

              <p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-september-release-date-trailer-2000619152">will arrive seven years after the first game</a>. Why? That’s what fans have been impatiently wondering for a while now. According to the developers at Team Cherry, there was no major drama or development snafus. Seven years is just how long it takes to make the Metroidvania Soulslike sequel to what some fans regard as one of the best games of the last decade.</p> <p>“I remember at some point I just had to stop sketching,” cofounder Ari Gibson <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">told <em>Bloomberg</em> in a new interview</a>. “Because I went, ‘Everything I’m drawing here has to end up in the game. That’s a cool idea, that’s in. That’s a cool idea, that’s in.’ You realize, ‘If I don’t stop drawing, this is going to take 15 years to finish.’”</p> <p>What began as DLC for 2017’s surprise Steam hit <em>Hollow Knight</em> eventually morphed into a full-fledged standalone game. Team Cherry officially revealed <em>Silksong</em> would become a sequel in 2019. The developers told <em>Bloomberg</em> they wanted to keep their team size small so as not to disrupt the creative flow responsible for the first game. But growing scope—bigger boss fights, multiple towns, a denser world—meant it would take even longer to finish, especially if it would exude the same level of tight controls, visual polish, and world-building mystery of the original <em>Hollow Knight</em>.</p>

 <p>When Microsoft doubled down in 2022 on the promise that <em>Silksong</em> would arrive within the year, that was apparently the actual goal. “We did genuinely believe that was the case,” cofounder William Pellen confirmed. “There was a period of two to three years when I thought it was going to come out within a year.” The team just kept biting off more than it could chew while also calmly ignoring all of the online chatter about unhinged fans.</p> <p>“I think we’re always underestimating the amount of time and effort it’ll take us to achieve things,” Gibson told <em>Bloomberg</em>. “It’s also that problem where, because we’re having fun doing it, it’s not like, ‘It’s taking longer, this is awful, we really need to get past this phase.’ It’s, ‘This is a very enjoyable space to be in. Let’s perpetuate this with some new ideas.’”</p> <p>It seems to have helped that the original <em>Hollow Knight</em> has now sold 15 million copies, Team Cherry revealed. <em>Silksong</em> is already Steam’s most-wishlisted game. If it lives up to even a fraction of the hype, the team won’t be forced to release their next game any time soon, either.</p>

              <p>Welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of video game news and other stuff you might care about. Today we have information about the future of <em>Forza</em>, news about Sony and EVO, and some fresh details about that new Lego Batman game. Also: get excited about The Gorillaz coming to <em>Fortnite</em>.</p> <h2>The Gorillaz are coming to <em>Fortnite</em></h2> <p>New leaks seem to indicate that the famous animated band The Gorillaz will be the next <em>Fortnite Festival</em> headlining act. This means the characters from the band will appear in-game as skins and some of their music will be added to <em>Festival</em>, too. The last few artists haven’t been very exciting, but bringing in the Gorillaz has my attention. Expect Epic to start teasing this next week or sooner, and then for the Gorillaz to arrive on August 26 when the current Bruno Mars season wraps up.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">GORILLAZ x FORTNITE INFO — AUGUST 26</p> <p>• 2D &amp; Noodle are most likely Item Shop<br>• Murdoc &amp; Russel are Festival Pass (Official Look) <a href="https://t.co/SnbqIstFTZ">pic.twitter.com/SnbqIstFTZ</a></p> <p>— HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1958249205195251776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>The next <em>Forza Horizon</em> game is likely set in Japan</h2> <p>There’s been a lot of rumors that the next <em>Forza Horizon</em> open-world racing game would be set in Japan and well, here’s some evidence that the speculation is probably correct. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-location-leaked-by-car-import-company-fans-believe">As reported by <em>IGN</em></a>, in a now-deleted social media post, a car importing company shared an image that claimed someone working on <em>Forza</em> came by to take scans and photos of a car made by Japanese manufacturer Kei. The post claimed this would be used in the next <em>Forza Horizon</em> game. Oops! But hey, a new <em>Forza Horizon</em> set in Japan sounds great.</p>

 <h2><em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em> is making the leap to Xbox</h2> <p>During Xbox’s Gamescom stream, it was announced that <em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em> is coming to Xbox Series X|S and Game Pass on September 17. I’m a big fan of this <em>Vampire Survivors</em>-like shoot ’em up and play it all the time on my Steam Deck, so I’m excited to play it on my Xbox and earn some achievements.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor releases Sept 17th on Xbox and coming to Game Pass <a href="https://t.co/ZQgVQeK8Is">pic.twitter.com/ZQgVQeK8Is</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1958524899758113136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>That new <em>Lego Batman</em> game will have Riddler trophies to find</h2> <p>That newly announced <em>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em> game looks to be the <em>Arkham</em> sequel fans have wanted for years now. And adding to that feeling is the confirmation from folks who have played the game at Gamescom that there will be <a href="https://youtu.be/sbOodsqBSmk?t=472">Riddler trophies and puzzles spread around the game’s open world</a> waiting for players to find and collect them all. Good luck with that.</p> <h2>Analogue delays its fancy N64 console…again</h2> <p>Analogue’s fancy, 4K Nintendo 64 console has been delayed again. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogue-delays-its-n64-remake-console-yet-again-205343467.html">On August 20, the company announced</a> that the highly anticipated retro games machine had been delayed again until Q4 2025. The $250 Analogue 3D was previously delayed in March and July. Hopefully, this new delay is the last one, and we’ll get our hands on this cool-looking console later this year.</p> <h2>Sony is selling its stake in the fighting game event EVO</h2> <p>Around four years ago, Sony spent a lot of money to buy up popular fighting game tournament EVO. It was weird! And in the years since, it’s remained a weird thing. And now, that era is ending as <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/145596/sony-sells-evo-co-ownership-nodwin-gaming?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Sony announced on August 21</a> that it was selling its ownership stake to co-owner NODWIN Gaming. Sony will remain a sponsor of future EVO events.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-switch-2-framerate-footage-video-gamescom-2000618923"><em>Elden Ring</em> is struggling to run on the Switch 2</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-the-game-announced-will-feature-multiplayer-and-solo-story-mode-2000618930">Michael Myers is back in a newly announced <em>Halloween</em> game</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-layoffs-2k-games-delay-2000618914"><em>Bioshock 4</em> studio gutted by recent layoffs</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Militsioner - Official Public Playtest Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c18RAdJs5Iw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>
