              <p>It’s not quite 2026 yet and the release calendar is already getting shuffled around. IO Interactive just confirmed its upcoming James Bond game won’t release as previously scheduled. Instead, <em>007: First Light</em> will get a few more months in the oven as it snags <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>‘s old release date.</p> <p>Originally set to arrive on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, and PC on March 27, 2026, the stealth action game will now launch on May 27, 2026. The <em>Hitman</em> maker said <em>007: First Light</em> was in good shape but the delay would allow for extra polish.</p> <p>Here’s IO Interactive’s full statement:</p> <blockquote><p>Today, we are sharing an update regarding 007 First Light, as we have decided to move the game’s release by two months, to May 27, 2026.</p> <p>007 First Light is our most ambitious project to date, and the team has been fully focused on delivering an unforgettable James Bond experience, bringing together breathtaking action, globe-trotting, spycraft, gadgets, car chases, and more. As an independent developer and publisher, this decision allows us to ensure the experience meets the level of quality you players deserve on day one.</p> <p>The game is progressing well and is fully playable from beginning to end, so these additional two months will allow us to further polish and refine the experience, ensuring we deliver the strongest possible version at launch. We’re confident this sets 007 First Light up for long-term success, and we sincerely appreciate the patience and continued support we’ve received ever since we revealed the game. We look forward to sharing more updates regarding 007 First Light in early 2026.</p></blockquote>

              <p><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>fans had to wait over a year for their Limited Run Games special edition of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560"><i><span>Sonic X Shadow Generations</span></i></a><span>. The remaster/excellent pack-in game launched in October of 2024, but with multiple shipment delays, it took 14 months between launch day and the special edition’s arrival on fans’ doorsteps. Was it worth the wait? Absolutely not.</span></p> <p><span>Several fans are reporting that the package’s Sonic and Shadow statues are showing up with various defects. Some have scratches, others have misprinted eyes, and one poor soul’s Shadow arrived with his nose broken off. The special edition cost $249.99 before taxes and shipping, and after a year-long wait, I would also be livid if this is what showed up in the mail.</span></p>

              <p>The PvP nature of multiplayer extraction shooter <em>Arc Raiders</em> has been contentious since the game’s launch. There are many who see the ability to kill and be killed by other players are vital for the game’s tension and enjoyment. There are others who argue it’s antithetical to the conventions of a game in which a scant, brave few are trying to bring back resources to those living underground. Either way, <em>Arc Raiders</em> players have reached a fascinating and fragile understanding in which most people, most of the time, don’t kill. So when a retired pro gamer shows up and just starts slaughtering everything, it’s…well, it’s just rude!</p> <p>As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-just-started-i-have-nothing-retired-pro-gamer-goes-viral-for-relentlessly-killing-casual-arc-raiders-players-but-is-it-griefing-or-just-fair-pvp"><em>IGN</em> reports</a>, Taylor “THump” Humphries—a former pro at games like&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends</em>,&nbsp;<em>Rocket Arena</em>, and&nbsp;<em>H1Z1</em>—has decided to spend his spare time taking out as many “casual” players as he can in Embark’s breakout hit game. On recent Twitch streams, THump has been broadcasting himself <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thump/clip/ThoughtfulGracefulRhinocerosPunchTrees-6vUn_UhjhRo_L3KC">griefing in&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em></a> for, seemingly, his lone amusement. His most recent stream, a grueling 13 hours long, is primarily the guy killing other players in a game in which most people opt to be peaceful.</p>

  <div> <p><span>Now, let me stress, he’s doing nothing </span><em>wrong</em><span>.&nbsp;</span><em>Arc Raiders</em><span> has PvP for a really good reason: it makes it a thousand times more tense to play. Were it only PvE (and honestly, all the wrong parts of me dearly wishes it were), then every interaction with another player would become banal, lacking the terrifying hope for uneasy, fleeting alliances that make it so exciting. Every time a player deliberately kills you, it feels like wanton betrayal, though it’s clearly well within the rules.</span></p> </div> <p>The issue with THump’s murderstreams is that the entire exercise is the video game equivalent of shitposting. His commentary is incessant irony, with him laughing as he makes other people sad. And, I dunno, I’m too old and tired to find that shit funny. Somehow this is proving entertaining enough to the streamer that he’s doing it night after night of late, most recently delighting in lobbing grenades.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Logging in with a full inventory of trigger nades and killing everyone trying to get re-looted after the expedition is a joy. Trigger nades do NOT need a nerf! Live<a href="https://t.co/hiY3uPb3e7">https://t.co/hiY3uPb3e7</a> <a href="https://t.co/DuaFRCGlUi">pic.twitter.com/DuaFRCGlUi</a></p> <p>— THUMP (@THump) <a href="https://twitter.com/THump/status/2003213487397568807?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>A few days back, it was <a href="https://x.com/THump/status/2001729907760730180">this post on X</a> that really riled people up, as THump dropped a clip of his killing a party of four at the very start of a run, when they didn’t even have any loot to steal. “We just started, I have nothing,” said the first person he killed. “What scum man,” they added after the second kill.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I love killing grown men that have jobs and children as they are trying to get 5 million credits for the expedition. Killing all teamers in solos, live now.<a href="https://t.co/hiY3uPb3e7">https://t.co/hiY3uPb3e7</a> <a href="https://t.co/ncHTgNMT1x">pic.twitter.com/ncHTgNMT1x</a></p> <p>— THUMP (@THump) <a href="https://twitter.com/THump/status/2001729907760730180?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Given THump’s a troll, his responses to those objecting—<a href="https://x.com/THump/status/2002365789475660245">such as</a> “I come from a place where PvP is not optional…<span>it’s a way of life. You want optional PvP go play <em>WoW</em></span>“—are obviously insincere. When one person calls him “another toxic streamer,” and suggests he’d have a better time helping other players rather than killing them, <a href="https://x.com/THump/status/2001832306106159267">he replies</a>, “Id rather ruin others time than have fun myself.”</p>

 <p>But, again, he’s not doing anything wrong. While THump’s repeated claims of innocence, that he’s just killing other players “in a PvP game,” are clearly disingenuous, there’s no arguing that <em>Arc Raiders</em> isn’t designed to facilitate it. Honestly, as much as seeing someone do this for clout is embarrassing to watch, I take huge solace in knowing that his actions are something that stands out among players. I really rather love that this ostensibly PvP game has somehow engendered a player base that, 90 percent of the time, opts not to kill, even when there’s personal gain in doing so. In 2025, that feels like a beacon of hope, and a douche like THump exploiting it only highlights how valuable it is.</p>

 <p><span>That episode, titled “I’ll Believe in Anything,” is currently rated as the second-best episode of television ever by </span><a href="https://www.imdb.com/search/title/?title_type=tv_episode&amp;num_votes=1000,&amp;sort=user_rating,desc"><span>IMDB users</span></a><span>, topped (teehee) only by </span><i><span>Breaking Bad</span></i><span>’s “Ozymandias.” Both episodes have a perfect 10-star score, but&nbsp;<em>Heated Rivalry</em>‘s up there with just 31,000 votes compared to <em>Breaking Bad</em>‘s 273,000.<br> </span></p>
