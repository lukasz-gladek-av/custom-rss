            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first trailer for <em>Project Hail Mary</em> has appeared, with Ryan Gosling playing the lead in an adaptation of Andy Weir’s novel of the same name. It’s a story about a man trying to save the sun, but as the trailer also sets up, it’s a far more intimate tale about one man’s relationship with something completely other.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Andy Weir’s first book, <em>The Martian</em>, was an extraordinary break-out hit, and well deserved to be. The tale of a smart, innovative man stranded on Mars went on to have a great movie based on it, directed by legendary filmmaker Ridley Scott. It was a glorious success story...and then Weir published <em>Artemis</em>. Oh good lord, what a fall. An astoundingly terrible book, it is one of the most excruciating examples of the “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.jezebel.com/strong-female-characters-arent-enough-goddammit-1592135553&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.jezebel.com/strong-female-characters-arent-enough-goddammit-1592135553">strong female character</a></span>” trope, and while rights to make a movie were purchased before it was published, it’s not really a surprise that nothing’s happened with that since 2018.</p><p>Fears that the author, who self-published <em>The Martian</em> after being rejected by various imprints, might be a one-hit-wonder grew, until 2021's <em>Project Hail Mary</em> appeared, and was a completely compelling piece of sci-fi on par with his first book. Phew! And now, we have a first trailer for the inevitable movie adaptation, starring Ryan Gosling as the book’s main character, Ryland Grace. Even better, the screenplay is by Drew Goddard, who not only wrote <em>The Cabin in the Woods</em>, <em>Cloverfield</em>, and many episodes of <em>Buffy</em>, <em>Angel</em> and <em>Lost</em>, but also adapted <em>The Martian</em>. Oh, and it’s being directed by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, the pair behind <em>The Lego Movie</em> and the writers of the<em> Into The Spider-Verse </em>movies.</p><p>So Ryland Grace is a junior high science teacher with a specialist background in molecular biology who is rather forcibly drafted to help with an effort by the European Space Agency to investigate a universal phenomenon of “dimming,” whereby stars are losing luminescence, including, rather pressingly, our own. Grace is pressured into joining a years-long mission to a star, Tau Ceti, that is resistant to the dimming, to find out why. Except, as you’d expect, lots goes wrong. But this isn’t a movie about that!</p><p>If you’ve not read the book, the latter third of the trailer might feel like quite a spoiler, and—I dunno—if I were marketing this, I’d have been a bit more subtle. But in truth, it’s actually setting up the vast bulk of the story, and really gives nothing away about the true extent of the narrative.</p><p>This is, without giving any specifics, a story about a unique relationship, and if the film can match the intimacy and uniquely peculiar nature of the novel, it could be very special. Or, the movie could trivialize that aspect and be far more about shit exploding in space. Who knows. But still, it looks pretty and fun so far.</p><p>The movie, which also stars Sandra Hüller, Liz Kingsman, and Lionel Boyce, is headed to theaters in March of next year. I imagine we’ll be seeing a lot more of it before then.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/project-hail-mary-trailer-ryan-gosling-andy-weir-1851785317]]></content:encoded>

I prefer the older version,” wrote one Steam player.” It feels better and looks better. Why couldn’t this just be an update or something? And for the price tag it just feels very meh. And this is one of my all time favorite games too. Just gonna install the older version and play through that.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3169520?updates=true&amp;emclan=103582791475151286&amp;emgid=523095184762732964&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3169520?updates=true&amp;emclan=103582791475151286&amp;emgid=523095184762732964" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sega is now addressing that exact criticism</a></span> by dropping the price to $20 for anyone who already owns the <em>Anniversary Edition</em> and letting fans who already purchased it on PC get a refund through July 10. It also detailed a series of upcoming patches to address the various issues, including “major improvements to chat input, scoreboard layout, and HUD elements,” and “Fixed softlocks, graphical glitches, and input issues in various screens.” Based on some players’ assessment of the <em>Master Crafted</em> Edition in general, however, it still might not be worth picking up. </p><p>The Anniversary Edition is currently 75 percent off, letting us get an already solid version of the old-school FPS for just $10. The <em>Master Crafted Edition </em>was more of a bone for console players anyway, since the <em>Anniversary Edition</em> never came to Xbox or PlayStation, and the original version of <em>Space Marine</em> wasn’t supported by backwards compatibility. Even there, however, Xbox Series X/S players (the game’s free with Game Pass Ultimate) have been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1l9czva/lost_progresssave_on_xbox_series_x_on_master/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Spacemarine/comments/1l9czva/lost_progresssave_on_xbox_series_x_on_master/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complaining about a major bug that’s eating their save files</a></span>. </p><p>“Played earlier today. Shut down the game like I always do, and turned back on today only to get greeted by missing save for campaign,” wrote one player on Reddit a couple of weeks ago. “Happened to me too,” responded another. “I am done with this version of the game for now. I couldn’t play online at all and today I just saw my save is gone.” Refunds aren’t available for that platform though, and the issue doesn’t appear to have been patched out yet. </p><p>The <em>Master Crafted Edition</em> isn’t available on PS5 yet, possibly due to the Game Pass deal with Xbox. Hopefully, all of these issues get ironed out before it arrives. In the meantime, <em>Space Marine 2</em>'s new horde mode isn’t a bad substitute. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-master-crafted-refunds-ps5-1851785318]]></content:encoded>
