Both free <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> betas will take place on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam) and include everything from the first beta test last year as well as a new Gypceros wyvern to hunt. </p><p>The additional free test weekends run February 6 to 9 and February 13 to 16 and run from 7:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. each time. Like the first beta test, these won’t require PS Plus or Game Pass Core subscriptions to play online, either. Capcom said its running the additional betas to give more players a chance to try the game who might have missed the first test back in November.</p><p>But while the publisher said it learned a lot from that weekend in terms of player feedback and complaints, don’t expect anything different this time around. “Please bear in mind that these improvements, including performance, game balance, weapon mechanics, known issues and more will not be reflected in the OBT 2 build,” the company stated this week. </p><p>Those improvements, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWqiYSA-t8E&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWqiYSA-t8E" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">outlined by <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>director Yuya Tokuda in a previous video</a></span>, will eventually include monsters moving to new areas less frequently, and making “hitstop” more noticeable so smacking enemies with giant swords and axes feels more satisfying. The team announced several balance tweaks to weapons as well. It’s unclear why these couldn’t be added to the game for the new betas, which would no doubt have given Capcom even more time to gauge community feedback ahead of the game’s full release. That is, after all, what betas are supposed to be for.</p><p>Instead, fans will have to wait until February 28 to see the changes in action. At that point, anyone who participated in one of the betas will get their bonus rewards like a decorative in-game pendant and a starter item pack of meat, traps, and other monster hunting necessities.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But Ronald appears to want to make a distinction, suggesting the goal of creating a handheld would be to use the company’s expertise gained over decades of making consoles, and bring that to a portable PC. “I would say it’s bringing the best of Xbox and Windows together,” the VP said told <em>The Verge</em>, “because we have spent the last 20 years building a world-class operating system, but it’s really locked to the console.”</p><p>The goal, it seems, is to bring the two together. Or, perhaps more frankly, to make Windows less of a pain in the ass to use on a small screen. It’s something Microsoft hasn’t traditionally been great at. Did you ever own a Windows-based cellphone? I did! Haha! It was so bad. Then remember Microsoft’s last big attempt, with Windows 7's abysmal attempt to become tile-based, compromising its entire UI for the desktops everyone was using it on for the sake of portable devices on which no one was?</p><p>With every tech firm under the sun attempting to ride the success of Valve’s Steam Deck device and launching their own handheld PCs, Microsoft clearly wants a slice of the pie, but perhaps knows that Windows 11 wouldn’t cut it, and that it’d never be able to show its face again if it used a Linux-based interface. That’s likely driving Donald’s declarations of bringing the simpler UX of an Xbox to a Windows-powered portable. However, he’s being coy, telling <em>The Verge</em> “we’ll have a lot more to share later this year.”</p><p>However, what he has to say just now sounds awfully familiar. “I think,” Donald says, “at the end of the day our goal is to make Windows great for gaming on any device.” Which is a refrain we’ve heard countless times across countless iterations of the operating system. Each major new release comes with a major new push to make Windows so great for gaming, and none ever catches on. (Remember when Windows Vista launched, trumpeting a feature that would score your PC’s hardware out of 10, and believed the industry would publish games with a matching score so you’d know if it worked? No? Exactly.) And yet, bizarrely, Windows has <em>always</em> been the default OS for PC gaming, inevitably working far better the less Microsoft has tried to get involved.</p><p>But, as Donald points out, the Xbox OS is sitting on top of a lot of Windows’ code, so it shouldn’t be a herculean task to bring its tiled world across to a handheld device. Obviously it needs to be reworked for a PC such that it never needs a cursor input or a taskbar to be clicked, and sure, the Xbox already manages this, but that’s largely thanks to all the ways it’s defiantly <em>not</em> behaving like a PC, with its incredibly limited settings and locked-down nature. “There’s fundamental interaction models that we’re working on,” says Donald, “to make sure that regardless of the operating system details, it feels very natively like a gaming-centric device and a gaming-centric experience.”</p><p>So, the real message here is, forget about a possible portable Xbox for now, we could well be seeing a portable PC that <em>feels </em>like an Xbox within the year.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you’re among the new PlayStation VR2 owners, you might feel overwhelmed looking at the over 300 games that are compatible with it. Where should you start?</p><p>There are many gems available via PlayStation VR2, ranging from VR-exclusive games to regular games with immersive VR modes. We could sit here all day listing everything worth playing on the console, but for people who just want to see what Sony’s headset can do, these eight games will offer you some of the best experiences the system has to offer. </p></div></div><div><p>It is literally impossible to make a list of the best VR games without starting with <em>Beat Saber</em>. It is the <em>Wii Sports </em>of VR gaming; it’s easy to learn, hard to master, and is a perfect use of motion-controlled technology. Even those who normally don’t take to VR games can enjoy <em>Beat Saber</em>’s straightforward gameplay, and it’s a surprisingly good workout to boot. I mean, it’s dancing with swords, what’s not to like?</p><p>Alternatively, if you like the idea of <em>Beat Saber </em>but don’t have cash to spend now, <strong>Synth Riders offers a similar rhythm game experience</strong> and is included with a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription. So if you have Sony’s subscription service and need something to tide you over, be sure to give that game a look.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/horizon-call-the-mountain-review-ps5-ps-vr2-forbidden-1850121501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-call-the-mountain-review-ps5-ps-vr2-forbidden-1850121501"><em>Horizon Call Of The Mountain</em></a></span><em> </em>honestly feels like a PlayStation VR2 tech demo, but it’s still really fun to play. As the name suggests, this is more a mountain climbing simulator than a VR-ified version of Sony’s flagship <em>Horizon </em>franchise. However, mountain climbing works <em>very </em>well in VR, especially since you can take in all the beautiful AAA-quality sights and get those tingles in your feet when you look down. I’m deathly afraid of heights and still enjoyed my time with this one.</p><p>It’s not a game that’s worth the standalone price of $60, in my opinion. However, since many Sony PlayStation VR2 headsets currently include this game as a pack-in at no additional cost, you’d be silly to pass it by. I liked it a heck of a lot for free.</p></div><div><p>Look, I get it, not everyone is necessarily chomping at the bit to play racing games unless there are red turtle shells involved. Despite that, you really have to give <em>Gran Turismo 7</em> a try if you’re looking for an immersive VR experience. It’s exhilarating to feel yourself in the driver’s seat as you race at 100+ MPH, and the Dualsense controller makes for a great motion-controlled steering wheel with its haptic feedback.</p><p>There’s never been a better time to try <em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstations-gran-turismo-7-is-basically-getting-a-free-1851713486&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstations-gran-turismo-7-is-basically-getting-a-free-1851713486">Sony recently released a free VR2-compatible demo of the game called <em>My First Gran Turismo</em></a></span>.

All I’ll say is that I had to clean the tears off my headset’s lens after I was finished.</p><p>It’s a good experience worth its asking price, but if you can get it for free via PlayStation Plus, this is a no-brainer.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tetris-effect-the-kotaku-review-1830325513&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tetris-effect-the-kotaku-review-1830325513"><em>Tetris Effect</em></a></span><em> </em>is already an incredible audio and visual feast for the senses, so you’re doing yourself a disservice if you haven’t played this one in VR. Also, I mean…it’s <em>Tetris</em>. You know you like <em>Tetris</em>, I know you like <em>Tetris</em>, so trying to explain why <em>Tetris </em>is great is like trying to explain why sunrises are great. <br></p></div><div><p><strong>Currently available with a PlayStation Plus Premium subscription</strong></p><p><em>Synapse </em>asks the question “what’s the most fun thing someone can do in VR” and lands on the answer “do cool telekinesis stuff with one hand while you shoot bad guys with the other.” It’s an incredibly playful use of the technology, and it innovates with its motion controls beyond the usual point-and-shoot antics of other games. This one’s a roguelike too, so even if you have a rough time getting the hang of it, you’ll at least enter your next run stronger.</p><p>Unfortunately, <em>Synapse </em>lacks a bit in content. That might make this one a tough sell for $34.99, but it’s a perfect grab for PlayStation Plus Premium subscribers.</p></div><div><p><em>Resident Evil 4 </em>is one of the most replayable games ever made, so it was no surprise that 2023’s <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> would go down as one of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891">the year’s best games</a></span>. And now, thanks to a free downloadable update that reimagines the game in VR, you can experience this all-time classic horror adventure in a brand new way. The motion-controlled aiming made me recall fond memories of playing <em>Resident Evil 4 Wii Edition</em>, and parrying attacks with your knife is so, <em>so </em>satisfying in VR.</p><p>You will be regularly reminded that <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake</em> was not originally designed for a first-person perspective. Cutscenes will play out as they did in the original flat screen version of the game, and actions like melee attacks will occur in third person (which is probably for the better, just thinking about Leon’s roundhouse kick in first person makes me motion sick). Regardless, if you need a reason to dive back into the world of survival horror, this is it.</p></div><div><p>I typically don’t double-up on games in the same franchise on lists like this, but <em>Resident Evil 4 Remake </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-the-kotaku-review-1846823333&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-the-kotaku-review-1846823333"><em>Resident Evil Village</em></a></span> are both so uniquely good as VR experiences that it’d be an injustice to not include both. Especially in this case, because <em>Resident Evil Village </em>actually <em>was</em> designed with a first-person perspective in mind. Key cutscenes will play out in VR, the combat feels simultaneously scary and enthralling, and the interface looks surprisingly natural. I’ve actually never seriously played <em>Resident Evil Village </em>until I tried it in VR, and even people watching me playing asked if the game was VR exclusive. It’s that good!</p><p>I will say the VR mode isn’t a perfect conversion. For example, you can twist your head around during cutscenes and view character models floating around that the player clearly was never meant to see. Still, <em>Resident Evil Village </em>reigns as my favorite experience with the PlayStation VR2, and it’s an incredibly easy recommendation if you want a bonafide adventure in the virtual world. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
