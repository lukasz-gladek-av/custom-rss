The shifts, while communicated about a year and a half ago, are still coming to fruition. Initial results were mixed, at best. <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> felt Frankensteined together from the remnants of multiple scripts (remember when WWE star <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/13j1hfy/a_photo_has_surfaced_of_seth_rollins_on_the_set/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SquaredCircle/comments/13j1hfy/a_photo_has_surfaced_of_seth_rollins_on_the_set/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seth Rollins was going to be in the film</a></span>?!) and ended up being a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/captain_america_brave_new_world&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/captain_america_brave_new_world" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">critical</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2025/02/box-office-captain-america-brave-new-world-1236289044/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/box-office-captain-america-brave-new-world-1236289044/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">commercial</a></span> disappointment. <em>Daredevil</em>: <em>Born Again</em> had the wider MCU trending in the right direction, only for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/thunderbolts-lost-millions-box-office-marvel-next-1236427994/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/thunderbolts-lost-millions-box-office-marvel-next-1236427994/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Thunderbolts* </em>to underperform financially</a></span> months later, despite positive reviews. That’s to say nothing of the Disney+ show <em>Ironheart</em>, which felt like it was just unceremoniously dropped on the service with little promotion or fanfare. In righting the ship, Marvel just can’t seem to hit smooth sailing.</p><p>Naturally, then, with the release of the studios newest movie, <em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>, there’s bound to be some good old-fashioned hand-wringing about the state of the MCU. On paper, the movie is splashy and full of exciting talent. <em>WandaVision</em>—one of the MCU’s biggest successes of what we’ll call its “expansion era”—director Matt Shakman is at the helm, joined by a quartet of beloved actors in the form of Pedro Pascal as Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards, Vanessa Kirby as the Invisible Woman/Sue Storm, Joseph Quinn as the Human Torch/Johnny Storm, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as The Thing/Ben Grimm. From a visual perspective, it boasts a <em>Jetsons</em>-like retro-futurism that’s both timeless and an exciting departure from much of Marvel’s recent output. Shakman also committed to a (welcome) sense of practicality, with an “emphasis on practical sets and props,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/fantastic-four-first-steps-space-race-kubrick-exclusive/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/fantastic-four-first-steps-space-race-kubrick-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">per a report from <em>Empire</em></a></span>. All of these signs point to exciting, well, <em>first steps</em> toward ensuring the film is of the utmost quality.</p><p>Yet, <em>Fantastic Four</em> arrives with a healthy dose of concern, under some pretty burdensome circumstances. At once, it’s one of the handful of projects that fell under the great reshuffle, the third reboot of Marvel’s first family in 20 years, and one of the last solo Marvel movies before the release of <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em> in December 2026. That last point is especially pertinent, as the lead villain for the upcoming <em>Avengers</em> is none other than <em>Fantastic Four</em> antagonist, Doctor Doom, which means <em>Fantastic Four</em> has to do some more heavy lifting than, say, <em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.</em></p><p>Played by Robert Downey Jr, in a decision that still reads as a desperate attempt at chasing the heyday of MCU years’ past, Doctor Doom <em>is</em> an incredible foe, when done correctly. Doom and Reed’s relationship is richly layered. In comic books, their rivalry dates back to their days at college, where they become bitter rivals with a begrudging respect for one another. They’re mirror images of one another, with Doom isolating himself from others while Reed embraces friends and family. They can’t exist without each other, forged forever in a fire of spite and anger, with Doom refusing to acknowledge that Reed is his superior. This often involves Doom trying to drag Reed down to his level, not unlike the Joker trying to pull Batman into having one bad day.</p><p>The relationship between Doom and Reed informs the backbone of <em>Secret Wars</em>, written by Jonathan Hickman with art by Esad Ribić. After a series of multiversal impacts tear the fabric of reality apart, Doctor Doom manages to salvage the existing universes into a patchwork reality. The culmination of the story involves Reed and Doom facing off, where Doom eventually admits that his tried and true foe would have found a proper way to restore all the disparate universes. Here, at the end of all things, Doom realizes that all his faculties are nothing in the face of Reed.</p><p>With the MCU looking to adapt—either directly or in parts—that very same <em>Secret Wars </em>story in the next two <em>Avengers</em> films, the future of Marvel storytelling hangs on the success of <em>Fantastic Four</em>.</p><p><em>Fantastic Four</em> needs to be a hit. Not only to prove that non-<em>Avengers</em> Marvel movies still have the juice, but to set up the Four and Reed as critical figures before introducing Doom. It’s telling that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZXBFirj6b4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZXBFirj6b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the famed chair video</a></span>, which revealed the expansive cast of the movie, Pedro Pascal’s chair appeared right before Downey Jr’s, seemingly indicating the pair will be critically important to the next <em>Avengers</em> films, a fact confirmed by Shakman who told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/news/fantastic-four-director-interview-matt-shakman-casting-auditions-1236461087/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/fantastic-four-director-interview-matt-shakman-casting-auditions-1236461087/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Variety</em></a></span> that Reed will be <em>leading</em> the Avengers by the time it’s all said and done. Audiences need to invest in Pascal’s performance as Reed for the emotional throughline of <em>Doomsday</em> and <em>Secret Wars</em> to work. Those <em>Avengers</em> movies may not hit the financial pinnacles of the pre-pandemic success of <em>Infinity War </em>and <em>Endgame</em>, but Disney’s surely counting on them to get as close as humanly possible.</p><p>Every Marvel movie this year has faced some level of concern. But <em>Fantastic Four</em> feels like it has so much riding on it. With such a large gap between this film and <em>Doomsday</em>, a sour note could be the thing that causes the worm to turn on Marvel writ large. But if done right, it’s the buoying force that could sustain a new level of optimism and enthusiasm for the MCU just when it’s needed the most.</p><p>Marvel Comics achieved tremendous success when Stan Lee and Jack Kirby introduced the Fantastic Four in 1961. Now, almost 64 years later, the MCU is looking to four intrepid heroes to do so once again, ushering in a new era of excitement. Will history repeat itself?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-dr-doom-doomsday-avengers-1851786672]]></content:encoded>

And Arnie. And it was goofy-ass perfect. The astonishingly po-faced approach to such a ridiculous concept was directed by the soon-to-be mighty John McTiernan, the movie he made before <em>Die Hard </em>(and just 16 years before his career would collapse in a heap of abysmal flops, and 19 before <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/what-happened-die-hard-director-905219/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/what-happened-die-hard-director-905219/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">criminal proceedings</a></span> would begin that would end with him spending a year in prison for wiretapping and perjury). <em>Predator </em>was a massive success despite an inevitable critical mauling, but has one of the weirdest legacies of the era.</p><p>Rather than spawning a run of rinse-and-repeat sequels, it instead saw the fantastically incongruous and amazingly terrible <em>Predator 2</em>, a Danny Glover vehicle directed by Stephen Hopkins (<em>Lost in Space</em>), which is basically <em>Babe 2: Pig in the City</em> but with killer aliens. That put the kibosh on the franchise for over a decade, until the satanic deal was struck that allowed spin-off universe&nbsp;<em>Alien vs. Predator</em> to become a movie in 2004. In 2010 we got the almost entirely forgotten <em>Predators</em> directed by the almost entirely forgotten Nimród Antal, then in 2018 <em>The Predator</em> from the occasionally brilliant Shane Black (<em>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</em>, <em>Iron Man 3</em>). That too got slaughtered by critics, and despite making back its money is considered a failure, including by Black himself. (It didn’t help that he cast a sex offender friend of his in a minor role, and then defended this.) </p><p>With all variants of the “Predator” title worn out, this finally brings us to 2022's <em>Prey</em>, from director Dan Trachtenberg (<em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em>), which heads back to 1719, focusing on the predator/prey relationship between an alien hunter and young Comanche woman, and <em>boom</em>, someone had finally figured out a way to make a new <em>Predator</em> movie that didn’t suck. Then just last month, animated feature <em>Predator: Killer of Killers</em> was released, set across four disparate timelines, and again won critics over to a long-struggling franchise.</p><p>So how is Trachtenberg following up this far calmer, far more composed approach to the alien hunter franchise? By going batshit ‘80s crazy, and I am <em>delighted</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="8239222bcc1ef0f19d57d25a5e6468ef" data-recommend-id="image://8239222bcc1ef0f19d57d25a5e6468ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1602" data-height="901" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dek and Thia walk through some wreckage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dek and Thia walk through some wreckage." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Fox / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8239222bcc1ef0f19d57d25a5e6468ef" data-recommend-id="image://8239222bcc1ef0f19d57d25a5e6468ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1602" data-height="901" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dek and Thia walk through some wreckage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Straight away, we get a shot of a synthetic woman, and a view through a camera with the text “WEYLAND-YUTANI BIO-WEAPONS DIVISION” stamped on screen. Yes. YES. We’re straight away declaring this is now, surely, in the <em>Alien vs. Predator</em> timeline—one completely erased from existence by Ridley Scott’s <em>Alien</em> prequels—and this time we’re on the side of the Predator.</p><p>Set on the Predators’ home planet, we’ve got a young Predator, Dek (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi), thrown out of his clan to become prey, who teams up with the synth remains of Thia (Elle Fanning) to survive. Then we have flying ships, behemothic monsters, somehow a bunch of armed humans, and then the closing image of what I’m pretty sure is a P-5000 Powered Work Loader mech suit—the thing Ridley uses at the end of <em>Aliens</em>.</p><p>Apparently an entire language has been developed for the Predators, which stuntman-actor Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi learned for the part, and clearly everyone involved has gone wonderfully, spectacularly mad.</p><p>The only thing that could make this better would be an Arnie cameo</p><p>We only have a few months to wait, the film releasing to theaters November 7.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/predator-badlands-trailer-dan-trachtenberg-prey-aliens-1851786667]]></content:encoded>
