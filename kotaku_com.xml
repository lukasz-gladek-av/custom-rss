              <p>If you’re planning to create content with your phone, there are some great options to help you better the way it looks and sounds. That includes a gimbal to make sure your picture stays static even when your phone or your subject is moving around. Case in point: The DJI Osmo Mobile 8 Gimbal Stabilizer.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6789/">If you’re interested in grabbing your own DJI Osmo Mobile 8 Gimbal Stabilizer, head to Amazon where you can get it for just $126, which is a $23 or 15% discount from the regular retail price of $149.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6789/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A stabilizing gadget to help improve your mobile photos and video</h2>
<p>This gadget is designed to produce smooth video and professional-looking results. It has AI-powered subject tracking (for subjects such as people and pets), and additional features like built-in light support and audio pickup. It even has 360-degree pan rotation for more creative movements, an extension rod and integrated tripod for transitioning between handheld shots and stationary shots without the need to swap equipment, and a stated 10 hours of battery life.</p>
<p>The gimbal itself weighs approximately 13.1 ounces and the handle has been designed to fit comfortably in the user’s hand for extended periods of time. It even includes an extension rod to create space for a wider view for framing groups, overhead shots, etc.</p>



<p>Stabilization using robust 3-axis gimbal technology is the key to providing you with stabilized video footage when moving the gimbal around. The motors on the gimbal will adjust to your hand movements resulting in smoother footage than what would be produced by in-phone stabilization. Plus, its unlimited 360-degree horizontal pan allows for options to capture wrap-around movements and panoramic sweeps. The gimbal has features such as Timelapse, Motionlapse, Hyperlapse, and multiple panorama modes, which provide users with the ability to creatively compress time or stitch together large areas with minimal manual setup.</p>
<p>Tracking with audio and lighting is accomplished natively through the inclusion of the DJI OM Multifunctional Module, which brings several tools into one unit. The module can track individuals and pets, receive audio, and integrate with external light support to ensure your subject remains visible and well-lit.</p>
<p>Overall, this handheld gimbal works hard to deliver more stable footage, improved framing, and smoother movement for the photos and video you take on your phone. It accomplishes that with three-axis stabilization, unlimited 360-degree panning, the extension rod and tripod, and the Multifunctional Module.</p>
<p>For this price, and considering the fact that it’s often hard to find DJI products anymore, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6789/">this a purchase you’re going to want to jump on right now before it’s out of stock again</a>. Be sure to grab yours fast.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fallout-3-new-vegas-remake-remaster-mods-2000661284</link>
            <guid>1410871</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Tale of Two Wastelands</span></i><span>, a mod that combines the world maps of</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-new-vegas-2-director-sawyer-xbox-bethesda-1851620259"><i><span> Fallout 3 </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i></a><span>, won’t be getting ported to (or otherwise remade for) those long-rumored remasters and remakes. One of the best ways to experience the wasteland will remain anchored to the older games..</span></p> <p><span>The existence of upcoming new versions of Bethesda’s</span><i><span> Fallout 3</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span> might be the worst-kept secret in gaming right now, much like </span><i><span>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered </span></i><span>was prior to its release last year</span><span>. If this is the first you’re hearing of this, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-why-fans-are-convinced-fallout-3-and-new-vegas-remasters-are-about-to-be-revealed-2000660161"><span>here’s </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>’s breakdown</span></a><span> of why everyone is so convinced that the remasters are on the way.</span></p>

 <p><span>The community is understandably excited, with said excitement at least partially fueled by the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-tv-series-season-two-reviews-prime-video-2000653876">success of <em>Fallout </em>season 2</a> </span><span>on Prime. But a remastered version of either game comes with the same potential headache as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remastered-steam-mixed-review-ue5-stuttering-2000624074"><i><span>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</span></i></a><span> did</span><span>: a lack of support for close to two decades of mods.</span></p>  <p><span>Where </span><i><span>Oblivion Remastered</span></i><span> is concerned, Bethesda </span><a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/69672"><span>outright confirmed</span></a><span> at release that “mods are not officially supported” for the game. This didn’t stop the modding community from </span><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/backward-compatible-many-old-oblivion-mods-still-work-on-oblivion-remastered/"><span>finding workarounds</span></a><span> for certain classic </span><i><span>Oblivion </span></i><span>mods, but the end result is clear: the original </span><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/oblivion/mods"><span>2006 release</span></a><span> of the game has ten times the number of mods on popular mod distribution site Nexus Mods that </span><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/oblivionremastered/mods?sort=downloads"><i><span>Oblivion Remastered</span></i><span> has</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>As spotted by </span><a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2026/01/19/161756.html"><i><span>Game*Spark</span></i></a><span>, at least one huge total conversion mod for both </span><i><span>Fallout 3</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span> won’t be making the jump to the current generation, as confirmed by the team behind </span><i><span>Tale of Two Wastelands </span></i><span>in their Discord server. Why? Because, understandably, producing a version of </span><i><span>TTW</span></i><span> that works with both remasters “would be a mammoth effort and would require an entire rebuild of the project.”</span></p>

 <h2><em>Tale of Two Wastelands</em> feels like its own game</h2> <p><span>If you haven’t played </span><i><span>Tale of Two Wastelands</span></i><span> for yourself, let me be the first to tell you that you really should. Merely describing it as a way to play through both games with a single character is massively underselling it, because it doesn’t just smoosh the Mojave and the Capital Wasteland together.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><i><span>Tale of Two Wastelands </span></i><span>overhauls both games in a way that makes the experience truly cohesive by completely rebalancing the game, altering the level cap and perks, and even restoring a bunch of cut content. It’s such a huge undertaking that it even has its own separate tag on Nexus, with over 1,200 support mods of its own. The </span><i><span>TTW</span></i><span> team aren’t exaggerating when </span><a href="https://thebestoftimes.moddinglinked.com/faq.html"><span>they describe the project</span></a><span> as its own “unique game.”</span></p> <p><span>Ever since I first tried <em>TTW </em>back in 2019, I haven’t returned to the standalone versions of either </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span> or</span><i><span> Fallout 3</span></i><span>. It obviously sucks to hear that the project won’t be supported once the </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> remasters drop, even if it’s completely understandable. We can only hope that Bethesda makes a better effort to support legacy mods this time around, but, in the case of </span><i><span>Tale of Two Wastelands</span></i><span>, we may have to make peace with the fact that some <em>Fallout</em> modding projects are simply too grand in scope to get ported to their remastered counterparts.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/razer-ava-ai-grok-interview-slop-motoko-2000661233</link>
            <guid>1410820</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In a splendidly combative interview with Razer’s billionaire CEO Min-Liang Tan,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/podcast/863361/razer-ceo-min-liang-tan-ces-2026-ai-gaming-project-ava-interview"><em>The Verge</em>‘s Nilay Patel took him to task</a> over the peripheral company’s approach to AI, not least including the Grok-powered <a href="https://kotaku.com/grok-hologram-anime-waifu-ces-2026-2000657749">waifu-AI-in-a-jar stunt</a> it pulled at this year’s CES. The hour-long interview gets more and more uncomfortable as it becomes clear Tan has no answers for any of the crucial questions Patel is putting to him. And just wait until he’s asked what games he’s played recently.</p> <p>The interview, which took place live on stage at 2026’s CES, has such a peculiar tone. <em>The Verge</em>‘s Nilay Patel makes pretty obviously cynical remarks about Razer’s approach in terms of the attention-seeking silliness it pretends to be developing, and Min-Liang Tan replies as if the questions are entirely sincere. Of the Ava AI tube, “Did you say to your team, ‘I want a holographic anime waifu on my desk’? You say the metric is ‘what we want.’ Who was like, ‘I want this’?” asks Patel. Tan then launches into a deeply sincere response about how the holo-lady was there to represent technology Razer can create for game companies, meeting an imagined desire for “a holographic representation of some of your latest characters,” and that the product demonstrates “we’re now able to get personality there and have conversational AI coming through,” and further that it isn’t just “great software” but now features “great intelligence.”</p>

 <p>As impossible as it is to think of a single use-case for a game character appearing in a physical tube and being able to spurt Grok responses back at people, Tan enthuses, “It’s that premise of being able to chat, as opposed to clicking a button or typing on something, and having a little thing over there.” It’s “a little bit of sci-fi, us growing up always wanting something cool like that, and so we said, ‘Hey, it’s a great concept,’ and I think the community loves it.”</p>  <p>Ava, <a href="https://www.razer.com/gb-en/concepts/project-ava">which has a website</a> that’s taking $20 preorder deposits and states that the product “is expected to be available in the second half of 2026,” is certainly not going to be released then, if at all, as becomes awkwardly obvious as the interview continues. When pressed on the reality of Ava actually being developed as a consumer product, rather than something “hack[ed] together” for CES, Tan starts to prevaricate. “We plan to put it out, but we do want to get as much feedback, to hear what the concerns are, right? Are there things we can do better? What’s cool? What are the characters that we would like to get on?” Which are all <em>really</em> strange questions to be asking of a product that’s supposedly going on sale later this year. Not least one that’s planning to run on Grok, Elon Musk’s wildly unstable and poorly managed AI.</p>

 <p>“Can you care about trust and safety, and also partner with Grok?” asked Patel, with the interview taking place as <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-grok-ai-deepfakes-undressed-images-2000658486">the stories of Grok’s gleeful creation of revenge porn and CSAM</a> were breaking. Tan does not answer the question at all, but rather speaks of Grok’s “really great conversational AI model.” When Patel puts to him the other obvious issues of a Grok-powered conversational device, Tan gives some of the most astonishingly dreadful responses, such as declaring, “Well, the doors have been open since Tamagotchi,” and “we’ve interacted with NPCs.” Patel desperately persists, laboring over the point that intentions are meaningless when we all know what gen-AI is already doing, but Tan refuses to engage, instead just repeating the usual lines about “software guardrails” and how the tech is [deep sigh] “evolving.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000661262" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661262"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661262">© Razer</figcaption></figure> <p>Patel continues heroically on. When asking Tan about glowy-keyboard company Razer’s intentions to invest $600 million into “AI” alongside employing 150 AI engineers, the host points out “that gamers hate it. The gamers, I think, are in open revolt against AI coming into their games, into their platforms.” This obviously hits rather close to home for the Razer CEO, who arrived at CES under the banner of “AI is the future of gaming.”</p> <p>Tan attempts to draw a line between the “AI slop” that most game players are currently revolting against, and the nebulous “AI tools” that will help developers with QA and cause them to “develop better games.” He talks of a “QA companion” that Razer is developing to “work with the human QA tester” by, um, filling in forms. Genuinely, that’s the example.</p>

 <p>But as much as Patel pushes, Tan never provides an actual example of a compelling use case. Instead it’s all about how “helpful” it will be, how it’ll “work with” current products, but never with a single concrete example of what he’s actually talking about. But it is, of course, “revolutionary.” Thank goodness for Patel, who jumps in at this point to demand that Tan explain what exactly is “revolutionary” about putting a camera with “AI” in it in some headphones in Razer’s Motoko. The answer: “Well, I would say, first off, we are really looking at being able to have an unobtrusive universal form factor to enable AI smarts.” Ho boy. It’s ChatGPT talking at you in your ears. And, more specifically, an imaginary future version of ChatGPT that can interpret live camera footage and ambient audio and provide related answers based on these feeds.</p> <p>And for all of Tan’s protestations that Razer isn’t interested in “slop,” he then goes on to deliver that hoary old line, “We’ll see new forms of artists, artists of whom may not necessarily have been so adept in terms of using a paint brush or using Photoshop, now being able to kind of wordsmith and craft great pieces of art with prompts throughout.” So yeah, just plagiarized slop then.</p> <p>And just in case it couldn’t get any worse, Patel finishes up by asking Tan—who repeatedly declared his love for gaming throughout—what games he’s playing right now. “Oh, it depends.” Nope. On a second try he says, “<em>Civilization</em> and stuff like that…I do play some MMOs of sorts, shooters, and I still play a lot of the battle royale genre.” Patel points out those are genres and desperately presses for the name of a game. “Oh, well, I play random stuff.” Fucking hell.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-140w-charger-crashes-to-its-lowest-price-of-the-year-as-amazon-clears-out-best-selling-power-adapter-2000661030</link>
            <guid>1410817</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Keeping multiple devices charged has become a daily challenge. Smartphones are just the starting point—add in wireless earbuds, smartwatches, tablets, laptops, and handheld gaming consoles, and it’s easy to see how quickly outlets and charging bricks multiply. A single, powerful charger that can handle everything is no longer a luxury. It is an absolute necessity. That’s why you need an Anker laptop charger. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/">Amazon happens to have it on sale at the moment for 35% off. It normally runs for $100, so that discounts easily calculates out to a savings of $35.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast Charging</h2>
<p>Designed as an all-in-one charging hub, this compact power brick is built to replace several individual chargers at once. It supports USB-C charging across a wide range of devices, from phones and accessories to full-sized laptops and gaming systems like the Nintendo Switch, Steam Deck, or similar handhelds. With a maximum output of up to 140W, it delivers a ton of power fast helping to minimize the time it takes to bring your devices back to life.</p>
<p>At the front of the charger, you’ll find three USB-C ports alongside a USB-A port, allowing you to charge up to four devices simultaneously. The first two USB-C ports support the highest power output, so either can be used for fast-charging a laptop without sacrificing performance. The USB-A port ensures compatibility with older cables and accessories you may still rely on, keeping the charge valuable for even your legacy devices.</p>
<p>Fast charging performance is a highlight. The Anker Laptop Charger is capable of powering larger devices and laptops like the 15-inch MacBook Air rapidly. Under optimal conditions, it can bring a drained laptop battery up to 50% in around 30 minutes.</p>



<h2>Smart Display</h2>
<p>A built-in smart display located on the top of the unit provides real-time charging information, breaking down how much power each port is delivering as well as the total output across all connected devices. The high-definition, full-color display makes the information easy to read at a glance.</p>
<p>The display also doubles as a temperature monitor. Keeping charging temperatures in check is critical for both safety and long-term device health, and the charger gives you visibility into how warm it’s running. Behind the scenes, Anker’s ActiveShield safety system continuously monitors temperature—checking millions of times per day—to protect against overheating and ensure stable performance.</p>
<p>In the box, Anker includes the 140W charger itself and a five-foot USB-C to USB-C cable rated for up to 240W, so you can take full advantage of its capabilities right away. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6126/">Available in dark gray or silver, the Anker laptop charger is now on sale for just $65 for a limited time.</a></p>
