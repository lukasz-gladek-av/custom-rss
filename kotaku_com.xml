Early classics included the original PC versions of<em> Resident Evil </em>and <em>Diablo</em>. <em>Warcraft I</em> and <em>II</em> are also part of the DRM-free program, and despite being removed from the storefront later this month, GOG says it will still continue to make sure players’ existing copies are updated moving forward. </p><p>“Once a game joins the Program, we pledge to maintain its compatibility even if it gets delisted from the store,” a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_bundle&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_bundle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new announcement</a></span> from the company reads. “This means that owners of those titles can still expect a seamless experience and tech support for those titles. This also considers potential changes in Windows OS that may impact games’ playability.”</p><p><em>Warcraft I</em> and <em>II</em> will both be removed on December 13th “at the publisher’s request,” GOG notes, meaning that Blizzard, now owned by Microsoft, is requesting GOG stop selling the $15 bundle of ‘90s-era strategy games, presumably because it just released its own remasters for $25.
