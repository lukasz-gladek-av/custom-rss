He says he fell in love with the voice that Suno would generate when he uploaded unfinished demos of his songs onto the platform. “It came to a point where I’m like, ‘Yo, this voice, it’s amazing.’”</p><p>There’s no word on when TaTa’s first single will be released, but the Stage Zero team plans to make her seem as real as possible.

So you can imagine that the general reception to Timbaland siding with the machines has been less than favorable:</p><p>Mudaliar believes the public opposition to AI-generated music will subside eventually because “[AI is] not going anywhere,” comparing what he sees as the inevitability of its eventual acceptance to the way that influencers went from laughable to standard. Even though human creators will be involved in the process of creating music for TaTa and other AI artists, it’s hard not to look at this new endeavor as a way to minimize human involvement in music. Timbaland has a track record of making generation-defining music, but this move just sounds off. <br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, mapping everything this series has to offer onto live-service structures and gacha rolls doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence in what may be one of the last <em>Persona 5 </em>spin-offs before we finally reach <em>Persona 6</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196411,196013" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It’s a shame I’m so hesitant, because the premise of <em>The Phantom X </em>is really compelling to me. This game takes place in a separate timeline in which a different group of high schoolers took up the Phantom Thieves mantle. Instead of playing as Joker, you play as Wonder, a completely different guy who goes to another school and has different friends, but still has Joker’s ability to summon multiple entities called Persona to fight off Shadows in a paranormal world called the Metaverse. Like most <em>Persona </em>heroes, his life is split between fighting monsters in one world and living a normal teenage existence in the other, but the difference this time around is that <em>The Phantom X </em>breaks the traditional RPG grind for a much more elaborate gacha one.</p><p>You build out your party by unlocking characters with gacha rolls. The game’s calendar system is regimented by an energy mechanic, so you can’t just have a breezy marathon running through several in-game days at a time like you could in other <em>Persona </em>games. Stats and abilities are now gated by RNG rather than acquired by simply getting more powerful. You know, the normal free-to-play dressings that keep you booting the game up every day or so.</p><p>I can’t speak to the probabilities for different pulls based on my two hours with the game, but folks who’ve been playing it in the East have said that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/1fkeeue/after_200_hours_of_playing_persona_5_x_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/1fkeeue/after_200_hours_of_playing_persona_5_x_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s pretty generous</a></span> compared to other gacha games and lets you unlock characters and summonable Personas with relative ease. But even if <em>The Phantom X </em>is less predatory than your average slot machine, I think I’m just kinda bummed that an interesting premise is being overcomplicated by all these chance-based systems. I’ve played every <em>Persona </em>game and can navigate all their complexities pretty easily, but opening a menu in <em>The Phantom X </em>and seeing how all the systems, from the social elements that have long been the draw to the simple act of customizing your party, have been made more complicated so the game can get its hooks into your daily routine and wallet takes the wind out of my sails.</p><p>I love <em>Persona 5</em>. Yeah, we have probably <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/persona-5-the-phantom-x-is-a-solid-rpg-but-even-adding-gacha-cant-hide-the-fact-that-persona-5s-been-stretched-awfully-thin-over-the-last-9-years/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/persona-5-the-phantom-x-is-a-solid-rpg-but-even-adding-gacha-cant-hide-the-fact-that-persona-5s-been-stretched-awfully-thin-over-the-last-9-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reached the subseries’ oversaturation point</a></span>, but I still am waiting for whatever the final spin-off will be that will gloriously send the Phantom Thieves off into the sunset. Every game Atlus put out after the 2016 original has felt like a low-stakes “monster of the week” romp that mostly existed to give the old crew a reason to hang out for a bit. <em>The Phantom X</em>, meanwhile, is the first time one of the <em>Persona 5</em> spin-offs has done something of substance. By sidelining the characters Atlus hasn’t done anything meaningful with since the enhanced edition, <em>Persona 5 Royal</em>,<em> </em>launched in 2019, <em>The Phantom X </em>has the potential to explore something truly different in this world for the first time in years. I haven’t had much time with Wonder’s version of the Phantom Thieves, but I’m interested to get to know new Persona users, even if they’re borrowing a previous crew’s aesthetic. But it’s hard to look forward to those possibilities when they’re all gated behind mechanics designed to tempt me to drop some cash.</p><p>I want to give <em>The Phantom X </em>its fair shake when it comes to mobile and PC on June 26, but I can’t lie, I’m skeptical. I hope I’m proven wrong.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s what one YouTuber tried to find out, wasting absolutely no time before putting a stomach-churning beatdown on Nintendo’s new hardware.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,196230" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@TechRax/videos&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@TechRax/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TechRax’s YouTube channel</a></span> is best known for smashing all sorts of high-end consumer electronics, usually iPhones and Apple Watches. Sometimes he throws golf balls at Tesla Cybertrucks. When he’s really feeling bored he pours laundry detergent into a car’s fuel tank just to feel something. Today, on June 5, as regular tech fans celebrate the launch of the Switch 2, TechRax decided to put the $450 console that fans spent hours standing in line for through a “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p33K1uuOk-A&amp;t=124s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p33K1uuOk-A&amp;t=124s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">durability test</a></span>.” The results were hard to watch and minimally illuminating. </p><p>What kind of a beating can the Switch 2 survive? That was the question TechRax answered in his latest video. First he dropped it on the floor. No damage. So far so good! Then he pulled out a razor blade and scored the middle of the screen. “That was a big scratch line and that’s not coming off, so guys this is not like an iPhone 16 Pro or something. If you do something like that, that’s it, you are toast,” he said before cutting it a second time just to be sure. <br></p><p>Next, rather than pressing the buttons on the Joy-Con to release them from their magnetic grip slots on the sides of the Switch 2, he bent them until they snapped off. He did it multiple times and much to my surprise, despite the heart-stopping snapping sound, neither part of the connector appeared to be damaged. Good news for everyone whose kids are going to bend and flex the new Joy-Con a dozen times a week. </p><p>Finally, after successfully bending the metal hinge kickstand, TechRax concluded his survey with the hammer test. What is the hammer test? Exactly what it sounds like. First he drops a metal hammer onto the screen. Then he does it a second time from higher up. Eventually he just starts whacking it until the screen cracks. The Switch 2's new LCD screen stood its ground until hammer blow number 10. Not bad. Not bad at all. But if you see TechRax coming into your store, please don’t sell him any more Switch 2s. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
