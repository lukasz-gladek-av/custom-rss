It would later be overshadowed by 2011's <em>Skyrim</em>, but <em>Oblivion </em>has never been truly forgotten by the millions of people who sunk far too many hours into it on their Xbox 360 consoles. And now <em>Oblivion</em> is back with new visuals and other gameplay improvements. </p><p>On April 22, during a livestream dedicated to the remaster, Bethesda and developer Virtuous said they wanted to keep <em>Oblivion</em>’s<em> </em>“old charm” but wanted to evolve the RPG to bring new people into it. The original <em>Oblivion</em> is still “the heart and soul” of the remaster, but Unreal Engine is used for all the visuals. Faces look better. It makes use of modern real-time lighting techniques. It looks great, and much better than some of the early leaks led me to fear it might. </p><p>It’s not just visuals that have been remastered. Bethesda says the game’s UI, audio, and even how you level up your character have seen revisions. Combat animations have been improved. Enemies will react to hits in more specific and dramatic ways and sparks fly when swords clash. <em>Oblivion </em>now has sprint. But one thing that hasn’t changed is that the classic lockpicking and dialogue mini-games are still here. </p><p> Bethesda has also added new voices for the different races in the game, but have left in all of the weird and silly lines that people remember. Don’t worry, “Cheese for everyone!” is still in there. Bethesda also confirmed the remaster includes all DLC and expansions.</p><p><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> is out now on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC. The game costs $50, but there is a deluxe digital edition that includes some extra cosmetics and quests and costs $60. </p><p>It’s taken a while to reach today’s big livestream reveal and for Bethesda to finally confirm the worst-kept secret in video games. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.xfire.com/remake-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-in-development-virtuos-games/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.xfire.com/remake-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-in-development-virtuos-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In 2023, a Reddit user</a></span> was the first to share details about an <em>Oblivion </em>remake.

It was a brutal scene and a controversial choice in <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, but a lot of people who watch the show never touched the games and aren’t tuned into online video game discussions enough to have caught wind of this moment. So even though Abby essentially voiced her intentions directly to the audience in episode one, newcomers may have had some hope that this would be a season-long conflict that Joel might survive, rather than one that would see him taken out just two episodes into the season.</p><p>Newcomers are in shambles and posting their reactions online. After sitting with this grief for five years, I eat this shit up. I love re-experiencing the crash-out vicariously through others. By the time <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> was over, I was at peace with it and understood why the story had put us through this. The TV show is extending the game’s story <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708">across multiple seasons</a></span>, so it might take some time before viewers get that same closure, but for now, they get to sit with all this grief, and I’m lapping up their reactions.</p><p>If you or a loved one has been personally victimized by <em>The Last of Us </em>season two, there are steps you can take to mitigate any further harm. Please remove all golf paraphernalia from your home, keep your old acoustic guitars in their cases and out of sight, and hide all instances of Pearl Jam from your Spotify playlists.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The option to auto-complete quick-time events has been made available in all difficulty modes as well, not just while playing on easy. It’s a nice suite of accessibility upgrades and follows a trend of Sony using next-gen ports and remasters to modernize gameplay customization features and introduce quality-of-life improvements across some of its older games. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/days-gone-remastered-coming-to-ps5-in-april-1851762060?_gl=1*frsg3j*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTMyODQxMC4xMjAuMS4xNzQ1MzMxNjM4LjQ0LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/days-gone-remastered-coming-to-ps5-in-april-1851762060?_gl=1*frsg3j*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTMyODQxMC4xMjAuMS4xNzQ1MzMxNjM4LjQ0LjAuMA..">The new version of<em> Days Gone</em></a></span> is $50, but anyone who has the game already can upgrade for $10. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
