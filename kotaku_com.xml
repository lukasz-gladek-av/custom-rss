All in all, it was a solid showcase. But throughout, I noticed that a <em>lot </em>of games were getting September or early October release dates announced. It seems that after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gta-vi-new-trailer-gameplay-story-1851779368&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gta-vi-new-trailer-gameplay-story-1851779368"><em>GTA 6</em></a></span>, which was previously expected to arrive in that time frame, recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta6-grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026-1851778799?_gl=1*1t8rgtv*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDkxNDcxMzYkbzEyMSRnMCR0MTc0OTE0NzEzOSRqNTckbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta6-grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026-1851778799?_gl=1*1t8rgtv*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDkxNDcxMzYkbzEyMSRnMCR0MTc0OTE0NzEzOSRqNTckbDAkaDA.">got delayed until May 2026</a></span>, everyone is feeling more comfortable launching a game in late summer or early fall. However, this is leading to a jam-packed September. </p><p>Here’s every game that got a  September or October release date announced during State of Play: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Hirogami </em>- September 3</li><li><em>Baby Steps </em>- September 8</li><li><em>Silent Hill F </em>- September 25</li><li><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> - September 30</li><li><em>Digimon Story Time Stranger </em>- October 3</li></ul></blockquote><p>It’s very likely that at least some of these games were slated to launch in September or October even before <em>GTA 6 </em>was delayed. And perhaps some of them would have still launched in that timeframe even if <em>GTA 6</em> didn’t get pushed back into 2026. But I also suspect that at least one or two of these games were likely to get pushed back to avoid Rockstar’s open-world behemoth. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-bloomberg-chaos-ea-battlefield-publishers-1851780047&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-bloomberg-chaos-ea-battlefield-publishers-1851780047">But now that it’s gone from 2025, they can stick to the plan</a></span>, and everyone can publicly lock down a date in late summer/early fall. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006">It was reported in February</a></span> that “everyone” in the game industry was waiting for Rockstar to announce a <em>GTA 6 </em>date. And when <em>Borderlands 4</em>'s September release date was announced by 2K Games and Gearbox earlier this year, that provided the first clue that it might be safe to drop your game in that timeframe. Take-Two owns both Rockstar and 2K Games. Now, everyone knows for certain that the last few months of 2025 are open for business, and that’s led to a log jam forming in September. </p><p>Here are just some of the games launching in September. Keep in mind some of these dates were announced before the delay:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Hirogami </em>- September 3</li><li><em>Hell Is Us</em> - September 4</li><li><em>Everybody’s Golf: Hot Shots</em> - September 5</li><li><em>Daemon X Machina Titanic Scion</em> - September 5</li><li><em>Terminator 2D No Fate </em>- September 5</li><li><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> (Switch 2 port) - September 5</li><li><em>Baby Steps </em>- September 8</li><li><em>Borderlands 4</em> - September 12</li><li><em>Marathon </em>- September 23</li><li><em>Silent Hill F </em>- September 25</li><li><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> - September 30</li></ul></blockquote><p>Yowza, that’s a lot of games! And I wouldn’t be surprised if a few more big games arrive in September as we get more release dates during this year’s ongoing Not-E3 / Summer Game Fest season. Like I said already, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-may-2026-too-many-games-rockstar-trailer-2-1851778860?_gl=1*2uvqnh*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDkxNDcxMzYkbzEyMSRnMCR0MTc0OTE0NzEzOSRqNTckbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-may-2026-too-many-games-rockstar-trailer-2-1851778860?_gl=1*2uvqnh*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDkxNDcxMzYkbzEyMSRnMCR0MTc0OTE0NzEzOSRqNTckbDAkaDA.">I think the last thing 2025 needed was <em>GTA 6</em>.

While the enhanced version’s director, Kazutoyo Maehiro, spoke about new features, and art director Hiroshi Minagawa spoke about pixel art sprites and 3D polygons, Matsuno—who is returning to re-edit the script and provide additional dialogue—drew out <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>’ political parallels to the modern world. At one end is an entrenched underclass and at the other are those in power who exploit them for their own gain. </p><p>“And now, in 2025—a time when inequality and division are still deeply rooted in our society—I offer this story once again,” he wrote. “The will to resist is in your hands.” Resist what, exactly? Matsuno doesn’t say. But it’s not hard to guess: bigotry, demagoguery, authoritarianism. <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is an incredibly complex and fun strategy game to unravel, but it’s also an eye-opening look at ideological capture and how it prevents people from imagining a better world, let alone fighting to bring it about. </p><p>This has given rise to all sorts of memes about political radicalization which, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aftermath.site/penality-crime-fine-final-fantasy-tactics&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aftermath.site/penality-crime-fine-final-fantasy-tactics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Aftermath </em>previously reported</a></span>, even led to made-up <em>Final Fantasy Tactics </em>quotes that felt so aligned with the core theses of the game that people just started pretending like they were actually from the game. “If the penalty for a crime is a fine, then that law only exists for the lower class,” reads the most famous one, which is exactly the kind of thing a <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> character would say before they make a deal with the devil and then beat your ass in one of the most <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/finalfantasytactics/comments/c5mqb7/how_did_you_beat_wiegraf/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/finalfantasytactics/comments/c5mqb7/how_did_you_beat_wiegraf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unfair fights</a></span> in all of gaming. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/why-everybody-loves-final-fantasy-tactics-5973196&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/why-everybody-loves-final-fantasy-tactics-5973196">One of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>’ best tricks</a></span>, though, is how it avoids the pitfalls of sounding preachy or didactic. It’s about big ideas and weight problems, but they’re always viewed through the prism of authentically realized characters who get swept up by the churn of history just like everyone else. “It was a story of a peculiar destiny, in which friendship and betrayal intertwine,” Matsuno wrote this week. I can’t wait for new players to get to experience that deftly spun tale later this year, and also see what subtle new turns he may have added as part of the remaster. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You need to only have beaten four other unique Nightlords in order for his mission, The Night Aspect, to show up at the Roundtable. The first mission you beat, Tricephelos, counts as one of them.</p><h2 id="h156570"><a id="1"></a>Preparation</h2><p>As a being of darkness, <strong>Heolstor is primarily weak to Holy damage</strong>, so focus on finding weapons that inflict that element. Try to reach as high of a level as you can before taking Heolstoron. During your run, prioritize passives and buffs that either increase your Rune acquisition from defeated enemies <em>or </em>ones that give you a lump sum of Runes. Being at least level 13 is recommended for this fight as Heolstor can hit very hard.</p><p>As for party composition, a Raider is probably the most useful and important class for this fight. This is because of his massive damage output and ability to stagger Heolstor easily. You want every opportunity to pile the hurt on Heolstor so that it doesn’t devastate you in return.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-iron-eye-single-shot-mark-ranged-1851783356&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-iron-eye-single-shot-mark-ranged-1851783356"><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>: A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Ironeye</a></span></p><p>Heolstor is a slow-moving boss, which makes it a perfect target for Ironeye to constantly apply pressure with his arrows from a safe distance.

At the start of the fight, it’ll assume the form of The Shape of Night. This first form is very easy compared to its second form, so you shouldn’t really have any issues taking it down here. It’ll use some very basic melee attacks that aren’t really worth explaining in depth here.</p><figure id="" data-id="13861d669adad7aa62cc1e1325231327" data-recommend-id="image://13861d669adad7aa62cc1e1325231327" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1075" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The party fights a boss during its easier phase." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The party fights a boss during its easier phase." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fromsoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="13861d669adad7aa62cc1e1325231327" data-recommend-id="image://13861d669adad7aa62cc1e1325231327" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1075" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The party fights a boss during its easier phase." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Just be patient when attacking The Shape of Night. Keep your HP high by not getting hit in the first place; you’ll want to conserve your healing flasks for the second phase. Conserve your Ultimates for the second phase too.</p><p>After taking down The Shape of Night, it’ll transform into Heolstor, the Nightlord. Its attacks are now cloaked in fire, becoming faster and stronger. As mentioned before, Heolstor walks slowly, but will very quickly close the distance by charging towards you and swinging its sword. These slashes come out fast and hit a wide arc, so be careful to time your dodges. Even at a distance, you’re not safe as his slashes can emit energy blades, and he can sometimes charge at you with a stab.</p><p>Heolstor can also summon fissures into the ground when it does slashes; look out for those too. Just watch the ground and avoid the glowing yellow lines.</p><p><strong>Heolstor likes to attack consecutively, but it has a cooldown period afterwards; this is the best time to come in and attack</strong>. When it gets up, back off and wait for the next opportunity to attack. The key to this fight is to be patient and not overextend. Don’t be afraid to use your UItimates, stagger Heolstor, or revive downed teammates quickly.</p><p>In another major attack, Heolstor will cover the entire battlefield in darkness before summoning a bunch of homing projectiles. This one is surprisingly easy to dodge by continually rolling out of the way. Heolstor can also be hit out of this attack by an Ultimate.</p><figure id="" data-id="e642edac0d41568b330ccda3a3c44263" data-recommend-id="image://e642edac0d41568b330ccda3a3c44263" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1070" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Darkness closes around the party as they fight an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Darkness closes around the party as they fight an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fromsoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e642edac0d41568b330ccda3a3c44263" data-recommend-id="image://e642edac0d41568b330ccda3a3c44263" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1070" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Darkness closes around the party as they fight an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After getting down to around 60 percent of its HP, Heolstor will enter its final phase. It’ll fly up high into the air and create a giant tear in the sky. <strong>Don’t waste your Ultimate thinking that you can knock it out of the air (I’ve tried; it doesn’t seem possible). </strong>This transition is inevitable. Once you see this, run away as fast as you can. Once Heolstor enters this phase, a giant explosion will occur and you don’t want to get caught in it.</p><p>As if Heolstor wasn’t already hard enough, small random pockets of the battlefield will explode with fire during the final phase of the fight. Avoid those. Be patient and just wait for the right opportunities to attack the boss and it should eventually go down.</p><p>After beating Heolstor, congrats!

However, if you simply can’t wait to collect or play with all your favorite characters and creatures from the legendary RPG series, you are in luck as this weekend, local game stores across the country are running pre-release events. If you are a longtime <em>Final Fantasy</em> fan jumping into the popular TCG for the first time, this guide will tell you everything you need to know about the event!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197580" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="GameStop Doubles Down On Crypto With Massive Bitcoin Purchase As Stores Close" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="88" data-playlist="197580,197576,197567" data-current="197580"><div><p>GameStop Doubles Down On Crypto With Massive Bitcoin Purchase As Stores Close</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h116938"><a id="1"></a> What is a Pre-Release? </h2><p>As the name implies, a Pre-Release is an event that shops will run usually the week before the release of an <em>MtG </em>set as a way to get cards into the hands of excited players before the full release. <strong>While different sets will have minor differences, in general attendees will receive a Pre-Release kit with a number of booster packs and some additional goodies</strong>. For example, the upcoming <em>Final Fantasy</em> Pre-Release comes with six booster packs, an exclusive spindown (<em>MtG’s </em>20-sided, spindown die used as a life counter), a deck box, and a traditional rare (or mythic rare) foil card. The <em>Final Fantasy</em> Pre-Releases start Friday, June 6 (with some stores choosing midnight events) and technically go through Thursday, June 12, however most stores will be running them this weekend.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/magic-gatheirng-final-fantasy-cloud-sephiroth-pack-set-1851782830&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gatheirng-final-fantasy-cloud-sephiroth-pack-set-1851782830">Everything You Need To Know To Get Into <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>’s <em>Final Fantasy </em>Set</a></span></p><p>Players will then be given a set amount of time to open the boosters and build a limited, 40-card deck using the cards from those packs. After that, you will play three games against other participants in a “tournament”. The tournament is Swiss Style, which means you play against other people with your record, ie: if you lose in Game 1, you play against someone who also lost in Game 1, and if you lose that too, you would play someone who lost twice in Game 3. There is usually a winner who is given a small prize such as a booster pack or sleeves or something small, but most people are there just to play some games. Given the randomness of the boosters in each pre-release as well as the the structure of the tournament, Pre-Releases are pretty casual events which make them great for <em>FF </em>fans coming to <em>Magic</em> for the collaboration.</p><h2 id="h116939"><a id="2"></a> What else do I need to know? </h2><figure id="" data-id="a6aebedb81680e83ea4d732ef2d735f7" data-recommend-id="image://a6aebedb81680e83ea4d732ef2d735f7" data-format="png" data-width="1206" data-height="2622" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows upcoming events for Magic: the Gathering." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows upcoming events for Magic: the Gathering." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wizards of the Coast / Simon Estey / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a6aebedb81680e83ea4d732ef2d735f7" data-recommend-id="image://a6aebedb81680e83ea4d732ef2d735f7" data-format="png" data-width="1206" data-height="2622" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows upcoming events for Magic: the Gathering." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As mentioned above, most local game stores that sell <em>Magic: the Gathering </em>products will be holding <em>Final Fantasy </em>Pre-Releases. The easiest way to find stores near you, is by downloading the “<em>Magic: the Gathering</em> Companion” App. You can then navigate to the “Locator” Tab and type in your zip code and you will see a list of all the events in the area (not just the <em>Final Fantasy</em> Pre-Releases), as well as their date and start time. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-cloud-tidus-1851782536&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-cloud-tidus-1851782536">How To Pick the Right Commander Deck For <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>’s <em>Final Fantasy </em>Set</a></span></p><p>Choosing one will also give you more info including additional store rules including how to sign up as well as the cost of the event. It’s a good idea to check a couple different events that you are interested in since pricing will vary depending on the store. In my experience, it appears that most stores are charging between $45 and $60, but don’t worry about paying less as the product received is exactly the same. Once you pick a specific time-slot, if sign-up rules weren’t listed on the event page in the Companion app, give the store and call and ask how you can sign up!</p><h2 id="h116940"><a id="3"></a>Additional tips</h2><p>If you have never played a TCG and have limited deck-building experience, here are a couple rules to get you started: <strong>Open all your packs and sort your cards by color</strong>. An <em>MnG</em> deck usually has two colors, so pick the two colors you have the most cards in as this will generally give you the most options. </p><p>If you get a particularly strong Mythic Rare in your box, it could also be worth choosing that as an option. Now, any <em>Magic </em>deck needs Mana, and a lot of it, so <strong>your deck should have between 17-18 “Land” Cards</strong>. I wouldn’t recommend using the ones contained in your boosters, because each pack only contains one, so you will be short by a lot. Your store should provide lands, so just use theirs this way you don’t get mixed up on which are yours and which are the stores. That only leaves 22-23 cards to pick from your boosters. Here is a good general breakdown for a well-balanced deck:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>1 Cost Cards: One or Two</li><li>2 Cost Cards: Seven or Eight</li><li>3 Cost Cards: Five or Six</li><li>4 Cost Cards: Three or Four </li><li>5 Cost Cards: Two or Three</li><li>6 Cost Cards: At Most One</li></ul><p>These are just general guidelines, and these numbers can be flexible if you think of a strategy that will work well. For example, if you want a Rush Deck to flood the battlefield with low level creatures, you will probably want less 5 Cost Cards and more 2 or 3. Play around with what you think will work, or just pick cards you like! Once you have your 40 cards selected, you should sleeve them. This is to protect your cards, and it makes them a little easier to shuffle. Your store will definitely have sleeves on sales. Dragon Shield is a popular brand as they are very well-made, affordable and have a lot of cool color options, but most likely any sleeves will do. Your store may even have <em>Final Fantasy</em> Sleeves for sale!</p><figure id="" data-id="32701ca4d96fc78e30ad73aa023f48f8" data-recommend-id="image://32701ca4d96fc78e30ad73aa023f48f8" data-format="png" data-width="744" data-height="1039" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Magic: the Gathering card shows a Chocobo and Mog." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Magic: the Gathering card shows a Chocobo and Mog." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wizards of the Coast / Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="32701ca4d96fc78e30ad73aa023f48f8" data-recommend-id="image://32701ca4d96fc78e30ad73aa023f48f8" data-format="png" data-width="744" data-height="1039" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Magic: the Gathering card shows a Chocobo and Mog." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you are at all curious about <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, you should definitely attend a Pre-Release. They are great for newcomers, as people are excited to play with new cards and with no real prizes, most veterans won’t try to build an overpowered deck. As an added bonus, given the excitement around the <em>Final Fantasy </em>set, there will probably be a lot of newcomers to the game too, so you won’t be alone if you are unsure about specific rules or card abilities. You also know you already have something in common with everyone who is there. Who knows? Maybe you’ll meet your next <em>FFXIV </em>Raid Group and have a new Friday Night Hangout.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
