You can one-hit stealth-kill a bipedal, humanoid-ish enemy using Divine Thorn, so long as they’re weak enough for your attack to wipe their health bar entirely.</li><li><strong>Invest in Dexterity and Perception</strong>; Dex will make you speedier while Perception will up your Critical Hit Chance as well as your Maximum Range for ranged weapons.</li><li><strong>Grab Shadowing Beyond from the Ranger class at Level 5</strong>; this will let you vanish into thin air and is a perfect combo with Divine Thorn.</li><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avowed-best-bow-the-long-touch-map-guide-rpg-1851766965&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-best-bow-the-long-touch-map-guide-rpg-1851766965">Snag the game’s best bow from Dawnshore</a></span>: The Long Touch.</li><li> While you can use the tall grass to hide your approach, it’s not a requirement. <strong>So long as you remain crouched and behind enemies, you’ll remain in stealth until you alert an enemy guard</strong>. I was wearing heavy armor and could still stealth-kill Xaurips with relative ease.  <br></li><li>No one is watching you play (unless you’re streaming to the masses). Don’t hesitate to lower the game’s difficulty to Story or Easy to deal additional damage, especially when stealth-attacking enemies, to help clear zones quickly and efficiently.</li><li>Don’t be afraid to fall back if you get spotted;it’s called a tactical retreat, not running away.</li></ul><hr><p><br><em>Avowed </em>is available now on Xbox Series X/S and Windows PCs. And you can play it on Xbox Game Pass if you’re an active subscriber and don’t feel like dropping $70 on another RPG this year!  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The big one is Nvidia’s Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) which boosts image quality without sacrificing framerate. It’s become a cornerstone of PC gaming and one of the main ways rigs punch above their weight for running high-end games. </p><p>The Switch 2 will also be capable of ray tracing, a feature still somewhat rarely seen in console gaming in practice, as well as Nvidia G-Sync’s Variable Refresh Rate in handheld mode to make performance and image quality more smooth using AI. The company also claimed the Switch 2's GPU tensor cores do all this while “keeping power consumption efficient.” Exactly how efficient remains to be seen. </p><p>Nintendo recently revealed the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-battery-life-steam-deck-compares-4k-60fps-1851774376&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-battery-life-steam-deck-compares-4k-60fps-1851774376">Switch 2's battery life is even worse</a></span> than the original Switch at the low-end. How all of these features work out in practice, and in the hands of developers, will be the real test. Once the Switch 2 is out in the wild for real we’ll have a better sense of how it operates after hardware enthusiasts do teardowns and show us exactly what’s inside.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
