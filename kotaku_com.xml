              <p>When you’re upgrading your storage, you also need to take care of speed and reliability. You don’t just want to add more space; you want something that doesn’t slow you down even when dealing with heavier files. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4563/">The Samsung 990 Evo Pro SSD does a great job at that, and the 1TB model can be yours for less this Prime Day.</a></p>
<p>We’ve often seen it go for $70 – a $35 discount – but, right now, it’s dropped even further to just $60 on Amazon, marking a steep 43% off. This is one of the best prices we’ve ever seen on this drive, and it’s available for both Prime and non-Prime members.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4563/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Capacity, Exceptional Speeds</h2>
<p>The 1TB capacity is more than enough to store all your essentials and then some. Think a ton of high-resolution photos, all your favorite videos, a bunch of movies, and even a few TV series to watch on the go when you don’t have a stable internet connection. There’s also a 2TB and 4TB version of this drive available, but we think the 1TB capacity should be enough for most work professionals and creatives out there.</p>
<p>Speed-wise, you’re looking at up to 7,250 MB/s read and 6,300 MB/s write speeds – ideal for large files and heavier apps. You can expect instant boot times and ultra-fast transfers that keep you productive without any slowdowns. Even the basic day-to-day tasks get a significant boost!</p>



<p>The SSD supports PCIe Gen 4×4, with forward compatibility for Gen 5×2, so it’s going to support all your future upgrades just as well. Magician Software keeps everything optimized and up-to-date, plus you will enjoy features like drive health monitoring and extra encryption in one place. And even with all this, you really don’t have to worry about overheating and battery life. There’s an efficiency-boosting nickel-coated controller that ensures it uses less power while still delivering excellent performance under pressure.</p>
<p>Installation is pretty straightforward. Just pop it into any compatible M.2 2280 slot, and you’re good to go. All in all, this is an efficient upgrade that gets you both solid storage and exceptional speeds.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4563/"> This Prime Day makes it possible to grab it for just $60, down from $105. For more capacity, you can consider getting the 2TB or the 4TB version.</a> Just note that the discount is only around for a short time, so it’s better to hurry.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-curvx-with-22000-pa-suction-and-ai-obstacle-recognition-is-600-off-amazon-is-clearing-out-stock-2000632479</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roborock-curvx-with-22-000%E2%80%AFpa-suction-and-ai-obstacle-recognition-is-600-off-amazon-is-clearing-out-stock.1318438/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Robot vacuums promise to handle your cleaning chores automatically but most fall short in frustrating ways. They get stuck on furniture, miss obvious dirt patches, tangle on cables or require constant babysitting that defeats their entire purpose. The <strong>Roborock Qrevo CurvX</strong> sits comfortably in our top three favorite robot vacuums because it actually delivers on the promise of true hands-off cleaning.</p>
<p>Yes, the standard $1,499 price tag is steep but this is one of the rare models that really replaces you rather than just assisting. It cleans to perfection, navigates your home intelligently and handles the messiest scenarios without complaint or intervention. Right now during Prime Big Deal Days, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4581/">Prime members on Amazon can grab it for $899, down from that $1,499 list price</a>. This <strong>40 percent discount</strong> represents an all-time low and makes premium robotic cleaning accessible at a price point where the investment actually makes sense.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4581/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How Qrevo CurvX Addresses Day-to-Day Cleaning Needs</h2>
<p>The <strong>22,000Pa HyperForce suction is among the strongest available in a robot vacuum</strong>, and it directly equates to cleaning performance you can see. Pet hair and debris trapped deep down in carpet fibers are cleaned thoroughly instead of being surface-swept. Areas of floor and grout lines where dirt tends to build up aren’t glossed over.</p>
<p>The <strong>Dual Anti-Tangle system</strong> of Roborock eliminates one of the leading failure modes of robot vacuums. Pet fur and human hair as long as 40 centimeters are dealt with by the system not wrapping around the brush roller and forming a knotted mess, which causes a halt to the vacuum mid-cycle. It is a huge issue if your family members are long-haired or if your pets shed, as other robot vacuums must be continually manually corrected by cutting hair off of the brush by hand.</p>



<p>Coming in at a mere 7.98 centimeters / 3.14 inches in height, <strong>the Qrevo CurvX is also the thinnest Roborock model yet</strong>. Its ultra-low profile gives it a way to slide under couches, beds, and cupboards where dust bunnies are a fact of life and regular vacuums are unable to reach.</p>
<p>The AdaptiLift Chassis represents genuine innovation in robot vacuum design. Roborock pioneered this technology as the first manufacturer to mass-produce a robot vacuum with a liftable chassis system featuring three-wheel control, launching in Q3 2024. The<strong> chassis can lift up to 4 centimeters to clear high thresholds between rooms</strong> or it can adjust individual sections independently to navigate around furniture legs and uneven surfaces.</p>



<p>Reactive AI obstacle detection employs structured light sensors and an RGB camera for <strong>detecting and evading 108 types of objects</strong>. It can work during bright sunlight and complete darkness, its sensors navigating it to safely navigate around objects such as shoes, cords, pet toys, etc., without your pre-cleaning your floors.</p>
<p>The <strong>mopping function uses 80°C warm water to clean its own mop pads</strong> and looses grease and embedded dirt deposited by cold water. It keeps your mop clean and actually cleans your floors rather than spreading dirty water. The Thermo+, <strong>Multifunction Dock 3.0 does it all for zero cost</strong>, automatically: cleaning your mop with warm water, drying off at 113°F to prevent mildew, emptying your dustbin, refilling your water tank, and even cleaning itself with warm water.</p>
<p>At $899 for Prime members, the Qrevo CurvX really provides professional-grade auto cleaning. It’s definitely one of our favorite ones.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-gopro-dji-osmo-action-4-camera-returns-to-its-lowest-price-in-months-for-prime-big-deal-days-2000632120</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>
                  Save up to 23% on the DJI Osmo 4 action camera, bundled with a ton of accessories to help capture your next adventure.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>Here it is, folks. Prime Big Deals Day is upon us finally. October 7 and October 8, you can save big across almost every product category on Amazon. The giant online retailer has sales on PC gaming parts, Bluetooth speakers, and even cameras. The DJI Osmo Action 4 has three different bundles which are each seeing sales. Right now, you can save as much as 23%.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4562/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>Let’s break down each bundle. The essential combo is the most barebones of the three. It includes the Osmo action 4 camera alongside a horizontal-vertical protective frame, a locking screw, lens hood, battery, quick release adapter mount, anti-slip pad, and a USB-C cable for charging and data transfer. This essential combo is usually $289, but has come down to $219 for the sale.</p>



<p>Next we have the standard combo. This includes everything you get with the essential set plus an adhesive curved base mount to pair with the quick release adapter mount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4562/">This set was $299, but has dropped to just $229.</a></p>
<p>Lastly, the adventure combo features all of that and you also get two more batteries so you always have a charged spare at the ready, a multi-functional battery case, a 1.5-meter extension rod or selfie stick as they are colloquially known, and a extra quick-release adapter mount except this one is mini. Normally priced at $399, the adventure combo is now down to just $327.</p>



<h2>Why DJI?</h2>
<p>GoPro is no longer the only name in the action camera business.&nbsp;The DJI Osmo Action 4 produces premium image quality with low-light clarity thanks to the 1/1.3-inch sensor. Capture every detail from dawn to dusk in stunning 4K resolution at 120 frames per second. The high framerate means you can render slow-motion shots without losing detail.</p>
<p>The ultrawide FOV keeps every bit of action in view whether you’re rushing down the side of a mountain on a snowboard or riding waved on water skis. The DJI Osmo Action 4 employs three different stabilization modes to ensure steady footage across rugged terrains of all kind. HorzionSteady is a DJI feature which keeps the horizon of your shots flat and level at all times.</p>
<p>The frame that comes with each of the bundles has a magnetic quick-release. The camera can be shot either in portrait or landscape so you can swap easily on the fly between the two while shooting.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4562/">If you’re looking for a big opportunity to save of some cool gadget to take on your next trip, consider saving yourself up to $72 on the DJI Osmo 4 action camera.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-is-quietly-offloading-its-mini-4k-drones-now-selling-at-a-new-record-low-price-on-amazon-2000632469</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-is-quietly-offloading-its-mini-4k-drones-now-selling-at-a-new-record-low-price-on-amazon.1318429/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Getting into aerial photography used to mean dealing with FAA registration paperwork, fees and regulatory headaches. DJI changed that equation with the Mini series, and the Mini 4K sits right at 249 grams, j<strong>ust under the 250-gram threshold that triggers FAA registration requirements</strong> for recreational use in the United States. This weight advantage has made it one of DJI’s best-selling drones, and gives casual users the freedom to fly without bureaucratic barriers.</p>
<p>Right now during Prime Big Deal Days, Prime members <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4576/">can snag this drone for an unprecedented $239, down from its usual $299 price</a>. This is<strong> an all-time low for a drone that shoots genuine 4K Ultra HD video</strong> with professional stabilization.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4576/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Professional Results in a Portable Package</h2>
<p>The <strong>4K Ultra HD camera captures video at 3840 x 2160 resolution</strong> which means you’re getting four times the detail of standard 1080p footage. This resolution matters when you want to crop or zoom into your footage during editing without losing quality, or when you’re capturing landscapes where fine details like distant mountains or intricate coastlines make the shot. The camera performs across different lighting conditions and handles everything from <strong>golden hour sunrises to moody sunset scenes</strong> and even challenging night environments.</p>
<p>What differentiates the Mini 4K from cheaper drones is its <strong>mechanical 3-axis gimbal stabilization</strong>. While electronic image stabilization on a lot of budget-priced drones crops into the scene and still shows jitter, a mechanical gimbal truly compensates for motion by physically balancing it on three axes: tilt, roll, and pan. That guarantees your video stays smooth even when your drone encounters a puff of wind or a sharp directional change.</p>



<p>Flight performance is formidable with<strong> Level 5 wind resistance, i.e., wind speeds of up to 38 kilometers per hour</strong> (around 24 miles per hour). Brushless motors provide the horsepower needed for stable flight at these speeds, and they are also more efficient and longer-lasting than the brushed motors found in toy-grade quadcopters. The same motors enable the Mini 4K to <strong>lift off at altitudes of up to 4,000 meters (around 13,100 feet)</strong> which opens mountain and high-altitude shooting potentia.</p>
<p><strong>10-kilometer video transmission distance</strong> gives you tremendous mobility to roam about and position shots. For all intents and purposes, you rarely take advantage of this limit due to line-of-sight limitations and battery life yet having that longer distance as a minimum guarantee ensures your operator gets a rock-solid connection with no dropouts or pixelation even if flying a few kilometers off.</p>



<p>Battery life provides <strong>31 minutes of best-in-class flight time</strong> per single supplied battery, although real-world flying with camera recording usually enabled normally produces about 25 minutes.</p>
<p>Safety features make Mini 4K accessible to total newcomers. <strong>GPS Return to Home returns the drone to its starting point if it runs low on battery</strong>, loses signal, or if you initiate a return yourself. One-tap takeoff/landing eliminates stress of manual throttle management during most critical flight stages.</p>
<p>Coming in at $239 for Prime members during Prime Day, the DJI Mini 4K offers true 4K quality, mechanical stabilization and intelligent modes at a price low enough to make aerial creativity accessible. It slashes its drone to an all-time-low during this Prime Big Deal Days sale, and it’s a great way to start your journey into aerial photography.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This week is Prime Big Deals Day. Despite the name, it’s actually two days. On both October 7 and October 8, you can save huge swaths of cash on a bunch of cool tech or home goods, and that included PC gaming accessories. If you’ve been on the hunt for a new gaming monitor, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4561/">now might be the time to pull the Hall Effect trigger you have mapped to “Add to Cart.” Samsung’s curved Odyssey G5 gaming monitor has dropped in price by $100.</a> The 27-inch model is down from $300 to $200, while the 32-inch has gone from $330 to $230.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4561/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Go Curved?</h2>
<p>The way we perceive the world around us is not on a flat plain. Heck, we even describe it as the world around us, not in front of us. So when we simulate worlds through the games we play, why not aim for a more immersive experience? Monitors like this are awesome to play pretty much anything on but where they really shine is anything that’s first-person. When I initially got my curved monitor, first thing I played was the updated version of <em>Portal </em>with RTX and oh boy was that thing a beaut.</p>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey G5 curved gaming monitor comes in either a moderate 27-inch or large 32-inch screen, each with a curvature of 1000R to help fill your peripheral vision with the visuals from your game. Enjoy a better-than-HD resolution of 1440p which packs in 1.7 times the pixel density of 1080p HD displays. HDR10 allows for vibrant colors with deep blacks and luminous whites, portray a wide depth of color and brightness.</p>



<p>The screen has a refresh rate of 165Hz to help maintain smooth gameplay with fast frame rates and the 1ms response time will keep your character feeling snappy. Seriously. I’d been playing <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> through Game Pass and my Xbox on a TV from 2017 then switched over recently to my PC and a similarly-specced monitor and wow what a difference. Input lag I had thought was just normally going completely away. I felt like I was cheating. It was just like that episode of <em>Samurai Jack</em> when Jack is training with the rocks strapped to his wrists and ankles. You know the one I’m talking about.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4561/">Elevate your game and save yourself a solid $100 during Amazon’s Prim Big Deals Day with this Samsung Odyssey G5 curved gaming monitor,</a> currently going for an even $100 off during the sales event.</p>

              <p>It feels like&nbsp;<em>forever</em> since we had a big gaming rivalry. Since the dawn of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> it has gone through patches of directly competing with other big-name shooter franchises, whether they were <em>Medal of Honor</em>,&nbsp;<em>Halo</em> or&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>, with everyone obliged to take a side. It’s kind of nostalgic to see it happening again, with the announcement that&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>‘s current beta is being extended by an extra 24 hours, to bring it close enough to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s release to creepily whisper in its ear.</p> <p>The current <em>CoDBlops 7&nbsp;</em>beta was due to come to an end at 12 p.m. EDT on Wednesday 8 October, but has now been given a 24 hour extension, along with a brand new map to play on and double XP rewarded until the new deadline of Thursday 9th. And you know this was planned from the start, designed to tread on <em>BF6</em>‘s heels as much as possible.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000632462" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000632462"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000632462">© Activision</figcaption></figure> <p>The sixth and final map is Toshin, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-tokyo-game-show-2025-ninja-gaiden-forza-2000628659">much vaunted Japanese setting</a> complete with cherry blossoms, a downtown shopping district, and a rather unfortunate central monorail crash. The update from the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes"><em>Call of Duty</em> patchnotes blog</a> also mentions that double XP&nbsp;<em>and</em> double weapon XP will be running through the end of the beta on Thursday, trying to keep as many eyes looking toward this franchise and not glancing away at EA’s rival.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-cod-black-ops-blops7-beta-doors-ttk-2000632082">Reports from the beta so far</a> have suggested issues with mulitplayer matchmaking (which of course is one of the reasons these betas are run in the first place—to try to get on top of problems like this before the release), as well as grumbles about TTK and oddly enough, the game’s closing doors.</p>

 <p>Come the end of the beta, attention returns to&nbsp;<em>Blops 6</em> and season 6’s The Haunting event for Halloween from October 9, which also happens to be the day&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em> comes out. At that point, FPS fans’ attentions will be torn, <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912">but many will be tempted by the shiny new object</a>.</p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> then has more than a month to itself, with <em>Black Ops 7 </em>not out until November 14 and not planning any more betas before then. It’ll be interesting to see if that’s long enough for <em>BF6</em> players to have had their fill and be willing to move across, or if both games can maintain their own audiences in the holiday season. Certainly Activision and EA are <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-two-new-maps-modes-roadmap-free-updates-dlc-2025-ea-2000630301">both planning</a> an awful lot of post-game content to try to keep everyone’s attention, and I’m looking forward to sitting back with popcorn to watch it all play out.</p>

              <p>Multi-device charging becomes a daily headache when you’re constantly swapping cables and hunting for available outlets. You need one charger that can handle your laptop, phone and tablet without compromising speed or taking up half your desk. <strong>Anker’s 65W Charger solves this with three ports (USB-C and USB-A)</strong> in a package roughly the size of an AirPods Pro case. These chargers haven’t seen meaningful discounts in months with the last comparable pricing showing up during July’s… Prime Day. Amazon’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4567/">bringing that record low price back for Prime members right now, dropping it from $39 to $25</a> for this Prime Big Deal Day event.</p>

<h2>GaN II Technology Redefines the Charging Game</h2>
<p>The Nano II Anker charger employs GaN II technology and it is <strong>running twice as fast as a typical silicon-based charger</strong>. That elevated speed creates smaller internal component sizes for the same output, hence how Anker managed to pack a whopping 65W into a tiny form factor.</p>
<p>With three devices plugged in simultaneously, the <strong>charger dynamically divides power across ports based on what’s plugged in</strong>. The dividing of power is by way of PPS protocols which speak to your devices to deliver only the wattage each is capable of receiving. If we say a MacBook Air, an iPhone, and an iPad are plugged in simultaneously, for example, the charger might deliver 45 watts to the laptop, 15 watts to the iPad, and 5 watts to the phone.</p>



<p>The three-port configuration includes <strong>a pair of USB-C ports and a USB-A port</strong>. The USB-C configuration for two ports is good for newer phones, tablets, and laptops, which have embraced USB-C but older devices like wireless headphones, fitness monitors, or Kindle readers, which are yet to conform, are dealt with by the USB-A port.</p>
<p>Also, GaN II technology <strong>enhances heat management</strong> better than traditional charger designs. The new circuit board architecture and stacked component arrangement allow for better heat dissipation, enabling the charger to remain cooler even for longer periods of use. It will warm up during high-charge sessions which is typical but it should not become unbearably hot, causing concern about leaving it on a charger for an entire night.</p>
<p>At $25, it’s costing about $8.33 per port for a charger that will do everything from our phones to our laptops. If we contrast it to getting individual chargers for each piece of equipment, we see how valuable it is. That it’s available at a price equal to July’s Prime Day’s cheapest, despite its absence of discounts for several months, makes it a good buy now.</p>

              <p>Getting into virtual reality has always meant making a tough choice: <strong>spend big on premium hardware or skip it entirely</strong>. Meta designed the Quest 3S to fix that problem, creating an entry point into mixed reality that doesn’t require a second mortgage. The catch? Meta rarely discounts their hardware. Instead of price cuts, they’ve traditionally thrown in free games or extended their Meta Horizon+ subscription for a few months. Actual savings on the headset itself simply didn’t happen.</p>
<p>Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Day is changing that pattern for the first time ever,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4500/"> dropping the 128GB Quest 3S with the Gorilla Tag Cardboard Hero Bundle from $299 to $249</a>. If you’ve been thinking about early holiday shopping or surprising someone with their first VR experience, this timing couldn’t be better.</p>

<h2>Price Matters for Newcomers to Mixed Reality</h2>
<p>The Quest 3S is <strong>Meta’s most accessible path into current-generation mixed reality technology</strong>. At $249, you’re getting hardware that shares the same core processor as the more expensive Quest 3, the Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chip. This processor handles the demanding computational work of tracking your environment, rendering games at smooth frame rates, and blending virtual objects into your real-world surroundings.</p>
<p>Mixed reality overlays virtual information onto your own reality by way of passthrough cameras: You may play games where virtual entities speak to your furniture, construct virtual desks with multiple floating monitors all around your own workspace or work out and yet see your living room. This integration of worlds holds you <strong>anchored to your own space rather than isolating you from reality</strong>.</p>

<p>The headset runs at a whopping 1<strong>832 x 1920 pixels per eye at a 90Hz refresh rate</strong>. That type of resolution produces clear images for reading text within virtual worlds and perusing environmental objects within games. A 90Hz refresh rate also reduces motion blur during abrupt head movements, precluding motion sickness that plagued other VR headsets at lower refresh rates.</p>
<p>Installation is easy and <span><strong>cableless</strong></span>: The Quest 3S is a self-contained headset, so all of your processing occurs within the headset itself, eliminating your need for a gaming PC. You charge it through USB-C, mark your play space boundary with controllers, and are playing within a few minutes. <strong>Batter life averages two to three hours</strong> depending on your activity.</p>



<p>The 128GB of storage holds space for some 10 to 15 large games, depending on how large they are themselves. The physics-based <strong>multiplayer game Gorilla Tag, a game included here in this Amazon-only bundle</strong>, is incredibly popular among VR groups because after a little while of getting used to swinging your arms to build up speed, your movements end up feeling really intuitive. Themed cosmetic items for the game are included here as part of the Cardboard Hero bundle which means you can set your character before even getting going directly.</p>
<p>In addition to Gorilla Tag, y<strong>ou receive a three-month trial of Meta Horizon+</strong>, which grants access to more than 30 games through a rotating library. Games like Walkabout Mini Golf, Demeo, and Pistol Whip are offered, which allow for a change of pace directly without purchasing titles individually. New titles are released each month, so each month you have a new set of genres ranging from rhythm games through puzzle adventures to try out.</p>
<p>With games included at $249, Meta’s finally giving a real hardware discount on hardware actually delivering on promises of affordable mixed reality.</p>
