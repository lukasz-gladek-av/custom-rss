He was arrested last week on multiple charges of coercion, unlawful surveillance, and harassment stemming from a 2022 breakup after which he allegedly threatened his ex with “revenge porn.” </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As first reported by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wbng.com/2025/01/08/mcdonough-man-arrested-threating-revenge-porn-against-ex/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wbng.com/2025/01/08/mcdonough-man-arrested-threating-revenge-porn-against-ex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Binghamton, New York TV station WBNG</a></span>, the Chenango County Sheriff’s Office processed Rees, who appeared in <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> and other films, after he turned himself in following a notice to appear for the two felony and one misdemeanor charges. He’s since been released to appear in court at a later date. The charges seemingly stem from a relationship Rees had with an unnamed woman that ended in September 2022. </p><p>Following the breakup, the voice actor allegedly threatened to release explicit photos of the woman if she didn’t respond to his continued messages, according to a legal complaint she filed in 2023. A domestic violence restraining order was previously issued against the actor in 2022, but Rees allegedly continued to try to intimidate witnesses who might testify against him. </p><p>While Rees did not return for last year’s <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, he played one of the more popular NPCs from the first three games in BioWare’s RPG series. His character, Cullen Rutherford, was especially popular in certain <em>Dragon Age </em>fanfiction. Then in December 2020, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/shitty-dragon-age-voice-actor-has-me-considering-deleti-1845854728?_gl=1*r75245*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjgwMjQxNS4yNzMuMS4xNzM2ODA0ODQ2LjE3LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/shitty-dragon-age-voice-actor-has-me-considering-deleti-1845854728?_gl=1*r75245*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjgwMjQxNS4yNzMuMS4xNzM2ODA0ODQ2LjE3LjAuMA..">Rees unleashed a weird rant on YouTube against cancel culture</a></span> while in character as his <em>Dragon Age</em> alter ego. </p><p>In it, he criticized Black Lives Matter protests and the #metoo backlash while speaking in third person. “This is my response to the mob’s inquisition of me, and my voice actor, Greg Ellis, and how we attempted to understand the resultant blight it spread across the fandom,” he said at the time. Rees has since appeared in<em> Hogwarts Legacy </em>and several animated shows. </p><p>The actor is also currently being sued by another unnamed woman in a separate case. She alleges that he harassed and threatened her and her family, and made up lies about them. Those lies were allegedly posted on a website made by a man named Vem Miller, who the woman claimed was a close friend of Rees’. Miller was briefly arrested last year during the presidential election cycle after trying to enter a Trump rally in Coachella, California while illegally possessing a shotgun, loaded handgun, and a high-capacity magazine. In his own legal filings, Rees claims that the second unnamed woman tried to murder him. </p><p>Rees could not immediately be contacted for comment. A talent agent listed on his website told<em> Kotaku</em> he had not been in contact with the actor for several years. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
