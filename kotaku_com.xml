              <p>Pokémon cards. If it ain’t a story about <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/target-removes-trading-cards-from-stores-after-violent-incident-with-gun.html">sudden acts of intimidation and threats of violence</a> over them, then it’s probably one about scalpers and reselling. Thankfully, no one got hurt (physically) this time as the Mega Evolution Phantasmal Flames Elite Trainer Box (ETB), Booster Display Box, and Booster Bundle all sold out during their pre-order sale yesterday, with significant amounts of them going to folks who have no interest in actually using them to play the game. And they went <i>fast</i>. Some fans were lucky enough to still get through and lay claim to sets of their own, but the sting of seeing exorbitant listings on reselling sites still sucks.</p> <p>Expected to arrive on November 14, 2025, pre-orders for the latest <i>Pokémon </i>card game expansion went up <a href="https://x.com/PokemonRestocks/status/1967620548051218478">yesterday, September 15, 2025</a>, and, predictably, were sold out within 15 minutes (<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/pokemon-tcg-phantasmal-flames-etbs-ebay-for-extortionate-prices/">h/t <i>The Gamer</i></a>). And no, these very pretty-looking cards will not be finding homes with eager fans hoping to add them to their collections. Sadly, scalpers have filled eBay with pre-order listings for the new cards. Some are set at around normal prices, but a significant number of these listings are selling the cards for five times the retail price, hovering around $300, if not more in some cases.</p> <p>Scalpers didn’t soak up all the fun, however. On social media, many are <a href="https://x.com/ReyGambino_/status/1967626696045269047">celebrating a win</a> with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/camyoin.bsky.social/post/3lyven5lodk2x">screenshots of successful pre-orders</a> of the new cards. That said, others ran into queue issues, getting bounced after only waiting for a short time, or in some cases, <a href="https://x.com/texasboy1060569/status/1967620858714992652">making it to checkout</a>, only to be bounced back in line. Others who made it to checkout were <a href="https://x.com/ChrisMulea96895/status/1967622801319424323">greeted by a mysterious “Error 17”</a> that then sent them back into the queue. Others hopelessly suffered as <a href="https://x.com/josejmurillo/status/1967624598754939237">they got bounced around in line</a> after multiple captcha checks to validate whether they were human or not.</p> <p>Adorned with a healthy splash of color, clearly the new Mega Charizard X ex is one of the main appeals of the new cards, along with Mega Gengar. I’m also really digging the moody, dark card sleeves. Shame that so few people will be buying them at normal prices any time soon.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-expect-hollow-knight-silksong-to-nerf-any-more-bosses-just-yet.1299192/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> hasn’t been <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-hollow-knight-team-cherry-seth-goldman-2000625769">out for even two weeks yet</a> and it’s already getting its second patch. But for anyone still struggling in some of the game’s more brutal boss fights and platforming sections: don’t expect any more relief just yet. The Metroidvania Soulslike’s new update mostly takes aim at some of the smaller bugs fans are facing.</p> <p>“We’re getting close to finalizing the second post-release patch for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>,” Team Cherry <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/546746634645557243/">announced</a> on Steam on Tuesday. “Where the first patch dealt mainly with critical issues, this next one focuses on a few still remaining, while also cleaning up some bugs around specific tools.”</p> <p>While not live in the game on PC or console yet, players can test the fixes in the public beta branch on Valve’s storefront while the developers work on adding a few more fixes and improvements. Here’s the full patch notes so far for <em>Silksong</em> update 2:</p>

 <blockquote><p>– Added Dithering effect option in Advanced video settings. Reduces colour banding but can slightly soften the appearance of foreground assets. Defaults to ‘Off’.<br> – Updated Herald’s Wish achievement description to clarify that players must both complete the wish and finish the game.<br> – Fixed Savage Beastfly in Far Fields sometimes remaining below the lava.<br> – Fixed rare cases of Shrine Guardian Seth getting out of bounds during battle.<br> – Added catch to prevent Lugoli sometimes flying off screen and not returning during battle.<br> – Further reduced chance of Silk Snippers getting stuck out of bounds in Chapel of the Reaper battle.<br> – Fixed various instances of dying to bosses while killing them causing death sequences to play messily or out of sync.<br> – Fixed Shaman Binding into a bottom transition causing a softlock.<br> – Cocoon positions in some locations updated to prevent it spawning in inaccessible areas.<br> – Fixed Liquid Lacquer courier delivery not being accessible in Steel Soul mode.<br> – Fixed some NPCs not correctly playing cursed hint dialogues in certain instances.<br> – Fixed Pondcatcher Reed not being able to fly away after singing.<br> – Fixed Verdania memory orbs sometimes replaying layered screen-edge burst effects.<br> – Fixed the break counter not working for certain multihitter tools eg Conchcutter.<br> – Fixed Volt Filament damage multiplier not applying for certain Silk Skills.<br> – Fixed Cogflies and Wisps inappropriately targeting Skullwings.<br> – Fixed Cogflies incorrectly resetting their HP to full on scene change.<br> – Fixed Curveclaw always breaking on the first hit after being deflected.<br> – Fixed Plasmium Phial and Flea Brew sometimes not restoring as intended at benches.<br> – Various other smaller tweaks and fixes.</p></blockquote> <p>This patch will arrive as players continue to debate <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-difficulty-hard-damage-criticism-2000624031"><em>Silksong</em>‘s difficulty</a> and whether some of the more challenging sections are hard for a reason or just annoying for no reason. <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-notes-moorwing-2000624424">The game’s first patch</a> took aim at some of these complaints, including making the dreaded Moorwing boss fight easier to survive. There’s also been some debate over whether<em> Silksong</em> is too stingy with Rosary Beads, its main currency for purchasing equipment, unlocking benches (save spots), and other important resources for the adventure.</p> <p>Even some super fans of the original <em>Hollow Knight</em> claim to have bounced off the sequel due to the more punishing gameplay. Team Cherry hasn’t signaled yet if it plans to eventually make deeper changes to<em> Silksong</em> to address some of these concerns, or add difficulty settings to help struggling players <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-difficulty-hollow-knight-easy-mode-2000624441">experience more of its excellent world and story</a>.</p>

              <p>In 2005, a very inevitable-feeling game was released. In fact, it’s remarkable it was as late as that year that we first saw a video game based on the massive television hospital drama <em>ER.</em> The 1994 show that launched George Clooney’s career (if you don’t count <em>Roseanne</em>) had already lost the actor to Hollywood, and by 2005 was very much waning (down from a peak of 36 million viewers to 17.5m), albeit still four years from its eventual demise. Yet, honestly, there was no point in the show’s lifetime when&nbsp;<em>ER: The Game</em> would have made a lick of sense. It remains one of the weirdest video games ever made. Let’s celebrate that.</p> <p>(To get this out of the way, when I say “20 years since,” this isn’t an exact measure. The game came out in the U.S. in May of 2005, but here in the UK it didn’t appear until September.)</p> <p><em>ER</em>, the TV show, certainly had a sense of humor, but it’s fair to say that it was very firmly a drama. These doctors were dealing with life and death, as well as lots of kissing, and there was that time Quentin Tarantino directed an episode. If you wanted silliness, you needed to change channels and watch the extraordinarily weird rival hospital drama <em>Chicago Hope.&nbsp;</em>So it remains a massive mystery how the video game incarnation of the series played like a spiritual sequel to Bullfrog’s&nbsp;<em>Theme Hospital</em>. This was a game in which you had to deal with an invasion of ninjas, and perform an operation while fairies danced around you and a football player kept appearing and disappearing at the foot of the bed.</p>

 <p>OK, let’s give this a bit of context. In 2004, EA’s&nbsp;<em>The Sims 2</em> had released, and controlling characters from an isometric view was big business.&nbsp;<em>ER: The Game</em> very much mimicked the look of the&nbsp;<em>Sims</em> sequel, with its cut-off view of walled rooms and NPC characters roaming around the corridors. And like in <em>The Sims</em>, you had to control your character to perform a series of tasks within strict time limits while maintaining their hygiene, health, and relationships. It’s just, you had to do all this while being an intern in the Chicago hospital, surrounded by the characters from the show. And I really do mean the characters from the show. Completely improbably, frankly inexplicably, this game almost no one heard of, let alone played, starred proper members of the TV show’s cast as voice actors. Noah Wyle, Sherry Stringfield, Mekhi Phifer, and Yvette Freeman all showed up, despite surely having nothing in their contracts that would have made them do so, voicing the doctors and nurses with whom you needed to get along. Sadly Maura Tierney and Goran Visnjic were no-shows, and obviously Anthony Edwards and George Clooney were long gone, but still.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000626003" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626003"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626003">© Mindscape / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I’m not an expert in how real hospitals are run, but I’m reasonably sure that it’s not entirely a gift-based economy. Yet this is how <em>ER: The Game</em> pitched things, with your relationship statuses with your colleagues often decided by the presents you’d buy for them and receive from them. Even the patients would give you a present if they were happy with your performance. Along the way, you gained new skills and talents, each boosted by being in the positive company of more talented co-workers, as you treated patients for their broken bones, neurological issues, and toxicology-based troubles. It was the latter that led to the most memorable moments.</p>

 <p>It has been 20 years since I played this game, and tragically it’s no longer available to buy. (This is definitely one GOG needs to rescue.) I am delighted to say that I do, however, still have the DVD on which it was released. The only issue is I don’t own a DVD drive, and as such can only show it to my PC, which just stares nostalgically at the shiny plastic. Fortunately, I do have my memories, and a copy of the review I wrote for it back in a 2005 print edition of <em>PC Gamer</em>. Let me quote from it:</p> <blockquote><p>“It’s certainly the best rubbish game I’ve played in as long as I can remember.”</p></blockquote> <figure id="attachment_2000626004" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626004"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626004">© Mindscape / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s remarkable how far the incompetently-made game’s utter weirdness carried it, the sheer charm of its absurdity making it a compelling play. And never more so than in that scene when my character started seeing fairies. It was a great level! Everyone was being so nice to me, and my medical skills were hugely improved. Even Dr. Pratt (Phifer) has stopped being a complete dick—the dude had taken a real disliking to me, and wouldn’t even talk about the weather when I tried to chat. The fairies dancing around the room did make the situation somewhat suspect, and like I said, there was that footballer in his full kit who would appear and disappear. That didn’t seem <em>quite</em> right. But it was still a disappointment when I woke up in a bed with Dr. Carter (Wyle) shouting at me. At this point, back in reality, the hospital had been invaded by a ninja and I was needed to help find him on the security cameras. One shift later I was kissing Dr. Carter.</p>

 <p>It’s a shame it was so badly made. The controls were a shambles, various systems made little to no sense, and the act of having a conversation with a janitor was technically more complicated than performing surgery on a child. But 20 years later, that shit only makes me like it even more. And it certainly helped that as busted as it might have been, the game was so bonkers that literally anything could happen, including a sudden mad rush of patients in cosplay after a disaster occurred at a sci-fi convention.</p> <p>Thank goodness for YouTubers, because you can still see the first 15 minutes of the game, complete with its utter lack of NPC pathfinding:</p>

  <p>It’s sad that as an industry we appear to be long past crappy TV tie-in games. Who can forget (no matter how hard they try) Telltale’s abysmal&nbsp;<em>CSI</em> games? Or&nbsp;<em>Deadliest Catch: Alaskan Storm</em>? Let alone&nbsp;<em>Prison Break: The Conspiracy</em>. And no, Netflix churning out mobile games for each new commission doesn’t count. We need more terrible games based on big-name franchises, or what’s even the point?</p> <p>Meanwhile, I’m beginning my campaign for GOG to rescue&nbsp;<em>ER</em> from obscurity, so I don’t have to be the only person who even remembers it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[HP Seems to Be Clearing Out a Bestseller, Its 17″ Laptop Bundle Just Crashed 70% (32GB RAM, 1TB SSD)]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-seems-to-be-clearing-out-a-bestseller-its-17-laptop-bundle-just-crashed-70-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-2000625799</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hp-seems-to-be-clearing-out-a-bestseller-its-17%E2%80%B3-laptop-bundle-just-crashed-70-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd.1299102/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Looking to upgrade that rinky dink laptop of yours? Direct your attention to Amazon. This HP listing comes bundled with a whole bunch of extra accessories including a wireless mouse, webcam covers, a cleaning cloth, an external DVD drive, USB port covers, and a portable 1TB SSD. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4125/">The whole set is marked down from $3,000 to just $900. Wowie, that’s a 70% discount amounting to a savings of $2,100.</a></p>
<p>Okay, so peak behind the curtains of online retail—the percentage off is never real. What I mean by that is Amazon is filled with a lot of laptop bundles that throw is some small accessories. Some of them you might use, like the wireless mouse. Some you never will, like the dust plugs.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4125/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>What sellers on Amazon like to do is take decent laptops, add in some freebies, set the price at an astronomical high and then immediately cut three quarters of it off with a sale.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what happened here. The price history only shows as far back as the beginning of September. On September 2, it got cut 70%.</p>
<p>Why do they do this? Shoppers will see the big red label marking “limited time deal” with a huge percentage next to it then go blind to everything else. But not you and me. We’re smarter than that.</p>
<p>What you need to do is judge these bundles at the price they are at like that’s their MSRP.</p>



<h2>What You’re Getting</h2>
<p>So what we have here is a 17.3-inch laptop, displaying in an HD resolution of 1920 by 1080. It’s a touchscreen so you can choose to operated it like a laptop or a tablet. <strong>The laptop comes pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro</strong>. It’s powered by a <strong>6-core AMD Ryzen 5</strong> and comes with <strong>32GB of RAM</strong> and <strong>a full 1TB of storage on its internal SSD</strong>. That ain’t bad! Plenty of room to store thousands of photos, videos, or documents of any kind.</p>
<p>The laptop supports Wi-Fi 6 as well as Bluetooth 5.4. You can connect to additional accessories using the variety of ports along the sides. You’ll find&nbsp; two USB-A ports, one USB-C port, an HDMI 1.4 slot, and an audio jack to connect headphones, desktop speakers, or a microphone.</p>
<p>HP equipped this laptop with a 720p HD front camera along with integrated dual array digital microphones. You can hop into a Zoom call or other video chat with friends or family, then use one of the included webcam covers to protect your privacy when not in use.</p>
