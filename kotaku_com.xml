I called it one of the best games in the series and the best-looking open-world game I’ve ever played. Set in feudal Japan, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-delay-march-february-1851736266&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-delay-march-february-1851736266"><em>Shadows</em></a></span> quickly became the second best-selling game of the year so far. And now, after the dust has settled, Ubisoft has revealed a months-long roadmap that includes new features, quests, options, gear, and even big parkour improvements. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/3rJiU861lAyWTYpvH3cfmY/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-update-a-first-look-at-whats-coming-next&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/3rJiU861lAyWTYpvH3cfmY/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-update-a-first-look-at-whats-coming-next" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On Wednesday</a></span>, Ubisoft published a short video detailing all the upcoming content and updates planned for <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows. </em>Most of the updates will be completely free, including a planned series of regular “Story Drops” that will add new quests, abilities, and activities while also providing more backstory for fan-favorite side characters. The first one lands in early May. </p><p>For fans of doing sick parkour leaps across buildings and up walls, Ubisoft is improving your parkour toolbox in a later May update that will add height-gaining back-ejects, fully re-animated height-gaining side-ejects, and a completely new parkour move called the Vertical Ledge Jump. This last one will let both characters jump straight up to grab low overhangs without needing a wall. Ubisoft also promises that “more little parkour tricks and improvements” will be added throughout 2025.</p><p>Another part of <em> Shadows’ </em>roadmap is a series of community-focused updates adding content and options based directly on player feedback, including the ability to toggle different in-game filters on and off as well as certain visual effects and character headgear during cutscenes.</p><figure id="" data-id="61b78b3ae42d610fbddc5875629509c2" data-recommend-id="image://61b78b3ae42d610fbddc5875629509c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="61b78b3ae42d610fbddc5875629509c2" data-recommend-id="image://61b78b3ae42d610fbddc5875629509c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ubisoft also says it has more surprises to reveal in the future and that this roadmap isn’t everything it has planned, but just the highlights that they wanted to let fans know about.  </p><p>Lastly, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> will receive its first paid expansion—<em>Claws Of Awaji</em>—later this year, seemingly sometime after June. It will add a new region to the world as well as a new weapon for Naoi: A bow staff.</p><p>That’s a lot of content and updates! It sounds like come this time next year—assuming Ubisoft sticks to this schedule—<em>Asssassin’s Creed Shadows </em>will be a much bigger and better game, which is impressive considering how excellent the game was at launch last month.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But the more disappointing news for fans is that Codemasters is done making rally games altogether. </p><p>As announced in the Wednesday update, Codemasters is “pausing” all current development on future dirt racing rally games, effectively killing the <em>Dirt/Colin McRae </em>rally franchise after two decades and 10+ entries.

We’ve provided a home for every rally enthusiast, striving tirelessly to push the boundaries and deliver the exhilarating thrill of driving on the ragged edge. We’ve brought together incredibly talented racing developers, worked with some of the sport’s icons, and had the opportunity to share our love of rallying. Thank you to all the fans who have and continue to be part of our rally journey.”</p><p>The studio promised fans that EA Sports <em>WRC </em>will continue to be “available” to new and existing players, so thankfully it doesn’t sound like the team’s last rally game will be delisted and shut down anytime soon. Still, it’s a shame to see the studio stepping away from rally racing after nearly 30 years of excellent games in a genre that is often ignored by other studios and publishers.</p><p>Codemasters will continue to develop other racing games, like EA’s yearly <em>F1 </em>series and possibly (hopefully) future entries in the track racer franchise <em>Grid</em>. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But firmware version 20.0.0 also made some other equally notable but less advertised changes, including a major shift to how Nintendo ranks best-selling games in the eShop. The result could have big ramifications for how games are discovered on one of the biggest console install-bases in history, and could help alleviate <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-eshop-switch-slop-clones-unpacking-scam-ai-art-1851722248&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-eshop-switch-slop-clones-unpacking-scam-ai-art-1851722248">some of the platform’s “slop” problem</a></span>. <br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,194644,196773" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Prior to Wednesday’s update, the “Best Sellers” section of the eShop covered the last 14 days and was arranged by total downloads. Now, however, the list is arranged by total revenue a game has generated from just the last three days. The shift was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6nDoGNfPc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3X6nDoGNfPc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted by <em>GVG</em></a></span> and documented at length on YouTube. “Hell has frozen over, folks, and Nintendo has massively changed chart discoverability with the latest Switch eShop OS update—in such a way that makes it clear that it’ll also carry through to the Switch 2,” game discoverability expert <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://lnkd.in/gPRBN5P5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://lnkd.in/gPRBN5P5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Simon Carless</a></span> posted <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7323333696051150848/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7323333696051150848/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on LinkedIn</a></span> following the news. <br></p><p>While there’s s still an option to revert to the previous view, the eShop now defaults to ranking games by revenue rather than individual units sold. Carless speculates that could stop companies from trying to game the charts by running steep discounts to gin up downloads, an incentive structure that led to lots of shovelware crowding out better quality games on the best sellers list. But he adds that it will also make it harder for cheaper games, including lots of smaller indie titles, to compete for high-ranking slots against pricier blockbusters. </p><p>So what does this change look like in practice? Just about every game in the best seller list, with the exception of <em>Minecraft</em>, is different than it was a couple days ago, according to <em>GVG</em>’s comparison. The chart heavily favors games that aren’t on sale and Nintendo games in particular, with seven of the top 12 being first-party releases. The deals list has similarly been skewed away from just the games that are the most discounted, now heavily featuring those that are both heavily discounted and selling well. I had to scroll for a bit before stumbling on an obvious shovelware cash grab like <em>I Am Busy Digging A Hole</em>, an asset-flip sim aimed at capitalizing on the success of the similarly titled <em>A Game About Digging A Hole</em> which is only on Steam at the moment.</p><p>Unfortunately, on the best seller list at least, you have to toggle over to the “download only” list before you start to see lots of smaller indie games, though even those are dominated by existing winners. The <em>Gloomhaven</em>-inspired party RPG <em>Sunderfolk</em> was the only recently released game in the top 10 when I looked today. As <em>GVG </em>mentions in its video, the eShop change has gone a long way to pushing “slop” off of the discoverability pages, but it’s also done the same to many indie releases. Also the storefront is still incredibly sluggish and loads like molasses. The Switch 2 version can’t come soon enough.</p><p>What else could Nintendo do to improve store browsing in the meantime? Some developers have suggested a new browser tab purely for curated picks. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pushtotalk.gg/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pushtotalk.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Push to Talk</em></a></span>’s Ryan Rigney recommended a new and trending section that takes into account the eShop’s own wishlisting system and other users’ activity on the store, similar to how Valve seemingly does it on Steam. Any new options would be better than none at all, though it’s interesting to see Nintendo tinkering more with the eShop now than it has in almost the entirety of the Switch’s existence (people also have strong feelings about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/rip-orange-eshop-nintendo-fans-bid-farewell-to-iconic-switch-color&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rip-orange-eshop-nintendo-fans-bid-farewell-to-iconic-switch-color" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the move from orange to red</a></span>). </p><p>“Thanks to the system’s performance capabilities, Nintendo eShop on Switch 2 has been improved and runs smoothly even when displaying a large number of games,” Nintendo’s developers said earlier this month. “We believe the act of finding the game you want to play is itself part of the game system experience.” They’ve promised better speed, overall performance, and a new “Game Finds” feature for more easily scrolling through images and videos on the Switch 2's eShop, though it doesn’t sound like any of those improvements will be trickling back down to the older hardware. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
