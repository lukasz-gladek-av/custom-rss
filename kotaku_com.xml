Then on April 8, someone bought the device for $2,000, which the seller accepted. At the moment, that’s all we know. I reached out to Valve and the person who allegedly sold the Steam Deck prototype on eBay to see if I could learn more about the device or how it was acquired. I’ve yet to hear back from either party. </p><figure id="" data-id="17a64d93e5b1aa49b3a8c3ed82ea60a5" data-recommend-id="image://17a64d93e5b1aa49b3a8c3ed82ea60a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Reddit / eBay / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="17a64d93e5b1aa49b3a8c3ed82ea60a5" data-recommend-id="image://17a64d93e5b1aa49b3a8c3ed82ea60a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1jurheo/a_steam_deck_engineering_prototype_was_just_sold/#lightbox&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1jurheo/a_steam_deck_engineering_prototype_was_just_sold/#lightbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Looking at the photos posted to Reddit by user Gary_the_mememachine</a></span>, the prototype Steam Deck is marked with a label on the back that says “Engineering Sample 34.” The front and back of the device are shaped differently than on a retail Steam Deck and its upgraded OLED model. It appears to be missing a right joystick, too. Oh, and the label on the back mentions that this alleged prototype isn’t meant to be sold. Oops!</p><p><em>SteamDeckHQ</em> further reports that the seller claimed the prototype doesn’t have an OS installed and shared images of the device’s boot screen with more information about it. </p><p>Perhaps this is an elaborate fake. That’s possible. But I think a real Steam Deck prototype was just sold online and I’m curious how Valve feels about that. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But some of that rebalancing ended up leaking out into the full campaign, and overall many players felt the changes made the game’s <em>Souls</em>-inspired combat meat grinder feel way overtuned and unrewarding. Negative user reviews instantly started pouring in on Steam and pushed <em>Path of Exile 2</em>'s rating down into mixed territory. </p><p>“Every boss fight is incredibly longer than it needs to be. Most of the skills do little to no damage,” wrote one player reviewing the game on Steam. “I understand they said they wanted to slow game play down, but I don’t think I will even make it more than 1 week in this league at this point.” Another asked, “how do you have a relatively good first patch then wait 3 months nerf everything and make the campaign a worse experience?” Some fans on the game’s subreddit were similarly apoplectic.<strong> </strong>“I was going to take a day or two off work to play this game,” one <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1jrrn4y/jonathanmark_this_aint_it/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PathOfExile2/comments/1jrrn4y/jonathanmark_this_aint_it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span>. “But I removed my vacation I had put in. I’d rather just go into work than play this game right now.”</p><p>Grinding Gear rushed into action with a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3746205&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3746205" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">series of quick patches</a></span> to try and ameliorate the key pain points, including the new Huntress class being so reliant on a parry mechanic to be effective, as well as more basic complaints around crashes and server disconnects. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3750853&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/3750853" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A long list of balance changes</a></span> was outlined earlier today to go live across the rest of the week, including making a range of character skills more powerful. “Now that we have a lot of the nerfs out of the way, we can concentrate on buffing things that are not performing well,” the developers wrote. </p><p>In some ways, that sounds like Early Access working exactly as intended, though there are perhaps deeper philosophical issues underlying some of the ongoing community angst around each big new<em> Path of Exile 2 </em>update. Some of that has to do with a clear, overall effort to make a game that’s (somewhat) more approachable to get into than its predecessor, but also decisively more punishing.  Some of it has to do with the fact that people who still love and play the original<em> Path of Exile</em> feel left behind. That game’s next big season was delayed as Grinding Gear <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/path-exile-2-poe-1-league-date-roadmap-update-1851751502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/path-exile-2-poe-1-league-date-roadmap-update-1851751502">tries to get a handle on the sequel</a></span>. </p><p>“I think a running theme with <em>PoE 2</em> in general is that the target to hit is smaller because if we want the combat to be more engaging, then that means there’s a smaller target; it puts more pressure on the balance to be right,” Rogers said during yesterday’s livestream. Some fans were critical of him for appearing “defensive” early on during the interview. He apologized toward the end of the chat and said he had just gotten up on the wrong side of the bed. Roberts added that he actually thought it was one of the duo’s more productive discussions about the game because they came out of it ready to launch over a dozen changes to get <em>Path of Exile 2 </em>back on track. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The second season deals with the mistrust Ellie has formed for Joel after suspecting him of lying to her about what happened after she was put under for the surgery. If you’re familiar with the PlayStation games the series is based on, the second season will be both familiar. It’s the frustration you’ll also feel that necessitates this unsurprising season 3 renewal.</p><p>Eight months ago, <em>The Last of Us</em> director Craig Mazin <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/hbo-the-last-of-us-tell-part-2s-story-season-3-4/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/hbo-the-last-of-us-tell-part-2s-story-season-3-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Deadline</em></a></span> that the show’s team got so much more story material from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-2-tlou-remastered-review-1851167660&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-2-tlou-remastered-review-1851167660"><em>The Last of Us Part II</em></a></span><em> </em>compared to its predecessor that there was likely no way they could properly tell the game’s full story in two seasons. He not only confirmed the series would need a third season before premiering the second season, but also hinted at episodes beyond that horizon. </p><p>“We don’t think that we’re going to be able to tell the story even within two seasons [2 and 3] because we’re taking our time and go down interesting pathways which we did a little bit in Season 1 too,” Mazin said. “We feel like it’s almost assuredly going to be the case that — as long as people keep watching and we can keep making more television — Season 3 will be significantly larger. And indeed, the story may require Season 4.”</p><p>With the new season being two episodes shorter than the first season, and our own Kenneth Shepard <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661">being unimpressed</a></span> with what he found to be the second season’s overly expository storytelling, season 3 might need to come sooner than later. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
