While that scene was apparently filmed, it was cut because, according to Washington, the people in charged chickened out. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The original <em>Gladiator </em>was released all the way back in 2000 and became a massive hit for director Ridley Scott. It starred Russel Crowe as Maximus, a powerful Roman general who is betrayed, made a slave, and forced to fight in the gladiator arena. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gladiator-2-paul-mescal-pedro-pascal-trailer-date-1851570038&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gladiator-2-paul-mescal-pedro-pascal-trailer-date-1851570038">The sequel stars Paul Mescal as Lucius Verus</a></span>, the son of Maximus, who finds himself in a similar situation. The movie also stars Denzel Washington as Macrinus, a former slave looking to take over Rome, and according to returning director Scott, the character was supposed to have a “twinkle” of bisexuality. However, one scene showing this part of the character has seemingly been cut. </p><p>In a recent interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LRLe9bpGTQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LRLe9bpGTQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gayety</em></a></span>, Washington sat down to talk about just how gay the Roman Empire is in the new historical epic. That’s when the <em>Equalizer </em>actor revealed the deleted gay kiss. </p><p>“I actually kissed a man in the film but they took it out, they cut it,” said Washington. “I think they got chicken. I kissed a guy full on the lips and I guess they weren’t ready for that yet.” </p><p>Washington then explained that the man he kissed in the deleted scene didn’t last long, adding: “I killed him about five minutes later. It’s <em>Gladiator</em>. It’s the kiss of death.” </p><p>Meanwhile, Denzel Washington is set to have a role in the next<em> Black Panther</em> movie from Marvel and Disney. As he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.npr.org/2024/11/13/nx-s1-5189146/denzel-washington-black-panther-3-retire&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.npr.org/2024/11/13/nx-s1-5189146/denzel-washington-black-panther-3-retire" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained in a different interview</a></span>, at this point in his career he wants to do things he hasn’t done before because he doesn’t know “how many more films [he’s] going to make.” He also suggested that “it’s probably not that many.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/neil-druckmann-last-us-part-3-uncharted-naughty-dog-1851698579<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Fans have been patiently waiting for word of what Naughty Dog’s next big single-player game will be following<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-3-naughty-dog-grounded-2-1851221748&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-3-naughty-dog-grounded-2-1851221748"><em>The Last of Us Part II</em> and multiple remasters</a></span>. While studio head Neil Druckmann didn’t hint at what that project might be, he reportedly confirmed during a recent roundtable discussion that he’s been working on his next game since 2020. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195928" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="190" data-playlist="195928,195922,196345" data-current="195928"><div><p>How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21446.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The comment came during a Jewish Visionaries in Gaming talk held online this week in which Druckmann appeared alongside Ken Levine of <em>BioShock</em> fame whose own upcoming game, the sci-fi shooter <em>Judas</em>, was revealed with a full trailer earlier this year. While Druckmann, who’s also been busy running Naughty Dog and co-creating the hit HBO adaptation of <em>The Last of Us</em>, didn’t say when his next game would be out, the 2020 marker suggests it might not be too far away at this point. </p><p>The roundtable discussion <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gr42v6/neil_druckmann_says_his_current_project_has_been/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gr42v6/neil_druckmann_says_his_current_project_has_been/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">started making the rounds on Reddit</a></span> earlier today, but the VOD has since been set to private on YouTube. While <em>Kotaku</em> was unable to view the full discussion, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/alonabadi/status/1857084744929841263&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/alonabadi/status/1857084744929841263" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another viewer</a></span> corroborated Druckmann’s mention of the 2020 date. Sony did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p>Naughty Dog has set the standard for blockbuster storytelling at PlayStation for years, but it’s been a while since the studio teased anything new. A <em>Last of Us Online</em> project that was expected to take the post-apocalyptic zombie survival formula into the live-service genre was suddenly canceled last fall. There’s also been a series of veteran departures at the studio in recent years, with Druckmann taking over as the top manager at Naughty Dog after former co-president Evan Wells <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/naughty-dog-neil-druckmann-evan-wells-tlou-president-1850633642&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/naughty-dog-neil-druckmann-evan-wells-tlou-president-1850633642">left in 2023</a></span>. </p><p>Given current development cycles for the biggest-budget games, it could still be a few more years until Druckmann’s next game, whatever it turns out to be, is actually in players’ hands. Things that used to take three to four years to make are now increasingly taking five to six, especially coming out of the 2020 pandemic. In addition to a new IP, fans have also been waiting to hear about the fate of <em>Uncharted, </em>which has been on ice since 2017's<em> Lost Legacy</em>. </p><p>Druckmann did speak once before about his next game in a now infamous Sony interview that was transcribed so inaccurately, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-us-2-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-sony-sequel-tlou3-1851500885&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-us-2-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-sony-sequel-tlou3-1851500885">entire thing had to be taken offline</a></span>. While the veteran writer and director was ridiculed online for appearing to suggest his next project would “redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming,” he later clarified that he never actually said those words. What he actually said was, “people even outside of gaming are looking at us to see what it is that we put out next.” </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
