The provision has been facing legal challenges ever since, but the latest loss and impending deadline leaves ByteDance less time and fewer options for avoiding a total ban of the app used by more than 170 million Americans. </p><p> A TikTok spokesman told NPR today that it will appeal the latest setback to the Supreme Court. Incoming President-Elect Donald Trump has also promised to “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://apnews.com/article/trump-tiktok-ban-congress-president-282d8df7b91dce270316509badd39978&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tiktok-ban-congress-president-282d8df7b91dce270316509badd39978" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">save TikTok</a></span>,” though it’s not clear what form that would take. It could mean another attempt to negotiate the sale of the app to a U.S. tech company like Microsoft or Apple. Earlier this week, Trump shared TikTok stats on Truth Social about his viral McDonalds and garbage truck videos from back during the campaign.</p><p>Gaming communities in particular have always thrived online, especially on social media, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tiktok-band-house-of-representatives-bill-pass-games-1851332769&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tiktok-band-house-of-representatives-bill-pass-games-1851332769">and Tiktok is no different</a></span>. The short-form video platform has become many fans’ go-to for reaction videos to the most popular new releases like <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> and <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>, as well as daily tips and meme content for live-service games like <em>Fortnite</em> and <em>Overwatch 2</em>. Despite attempts by Instagram and YouTube to copy its mechanics and algorithmic recommendation machine, neither has so far been able to replicate the formula at a similar level of success. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Others have been working to reverse-engineer how Netflix created the interactive video experiences. </p><p>“I couldn’t let this work go to waste,” Pixel, one of the fans working to archive everything, explained to<em> 404 Media</em>. “We’re talking about over 100 hours of video and ~ one thousand hours of dubbing.”</p><p>According to the outlet, some shows are already fully emulated and can be enjoyed via alternative video players. Other shows have been uploaded to YouTube and emulate the interactivity using on-screen links and cards that take you to other archived videos. This is actually a similar method to how <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/52ZkFD-YlmY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/52ZkFD-YlmY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix created some YouTube-exclusive ads</a></span> promoting the interactive shows a few years ago. </p><p>In order to get people to talk to them, <em>404 Media </em>agreed not to share the Discord channel and other places where these archiving methods are happening. <em>Kotaku </em>will also not be sharing them. There is a fear in the community that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/netflix-team-blue-bungie-blizzard-sony-closed-1851678075&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-team-blue-bungie-blizzard-sony-closed-1851678075">Netflix</a></span> will crack down on their efforts if these alternative options are too publicly shared online. </p><p>Pixel told <em>404 Media</em> that Netflix’s interactive shows relied on an “internal video” that contained all the different paths and endings. According to the archivist, these interactive shows were controlled by two JSON files. One controlled decisions and where to skip to in the video and the other file pulled in assets for the buttons.</p><p>“We currently have a proof-of-concept emulator running off a Python script that uses the JSONs to make functioning decisions, although it needs ironing out and button images are broken as of now,” explained Pixel. “We have a member of the team in Turkey that is hosting the files for once we get the emulator working on a webpage.”</p><p>According to Pixel, right now the biggest challenge the fans face in archiving all of this deleted Netflix content is keeping track of everything. </p><p>“We have a lot of people counting on us,” said Pixel, “And I get a LOT of DMs from people asking how to play them.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
