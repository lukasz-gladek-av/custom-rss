              <p>A TikTok content creator allegedly flew all the way from the United States to Edinburgh, Scotland to stand outside the offices of <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a> developers Rockstar North and yell at people entering and exiting the studio. According to the creator, he is “sick and tired” of waiting for a new trailer or information on any further delays.</p> <p>On September 30, <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/gta-6-devs-harassed-by-tiktoker/">as spotted by </a><em>TheGamer,</em> TikTok user Backonboulevard shared a video on the social media service that appeared to show him staking out the Rockstar North office in Scotland and then yelling at two different people that he seemingly assumed were developers working on<em> GTA 6</em> after spotting them entering and exiting the building. The video has over 140,000 views and is currently pinned on the TikTok user’s channel.</p>

 <p>In the first incident, a person can be seen walking toward the office when Backonboulevard yells at them: “When’s the delay? When’s the next trailer? I wanna know!” The person shrugs, starts walking away quickly, and replies, “I don’t know.”</p>

   <p>In another incident shown in the video, Backonboulevard seemingly follows a person after they have presumably left the office and shouts at them, asking: “When’s the delay happening? Is there another delay? What about the trailer? Another trailer? You can’t tell me? You can’t tell me? You can’t tell me nothing?” That person looks visibly scared and understandably nervous about a random dude aggressively confronting them in the dark, and quickly flees the scene as the TikTok creator follows before the video cuts.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted the TikTok user about the video and reached out to Rockstar Games.</p> <p>“I’m sick and tired of waiting for the answers,” explained Backonboulevard in the video. At another point, he showed the outside of Rockstar North’s offices to prove he was there. “Right now we are here, right here, live from Rockstar North. I told you guys I wasn’t playing around.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://x.com/GameRoll_/status/1973022044251152503">On Tuesday, the video was flagged by <em>GTA</em> content creator GameRoll on Twitter</a>. “If you’re waiting outside of somebody’s workplace to harass employees over a video game, give your head a wobble,” said GameRoll.</p> <p>While many in the comments below GameRoll’s post shared disbelief and anger over what Backonboulevard seemingly did, there are many, many comments below the original video on TikTok that take the creator’s side and blame Rockstar’s lack of information and new trailers for the harassment. And to be clear: That’s fucking stupid and you should never, ever, ever sit outside a video game studio and harass the people inside and demand answers from them. That will never work out, it might get you in trouble legally, and it’s just a dick move.</p> <p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> is set to launch in May 2026 <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-may-2026-too-many-games-rockstar-trailer-2-1851778860">after being delayed earlier this year</a>. It will launch on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Don’t yell at the devs about it, okay?</p>

              <p>Peacemaker’s dance emote will return to <em>Fortnite</em> now that Epic Games is satisfied it had nothing to do with Nazi imagery. Following the reveal of the HBO show’s recent season 2 twist, the company implied it was concerned the dance moves<a href="https://kotaku.com/peacemaker-fortnite-nazi-emote-season-2-spoilers-2000629842"> intentionally recreated a swastika</a>. The emote will now return next week, with modified animations.</p> <p>“We’ve worked closely with our partners at Warner Bros. Games to confirm there were no creative intentions to connect the Peaceful Hips Emote and the current <em>Peacemaker</em> storyline,” the<em> Fortnite</em> account on X posted on Wednesday. “To avoid any confusion, we’re modifying the Emote choreography in next week’s update. If they prefer, players can return the Emote without using a ticket.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/ial5jDTIFI">https://t.co/ial5jDTIFI</a> <a href="https://t.co/CnsrL8QL7t">pic.twitter.com/CnsrL8QL7t</a></p> <p>— Leryensu (@iLegendTz) <a href="https://twitter.com/iLegendTz/status/1973484250289807592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><strong>Spoiler warning:</strong> we’re about to mention some major plot points from <em>Peacemaker</em> season 2.</p> <p>This whole thing started after the alternate universe that John Cena’s Chris Smith has been exploring this season was revealed to be one in which Hitler’s Germany won WWII and America is now run by Nazis. If you then went back and looked at the&nbsp; dance in the Peaceful Hips <em>Fortnite</em> emote, which is supposed to be the one Cena does in the season 2 intro, you can sort of see that maybe there’s a swastika in there somewhere if you overlay multiple freeze frames.</p> <p>Epic Games then pulled the emote and said it would investigate to see if this had been done by someone at Warner Bros. on purpose. It seems the company is now satisfied that it was just an unintended coincidence. But what fans really want to know is if the dance will actually sync up to the music this time the way it’s choreographed in the show. We’ll know when the emote returns during <em>Fortnite</em>‘s reset next week on October 9.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-announces-luna-another-cloud-based-streaming-ga-1845170977">Luna, Amazon’s video game cloud-streaming service</a>, is shifting gears. While the service will still feature AAA video games like <em>Fallout</em> and <em>Dead Island,</em> the retail giant has announced new plans to “reimagine” Luna as a way for families to play casual, easier-to-learn games using their phones. And the first one of these games Amazon revealed is a courtroom comedy game featuring an AI-powered Snoop Dogg as the judge. Hmm.</p> <p>Launched back in 2020, <a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-cloud-streaming-war-xbox-ps5-ps-portal-luna-1851704159">Amazon Luna followed in the footsteps of Google’s video game streaming service</a>, Stadia. But unlike Stadia, <a href="https://kotaku.com/stadia-google-refund-cloud-streaming-assassins-creed-1849597014">which died back in 2022</a>, Amazon has continued to support Luna, offering a subscription service with access to over 100 games as well as giving Prime members a small catalog of games to play for free. It’s never felt like Luna was a big hit, though, despite some publishers like Ubisoft and EA continuing to support it. Well, Amazon seems to have admitted it wasn’t working, because the company just revealed big plans to rebrand Luna as a more casual experience built around couch co-op and new, unique games.</p>

  <p>On October 1, <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/new-amazon-luna">Amazon announced that later this year, Luna will change.</a> While the service will still allow you to buy and play AAA games, Amazon is going to target, as explained in a press release about the pivot, “the <span>100s of millions of people who&nbsp;</span><span>want</span><span> to experience the magic of playing games on the big screen but feel left out” due to games being too complicated or consoles being too expensive. Amazon’s play is to turn Luna into a place where friends and family members can gather around the TV, pull out their phones, and play less complicated games together. If this sounds a lot like Jackbox, well, congratulations, you too can be an Amazon Gaming executive.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p>The big centerpiece of this rebrand is Game Night, a new Amazon-developed hub within Luna that will offer a variety of Jackbox-like, family-friendly, casual games. Players just scan a QR code using their phone, and a few seconds later, they’re having a great time playing… a Snoop Dogg courtroom game powered by AI?</p>

 <p>Yeah, the big game revealed today is <span><i>Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg,&nbsp;</i>which Amazon describes as an “</span><span>AI‑powered improv courtroom game where players invent outrageous characters, spin wild stories, and do whatever it takes to defend their testimonies before Judge Snoop Dogg.” Gather around, grandma, pull out your Cricket Wireless smartphone, and let’s yell at an AI-powered recreation of a famous rapper who has, <a href="https://www.snooppassport.xyz/">let’s say,</a> <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/snoop-dogg-criticizes-lgbtq-couple-disney-lightyear-1236353064/">made some</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/20/g-s1-43733/snoop-dogg-trump-perform-inauguration">bad choices in recent years</a>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>Will this big pivot work out? I have no idea. A lot of this pitch reminds me of the same stuff Google said about Stadia and what Intellivision promised about <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-new-gaming-console-thats-become-a-giant-car-crash-1847699027">the disaster that is the Amico console</a>. Maybe Amazon will find success where others haven’t? Maybe. I mean, it’s not like Luna’s setting the world on fire at the moment. We’ll find out when the big pivot happens later this year.</p>
