              <p>The iconic Ray-Ban Wayfarer glasses have been cool all the way back to Buddy Holly and Roy Orbison in the ’50s, and now 7 decades later, they’re getting a whole new life as advanced tech wearables thanks to Meta. These retro-cool glasses are now 21st Century marvels with speakers, camera, mic, and Meta AI all discreetly built in, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6345/">they’re also a great limited-time deal at Amazon right now for just $224.</a></p>
<p>There are 10 different models of the Gen 1 Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers available as part of this limited-time deal, in regular and large sizes for men and women, with a variety of frame colors and lenses ranging from clear to transitions to different shades and colors of sunglasses. They’re the top-selling AI glasses in the world, and now you can find out why for $75 less.</p>

<h2>Big Tech, But With Style</h2>
<p>Futuristic tech mixed with impeccable classic style is the mashup we need right now, so seeing Meta team up with Ray-Ban rather than create some bizarre-looking goggles or helmet or other such thing is a hugely welcome development. The Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers looks like the regular Wayfarers made legendary by Jack Nicholson, Tom Cruise in <em>Risky Business</em>, and the Blues Brothers, but these also take seriously good 12MP photos and 1080p video, which is probably why&nbsp;<em>Popular Mechanics</em> calls them the best AI glasses for social media. To engage the camera, just touch a button on the glasses’ arm, or use a voice command.</p>
<p>(Side note: While the Wayfarers spiked again in popularity when&nbsp;<em>The Blues Brothers</em> came out in 1980, there’s an ongoing debate about whether they both wore Wayfarers, or if Dan Aykroyd’s Elwood actually wore lookalike vintage sunglasses. Either way, they’re indelibly associated with the Wayfarers.)</p>
<p>The Meta AI features are probably the most mindblowing of all. The multimodal AI can translate signs, identify objects, and even look up and give you historical information on something you’re looking at, in real time. It’s all done discreetly — you gain all of the information while to the rest of the world, you’re just a person in Wayfarers. Real-time audio translations from 6 languages and counting are built in, with no Wi-Fi connection necessary.</p>



<h2>Outstanding Audio</h2>
<p>Even without any actual in-ear extension, the custom-built open-ear speakers sound amazing during calls or if you’re listening to music or a podcast. You get immersive sound that doesn’t intrude on the people standing near you, and you can call and text hands-free. The incredible amount of interactivity provided by the Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers make them a content creator’s dream, a multitasker’s must-have, and they just look&nbsp;<em>cool</em> no matter which feature you’re using (or none.)</p>
<p>The opportunity to look like James Dean but have hidden tech worthy of James Bond is worth a heck of lot more than just $224, but that’s the Amazon price tag on the Ray-Ban Meta Wayfarers during this limited-time deal. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6345/">Save 25% and grab one of the best and coolest tech wearables available anywhere.&nbsp;</a></p>

              <p>Laptop upgrades can cost a pretty penny, depending on the features you’re after. If you’re a work professional or a student looking to upgrade their everyday machine, you need a model with a good display, a comfortable keyboard, a muscular processor, plus at least 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD. Most options offering these and more – especially the ones from known brands – sit well over $1,200, but that’s not the case today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6344/">We just spotted the 17-inch HP touchscreen laptop going for just $1,000 at Amazon, after the retailer generously took a whopping 67% off its usual $3,000 tag.</a> Orders placed within a couple of days arrive before Christmas, so you can also consider it as a gift for a loved one. Best of all, the retailer throws in a bunch of useful computer accessories worth almost $200 with your purchase – for absolutely nothing. There are no complicated coupon codes to enter to score the discount or the freebies. Just add the item to your cart, and the offers apply automatically. You’ll also save an additional 5% at checkout, which ultimately brings the overall price down even further. But as you’d expect, discounts this good don’t stick around for long. It’s best to hurry to grab yours, as the price could shoot back up any moment now.</p>

<h2>Incredible Work and Play Performance</h2>
<p>The roomy 17.3-inch HD+ (1600×900) display offers plenty of space to work and play without feeling limited. It not only pushes vibrant, detailed visuals, but also features an anti-glare coating that makes the overall viewing experience quite comfortable on the eyes. Whether you’re using it out there in the sun or while sitting in a dimly lit room, picture quality stays consistent and balanced. Touch support makes navigation easy. You won’t have to rely on the keypad or the mouse to find your way around things; just use your fingers directly on the screen to pinch, tap, scroll, draw, and even type. Paired with the screen is a spacious, full-sized backlit keyboard. It makes typing long documents easy on the wrists, while the backlight lets you hit goals even after the shadows fall.</p>



<p>The laptop runs on the AMD Ryzen 5 7430U 6-core processor, which is capable of hitting speeds up to 4.3GHz. It’s powerful enough to support you through all your tasks, from those early-morning deadlines to late-night passion projects. There’s a massive 32GB RAM to keep everything (video calls, resource-intensive applications, games) running smoothly; something that makes a huge difference during busy days when you need to handle a bunch of tasks at the same time. The 1TB SSD lets you store all your important files in a single place. You can throw in a ton of videos, high-resolution photos, work documents, research files, and more with ease. Even better, the memory and storage are expandable up to <strong>64GB RAM and 2TB SSD</strong>, respectively, so you can always add more as your needs grow in the future.</p>
<p>Battery life is just as solid. A single charge gets you up to 9 hours of video playback, meaning you can go a full day without plugging it in. Recharging doesn’t take forever either, thanks to HP Fast Charge that juices the laptop from 0 to 50% in just about 45 minutes. Plug it in during a quick lunch break at work, and come back to a machine ready to help you power through the rest of your day.</p>
<p>The accessory kit includes a Redragon mouse, an external CD/DVD drive, and a clean cloth. <strong>Windows 11 Pro</strong> also comes pre-installed, so you’re literally getting a machine that’s ready to go right out of the box.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ugreens-6-in-1-steam-deck-dock-falls-to-record-low-works-with-rog-ally-x-legion-go-macbook-and-more-2000652271</link>
            <guid>1379524</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Just a few years ago, Valve introduced us to a brand new way to play PC games with the advent of the Steam Deck. Sure, they just copy-pasted the Nintendo Switch, but the key difference here is you can play your Steam games on it. This kicked off a wholly new class of product with the PC gaming handheld. Taking your PC games with you on the go is something we’d only been dreaming of a decade ago. That kind of versatility is great for gamers. If you are a proud owner of Steam Deck, you can make it even more versatile with a Steam Deck dock. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/">This one from UGREEN offers a lot of flexibility are is right now discounted down by 35%. Normally the dock goes for $46, so this ends up shaving off $16</a>. You only need to pay $30 for a limited time.</p>
<p>Playing handheld with the Steam Deck is great. I mean, of course it is. That’s the thing it’s designed to do. However, maybe you don’t always want to play on just the 7.4-inch screen. Maybe you want to hook it up to your 65-inch screen in your living room. The Nintendo Switch can do that. So what about the Steam Deck?</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6343/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Extensive Connectivity for Gaming</h2>
<p>Well, the UGREEN docking station will allow you to connect your Steam Deck to an external display like a monitor or smart TV and be able to play in 4K at up to 120Hz. That kind of visual fidelity isn’t possible when playing handheld. Even with the best model, you’re only getting a 1280 by 800 resolution in up to 90Hz.</p>
<p>This docking station powers your Steam Deck while its sitting in place over USB-C. It utilizes 100W PD charging to provide fast power to your gaming handheld. That makes this dock not just great for playing your games on the big screen, but just being your Steam Deck’s home when you’re finished playing. This way each time you reach for it, you know it will be at full charge.</p>
<p>The dock also has two USB-A ports, great for connecting a wired controller. You can, of course, always choose to use a wireless controller instead over Bluetooth. It connects to a display over HDMI. It also has a built-in Ethernet port so you can maintain a fast connection when playing online multiplayer or just hoping to download a big game super fast. The port is capable of up to 1,000Mbps.</p>



<p>The UGREEN docking station stands apart from other third-party docks on the market because of its overall design.</p>
<p>It can fold up for easy storage. This also makes it practical to take it with you while traveling. Game handheld while on the plane and then go full screen with the TV when you reach your Airbnb.</p>
<p>You can also adjust the viewing angle of your Steam Deck. This is great for using the Steam Deck as a stand and playing off that like a Nintendo Switch in Tabletop Mode.</p>
<p>Under the docking station are a series of non-slip silicone. This adds stability so the dock won’t slide around inside or on top of your media center. It’ll stay firmly in place while you game.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/wd-6tb-external-hard-drive-hits-0-02-per-gb-after-falling-even-lower-than-black-friday-in-an-early-christmas-deal-2000652312</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Storage problems are common, but they don’t have to hold you back. If your current devices are overflowing with files, media content, and projects, it’s high time you grab a spacious external hard drive to get things moving again.</p>
<p>Depending on the capacity you’re after, these can cost a pretty penny, but not today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6342/">The WD 6TB portable external hard drive for PC and Mac is going for $137 at Amazon right now, after a sweet $33 discount</a>. It’s spacious enough to house all your important data, and the compact size makes it easy to carry your entire library with you, wherever you go.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6342/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stores All Your Important Files</h2>
<p>This portable drive works with both Windows and Mac. It comes formatted for Windows 10, 8.1, and 7.1, meaning you can just plug it into the USB 3.0/2.0 port of your device using the included cable to start transferring your files; no additional drivers needed. Users of Mac and other operating systems will need to reformat it manually, but the process is fairly straightforward and shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. Once all is set, you’re going to enjoy fast transfers, even when moving large files around.</p>
<p>It’s great for both work professionals and creatives looking to offload heavy stuff that’s taking up a lot of space on the internal drive. The 6TB capacity is quite spacious, and easily capable of housing thousands of high-resolution photos, hundreds of old and new videos, massive creative projects, long research papers, large office documents, and even your favorite gaming titles. We won’t say it’s a forever storage solution, because our needs will grow faster than you think, but it’ll still take you a long way before you need to upgrade again. Think at least a couple of years, unless you’re trying to create an unusually large creative or gaming library.</p>



<p>Its compact size and portability are another strong selling point. It sits nicely on your desk without taking up a lot of space, and slides into any backpack easily, without bulking things up. You’ll be able to take all your important stuff with you on the go; just plug it into your laptop or a remote desktop when you’re out and about, and access whatever you need instantly!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6342/">On a regular day, this drive would run you around $170, but the current 19% discount drops it to just $137.</a> It’s also the lowest we have seen it drop to in the last 30 days. If 6TB is more than what you need, there are several other configurations available, all of which are discounted. For instance, the 1TB version is sitting at just $59. You can also grab the 2TB model for $70, or the 4TB option for $114. Additionally, if you’re someone who deals with large chunks of data for different tasks on a regular basis, it’s also a good time to pick up a couple of these!</p>

              <p>Nintendo has just added a new game to its collection of GameCube Classics for the Switch 2’s Online + Expansion Pack subscription: 3D platform game <em>Wario World</em>.</p> <p>I’ve always loved the very existence of Wario. Antithesis villain characters are woefully underused in the realm of video games, despite those that we’re familiar with being so bloody brilliant. Wario, Shadow the Hedgehog…um… See! Oh wait, there was that Evil Crash Bandicoot that one time, right? But where’s a goatee-wearing Joel Miller who sides with the infected? Or a mirror world of mustachioed Pokémon, looking to capture human trainers in silver, spiky balls? (You know what the real problem is? In trying to think of examples for this dumb joke, I realized that nearly all video game leads these days are already antiheroes, which sucks.)</p> <p>Wario is the perfect platonic example of an antithesis character, the result of flipping an ‘M’ upside down and the pure evil that results. Yes, I have enormous love for Waluigi, but Wario is the OG. And let’s be honest, “Waluigi” is a semantic stretch. “Wario” is so clever not just because it invokes a Mario from the Upside Down, but because <i>warui</i> (悪い) literally means “bad.” No notes.</p>

 <p><em>Wario World</em> was the gold-loving monster’s first outing that wasn’t on a handheld. (Wario jokes at the start of the game that “I’ve always been stuck in those liquid crystal displays, but not anymore!”) While not made in-house at Nintendo—instead by Treasure, the team that brought us&nbsp;<em>Gunstar Heroes</em> and <em>Bangai-O</em>—it was clearly inspired by the design of <em>Mario 64</em>, albeit with a fixed camera, but with a much greater focus on combat.</p>

  <p>And it was good! Not great, not a <em>Mario</em>-like game-changing event, but a good, solid and extremely busy action-platformer. However, the concerns on its original 2003 release are somewhat lessened with the passing of time, not least the contentious nature of its brevity and price.&nbsp;<em>Wario World</em> was a premium game, but over in eight hours, and that sucked. But in 2025, when it’s the latest addition in a subscription pack you most likely pay for so you can play Switch games online, that issue becomes far less important. The retracing your steps and over-reliance on boss fights will still irk, but hey, it&nbsp;<em>feels</em> like it was free.</p> <p><em>Wario World</em> joins <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>, <em>F-ZERO GX</em>, <em>Soulcalibur II</em>, <em>Mario Smash Football</em>, <em>Chibi-Robo!</em> and <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> in the GameCube Classics collection. Still to be added but said to be coming soon are <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>, <em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em>, <em>Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</em> and&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Colosseum</em>.</p>
