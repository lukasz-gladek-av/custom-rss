And now, because of a moon in a screenshot, <em>GTA </em>superfans are convinced that on November 22, we’ll either get the next trailer or an announcement from Rockstar of when to expect.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1852350119250628835?&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/RockstarGames/status/1852350119250628835?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On November 1, Rockstar Games provided an update</a></span> on<em> GTA Online</em>’s next major patch, which is set to arrive in December. The tweet contained a screenshot of someone sitting on a car and looking at a building at night. And in the sky above is the moon. Seems like a fairly mundane, boring image. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1gh69am/a_waning_gibbous_moon_in_the_most_recent_rockstar/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1gh69am/a_waning_gibbous_moon_in_the_most_recent_rockstar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But one fan on Reddit</a></span> pointed out that the moon seen in the screenshot was in its waning gibbous phase. After some additional research, the community decided that on November 22, something will (<em>probably</em>) happen. </p><p>What exactly are they predicting? Well, that remains to be seen, with some suggesting a new trailer, others a release date announcement, and others a teaser for a future trailer. <br></p><p>This whole moon theory popped up not long after the tweet was published, but has continued to pick up support and momentum online as we get closer and closer to November 22. At first, this was a fringe theory, but now it’s all <em>GTA</em> fans can talk about at the moment. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/that1detectiv3/status/1858561899597619561&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/that1detectiv3/status/1858561899597619561" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I even saw one popular account suggest</a></span> that, because the first trailer contained a Tom Petty song off the album “Full Moon Fever,” this moon theory was more plausible. </p><p>Here’s the wild part: This isn’t the first time the Rockstar community has tried to predict the future using the phases of the moon as seen in a tweet. Last year, fans did the same thing, and guess what...<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1ghdw6o/before_yall_say_im_loosing_it_last_year_there_was/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GTA6/comments/1ghdw6o/before_yall_say_im_loosing_it_last_year_there_was/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> they ended up being right in the end</a></span>! Two months before the first <em>GTA 6</em> trailer was announced, Rockstar shared an image with the moon in it, with the phase pictured arriving on December 1. And weeks later, on December 1, Rockstar teased the December 5 release date for the first <em>GTA 6 </em>trailer. Hmmmm. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-ps5-pc-1851482968&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date-ps5-pc-1851482968"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> arrives in Fall 2025</a></span> for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. And, if all this is to be believed, we might be only a few days away from a new trailer for the highly anticipated open-world game. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That’s because the event changed its rules this year to allow DLC to be considered alongside full, standalone games. It seemed obvious that the loophole was added to give FromSoftware’s latest release a shot at recognition, and not undeservedly so. <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> has received almost universal acclaim. At its most reductive, it’s just more <em>Elden Ring</em>, but that still puts it head-and-shoulders above much of the competition.</p><p>At the same time, there are a bunch of other games that could have taken that nomination slot and added something newer and more interesting to the mix. Plus, it’ll be a bit weird if <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> wins and a bunch of people run out to play 2024’s GOTY, only to realize they need to play dozens of hours of a different game and also beat two of its toughest bosses. Maybe a better solution is just to give expansions their own category, especially as they become more and more frequent. <em>Factorio</em>’s <em>Space Age</em> DLC, for instance, just came out and reinvents a game that was already one of the best resource management sims around. —Ethan Gach </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="55c66314777f98a02f3007ceef94f978" data-recommend-id="image://55c66314777f98a02f3007ceef94f978" data-format="jpg" data-width="1022" data-height="575" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Helldivers stand triumphant on a hill.

Arrowhead Game Studios’ coop alien shooter was more than just a great game, it was an entire phenomenon, taking over Tiktok and even convincing normie friends of mine who haven’t played games in ages to hop in. While it’s on the lower end of the Metacritic spectrum for a GOTY winner (at 82), it’s one of the fresher and more innovative games of the decade so far.</p><p>The Game Awards jury didn’t agree, however. And based on years past, perhaps no standout game of 2024 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/awards/450688/what-makes-game-of-the-year-tgas&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/awards/450688/what-makes-game-of-the-year-tgas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had more going against it</a></span> for a GOTY nomination than <em>Helldivers 2</em>. It’s a multiplayer game with no story-driven campaign, open world, or RPG systems to speak of. It didn’t have the blockbuster production chops to make up for it either, unlike 2016’s <em>Titanfall 2</em> which snuck into the category even before it was expanded to six entrants. Perhaps to make up for <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s snub, it’s in the running for best ongoing game despite not even being a year old yet. —Ethan Gach</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b1567bfb41aae79fd688796649a1ec93" data-recommend-id="image://b1567bfb41aae79fd688796649a1ec93" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cards on a board deal combo points.

Some great reviews here, positive chatter on social media there. Eventually, it had people everywhere hooked. Then it came to mobile and everyone kept playing its compulsive mix of roguelike deckbuilding and high-score arcade chase. The mix of playing card combos and<em> Diablo</em>-style buildcrafting is nominated across five different categories, including best game, best indie game, and best mobile game.</p><p>Its total number of nominations is equal to that of <em>Silent Hill 2</em> and one ahead of<em> Black Myth: Wukong</em>, and behind only <em>Astro Bot</em> and <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, which each have seven. It still seems like a long-shot for the best game win—my guess is that it and <em>Animal Well </em>split the best indie and best debut indie categories—but it’s an impressive showing for a game that wasn’t even on anyone’s radar until it blew up this year. — Ethan Gach</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="70897997f420d5fcdc92f3f980266a42" data-recommend-id="image://70897997f420d5fcdc92f3f980266a42" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dragon Age heroes confront a monster.

We here at <em>Kotaku </em>really like it. I’m currently in the middle of a 40+ hour playthrough and I’m loving it. Sure, it’s not perfect and some might miss the darker tone of the older <em>Dragon Age</em> games, but what’s here is a very good RPG that expertly balances combat, exploration, and narrative.</p><p>And yet, <em>Veilguard </em>only got one nomination at this year’s Game Awards. The new RPG from Bioware was nominated for “Innovation In Accessibility,” a very important category, and the devs should be proud. Still, it’s a bit wild that <em>Veilguard </em>failed to receive any other nominations at this year’s Game Awards. Perhaps the game was too new and too big, and so too few jurors had gotten a chance to finish it and vote for it. Or maybe it had some support, but it was too divisive to get enough votes in any one category. It’s a shame that one of the best BioWare RPGs in years won’t have a chance to win in the RPG category, yet a DLC for <em>Elden Ring</em> is in there. Strange year. — Zack Zwiezen</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="255c34c407ef6ab9e6891fe1070f8acd" data-recommend-id="image://255c34c407ef6ab9e6891fe1070f8acd" data-format="png" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Knuckles drinks coffee on a porch.

The very idea of remaking <em>Silent Hill 2</em> angered people, and it didn’t help that Bloober, a studio with a spotty track record, was handling it. Videos and screenshots that Konami released in the lead-up to the horror game’s launch were criticized and picked apart. And then it came out and…it was good. Really good, even. One of the best horror games in years.</p><p>Sure, the remake was not as impactful as the OG game, but they’re different enough that the new<em> Silent Hill 2</em> feels more like an adaption of the source material that’s worth experiencing in its own right, and not a replacement for the original classic. And now, after years of fans fearing that the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake would suck and ruin the game’s legacy, here we are in December and it’s up for multiple nominations at the Game Awards. What an unexpected ending to this whole saga, and some good news for the devs. — Zack Zwiezen</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c64c4da6a4a91d7006d1a1e79f3cf93f" data-recommend-id="image://c64c4da6a4a91d7006d1a1e79f3cf93f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1141" data-height="642" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A football player runs with the ball.

It has a higher Metacritic rating than every other game in the category, including <em>WWE 2K24 </em>and <em>F1 24</em>, even if it has far fewer overall reviews than those games. In the end, there’s probably just much less overall interest in a simulation of an American college sport among the Game Awards’ global jury pool. — Ethan Gach</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Scrolling down will let you see every card available in the three Genetic Apex booster packs. Click on the one you want and you’ll be able to trade your points for a copy.</p><p>Depending on the card’s rarity, it will cost a different amount of Pack Points. These aren’t given proper names but are categorized by Diamond, Star, and Crown cards. Here’s a breakdown of each rarity and their Pack Point cost:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>One Diamond – 35 Pack Points.

Includes most Stage 2 Pokémon cards.</li><li>Four Diamond – 500 Pack Points. These are ex Pokémon cards with CGI art.</li><li>One Star – 400 Pack Points. These are non-ex Pokémon cards with full illustration art.</li><li>Two Star – 1,250. These are ex Pokémon with full CGI art and Supporter cards with full illustration art.</li><li>Three Star – 1,500. These are limited to the headlining ex Pokémon for each booster pack and use unique full illustration art.</li><li>Crown – 2,500.

Each one will provide you with five points. <strong>That means the best way to farm Pack Points is to keep earning Pack Hourglasses so you can open more Booster Packs.</strong> Your best option to do that is by completing Battle Tasks or participating in limited-time events.</p><p>That isn’t to say you’ll be swimming with more points than you’ll know what to do with. It will take opening 100 booster packs before you can trade in for a basic ex card. Interested in the cooler full-art versions? You’ll need to open 250 boost packs total just to trade in for one of those.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-best-decks-mewtwo-charizard-1851696181&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-best-decks-mewtwo-charizard-1851696181">The 4 Best Decks To Dominate In <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em></a></span></p><p>There might be more enjoyment in trading in for some lower-end cards you keep missing. I had everything ready to make one of those annoying Mewtwo-Gardevoir decks except for a Ralts, but every pull and Wonder Pick left me with disappointment. Crafting that card was a simple process that filled me with joy and now I can take joy from those that I play against.</p><p>Of course, it’s all up to your personal preference at the end of the day. The minuscule chances of pulling those rarer cards are certainly a great reason to craft them instead. Statistically, you probably have better chances of getting the more common cards over time than a sick full-art Mewtwo.</p><hr><p>It doesn’t boast the best rates, but Pack Point Exchange is a nice option to get a specific card in <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>. You don’t need to rush yourself to use them too soon either. Although each expansion will use its own exclusive Pack Points, they won’t expire on you.
