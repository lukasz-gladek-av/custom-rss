No one. No one was counting. Including you, Kai, unless you think “another” is a numeral. Recognizing a win in no sense implies tallying anything. It doesn’t make sense. Stop saying it, man. Just <em>stop saying it</em>. In fact, unless you’ve got something useful to say, maybe don’t say anything at all?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196599,196029" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>For as long as I’ve played what I think we can sensibly call BioWare-like RPGs, this issue has driven me to distraction. Companion characters who feel the need to comment at the end of every battle, but say nothing of interest or worth, and then say it over and over and <em>over</em> again. Maybe it could not be a thing?</p><p>I <em>love</em>&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em>, I’ve been so fortunate to have had code for a couple of weeks before its release, but no deadline to finish it by—this has allowed me to really sink into it, to explore its sprawling Living Lands at my own pace, never pressured to reach a story beat. I spent the 25 to 30 hours the game is supposed to last reaching just its midpoint, and am still in no hurry. I suppose you could argue that I should be slightly more motivated to speed up given the scale and danger of the Dreamscourge, but I’m not able to live in denial of its spread being entirely beholden to my advancing the plot. The plague can wait, because I just saw what might be a hidden cave entrance and it could end up being a whole other dungeon to explore.</p><p>The catch is, I’ve survived a <em>lot</em> of battles, big and small, primarily skirmishes with Xaurips or spiders who are hanging out in the next valley I’m poking my nose into, defiantly fought entirely with my bow and arrow. And every single time, every single one of them, one of my two companions feels the need to comment on it. But each appears equipped with only two or three different things to say. So dear God, I’ve heard them all so many bloody times.</p><p>“Another glorious battle!” bellows Kai, my constant companion (I can no more leave him in camp than I could when he was in his Garrus incarnation in <em>Mass Effect</em>), following our killing a bunch of halfwits who couldn’t be talked out of trying to kill us. No, Kai, no it wasn’t. It was ignominious at best, and more realistically, fairly grotesque. His cheering in delight after I’ve been forced to slaughter some dumb-dumbs rebels who wouldn’t listen to calm reason makes me think there’s something really very wrong with him.</p><figure id="" data-id="276e820ccd0e9bcf568831e79f0b56c4" data-recommend-id="image://276e820ccd0e9bcf568831e79f0b56c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some very pretty fireworks during a boos fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Some very pretty fireworks during a boos fight." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="276e820ccd0e9bcf568831e79f0b56c4" data-recommend-id="image://276e820ccd0e9bcf568831e79f0b56c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Some very pretty fireworks during a boos fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Far worse occurred with another companion after a significant story event that I shall not spoil. Let’s put it this way: everything she’s known and loved has just been destroyed, she’s distraught, and seconds later, on stumbling into a group of sentient toadstools or the like, she’s straight back to happily cheering me on and celebrating wins.</p><p>Or how about one companion discovered later on who, <em>every single time</em> she uses her “dispel” ability, says the same two things. “What, like it’s hard?” and “Child’s play.” Both things. Every time. And neither of them makes <em>any</em> sense in context.</p><figure id="" data-id="531e3d97358421b5f26800921aa10599" data-recommend-id="image://531e3d97358421b5f26800921aa10599" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="My character staring down at the rocky wilderness of the Living Lands." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="My character staring down at the rocky wilderness of the Living Lands." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="531e3d97358421b5f26800921aa10599" data-recommend-id="image://531e3d97358421b5f26800921aa10599" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="My character staring down at the rocky wilderness of the Living Lands." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Avowed</em> deserves so much better than this! The game has fantastic writing throughout, with a really lovely group of chums to chat to, and banter between them all in camp is a real treat to stand still and listen to. So why, for the love of all things <em>why</em>, does each only have three things they say at the end of every fight?!</p><p>Given the verbose nature of Obsidian and BioWare’s RPGs, and how the voice actors must be spending days and days in the recording studio performing their billions of lines, why can’t they each just have a couple of dozen different post-fight lines to drop? It’d add, what, ten minutes to the recording time? And it’s not exactly a Herculean writing task. Watch, I’ll do some now:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>“Phew, glad we were able to put that lot down so quickly.”</li><li>“Hey, I think you clipped my ear with one of your shots that time!”</li><li>“Ha! They really thought they could beat us, didn’t they?”</li><li>“I told my parents it was worth spending so much time practicing with this bow.”</li><li>“Well, if they weren’t all dead, I think they’d have to admit they were impressed.”</li></ul><p>That was a minute’s work, and no, none of them is particularly good, but then nor is any line any companion has ever said in any game in the same circumstances. They’re certainly up there with Marius telling me that he’s pulled his shoulder for the 786th time.</p><p>All of them would be deeply annoying the second time they were spoken, so you write 20, 30 of them per character, and have them tick off so they don’t repeat until they’ve all been said. Done. Problem solved. I fixed a 30-year-old bane of RPGs, and I don’t even know how to use C++.</p><figure id="" data-id="6bce73ba6768622ada8eb2bc7a982d1b" data-recommend-id="image://6bce73ba6768622ada8eb2bc7a982d1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Giatta saying the unimprovable words, 'You irredeemable fucking swine...'" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Giatta saying the unimprovable words, 'You irredeemable fucking swine...'" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6bce73ba6768622ada8eb2bc7a982d1b" data-recommend-id="image://6bce73ba6768622ada8eb2bc7a982d1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Giatta saying the unimprovable words, 'You irredeemable fucking swine...'" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s an even easier solution. Hold on tight. Don’t have them say anything at all! Nothing needs to be said! I just killed seven skeletons that were stood by that rock, because I wanted to go past that rock. It wasn’t a battle about which operas will be written, it was just a bit of busywork in a video game. It requires no comment. Silence does perfectly.</p><p>Heck, I’ll compromise! I’m that decent. How about they only say their silly lines after a named boss fight? There are plenty of those in <em>Avowed</em>, and they tend to feel like a more major event, even if they’re just ticking off a bounty. When I’ve won one of those, I feel like I’ve at least achieved something, so sure, let Kai declare it a glorious battle. Give him his moment.</p><p>This is absolutely not an <em>Avowed</em> issue, but an RPG games issue. But that doesn’t let it off the hook. Obsidian, when you make the inevitably (and deeply desired) <em>Avowed 2</em>, please, <em>please</em>, could you be the team to lead the way on changing this? Because the choice is doing this, or I will somehow arrange for your friends and families to respond, “Great work, you really ate some mouthfuls” every single time you have a meal for the rest of your lives.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s the characters that are our vehicles down these cinematic roads paved in broken hearts, therapeutic laughs, and unnecessarily life-threatening stunts by Tom Cruise. The greatest characters in cinema history stay with us because they’re so well-written and acted that we can see ourselves having a drink with them, or dating them, or, in the case of most of Wes Anderson’s best characters, we just want to watch them, in all their colorful eccentricity, live in this world. </p><p>Anderson is one of the greatest filmmakers ever, and that’s in no small part because he’s created characters we find simultaneously surreal and relatable, even if we don’t understand why. Why do we admire people like <em>Bottle Rocket</em>’s Dignan (Owen Wilson), who refuse to accept reality, even when it’s slapping them in the face? Why do we sometimes cling to a version of ourselves that no longer exists like Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) in <em>The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou</em>? Anderson knows why, and he tells us through these unforgettable characters.<br></p><p>Before the acclaimed director releases his 12th film,&nbsp;<em>The Phoenician Scheme, </em>let’s revisit the characters that have defined his legacy and enriched our lives. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="842776bfa1b0e5abba050da15b65c67e" data-recommend-id="image://842776bfa1b0e5abba050da15b65c67e" data-format="jpg" data-width="736" data-height="690" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dignan deep in thought" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dignan deep in thought" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="842776bfa1b0e5abba050da15b65c67e" data-recommend-id="image://842776bfa1b0e5abba050da15b65c67e" data-format="jpg" data-width="736" data-height="690" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dignan deep in thought" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>We should all strive for the long-term optimism that Dignan (Owen Wilson), the protagonist of Anderson’s first feature film <em>Bottle Rocket</em>, has in his life’s blueprint. However, we probably shouldn’t base a 75-year plan on stumbling up the underworld ladder of criminality. Still, Dignan’s absurdist exaggeration of relatable human emotions—like the fear of mediocrity and the yearning for purpose—became an Anderson trademark that has endeared his characters to us for decades.</p><p>While Dignan isn’t as fleshed out as Anderson’s later characters, the depth of his delusion shifts from comedic to cautionary in the film’s final moments. As he sits in prison, his last words—“They’ll never catch me, man. ‘Cause I’m fucking innocent.”—perfectly encapsulate his unwavering belief in his own fantasy. Even in comedy, Anderson creates characters who can tickle our funny bone while simultaneously breaking our hearts.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="748aceecf10d39ba1b7352d50f1dc5fa" data-recommend-id="image://748aceecf10d39ba1b7352d50f1dc5fa" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1372" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Steve Zissou giving orders" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Steve Zissou giving orders" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="748aceecf10d39ba1b7352d50f1dc5fa" data-recommend-id="image://748aceecf10d39ba1b7352d50f1dc5fa" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1372" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Steve Zissou giving orders" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Steve Zissou (Bill Murray) embodies the tragicomic grandeur that defines Wes Anderson’s best characters—a man clinging to his past glory while barely holding his personal life together. His quest to kill the jaguar shark that ate his best friend is less about science and more about proving he still matters, making lines like “What would be the scientific purpose of killing it?” both hilarious and heartbreaking. His slow-motion strut through his boat&nbsp;the Belafonte, set to David Bowie’s “Queen Bitch,” paints him as a man desperate to maintain his legend, even as the world moves on without him.</p><p>Yet in the film’s most vulnerable moment, when he finally sees the shark, his whisper—“I wonder if it remembers me”—turns his vengeance into bittersweet acceptance. Murray brings Zissou to life with a perfect balance of deadpan humor and quiet melancholy, delivering every line with the kind of effortless charisma that makes him both absurd and deeply human. Whether he’s sulking in his wetsuit or rallying his dysfunctional crew, Murray’s presence makes Zissou more than just a parody of washed-up adventurers—he makes him unforgettable.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d5f360f90834166666fca199e7bf334f" data-recommend-id="image://d5f360f90834166666fca199e7bf334f" data-format="jpg" data-width="600" data-height="400" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Max Fischer teaching" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Max Fischer teaching" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d5f360f90834166666fca199e7bf334f" data-recommend-id="image://d5f360f90834166666fca199e7bf334f" data-format="jpg" data-width="600" data-height="400" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Max Fischer teaching" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman) is the blueprint for so many of Wes Anderson’s best characters—an overconfident dreamer, equal parts genius and disaster, whose ambition far outweighs his ability. He strides through <em>Rushmore</em> as if he owns it, despite being one of the worst students in the school, and his belief in his own brilliance is so unshakable that even when he’s failing, he’s still convinced he’s winning. His line, “I saved Latin. What did you ever do?” perfectly captures the delusional self-importance that makes him both hilarious and strangely inspiring. Like Steve Zissou or M. Gustave after him, Max isn’t just chasing success—he’s crafting his own legend, whether through his impossible aquarium project or his wildly over-the-top Vietnam War play, <em>Heaven and Hell</em>. </p><p>But Anderson’s best characters aren’t just cartoons; they’re flawed, deeply human figures hiding real pain beneath their quirks. Max’s heartbreak over Miss Cross (Olivia Williams), his crumbling friendship with Herman Blume (Bill Murray), and his desperation to matter in a world that keeps telling him he doesn’t, make him one of Anderson’s most enduring protagonists. And yet, by the end, as he orchestrates one last grand production—not a play, but a reconciliation—he learns that sometimes the grandest gestures aren’t about proving your worth, but about making peace. As “Ooh La La” by The Faces plays and he takes Miss Cross’s hand for a quiet dance, Max joins the legacy of Anderson’s most unforgettable characters—an outsider, a dreamer, and a legend in his own mind, but one we can’t help but root for.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="918816496f2f6da12cc2568d662665b4" data-recommend-id="image://918816496f2f6da12cc2568d662665b4" data-format="png" data-width="1240" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Augie Steenbeck looking out quizzically " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Augie Steenbeck looking out quizzically " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Universal</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="918816496f2f6da12cc2568d662665b4" data-recommend-id="image://918816496f2f6da12cc2568d662665b4" data-format="png" data-width="1240" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Augie Steenbeck looking out quizzically " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Augie Steenbeck (Jason Schwartzman) might be the most emotionally stranded character Wes Anderson has ever created—an expert at capturing the world through his camera but completely incapable of being present in his own life. When his wife dies, he doesn’t tell his children for three weeks, waiting until they’re quite literally stranded in the middle of nowhere before finally dropping the news with all the warmth of a weather report. </p><p>“She’s in the Tupperware,” he says flatly, holding up the ashes as if they’re just another piece of luggage. But Augie’s grief isn’t loud or theatrical—it’s buried so deep beneath his deadpan demeanor that even he doesn’t seem to recognize it. He moves through <em>Asteroid City</em> like a man rehearsing for a role he’s forgotten how to play, leaning on the safety of his routine and keeping everything—his emotions, his children, even himself—at arm’s length. </p><p>His moments with Midge Campbell (Scarlett Johansson) offer a glimpse of something raw, something unscripted, particularly their quiet, stunning exchange through the motel window, where she tells him to “just feel it” and he admits, “I don’t know how.” But Augie’s real breaking point comes not in the world of <em>Asteroid City</em>, but in the black-and-white void of the meta-play’s production, when he steps outside of himself entirely and asks the director, “Am I doing it right?” It’s the most vulnerable thing he could possibly say—not just about the performance, but about everything. About grieving. About parenting. About simply existing. And somehow, that single moment—simple, direct, heartbreaking—cements Augie as one of Anderson’s most painfully real characters.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="70c2936e87e0903dea664b0d1ed6e5a0" data-recommend-id="image://70c2936e87e0903dea664b0d1ed6e5a0" data-format="webp" data-width="800" data-height="439" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Francis Whitman figuring himself out" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Francis Whitman figuring himself out" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fox Searchlight Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="70c2936e87e0903dea664b0d1ed6e5a0" data-recommend-id="image://70c2936e87e0903dea664b0d1ed6e5a0" data-format="webp" data-width="800" data-height="439" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Francis Whitman figuring himself out" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Francis Whitman (Owen Wilson) is the kind of guy who hands his brothers laminated itineraries for their own emotional healing, as if a tight schedule and a few sacred temples will magically fix everything that’s broken between them. After nearly dying in a motorcycle accident, he rounds up his estranged brothers for a “spiritual journey” across India, but his idea of enlightenment is less about self-discovery and more about tightly scheduled temple visits and laminated trip plans. “I want us to be completely open with each other,” he declares, before dictating exactly how they should feel and what they should say.</p><p>His face, half-covered in bandages, is a perfect visual metaphor for the wounds he refuses to acknowledge. But beneath the forced optimism and suffocating leadership, Francis is drowning in unresolved trauma, haunted by a father who left him nothing but matching luggage and a mother who abandoned them entirely. His breaking point comes in a moment as ridiculous as it is raw—standing on a hilltop, screaming, “Let’s get a drink and talk it over!” as if healing can be scheduled like a pit stop. It’s only when he finally lets go—literally, dropping his father’s suitcases in the film’s final moments—that he begins to understand that some baggage is too heavy to carry forever. </p><p>Francis may never find the spiritual awakening he set out for, but in that quiet surrender, he embodies one of Anderson’s most enduring themes—the illusion of control in the face of grief—and cements himself as a pivotal figure in Anderson’s legacy of characters who mask deep emotional wounds with carefully curated exteriors.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ac011c440fec4f1b32c695bbac4a7229" data-recommend-id="image://ac011c440fec4f1b32c695bbac4a7229" data-format="jpg" data-width="2027" data-height="1140" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="M.

Gustave (Ralph Fiennes) <em>was</em> the hotel. Like so many of Anderson’s best characters, he is both a figure of control and a man completely out of his depth, clinging to a version of the world that no longer exists. He operates with impeccable charm and rigid etiquette, convinced that poetry, perfume, and perfect manners can hold back the tides of war and betrayal. But beneath the carefully curated exterior lies something deeper—a man terrified of irrelevance, desperate to preserve beauty in a world that seems intent on erasing it. </p><p>He fits perfectly in Anderson’s lineage of complicated men, from Royal Tenenbaum’s self-mythologizing to Steve Zissou’s delusional grandiosity—characters who perform their own importance even as their carefully built identities begin to crumble. What makes Gustave unforgettable is not just his refinement but his defiance, the quiet tragedy of someone who refuses to accept that the rules have changed. And yet, through the memory of Zero (Tony Revolori), he lingers—an echo of lost grandeur, as fragile and fleeting as the hotel itself.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="31010470ab37881d54319fba727e63cf" data-recommend-id="image://31010470ab37881d54319fba727e63cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="759" data-height="500" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arthur Howitzer Jr looking unimpressed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Arthur Howitzer Jr looking unimpressed" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Searchlight Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="31010470ab37881d54319fba727e63cf" data-recommend-id="image://31010470ab37881d54319fba727e63cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="759" data-height="500" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arthur Howitzer Jr looking unimpressed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>No one could create a character like Arthur Howitzer Jr. (Bill Murray) but Wes Anderson. He’s a<strong>&nbsp;</strong>man of quiet authority, deep sentimentality, and an unshakable devotion to a world that’s slipping away.  Howitzer is a figure who holds chaos together with a firm but gentle touch. He enforces a hilariously strict no-crying policy, yet he is the first to see the humanity in the stories his writers bring him, shaping their sprawling eccentricities into something refined. </p><p>Beneath his gruff pragmatism lies something deeply sentimental—he’s an editor who truly believes in the beauty of storytelling, even as the paper itself fades into memory. Bill Murray’s performance here is his best in any  Anderson movie (he’s been in ten), a masterclass in understated warmth and dry wit, embodying the weary but devoted editor with effortless charm. With just a raised eyebrow, a clipped piece of advice—”Just try to make it sound like you wrote it that way on purpose”—or a quiet, knowing glance, he gives Howitzer the gruff yet deeply sentimental presence that makes him feel like the soul of the newsroom.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f7d1a6a7e0d5a276d15982d56e32c241" data-recommend-id="image://f7d1a6a7e0d5a276d15982d56e32c241" data-format="webp" data-width="800" data-height="440" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Richie Tenenbaum getting ready" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Richie Tenenbaum getting ready" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f7d1a6a7e0d5a276d15982d56e32c241" data-recommend-id="image://f7d1a6a7e0d5a276d15982d56e32c241" data-format="webp" data-width="800" data-height="440" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Richie Tenenbaum getting ready" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There’s a certain kind of sadness that runs through Wes Anderson’s films—a deep, unspoken melancholy beneath the symmetry and pastel palettes—and no character embodies it more fully than Richie Tenenbaum (Luke Wilson). Among Anderson’s pantheon of emotionally stunted geniuses, misguided visionaries, and lost souls, Richie stands out as perhaps the purest example of quiet, unshakable heartbreak. </p><p>Richie barely speaks his pain aloud, instead carrying it in his hunched posture, his constant sunglasses, his resigned half-smiles. He is a man who once had a place in the world—graceful, adored, effortlessly talented—but now drifts outside of it, undone by love he can never fully have and a family he doesn’t know how to reconnect with. </p><p>What makes Richie one of Anderson’s greatest creations isn’t just his sadness but his underlying tenderness; he has the softest heart of any of Anderson’s tragic figures, and while others spiral into narcissism or self-indulgence, Richie’s pain is private, restrained, and deeply human. In a world of characters chasing lost potential, he is the one who seems to know, deep down, that it’s already gone—and yet, somehow, he still holds onto the smallest hope that something beautiful remains.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a69be0c611a4da7c0165026b3d0c656c" data-recommend-id="image://a69be0c611a4da7c0165026b3d0c656c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1030" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mr. Fox looking out optimistically" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mr. Fox looking out optimistically" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Fox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a69be0c611a4da7c0165026b3d0c656c" data-recommend-id="image://a69be0c611a4da7c0165026b3d0c656c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1030" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mr. Fox looking out optimistically" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>There’s a restless energy to Mr. Fox (George Clooney) that makes him one of Wes Anderson’s most compelling characters—a rogue caught between the wild animal he was born to be and the domesticated family man he’s trying to become. He is, at heart, a creature of impulse, forever chasing the next thrill, whether it’s stealing chickens or outwitting farmers, even as the consequences pile up around him. </p><p>What makes him so fascinating isn’t just his charm or cleverness but the underlying insecurity that drives him; he longs to be exceptional, to be remembered, to be <em>more</em> than just another fox scratching out an ordinary existence. And yet, beneath the bravado, there’s an ache of self-awareness—he knows, deep down, that his recklessness puts everything he loves at risk, that his need to prove himself is as much a flaw as it is a gift. </p><p>In a world of neatly arranged stop-motion frames, he is a burst of chaos, a contradiction, a character whose triumphs always come with a cost. And yet, like all of Anderson’s best creations, he is impossible not to root for, because no matter how many mistakes he makes, no matter how much he loses, he never stops reaching for something greater—even if it’s just one last, perfectly executed heist.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="32d75e64e15aa0b864d4a81029147328" data-recommend-id="image://32d75e64e15aa0b864d4a81029147328" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chief looking excited " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Chief looking excited " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Searchlight Picutres</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="32d75e64e15aa0b864d4a81029147328" data-recommend-id="image://32d75e64e15aa0b864d4a81029147328" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Chief looking excited " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s almost absurdly funny that the same actor who played Walter White, the ruthless and calculating kingpin of&nbsp;<em>Breaking Bad</em>, can also deliver a deeply heartfelt and compelling performance as a grumpy, stray dog in a Wes Anderson stop-motion film. There’s a rawness to Chief (Bryan Cranston) that sets him apart from the other dogs in <em>Isle of Dogs</em>—a scrappy stray who wears his independence like armor, convinced he’s better off alone. </p><p>Unlike the pampered house pets exiled to Trash Island, Chief has never known human affection, and he resents the very idea of servitude. But what makes him one of Wes Anderson’s best characters isn’t just his toughness or his bite—it’s the slow, reluctant unraveling of his defenses. Beneath the gruff exterior, there’s a deep, unspoken longing to belong, a flicker of uncertainty that grows as he bonds with Atari, the boy who sees past his snarls to something gentler underneath. </p><p>His transformation—from a cynical loner to a loyal protector—is one of Anderson’s most quietly affecting arcs, proving that even the most hardened creatures can find their place in the world. And in a film filled with symmetrical beauty and precision, Chief remains a glorious contradiction: a creature of instinct wrestling with the unfamiliar weight of love.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="751c7789e627cad8f0d8acc1af5c4104" data-recommend-id="image://751c7789e627cad8f0d8acc1af5c4104" data-format="jpg" data-width="640" data-height="347" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sam (left) and Suzy (right) sitting together " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sam (left) and Suzy (right) sitting together " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Focus Features</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="751c7789e627cad8f0d8acc1af5c4104" data-recommend-id="image://751c7789e627cad8f0d8acc1af5c4104" data-format="jpg" data-width="640" data-height="347" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sam (left) and Suzy (right) sitting together " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It may be hard to accept that Wes Anderson, a filmmaker known for his intricately damaged adults—men burdened by lost love, fathers drowning in regret—crafted his most affecting characters in two 12-year-olds who run away from home with a cat, a suitcase, and a record player. But, it’s true. Sam and Suzy (Jared Gilman &amp; Kara Hayward) in <em>Moonrise Kingdom</em> aren’t just kids playing house; they’re two souls who, despite their age, understand each other in a way the adults around them never could. </p><p>Sam, an orphan and outcast among his peers, is pragmatic and fiercely loyal, while Suzy, with her sharp gaze and stolen library books, carries the quiet rage of someone who feels fundamentally unseen. Together, they create a world of their own, a secret island refuge where they can exist without judgment. But what makes them Anderson’s best characters isn’t just their rebellious adventure—it’s the earnestness of their love, the way they approach life with the sincerity that only children can. </p><p>In a world of emotionally stunted grown-ups, Sam and Suzy are the only ones brave enough to demand something more: a life where they are understood, where they belong. And that’s what makes their story, despite its pastel whimsy, the most profoundly human one Anderson has ever told.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Hundreds of millions, possibly billions, have been lost over the past year to the hubristic concept of games people will want to keep playing, and investing in, for years to come. But it’s vital to remember there <em>are</em> live-service games that are still raking it in. One of the most impressive success stories is Ubisoft’s <em>Rainbow 6 Siege</em>, which ten years on from release is due to reveal a major update which is being claimed as “a new era.”</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196299" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="385" data-playlist="196299,195734,195189" data-current="196299"><div><p>You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21849.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Rainbow Six Siege X</em>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/1yyppDElemqVlUXSVif55M&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/1yyppDElemqVlUXSVif55M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is described by Ubisoft</a></span> as “the biggest transformation in the game’s history,” with the obvious aim to refresh the aging multiplayer game for the foreseeable future. This will involve new game modes, “deepened tactical gameplay,” and most likely a significant graphical tidying up. The ambiguity here is because, in the tiresome way of modern life, this is all based on a teaser for a teaser, the announcement that there’s to be The Rainbow Six Siege X Showcase on March 13. It’s to be a live event, taking place in Atlanta, Georgia, but obviously will be streamed online <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.twitch.tv/rainbow6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via the game’s Twitch channel</a></span>.</p><p><em>Siege</em> first launched in 2015, and was a flabby <em>Counter-Strike-</em>me-do, with poor sales. Ubisoft cannily switched to the live-service model, and over the next few years persisted with the game, reinventing it with free DLC, until it had become something enormously loved, and hugely successful. Yes indeed, it’s hard to imagine, but instead of just junking years of work and hundreds of millions of dollars spent, developers instead worked incredibly hard to bring the game to the point of massive popularity. Bewildering.</p><p>Ten years on, it looks like Ubisoft is taking a big gamble, and meddling with the format. All changes bring the threat of a core player-base’s fury, but it looks like the goal with the showcase is to ease everyone in to the second decade of the game’s existence with careful explanation. (There will always be those who would prefer their favorite game wither and die than ever evolve or advance, but they need to shhhhhhhh.)</p><p>Here’s a thought: The brief information about the changes mentions “deepened tactical gameplay,” and I can’t help wondering if there might be a desire to return to <em>Rainbow Six</em>’s roots. When the first game came out in 1998, it was wholly different to the <em>R6</em> people know today. Most significantly, you didn’t control a single character, but rather an entire squad. Those first few games were about <em>planning—</em>you we given detailed briefings about what your team needed to achieve, and then you strategized your approach all before ever showing up. Played best, the bit with soldiers running around was just the unfolding of pre-determined plans, with on-the-fly improvisation if something went wrong.</p><p>It’d be fascinating if <em>Siege</em> were to think about adding modes that re-evoked the series’ original spirit.</p><p>We’ll find out what Ubisoft are actually up to in just under a month.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
