            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Have we hit peak licensed Lego set? Maybe. The brick builder toy maker has been releasing more and more elaborate sets based on famous franchises at higher and higher prices. The new Lego Death Star <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-death-star-1000-most-expensive-set-star-wars-size-release-date-2000623168">will be $1,000</a>. What fools would pay that much for plastic? But now Lego has teased an upcoming <em>Star Trek: The Next Generation</em> set that’s probably the Enterprise-D and now <a href="https://youtu.be/nF-SR2UwGQ8?si=EEuRI0PGtYYUfzYw">I am that fool</a>.</p> <p>That’s because on Monday, Lego teased a new collaboration with <em>Star Trek</em> that saw Patrick Stewart’s Captain Jean-Luc Picard beamed into the Enterprise-D as a Lego figurine. Every nostalgic licensed cash-in seems silly until they finally find the one you can’t live without. A <em>Star Trek: TNG</em> Enterprise is about as close to that for me as you can get. I’m not saying I would make poor choices with my family’s finances to make whatever this set is show up on my doorstop at some point, but I’m not saying I wouldn’t either.</p>   <p>While an Enterprise-D Lego set seems like a sure bet with this tease out there, leaks from last month have only fueled fan speculation. Based on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1mfzqbr/icons_10356_star_trek_uss_enterprise_d_via_4chan/">a 4chan leak</a> of the images, which may or may not be accurate but certainly looked convincing, the set will be 3600 pieces and ship November 28 for $400. Fans will get the Enterprise plus mini-figures of Picard, Riker, Worf, Geordi, Data, Dr. Crusher, Wesley Crusher, Troi, and Guinan.</p>   <p>The Enterprise-D is the only toy model I ever put together and it’s the only Lego set I’d ever consider spending $400 on. But it’s not the only <em>Star Trek</em> set I’d get out my wallet for. A Klingon Bird of Prey? A Romulan Warbird? Don’t get me started on the Borg Cube. I would, in time, buy and build them all. The best part? Because it’s Lego I can create my very own three-nacelle Enterprise from the <em>TNG</em> series finale “All Good Things.” Fine. You win Lego. Make it so!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/tp-link-wifi-6-mesh-3-pack-drops-below-prime-day-pricing-cheaper-than-buying-singles-2000623518</link>

              <p>A sketchy home Wi-Fi system will drive you nuts in so many ways. Streaming fails, sudden lag fits during an intense gaming session, and those awful dead spots that somehow seem to move around the house — they all mean your home network is outdated or just too weak to give you a strong signal throughout the house.</p>
<p>A mesh Wi-Fi network is the answer — one hardwired mothership and two wireless beacons render your old router and extenders moot and give you a powerful, consistent signal everywhere. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3961/">Right now Amazon is running a great $140 sale on the TP-Link Deco X55 AX3000 Wi-Fi 6 mesh system</a>, which blankets up to 6,500 square feet in a signal strong enough to banish those dead spots and eliminate those laggy streaming and gaming sessions.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3961/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Lose the Boosters</h2>
<p>Wi-Fi boosters and wall-outlet range extenders were the best weapons against Wi-Fi dead spots and weak signals for years, but even at their best they only gave you marginal relief. As both Wi-Fi and the devices that rely on Wi-Fi evolved, those boosters and extenders fell way behind the times, and the mesh network stepped up to take on the fight.</p>
<p>TP-Link was one of the early adopters of mesh technology, and this is one of their better systems at an exceptional price. Each one of the 3 units has three Gigabit ports if you want or need to hardwire, and the easy-to-install network supports up to 150 devices to ensure you’re not experiencing web traffic jams when everyone logs in at the same time. The difference you’ll immediately experience is huge&nbsp; — speeds of up to 3,000Mbps, with TP-Link’s AI-Driven Smart Mesh technology that learns your network environment and user behaviors and adjusts on the fly to optimize your signal.</p>



<h2>Bigger and Safer</h2>
<p>The 6,500 square foot range of the TP-Link Deco X55 network is enough to cover most homes and often backyards or garages in a powerful signal. But if your home or property outstretch that coverage, adding another TP-Link Deco beacon is an inexpensive and amazingly easy solution — just plug it in and the network immediately adds it, and your signal and coverage grow.</p>
<p>The TP-Link Deco X55 mesh network is also sure to upgrade your home internet security, with a real-time network scanner that automatically detects threats, robust and easy to operate parental controls, and for an extra $6 per month or $55 per year you can install TP-Link’s HomeShield Pro service for DDoS attack prevention, advanced parental controls, and more.</p>
<p>The TP-Link Deco X55 mesh network and Deco app will take you from unboxing to a massive upgrade to your home Wi-Fi network in next to no time, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3961/">this Amazon deal that brings you the 3-pack set for just $140 is a 30% drop from the usual $200 price.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-difficulty-hard-damage-criticism-2000624031</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/difficulty-is-already-dominating-the-hollow-knight-silksong-conversation.1291710/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Fans have been waiting almost a decade to go hands-on with <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> and the hype was off the charts. Now that people are finally playing, those expectations have been brought back down to earth. <em>Silksong</em> is a good game. Maybe even a great one. But it is also a hard one. Harder than the first game? That depends on who you ask. While players rave about their favorite new characters, secrets, and boss fights, other are bouncing off the game, feeling unwelcomed by the new Metroidvania Soulslike.</p> <p>One of the biggest differences between<em> Silksong</em> and the original <em>Hollow Knight</em> is that enemies hit harder earlier in the game. Instead of taking one mask of damage off Hornet, even some rank-and-file minions can knock two off with each hit. Add to that the fact that Hornet can’t heal until a full wheel of silk has been earned and you have a recipe for an uncompromising early game. Maps and UI elements must also be purchased as upgrades, leaving newcomers who tend to easily get lost in 2D mazes scrambling more than usual to figure out where to go and what to do.</p> <p>“My wife is a massive <em>Hollow Knight</em> fan and has been waiting for <em>Silksong</em> to come out for years,” reads one of the biggest threads on the<em> Silksong</em> subreddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1nb6u1r/my_wife_has_been_waiting_for_years_for_silksong/">from this weekend</a>. “She is not the most skilled of players but she was able to complete <em>Hollow Knight</em> and enjoy her time. <em>Silksong</em>, instead, is breaking her apart. She has spent three days fighting Moorwing without beating it and she’s dropping the game for good. I hope she’ll pick it back up sometime but it’s sad to see all the anticipation die out like this.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000624073" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624073"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624073">Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p>Moorwing has been brutalizing many players in the Greymoor section of the game. The flying moth has lots of attacks that are tricky to dodge, and it requires a shocking number of hits to finally bring down. There are ways to accidentally skip the fight altogether or cheese him into submission, but if you’re just grinding <em>Silksong</em> out without searching for guides or trying to exploit tricks, it’s a pain in the ass, one of those fights for true Soulslike sickos and not necessarily for the people who come to <em>Hollow Knight</em> for the worldbuilding, exploration, and wonderful characters.</p> <h2>Is <em>Silksong</em> really harder than <em>Hollow Knight</em>?</h2> <p>There’s a good comment on the <em>Silksong</em> Steam discussion page that breaks down some of what might be going on with the initial reaction to the sequel. “People are complaining because this game doesn’t give them nail upgrades and an early charm system with charms that trivialize a lot of boss mechanics for 3/4th of the entire game, and instead attempts to get its players to recognize tells, queues, patterns, positioning, and programmed it’s enemies to specifically punish overly aggressive or greedy play,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1nbjivd/thats_the_best_comment_about_the_games_difficulty/">it reads</a>.</p>

 <p>Instead of treating <em>Hollow Knight</em> like a tutorial for <em>Silksong</em>, this argument claims some players are treating the new game like a continuation of the old one instead of recognizing the clear yet subtle differences, including a diagonal downward attack that complicates combat and platforming, especially for people used to the first game’s more straightforward up/down pogo-ing on top of enemies. Though there are Crests players can find in <em>Silksong</em> even early on to help make the game easier, it seems clear Team Cherry also made a point of not greasing the wheels with combat as much as it did with <em>Hollow Knight</em>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hunter's March is insane bro.</p> <p>Crazy difficult platforming and the enemies are hard too 💀</p> <p>These stupid bugs took FOREVER to beat. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Silksong?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Silksong</a> <a href="https://t.co/2EAEAnq5Vq">pic.twitter.com/2EAEAnq5Vq</a></p> <p>— KAMI (@Okami13_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Okami13_/status/1964177257175363631?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Enemies deal more damage, take longer to kill, and some of the longer run-backs after you die to a boss can be lowkey soul crushing. <a href="https://cdn.steamusercontent.com/ugc/13783810008345348251/6E499B8A265A90E34485F5954B0681F9DC5C8C8A/">Here’s a 30-second clip</a> of a player going back to the Act 1 boss after dying, a trek which includes more than one non-trivial platforming section. Whether players ultimately enjoy it or not, the double damage many enemies do compared to Hollow Knight is already <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1nb11gc/a_meme_about_silksongs_difficulty/">the biggest meme</a> coming out of<em> Silksong</em>‘s launch. “The reason it took so long to come out: Team cherry was trying to beat the game before they released it,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1nbgmfr/the_reason_it_took_so_long_to_come_out/">one fan joked</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Silksong</em> is too hard vs. <em>Silksong</em> is bad</h2> <p>The post-launch conversation around the <em>Hollow Knight</em> sequel has generally followed this arc, forking along to parallel tracks over the weekend. First: “Yay, it’s out!” Second: “Check out cool thing X.” Third: “Boss fight Y was incredible” or “Help, I can’t stop dying.” And finally: “This game is too hard and it’s the best” or “This game is too hard and it sucks.” We’re at the point where an initial backlash to how much more punishing <em>Silksong</em> is has been followed by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1nbbr79/yes_team_cherry_isnt_above_criticism_but_that/">a backlash to the backlash</a>. Much of it essentially boils down to: okay, maybe <em>Silksong</em> is much harder but that doesn’t make it worse than <em>Hollow Knight</em>.</p> <p>My guess is that there are two things going on here. The first is that <em>Silksong</em> is reaching a much wider audience at launch than <em>Hollow Knight</em> ever did, and I would guess many of those players are coming to it from non-Souls-inspired backgrounds. They are here for the neat story, excellent art, and top-notch Metroidvania exploration, not necessarily the “git gud” grind that comes with hitting what seems like an insurmountable challenge you that you persevere through, knowing eventually, whether hours later or days later, you will overcome it.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000624072" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624072"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624072">Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p>The second is that so much is riding on <em>Silksong,</em> following years of hype and secrecy, that everyone is extra touchy about the possibility it could be <em>worse</em> than <em>Hollow Knight</em>. We’ve all been there. You go to see a movie you were really excited for. It washes over you in haze. There were parts you loved. You talk about them outside the theater with friends. Than days go by, weeks, years even, and you eventually admit it wasn’t as good as you hoped. Disappointment sucks! Do I think most people are actually disappointed with<em> Silksong</em>? Not at all. But I think any naysaying this early on in the “honeymoon period” of a new indie darling’s release can feel like an attack.</p> <p>TL;DR: the internet is currently designed to make negativity go viral, which elicits defensive hyperbole in response.</p>

 <p>What’s clear is that there’s a not-insignificant number of people already feeling burnt out on<em> Silksong</em> or bouncing off of it entirely because of its less forgiving design. “I beat <em>Hollow Knight</em> twice through (Radiance), I love the game and its world and its vibes and everything you mentioned, and I’m currently falling out of love with a sequel I desperately WANT to enjoy, due to a difficulty curve that feels completely out of sync with<em> Hollow Knight</em>’s,” wrote one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1nbbr79/yes_team_cherry_isnt_above_criticism_but_that/">on the subreddit</a>. “I’m handling the difficulty fine, but it’s just exhausting,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1nbdetn/comment/nd1gtpu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">wrote another</a>. “I think <em>Silksong</em> is beautiful and a masterpiece, but the two mask damage is tiring. Most people WILL have a skill issue, even if they’re managing, so rather than the game be fully enjoyable like <em>Hollow Knight</em>, it will create exhaustion which is not fun.”</p> <p><em>Silksong</em> doesn’t have difficulty options or any other way to mitigate its challenge outside of in-game remedies like finding certain upgrades and Crests as early as possible. We’ll see if that ultimately holds it back from the same level of fawning adoration that its predecessor achieved, or if Team Cherry decides to address the skill gap in a post-launch update. Purists will be able to say they were there on day-one with their double-damage victories intact to prove it, but at least that way everyone else can discover the rest of the special game Team Cherry spent seven years making.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-just-made-its-magsafe-compatible-charger-stand-practically-free-ahead-of-iphone-17-launch-2000623532</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Minimalist nightstand fans are going to love this limited-time Amazon deal. The<strong> Anker MagSafe Compatible MagGo Charger Stand</strong> takes your alarm clock and the charging cables for your iPhone and AirPods and combines them into one small, sleek, powerful fast charger, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3960/">it’s a steal at just $34</a>.</p>
<p>So many of these megadeals are marked down so dramatically because they’re somehow outdated or incompatible with the latest tech release, but this Anker&nbsp; MagGo 15W charger is Qi2 certified and able to fast-charge the latest Apple devices, including the iPhone 16 series, AirPods 4, and AirPods Pro 2. Chances are it’ll remain current when Apple’s next line of smartphones and AirPods drop too, because Apple looks to be locked into MagSafe and Qi2 charging for its devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3960/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ditch That Clock</h2>
<p>The iPhone is a brilliant alarm clock, but when it’s lying flat on your nightstand and hardwired to a charging block, it can lead to fumbling to find the phone as you come out of a dead sleep, and also hard to see the time. When you attach your iPhone to the Anker MagGo charging stand, you can turn it into horizontal position and place it in StandBy mode, giving you the clock display and customizable widgets and photos.</p>
<p>That’s a huge upgrade from the old digital clock, and you can also tilt the iPhone up to 45 degrees backward so you have the ideal viewing angle. Since it’s a MagSafe charger, there’s no wire to get in the way or come loose as you move the phone to exactly where you want it.</p>



<h2>Supercharger</h2>
<p>While it’s taking over for your alarm clock, the Anker MagGo is also bringing fast charging to your iPhone and your AirPods, so they’re both fully loaded when you wake up. The two built-in LED lights let you see that each device is charging, and charging quickly: An iPhone 15 Pro will go from dead to 25% charged in just 21 minutes on the Anker MagGo, nearly half the time a 7.5W charger takes.</p>
<p>The Anker MagGo dual charger comes in white or black to fit your decor, and it’s also a perfect fit for a desktop or work station. It comes with a 5-foot USB-C cable and Anker’s two-year warranty.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3960/"> Best of all, it’s 37% off right now at Amazon, just a little over $34 for this reliable and elegant-looking charging and spatial arrangement solution</a>. It’s a limited-time deal, though, so don’t hesitate and end up stuck with that old alarm clock.</p>

              <p>Another dang Monday!? Didn’t we do this already? Fine, whatever, let’s go again. Welcome to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news and other stuff you might care about. Today, we have news about the next <em>Wolfenstein</em> game, information on how Nintendo develops new ideas, a trailer for the next <em>Knives Out</em> film, and bad news for people planning to play <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> on Switch.</p> <h2><strong>Your city’s size in <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> depends on what platform you play on</strong></h2> <p>In December, Square Enix’s<em> Octopath Traveler 0</em> will launch and, in addition to questing through dungeons and slaying monsters, players will be building a new town in this upcoming RPG. But how big your in-game town can be will not be dependent on your skill or determination. As recently revealed by Square Enix and <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1963999156030296316">spotted by Wario64</a>, the maximum size of your city will depend on what platform you play <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> on, with weaker consoles being more limited than PC and newer machines.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Octopath Traveler 0 platform specs <a href="https://t.co/2jhpK7osy6">pic.twitter.com/2jhpK7osy6</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1963999156030296316?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The OG Switch has a 250 building limit. Meanwhile, the Switch 2 and PS4 max out at 400 buildings. Finally, if you want 500 buildings (and who doesn’t?), you’ll need to play the RPG on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, or PC.&nbsp; As you might expect, where you play decides your max FPS and resolution, too, which are also included in the chart above. Lots to think about for <em>Octopath</em> fans ahead of the game’s December 4 release date.</p>

 <h2><strong>MachineGames hopes to make a third <em>Wolfenstein</em> game</strong></h2> <p>While <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> was a fantastic video game and one of the best Indy adventures yet, it wasn’t what I wanted from developer MachineGames. What I wanted was a new <em>Wolfenstein</em> game. It felt like there was at least one more story to be told with the studio’s version of BJ, and it turns out that’s in fact the case.</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/E189QG28rnE?t=2440">In <em>NoClip’s</em> newly released documentary</a> about the history of MachineGames and the making of its <em>Wolfenstein</em> series, co-founder and studio head Jerk Gustafsson confirmed that the plan from day one was always to make a trilogy. And that’s still the plan, assuming the studio gets a chance to make one more <em>Wolfenstein</em> game.</p>

 <p>“I think this is important to say, because we have always seen this as a trilogy. So that journey for BJ – even during those first weeks at id, when we mapped out <em>New Order</em> – we still had a plan for at least that character. What will happen in the second one. What will happen in the third one. I think that’s important to say because, at least I hope, that we’re not done with <em>Wolfenstein</em> yet. We have a story to tell.”</p> <h2><strong>Nintendo doesn’t need new franchises</strong></h2> <p>Former Nintendo developer and programmer Ken Watanabe <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-09-05/nintendo-invents-new-ways-to-have-fun-with-old-characters">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a> that the company doesn’t really have a need to create new franchises, as it can simply incorporate new mechanics and ideas into one of its existing and already established IP.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“New franchises haven’t come out simply because there’s no real need to make them,” Watanabe told the outlet. “When Nintendo wants to do something new, it’s basically about the gameplay mechanics first — about creating a new way to play. As for the skin or the wrapper, they don’t really fuss over it. They just pick whatever fits that new gameplay best.”</p> <h2><em>Schedule 1</em> will add shrooms, which apparently weren’t in the game before</h2> <p><em>Schedule 1,</em> the super-popular drug-dealing simulator on Steam, recently asked players what they wanted added to the game next, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/">the fanbase voted for shrooms</a>. Which is fine, but also weird to me. It’s not weird that people playing a game about drugs want more drug variety, but, weirdly, shrooms weren’t in <em>Schedule 1</em> to begin with. Anyway, shrooms will be added around November as a free update. Meanwhile, fishing fans, you lost out, and that feature won’t be added to the game in the near future.
