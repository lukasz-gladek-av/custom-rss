            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft’s gaming business is seemingly in for another round of mass layoffs.

Managers are apparently expecting “substantial cuts” across Xbox, though it’s not yet clear which teams or studios might be hit hardest.

While Microsoft claimed that no games were canceled in that most recent round of layoffs, developers at studios like <em>State of Decay 3</em> maker Undead Labs were impacted.</p><p>The ongoing cuts come at the tail end of an acquisition spree that culminated in buying <em>Call of Duty</em> and <em>Candy Crush</em> maker Activision Blizzard for $70 billion. The Xbox portfolio now constitutes the biggest gaming content publisher in the world, but at the cost of greater scrutiny and revenue expectations. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer, who usually prefers to talk about his favorite new games, has deflected blowback for the cuts over the last year by reiterating his responsibility to keep Xbox profitable. </p><p>  “Our jobs inside the company is to run a good business,” Spencer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw26FdfkUDM&amp;list=PL0il2l-B_WwapNQtqa4Fr75ozqe3vHIQi&amp;index=3&amp;t=144s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw26FdfkUDM&amp;list=PL0il2l-B_WwapNQtqa4Fr75ozqe3vHIQi&amp;index=3&amp;t=144s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said at Summer Game Fest earlier this month</a></span> right after Xbox’s big summer showcase. “We’re accountable to Microsoft for running a good business, a healthy business that continues to grow at both top line and bottom line. That’s kind of a foundation for us. And what that does is it allows us to continue to invest in Xbox for our community of players and creators and that we’re doing it. It does mean we have to make trade offs through the year on things that we’re going to invest more in, things that we’re not going to invest as much in because it is kind of we are the business that we are.”</p><p>The result has been not only bringing major first-party games like <em>Sea of Thieves</em> and <em>Gears of War</em> to PS5, but also raising prices. <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> will be the company’s first $80 game this fall, and the price of the Xbox Series X/S recently spiked due to new tariffs amid Trump’s ongoing trade war with China. It feels like only a matter of time before Game Pass Ultimate, currently $20 a month, also goes up in price again.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/xbox-prices-layoffs-next-gen-hardware-ps5-1851784992]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p> The limited edition Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition (yes, that’s what it’s called) looks neat. I’ll give it that. The all-black model with the green inlays cuts a nice contrast with the normally white-only VR headsets. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ps5-exclusives-streaming-1851722886?_gl=1*d4ebzk*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA3MTAwMzQkbzE0NiRnMCR0MTc1MDcxMDAzNiRqNTgkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ps5-exclusives-streaming-1851722886?_gl=1*d4ebzk*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA3MTAwMzQkbzE0NiRnMCR0MTc1MDcxMDAzNiRqNTgkbDAkaDA.">Everything else about it confuses me</a></span>, including why it exists. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,197533,197567" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I guess the simple answer is that Microsoft’s “everything is an Xbox” marketing slogan that arrived last fall wasn’t just a threat, it was a promise. A promise that the company will begin slapping the Xbox logo on anything that is capable of streaming Game Pass. Smart TVs are now Xboxes. PC gaming handhelds are, too. Why not bundle a limited-edition Xbox controller with a Meta Quest 3S and call it an Xbox too?</p><p>The entry-level Meta Quest 3S 128GB is currently $300. The Xbox version will be $400 but comes with a limited-edition Xbox controller in addition to the standard Touch Plus controllers and three months of Game Pass Ultimate. This is, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/24/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/24/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in Microsoft’s words</a></span>, “everything you need to start gaming on a massive virtual display the moment you open the box.”</p><p>That’s primarily because the Meta Quest 3S can stream a selection of Game Pass games that support cloud gaming like <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em>. The pitch from Microsoft is: “start a game on your Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition, pick up where you left off on your console, and continue the adventure with Xbox on PC without ever losing your achievements or saved data.” That’s a cool idea in theory, but the caveat is that it’s  limited to streaming and games that already support Play Anywhere.</p><p>This is the same Achilles’ heel that impacts the upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000">Xbox Ally ROG PC gaming handheld</a></span>. It’s a custom Windows experience designed to feel like playing on an Xbox, but it can’t play existing Xbox-only releases. Lots of big games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Elden Ring</em>, and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>don’t support Play Anywhere, meaning you still need to purchase the game twice. I’d love it if that weren’t the case, but for now it is. Until those gaps are filled in, it’s hard to see more Xbox-branded devices as anything other than niche collectors’ items for enthusiasts. </p><p>Meta has never released sales numbers for the Quest 3, but estimates a year ago were that it had sold at least 1 million units. Microsoft probably isn’t lying when it stresses how “limited” the Xbox Edition Quest 3S is, but it raises the question of why the partnership exists if it’s going to stop short of making the headset double as an official accessory for existing Xbox consoles that can stream native games remotely as a second display. </p><p>Maybe because VR is an even tougher sell than PC gaming handhelds. PlayStation VR 2 is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mixed-news.com/en/psvr-2-sales-figures-estimation-toast-interactive/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mixed-news.com/en/psvr-2-sales-figures-estimation-toast-interactive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rumored</a></span> to have sold only about half as many units as Steam Deck. That might be why Meta is ending <em>Beat Saber</em> support for the Sony peripheral. Coincidentally, the reduced price of Sony’s headset makes it cost the same as the Xbox Quest 3S. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/meta-quest-3s-xbox-vr-game-pass-price-handheld-1851784984]]></content:encoded>
