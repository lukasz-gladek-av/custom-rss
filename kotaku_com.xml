She’s done some good work in the past but with this plot, with this storyline—I feel like she just didn’t fit the role,” Ryan Mabry said.</p><p>He went on to say that he felt Rae was mostly playing herself in the role and it was hard to see her as the actual character she was performing as. </p><p>In the comments section, folks agreed with his sentiments.</p><p>“I feel like she always plays Issa Rae,” wrote one user.</p><p>“I love her, she’s stunning but lacks depth and range as an actor. She always playing herself but because she’s popular we accept it,” said another user.</p><p>Added another, “This episode made me realize Issa just isn’t that good of an actress which is so hard for me to admit.”</p><p>Another user <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@dreuxsuave/video/7493245947598736670?lang=en&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@dreuxsuave/video/7493245947598736670?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dreaux’s Reviews on TikTok</a></span> also made a similar video saying that she while she supports all of Rae’s business endeavors—she has to be honest and say that she can’t act.</p><p>“‘Awkward Black Girl,’ cool. ‘Insecure,’ cool. Anything beyond that? Get behind the camera,” she said. “Her abilities do not succeed what was needed beyond those two series.”</p><p>In the comments section, people shared her viewpoint.</p><p>“I didn’t wanna admit it either but she’s not a good actress maybe a good writer but actress no,” wrote one user.</p><p>“Love Issa down but she needs to work on her range. She can’t play herself in every role,” said another.</p><p>Added one other user, “I thought I was tripping! I love her in Insecure but this role was not for her.”</p><p><em>This story originally appeared on The Root, our sister site, on Tuesday, April 15.</em></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
