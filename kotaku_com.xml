              <p>And…there we go! It’s officially Friday, folks. I’m filling in for Ethan, who <em>should</em> have written today’s edition, so if you prefer his take on Morning Checkpoint, well, sorry, you have to deal with me. This morning, we learn about Double Fine’s future, get ready to watch a weird <em>Fortnite</em> stream, check out what’s up with <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s campaign, and catalog the first game to run away from <em>Silksong</em>‘s September launch. Oh and here’s a trailer for a movie that looks like <a href="https://youtu.be/9oJEUcpPeBw"><em>Jaws</em>, but set during the Second World War. Enjoy</a>?</p> <h2>Aeterna Lucis is delaying its launch to avoid <em>Silksong</em></h2> <p>Yesterday, after many years of waiting, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-september-release-date-trailer-2000619152">we finally got a release date for <em>Silksong.</em></a> It’s arriving next month, and one game is already throwing in the towel and delaying its launch to avoid the indie superstar sequel. On Friday, the devs behind <em>Aeterna Lucis</em> announced that the game was being pushed back from a planned September launch to sometime in 2026, partly because of <em>Silksong</em> and partly because they lack all the dev kits needed for a release on “next-gen” platforms.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/CUomiRcsZU">pic.twitter.com/CUomiRcsZU</a></p> <p>— Aeternum Game Studios (@aeternathegame) <a href="https://twitter.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Our initial plan was to launch<em> [Aeterna Lucis]</em> this September,” said the devs in a statement. “But after the announcement of <em>Silksong</em>, we are fully aware that our game wouldn’t have the visibility it deserves. Competing with a phenomenon of that scale would not only be unfair to our team’s effort, but also to you, the community, who expect to experience this adventure under the best possible conditions.”</p>

 <h2>Double Fine isn’t working on <em>Brutal Legend 2</em> or any other sequels</h2> <p><em>Keeper</em>, Double Fine’s next game, looks great! It comes after a big gap following the company’s last game, <em>Psychonauts 2</em>. If you’re worried that, after&nbsp;<em>Keeper</em>‘s release, you’ll be waiting a while again for more Double Fine goodness, take heart: the studio’s founder and boss, Tim Schafer, says that Double Fine is working on multiple projects at the moment. But, if you were hoping for a <em>Brutal Legend 2</em> or <em>Psychonauts 3</em>, well, I’m sorry to say that ain’t happening anytime soon.</p> <p>“I’m working on other stuff,” <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/double-fines-tim-schafer-rules-out-more-sequels-for-now-so-you-can-forget-about-brtal-legend-2-and-psychonauts-3">Schafer told <em>IGN</em></a>. “The studio is doing multiple projects right now and they’re all original IPs, because we did <em>Psychonauts 2</em> and that will hold us for sequels for a while.”</p> <h2>The alleged mother of one of Elon Musk’s kids will be on a <em>Fortnite</em> stream</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">💥 Fortnite Friday is BACK 💥</p> <p>🚨 Alleged Mother of Elon Musk's Child… Ashley St. Clair (<a href="https://twitter.com/stclairashley?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@stclairashley</a>) gives her FIRST live interview since news broke… straight from the Battle Bus 🚨</p> <p>🇺🇸 5PM PST / 8PM EST 🇺🇸 <a href="https://t.co/WFBXsFMblL">pic.twitter.com/WFBXsFMblL</a></p> <p>— connor (@ConnorEatsPants) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConnorEatsPants/status/1958612410774040833?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>I don’t have much to add to this other than that we live in a very strange world.</p> <h2><em>Call of Duty Black Ops 7</em> is ditching campaign difficulty levels</h2> <p>The latest <em>Call of Duty</em> is making some big changes to the series’ handling of campaigns. <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s will support co-op, and there will be a rogue-like endgame included with it. Another big change? <em>Black Ops 7</em> won’t feature the franchise’s usual difficulty levels, like Veteran or Hardened. Instead, as developers, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-does-not-have-difficulty-options-treyarch-explains-why">Treyarch explained to <em>IGN</em>,</a> the studio is using co-op to balance the game. The more players you include in the action, the harder things get. It’s an interesting change, though I wonder how more casual players hopping in to play with a friend might handle getting their ass kicked over and over again and having no way to make things easier.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-pete-parsons-halo-destiny-2-sony-2000619244">After 23 years, Bungie boss Pete Parsons is leaving</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown-ftl-2000619136">This new<em> Star Trek Voyager</em> game seems cool</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/critical-role-campaign-4-cast-brennan-lee-mulligan-date-2000619230">Critical Role’s big shake-up, explained</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="How Star Wars Control Panels Were Made for Filming!" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UykDcJEojc4?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

              <p><span>After almost 30 years of monster catching and battling, there are dozens of unsolved mysteries in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-balls-monster-catchin-musical-professor-oak-2000617768"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a> <span>universe. One that has literally haunted fans for over a decade now is the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nobody-knows-what-the-deal-is-with-the-ghost-girl-in-po-1458254184"><span>“Ghost Girl”</span></a><span> who appears in the 3DS games </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>. This mysterious Hex Maniac character shows up in Lumiose City, says some ominous stuff to the player, and slides off-screen without an actual walking animation. This odd occurrence has never been explained, and when </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/almost-a-year-later-pokemon-x-ys-ghost-girl-is-still-1646738916"><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>asked</span></a> <i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y </span></i><span>producer Junichi Masuda about it back in 2014, he was playfully evasive. Well, thanks to the spooky-ass </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-victreebel-evolution-trailer-2000619134"><span>Mega Victreebel trailer</span></a><span> Game Freak put out, fans now suspect that this ghost girl may reappear in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-world-championship-closing-ceremony-recap-z-a-2000618195"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Case of the Sweet Scent Incident | Pokémon Legends: Z-A" width="500" height="375" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NyfDz36JkkU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>The found footage-style video shows two curious Pokémon trainers exploring a seemingly abandoned house, only to find it crawling with creepy Pokémon and being used as a training area for a Mega Victreebel. It’s not just Pokémon hiding out here, however. At about the one-minute mark, you can see what looks like a girl dressed in a dark purple outfit hiding outside a window.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>This looks pretty similar to what appears to be the new Hex Maniac design in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A, </span></i><span>seen in the game’s </span><a href="https://x.com/SerebiiNet/status/1895120741802352840"><span>official art</span></a><span>, leading fans to theorize that this could be a nod to the ghost girl from </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>, or maybe even a hint that we might finally learn more about this enigmatic trainer after a decade of theorycrafting. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>takes place entirely in Lumiose City, where the ghost girl appeared in the 3DS games. So, if Game Freak wanted to finally provide some answers to fans’ long-running questions, this would be the game to do it.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000619525" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619525"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619525">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>All that said, this could just be nothing more than an easter egg for fans to spot in the trailer, and it could go nowhere. After all this time, do you really need to have all the questions answered for you? Can’t you just enjoy the terrifying whimsy of knowing this world is sometimes vast and unknowable? No? Well, we’ll find out for sure when </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>comes to the Switch consoles on October 16.</span></p>

              <p>Ubisoft’s long-promised animated series&nbsp;<em>Splinter Cell: Deathwatch</em> has finally been given a longer trailer and a release date. Due October 14, the Liev Schreiber-fronted anime also stars comedian Janet Varney as Anna “Grim” Grímsdóttir, and has been in the works for about four-hundred-thousand years.</p> <p>OK, five years, but it really has dragged on. In the meantime we learned an entire <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-splinter-cell-movie-tom-hardy-1851700151"><em>Splinter Cell</em> movie starring Tom Hardy was canned</a>, while there’s been no word on other announced Ubisoft TV and movie projects like <em>Watch_Dogs</em>,&nbsp;<em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Division</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ghost Recon</em>, <em>Riders Republic</em>, a <em>Rabbids</em> feature, and even a <em>Just Dance&nbsp;</em>movie. So honestly, the fact that anything at all is coming to screens feels fairly miraculous.</p> <p>The trailer, however, is…not what I was expecting. In 2024, Michael Ironside—who voiced title character Sam Fisher in the games—<a href="https://screenrant.com/splinter-cell-anime-cast-update-liev-schreiber-sam-fisher/">said that he was “too old” to play the part</a> at 75, with the role handed over to 57-year-old Liev Schreiber for the anime. So it’s something of a surprise to see Sam appearing in the trailer looking like a 75-year-old man.</p>

 <p>There’s still no clear idea what the show will actually be&nbsp;<em>about</em>, beyond it being personal to Fisher, following the death of someone called Douglas Shetland. What we do see is a lot of guns being fired, and Sam mistaking a fair few people for knife racks. Oh, and while it’s weirdly tossed away in the middle of the short teaser, at least the three-light googles appear at one point. I mean, I’m not in charge of Netflix marketing, but given most of the trailer looks like Sam Fisher: The Retirement Home Years, I’d perhaps have ended on the iconic headwear and maybe&nbsp;<em>something</em> that suggested some sort of intrigue.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Splinter Cell: Deathwatch | Official Teaser | Netflix" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LAM63Dj3XBQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The better news is the team behind the show. The creator is Derek Kolstad, responsible for Bob Odenkirk’s reinvention as an action hero in&nbsp;<em>Nobody</em>, and the writer of the first three&nbsp;<em>John Wick</em> movies. That’s some caliber, although I struggle not to imagine the scripts for <em>John Wick</em> are mostly “John punches a man, and then another man and then he shoots three guys, and then he gets shot in the leg but shakes it off and punches four other guys and throws knives at a guy.” Along with Kolstad is a writing team that features scribes from <em>Shooter</em>, and some fresh faces too.</p> <p>It’s an oddly witless and plotless teaser, although given Kolstad is head writer, it seems implausible the show itself could fall that way. Right? Please? As for Fisher’s age, perhaps the show is canon to the games, given the last one—<em>Splinter Cell: Blacklist</em>—came out an extraordinary 12 years ago. Maybe it’s to make the people who remember playing the games feel seen.</p>
