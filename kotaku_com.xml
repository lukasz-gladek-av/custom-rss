            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You don’t need to spend $1,100 on the latest <em>Fenix 8</em> to get a serious running watch that tracks everything you need. The sweet spot in Garmin’s lineup has always been the <em>Forerunner</em> series, and for good reason: these watches outsell everything else in the brand’s catalog. The Forerunner 265 is the most premium and popular model in the range and packs a brilliant AMOLED display and advanced training metrics that rival watches costing twice as much. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5552/">just quietly marked it down to $299, slashed from its usual $449 price tag</a>. That’s an <strong>all-time low</strong> for a watch that delivers fantastic running features without the extreme price of Garmin’s flagship models.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5552/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Runners Keep Picking This Watch</h2>
<p>The difference is apparent from the very first moments you fire up the Forerunner 265: that <strong>brilliant AMOLED touchscreen pops with color and sharp text</strong>&nbsp;which remains quite readable under direct sunlight, joined by traditional button controls that work beautifully when your hands are sweaty or you’re wearing gloves. The <strong>46mm size</strong> makes the watch feather-light on your wrist so you just about forget it’s there on those ultra-long runs-or really through most of the day. Get <strong>up to 13 days of battery life in smartwatch mode</strong> and up to 20 hours in GPS mode to give you plenty of juice for training weeks.</p>
<p>Your day begins with a personalized report which provides context for how to approach each and every training day. Upon waking, you get an overview of your sleep quality, recovery status, and training outlook alongside HRV status, training readiness, and local weather. This information helps you decide if today is the day to push hard or if your body needs an easier session. The training readiness score brings together <strong>sleep quality, recovery, training load, and HRV status</strong> to tell you if you’re primed to go hard and get the most out of your workout.</p>



<p>Race preparation becomes strategic with <strong>personalized daily suggested workouts</strong>. You input your target race and course details into the Garmin Connect app, and the watch creates training plans that adapt after every run to match your current performance and recovery status. The race widget on your watch keeps your goal front and center while the workouts adapt as your body responds to training.</p>



<p>Multi-band GNSS technology with SatIQ provides accuracy in positioning that more affordable watches simply cannot attain. This matters when you’re running in areas with tall buildings, heavy tree cover, or challenging terrain where the basic GPS signals struggle. Optimizing this accuracy for battery life means you won’t be sacrificing runtime to get accurate distance and pace. You <strong>have more than 30 built-in activity profiles for running, triathlon, cycling, open-water swimming, and lots more</strong>.</p>
<p>Safety features add peace of mind during solo training sessions. <strong>Incident detection works</strong> during select outdoor activities and sends a message with your live location to emergency contacts when paired with your compatible smartphone. The <em>Assistance</em> feature lets you manually trigger an alert when you need help, something that is good to have when you are exploring new routes or training in remote areas.</p>
<p>At $299, you’re getting a watch that competes directly with models costing $600 or more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Some of the biggest games of the year are getting new difficulty options. Some of the biggest companies would kindly like their workers to quietly leave. Welcome to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily round-up of gaming news and culture. <a href="https://beta.ideas.lego.com/product-ideas/0046a36e-c287-4ddf-9ff2-dc1b553dfde1">This Lego arcade</a> is one of my favorite new proposed fan sets. It would go perfectly in that giant Lego city I have no time or money for building in my attic.</p> <h2>Krafton will let developers voluntarily resign as it doubles down on AI</h2> <p>The <em>PUBG</em> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101"><em>Subnautica 2</em> publisher</a> will allow employees based in South Korea to be part of a new voluntary resignation program that gives anywhere from six months to three years of severance,<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=256319#google_vignette"><em>Business Korea</em> reports</a>. Krafton says the plan isn’t aimed at sneaking through “soft” layoffs, but is “to support members in proactively designing their growth direction and embarking on new challenges both inside and outside the company amid the era of AI transformation,” according to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/krafton-launches-voluntary-resignation-program-for-employees-as-it-transforms-into-an-ai-first-company/">a translation by <em>Automaton</em></a>.</p>

 <p>The news comes after <a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-krafton-ai-pubg-bloodlines-2-motion-blur-2000638553">Krafton committed $70 million</a> in investment for GPU clusters to drive its agentic AI transformation and as fellow South Korea publisher <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gen-ai-nexon-eurogamer-voices-2000643436">Nexon suggested</a> adopting generative AI technology is a matter of survival.</p> <h2>220 <em>GTA 6</em> devs signed a letter blasting the firing of 31 colleagues</h2> <p>The IGWB trade union group in the UK announced on Thursday that the letter was delivered to Rockstar management. It accused the company of union busting and demanded the reinstatement of the previously fired developers. French union STJV is planning a protest in front of Take-Two France on Friday.</p>

 <p>“It’s heartwarming to see so many of our colleagues supporting us and holding management to account—during a period where Rockstar want us to feel scared, my brave former colleagues are marching straight up to our boss’s door and demanding our voices are heard and not backing down,” one of the fired employees said in a statement. “It’s clear to everyone close to this situation that this is a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting. Rockstar employs so many talented game developers, all of whom are crucial to making the games we put out.”</p>

 <h2>Could <em>GTA 6</em>‘s delay also delay the launch of the PS6?</h2> <p>That’s the thought experiment one recently analyst proposed. “We are currently forecasting a next-gen PlayStation and Xbox to arrive in late 2027–but might the console companies be tempted to get more from the current console generation by riding the <em>GTA 6</em> wave and waiting until 2028?” Ampere Analysis research director Piers Harding-Rolls <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-games-industry-reacts-to-the-delay-of-gta-6">posed the idea to <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>. “The fact that games are now cross-gen makes this less of a factor, perhaps, but such is the size of the <em>GTA</em> franchise, the launch timing will get all areas of the games business thinking about their product strategies.”</p>

 <p>The idea here is that GTA 6 will lead to a spike in new console sales that will dramatically increase the current-gen install base. If that peak doesn’t come until early 2027, console makers might have an incentive to wait a bit before pushing out their next hardware release. But as Harding-Rolls also points out, backwards compatibility makes that less of an issue these days.</p>

 <h2><em>Silent Hill f</em> just got a new easy mode</h2> <p><a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/f/gate?p=q9avy6C9QUKFRFGSGPvBvfio1VMukY6Si2kFcyPbJy1IDNigoCWC1RGMUocaVwR2">Patch 1.10 added</a> a “casual” difficulty for players who are tired of messing around with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505">Souls-y action combat</a> and just want to experience the world and story.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is the latest monster-taming RPG in the series to forgo voice acting. As these games have become more cinematic, it’s become pretty jarring that these characters don’t have voices when they speak. </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span> has fully animated scenes in which characters’ mouths flap as they speak, but no sound actually comes out. As such, fans have been making their own voice dubs of the series for years, and there are </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H2iFaaUZo9M"><span>some pretty good ones out there</span></a><span>. There’s also a deeply unserious one by </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/review-final-fantasy-16-ffxvi-ps5-rpg-release-date-1850558485">Final Fantasy XVI</a> </span></i><span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402?_gl=1*9icn1w*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDcyMzIxNjAkbzU4JGcxJHQxNzQ3MjQ1MDg0JGo2MCRsMCRoMCRkTGhKQ1VESkJYd2lqTzFUMTlocEx1a0ptWERkbVBiM21jZw.."><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a><span> actor Ben Starr playing Naveen from </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> completely straight with his usual broody delivery.</span></p> <p><span>In a recent episode of the Kit &amp; Krysta Podcast, Starr “auditioned” for the role, with co-hosts Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang acting alongside him as the protagonist and Taunie. Starr, hilariously, makes no attempt to capture Naveen’s youth and pretty much whips out his gravely Clive voice from </span><i><span>Final Fantasy XVI</span></i><span>. If you’ve ever wanted to hear Starr be a broody simp for a Pokémon streamer, here’s your chance.</span></p>   <p><span>It’s a funny bit and I have to applaud the artistic choices made with a mostly straight face here, but it does underline that a lot of the character of these games can be dialed up and enhanced with a good voice actor in the booth. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> definitely shows that Game Freak has the writing chops to execute </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-credits-npc-dialogue-school-kid-2000638839"><span>some really funny, memorable scenes and jokes</span></a><span> despite not including voice acting, but every time I hear a fan try to embody these characters, I just wish the games had that same spark we get in projects like the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389"><i><span>Pokémon </span></i></a><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389">anime</a> or the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/detective-pikachu-returns-pokemon-review-switch-1850915720"><i><span>Detective Pikachu </span></i></a><span>games. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>takes a baby step toward this future by giving your main character Link-like grunts and yells when they do some actions, but they’re one person in a city full of heroes and villains that I’d love to hear speak instead of just reading. Don’t get me started on that weird scene in </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield </span></i><span>where a whole concert was happening just for a character to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC9vQmmvvfI"><span>pantomime the performance instead of singing</span></a><span>. Though that’s also </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thecamsteady/video/7536409709599870222"><span>allowed fans to interpret that character’s musical chops</span></a><span>, as well.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

Right now, that savings of $14 brings the price you pay down to just $22.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5555/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Travel-Friendly Charging</h2>
<p>This portable charger from INIU is the perfect travel buddy. It’s small in stature, able to fit in your pocket alongside your phone easily.

Or just keep it on your keys so you always have it with you. Perfect for charging during trips or long commutes. It’s also TSA compliant so you’ll have no trouble taking it with you through the airports while traveling.</p>
<p>You’ve got lots on things you carry on you that need to be recharged every now and again.

It’s also got an additional USB-C port in case you need to charge two phones at once.</p>



<p>Despite it’s compact form , this portable charger can pack a lot of backup power. With 5,000mAH on hand, the power bank can provide an Apple Watch with six full charges or an iPhone 16 with up to 91% from zero, giving you that reliable boost of power when you really need it.</p>
<p>It’s fast too. With Power Delivery support and 20W output, you can bring an iPhone 17 Pro up to 56% in just 25 minutes time. When it’s time to charge the portable power bank itself, it can do that fairly quickly as well. It can reach full charge from 20% in just two hours time.</p>
<p>The digital display on the front is there to let you know exactly how much power the charger has left in it. This can help prevent you rushing out the door with it, expecting it to be at full charge but then you realize you had forgotten to plug it in. You get a simple three digits indicating what percent battery the charger has left.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lgs-32-inch-4k-monitor-priced-like-a-no-name-monitor-black-friday-got-here-early-2000644001</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lg%E2%80%99s-32-inch-4k-monitor-priced-like-a-no-name-monitor-black-friday-got-here-early.1352683/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Buying a quality monitor usually means choosing between paying premium prices for trusted brands or gambling on unknown manufacturers that might deliver terrible color accuracy and dead pixels. LG stands as one of the most prestigious names in display technology and finding their products at bargain prices rarely happens outside of major sales events.</p>
<p>Amazon just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5563/">launched an early Black Friday deal that brings the LG 32UR500K-B down to $199, slashed from its usual $299</a>. This record-low pricing puts a<strong> 32-inch 4K UHD monitor</strong> from a reputable manufacturer at the same cost as generic no-name displays that flood the market with questionable quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5563/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Display Quality That Justifies the LG Name</h2>
<p>The <strong>32-inch 4K UHD display lets you experience 3840 by 2160 resolution</strong> that reproduces sharp text and detailed images across the whole screen. This kind of pixel density means you can see fine details in photos, read small text without zooming and enjoy crisp lines in spreadsheets or design work. The panel expresses up to <strong>90% of the DCI-P3 color gamut</strong> – that’s the cinema-grade color space used in professional content creation and high-end displays. You’re seeing colors that match what directors and designers intended rather than the washed-out or oversaturated visuals that come from cheaper monitors that have poor color reproduction.</p>



<p>HDR10 support elevates compatible content by expanding the range <strong>between darkest blacks and brightest whites</strong>. HDR takes advantage of the ability to create realistic lighting and shadow details in modern games, 4K video content, and streaming services that are impossible on flat SDR content. You’ll notice the dramatic visual immersion when watching HDR movies or playing supported games.</p>



<p><strong>Built-in stereo speakers</strong> with <em>Waves MaxxAudio</em> save desk space and eliminate the need for separate speakers if you’re using a minimalist setup. The audio quality is also quite a step above the tinny sound most monitor speakers produce; it’s big and bold, making movies and games actually enjoyable without headphones. For video calls or casual consumption of content, this solution works perfectly.</p>
<p><em>OnScreen Control</em> software gives quick access to monitor settings <strong>without having to fumble around with physical buttons</strong> on the back of the display. You are able to split your screen into different zones for multitasking, tune brightness and contrast with mouse clicks, and switch between preset modes optimized for different tasks.</p>
<p>The <strong>ergonomic stand allows for tilt adjustment that lets you angle the screen to match your eye level and viewing position.</strong> Proper monitor positioning reduces neck strain during long sessions of work and prevents glare from overhead lights or windows. The borderless design maximizes screen real estate while creating a modern aesthetic that looks clean on any desk.</p>
<p>Multiple connectivity options include<strong> two HDMI ports and one DisplayPort</strong> for flexibility in hooking up gaming consoles, PCs, or laptops or media devices all at the same time. You can also easily switch inputs to avoid constantly plugging and unplugging cables, which is a plus if you use the monitor with multiple systems.</p>
<p>At $199, you’re paying what generic 32-inch 4K monitors cost while getting LG’s established reputation for reliability.</p>
