But it doesn’t come free. You’ll have to invest cash to improve your abilities. But since you have amnesia after crash-landing on a foreign island, naturally your wallet is a little light. Thanks to the locals and an abundance of treasure hidden across each island in the game, you’ll soon find yourself stacking pirate gold like a wealth-hoarding dragon in no time. But some ways are faster than others, so let’s go over the quickest ways to get that bag.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196578" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Total Recall: Why Yakuza Is So Much More Than A Japanese GTA" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="387" data-playlist="196578,195719,196394" data-current="196578"><div><p>Total Recall: Why Yakuza Is So Much More Than A Japanese GTA</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22135.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h952126"><a id=""></a>Bounties: the most lucrative way to make money</h2><figure id="" data-id="8cd4552ca41f2c3e8d220a19a423e36b" data-recommend-id="image://8cd4552ca41f2c3e8d220a19a423e36b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Goro Mijima opens a treasure chest in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Goro Mijima opens a treasure chest in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8cd4552ca41f2c3e8d220a19a423e36b" data-recommend-id="image://8cd4552ca41f2c3e8d220a19a423e36b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Goro Mijima opens a treasure chest in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While the tactics and techniques discussed below will net you some pocket change for buying items and, after some time, upgrades, you’ll need to pull in big money for ship customization and late-game upgrades to your health, damage, and abilities.

If you slay a bounty, especially a Pirate Bounty, their ship often contains a chest with tens of thousands of dollars in rewards and loot.

You’ll acquire junk by exploring Rich Island, as well as all subsequent islands in the archipelago, and by defeating enemies you encounter in the world.</p><p>After unlocking access to the Goromaru, you’ll also receive a treasure map shortly once you hit the high seas and can travel to various islands. These islands, represented by a treasure chest on the map, offer on-the-ground combat against various criminals and unknown pirates, usually a boss and mini-boss along the way, and then a treasure chest at the very end. If you make it that far, opening up said chest will often grant you a ring or other lore item, the former of which you can wear to boost your abilities, along with resources to sell and money.</p><figure id="" data-id="2271ae2d24db7f5d30dffe7ffff60087" data-recommend-id="image://2271ae2d24db7f5d30dffe7ffff60087" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The treasure chest description in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The treasure chest description in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2271ae2d24db7f5d30dffe7ffff60087" data-recommend-id="image://2271ae2d24db7f5d30dffe7ffff60087" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The treasure chest description in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Lastly, if you need a few dollars, roam landmasses to encounter random groups of enemies, most of which drop a handful of cash upon defeat.

It’s not much, but every little bit adds up to a new skill or buff.</p></div><hr><p><em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.

They’re headed to <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> on March 27, alongside new creature and trainer cards hailing from <em>Pokémon Violet</em> and <em>Scarlet</em>’s Paldea region. Tatsugiri, Sprigatito, and Iono are just a few of the new faces arriving before the end of the month.</p><p>Exactly how rare will Shiny <em>TCG Pocket</em> cards be? The Pokémon Company and developer DeNA haven’t yet revealed the actual odds of finding one in a pack. They may be similar to current crown cards like the gold Charizard ex which has a 0.04 percent chance of appearing in packs. The Shiny Charizard ex shown in the trailer for Shining Revelry has two new rainbow symbols in the rarity section of the card, however, leading me to believe it will be even harder to find. </p><p>The good news is that players will have other things to occupy themselves with besides the pain of not finding shinies when the new set drops. <em>TCG Pocket</em>’s first Ranked matches are also going live in the game on March 27. A new set of ex Starter Deck missions will be available that day as well.

The crudest way I can describe it is mashing together <em>Far Cry</em>, <em>Fortnite</em>, and <em>Rust</em>. </p></div><div><p>Based on the Kyle Starks’ comic by the same name,<em> I Hate This Place </em>is about surviving in the woods by collecting resources in the day, and navigating occult horrors at night. What helps set it apart form similar survival crafting loops is the inky art-style and ‘80s analogue horror vibes. </p></div><div><p>Don’t be fooled, <em>Elsewhere Electric</em> is not a van life adventure game. It is instead a co-op first-person exploration game where you solve puzzles in a strange facility. It supports virtual reality headsets and will show each player different things, forcing them to communicate to overcome obstacles. </p></div><div><p>This one is a bonkers mashup. <em>Shelf Heroes</em> is an FPS with roguelike elements, and card-based perk powerups, and multiplayer co-op. You have to assemble your perfect action figure to take back your home from rogue toys. <em>Risk of Rain</em> <em>2</em> meets <em>Toy Story</em>?<br></p></div><div><p>What if you could ponder the Roman Empire from the cozy comfort of a <em>Stardew Valley</em>-like? <em>Romestead</em> looks the part, but will offer less chill with up to eight players battling for dominance across limited resource maps. So maybe less slice-of-life farming sim than <em>Age of Empires </em>clash of civilizations?<br></p></div><div><p>A robot with a gun awakens on an abandoned oil tanker and searches for meaning. <em>The Last Caretaker</em> calls on players to “craft, explore, and battle rogue machines” as they try to bring humanity back from apparent extinction. There’s a choose-your-own-adventure tag on Steam though, so maybe you can decide to leave humans behind in the end. </p></div><div><p>Kickstarted over four years ago, the table-top dark fantasy tactical RPG <em>Frosthaven</em> is getting a video game adaptation. It’ll feature single-player, co-op, and online multiplayer, with a closed beta happening soon, ahead of its Early Access release. </p></div><div><p><em>Raev</em> is a kingdom builder that blends RPG elements with 4X strategy. You guide a civilization of furries on their way to environmental harmony, architectural beauty, and societal greatness. It’s coming to PC in 2026. </p></div><div><p>Old-school first-person shooter <em>Painkiller</em> is being revived by Saber Interactive. The <em>Doom</em>-inspired fast-paced gothic gorefest will offer co-op as players battle the fallen angel Azazel and his army of demons using steampunk-looking weapons. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Although they’re all viable depending on the situation, these are the perks to lean toward if you want to be the best Tank for your team.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,197298" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h1818"><a id=""></a>D.Va</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Ejection Suit</strong> is the ideal perk choice for D.Va as it gives her 75 temporary overhealth for ten seconds in Pilot form.

So if you’re concerned that <em>Severance</em>’s many mysteries might get needlessly stretched out to keep a successful thing going, you can take comfort in the fact that it sounds like the writers know where they’re headed.</p><p>“Making <em>Severance</em> has been one of the most creatively exciting experiences I’ve ever been a part of,” Stiller said in a statement to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/severance-renewed-season-3-apple-tv-1236283327/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/severance-renewed-season-3-apple-tv-1236283327/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Variety</em></a></span>. “While I have no memory of this, I’m told making Season 3 will be equally enjoyable, though any recollection of these future events will be forever and irrevocably wiped from my memory as well.”</p><p>Without getting into specifics, <em>Severance</em>’s season two finale ended on a pretty big cliffhanger, though for a few hours there I would have been pretty content if the show itself had ended with it.
