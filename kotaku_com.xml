              <p>We’re sure you’re already aware of this, but the next three months are basically one huge shopageddon. Halloween candy, costumes, and decorations lead straight into the biggest food shopping week of the year before Thanksgiving, following immediately by Black Friday and Cyber Week. Normally that would mean either a long, grueling trek of in-person shopping, or online shopping with so many tabs open your laptop cries uncle.</p>
<p>Or, you could do it all in one location, either online or in any of over 600 location nationwide, when you get a Sam’s Club membership. Getting access to the all-in-one warehouse giant should come at a premium cost just for the convenience and amazing prices, but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4484/">right now at StackSocial you can get a one-year Club membership for just $15.</a> That even less than the usual discounted price offered by StackSocial, and you’ll easily recoup that $15 just in the gas you’d burn through hitting all those shopping stops if you weren’t a Sam’s Club member.</p>

              <p>Harry Potter is one of LEGO’s most beloved franchises, and the <em>Hogwarts Castle and Grounds</em> set has earned a stellar 4.8 out of 5-star rating on Amazon with over 1,800 reviews backing it up. <strong>LEGO’s official website shows zero discounts</strong> on this flagship model and maintains the strict pricing the company is known for. But Amazon isn’t playing by those rules.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/">this 2,660-piece castle has dropped from $169 to just $135, marking an all-time low for the best-selling Harry Potter LEGO set</a>. This deal is accessible to everyone, including non-Prime members, which makes it even more appealing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4207/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Complete Miniature Replica of the Wizarding School</h2>
<p>It is the first L<strong>EGO brick model that includes the entire Hogwarts Castle and its grounds in a single build</strong>. Earlier sets focused on a solitary tower, classroom, or section, but this 2,660-piece model presents the entire campus to you in one continuous display. The construction includes the Main Tower with its signature pointed roof, the Astronomy Tower where the students study the stars, the Great Hall where banquets and ceremonies take place, as well as several courtyards and cross-bridges that lead to various sections of the castle.</p>



<p>The scale allows the LEGO designers to include recognisable details without overwhelming builders with tens of thousands of pieces. You will construct <strong>the Chamber of Secrets hidden beneath the school, the Winged Key room of Harry’s first-year nightmare, the Potions Classroom where Snape taught in the dungeons, and the large Chessboard Chamber from the Philosopher’s Stone challenges</strong>. The grounds surrounding consist of the Boathouse where students arrive by boat, the Black Lake in front, the greenhouses for Herbology class lessons and the Whomping Willow that attacks anything getting too close.</p>
<p>Other features recreate scenes from around the film series: The Durmstrang Ship comes out of the lake just as it did when Durmstrang participants arrived during the Triwizard Tournament in Goblet of Fire. The powder-blue Beauxbatons Carriage is present on the grounds, representing the arrival of the French school of magic. The crashed Ford Anglia is a part of the Forbidden Forest trees after the failed flight by Ron and Harry in Chamber of Secrets.</p>
<p>The finished model measures <strong>13.5 inches wide, 10 inches in depth, and 8.5 inches in height</strong>, large enough to be seen on a shelf or desk but not big enough to require special furniture. The build is supported on a highly detailed baseplate that is sculpted as the grounds of the castle with textured areas representing grass, pathways, and water. There is a gold mini-figure statue representing the Hogwarts architect which you can put near the nameplate “Hogwarts Castle” or in the corner of the baseplate to give it an extra visual touch.</p>
<p>For $135 for 2,660 pieces, you are <strong>paying around 5 cents per brick which is excellent value in the price system of LEGO</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/report-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-on-game-pass-cost-microsoft-300-million-in-lost-sales-2000631659</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/report-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-on-game-pass-cost-microsoft-300-million-in-lost-sales.1316497/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last year’s <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> was the first entry in the hit multiplayer military shooter to launch day-one on Game Pass in what reportedly turned out to be an expensive experiment for Microsoft. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, making the game available for free to paid subscribers on console and PC cost the tech giant $300 million in lost sales of the 2024 best-seller. That data point adds some interesting context to Microsoft’s controversial decision to hike the price of Game Pass Ultimate by 50 percent this week.</p> <p>A defining feature of Game Pass was the decision early on to release first-party games like <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> and <em>Halo Infinite</em> on the service day-and-date. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-03/xbox-s-game-pass-hike-shows-cost-of-lost-call-of-duty-sales?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1OTUyNzI0MywiZXhwIjoxNzYwMTMyMDQzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUM0lWRFNHUFFROVIwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJGRUIzODlCNUI2ODI0RTY0QjY5MENEODE1RTBDREZGRCJ9.D1EObQzg2KlvqBoXPyEm5Yn-DznTYaVWC3okI5aX3AU"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a> that this move was “controversial internally” due to the likelihood of cannibalizing sales of big games that take a lot of time and money to develop. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151814/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-strategy-changes-arkane-tango"><em>The Verge</em> reported</a> last year that a similar debate arose around the decision of whether to put <em>Call of Duty</em> on Game Pass or not.</p>

 <p>The former longtime head of Activision, Bobby Kotick, went on record during the 2023 FTC trial over Microsoft’s acquisition of the company saying that he didn’t think adding games like <em>Call of Duty</em> to subscription services made “commercial sense.” “I have a general aversion to the idea of multi-game subscription services,” he <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/activision-ceo-wouldnt-put-call-of-duty-other-titles-on-xbox-game-pass">said at the time</a>. “Maybe part of it is being in Los Angeles and having large, big media companies move their content to these subscription streaming services and the business results have suffered.”</p>

 <p>But following the acquisition, Microsoft did exactly that. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/october-2024-sales-charts-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sparks-xbox-game-pass-subscription-surge">According to Circana’s U.S. market data</a>, sales of 2024’s <em>Black Ops 6 w</em>ere 23 percent higher than <em>Modern Warfare 3</em> sales over the same period, but 82 percent of those sales were on PlayStation compared to Xbox and PC. Subscription gaming services also saw a 16-percent jump year-over-year following the release of<em> Black Ops 6</em>.</p>

 <p>If the move cost the company $300 million in lost sales, Microsoft would have needed around 15 million players to subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate for one month to make that up, or just 1.25 million over the course of an entire year. The numbers would be more dramatic for the even cheaper Game Pass PC tier where <em>Call of Duty</em> is also now available day-and-date. The price hikes this week change that math. Now, even if <em>Black Ops 7</em> saw a similar drop in sales, Microsoft would need only 10 million new sign-ups for Ultimate in November to fill the gap, or just 834,000 over the length of a year.</p>

 <p>This week’s Game Pass overhaul shows Microsoft is essentially continuing to back off its original day-one commitment. Game Pass Premium is the same price Game Pass Ultimate was a few years ago, but will only get first-party Xbox games a year after they’re out, and it’s not guaranteed to get<em> Call of Duty</em> games at all. This might not be the last major change we see to the service in the near future, either. The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-streaming-free-ad-supported-report-price-increase-2000631520">is reportedly testing a “free” ad-supported tier</a> that will be exclusively cloud gaming, and it could keep raising prices on the higher tiers if it thinks a core audience will stick around.</p> <p><em>Bloomberg</em> reports that Microsoft CFO Amy Hood has “asked Xbox to find other ways to increase profit.” Instead of growing its share of the gaming market, the company now seems content to extract more from those already paying it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/in-case-of-emergency-this-1500w-portable-power-station-is-a-lifesaver-and-it%E2%80%99s-now-selling-for-pennies.1316494/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power outages during storms, camping trips without reliable electricity, tailgating events that need a blender for frozen drinks, remote work setups in RVs, or simply keeping your essential devices running during emergency situations… These scenarios share one common frustration: <strong>being disconnected from power when you need it most</strong>.</p>
<p>A portable power station solves this problem by providing reliable electricity anywhere and gives you the freedom to charge laptops, run small appliances, or keep medical devices operational during blackouts. If you’ve found yourself in any of these situations wishing you had backup power,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/"> the Jackery Explorer 1000 is currently at a record low of $429, down from $799</a>. This <strong>46% discount</strong> makes one of the most capable portable power stations accessible for people who need reliable energy independence.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Explorer 1000 holds 1,070 watt-hours of capacity in <strong>an incredibly light 23.8-pound package</strong>. This held energy translates to usable use like powering a mini-fridge for roughly 10 hours, charging a laptop over multiple work sessions, or keeping your phone charged dozens of times through. The unit can <strong>output 1,500 continuous watts via its three pure sine wave AC receptacles</strong> and can surge a maximum of 3,000 watts momentarily as appliances come online.</p>



<h2>Charges Faster Than You’d Ever Imagine</h2>
<p>Jackery designed this power station <strong>using ChargeShield 2.0 technology</strong> which enables full recharge in one hour when you activate emergency mode via the accompanying app. That’s due to intelligent charging algorithms that push maximum current safely into the lithium iron phosphate battery cells. The standard charge time stands at 1.7 hours which strikes a balance between fast charging and maintaining long-term battery health by minimizing heat gain during charging. For perspective, most other power stations you’ll find take four to six hours for a full charge.</p>



<p>LiFePO4 battery chemistry delivers outstanding longevity over conventional lithium-ion cells. This<strong> battery retains over 70% of its capacity after 4,000 full charge cycles</strong>, or over a decade of moderate use if you’re cycling the battery every week. Lithium iron phosphate cells also handle extreme temperatures more robustly and represent less fire hazard than traditional lithium-ion batteries.</p>
<p>The port choice caters to modern charging needs with t<strong>wo USB-C ports offering 100 watts of power delivery, a USB-A port, a 12-volt automotive port, and the usual three AC ports</strong>. A 100-watt USB-C port can charge new MacBook Pros, iPads and high-end Android phones at maximum speed without requiring separate power bricks.</p>
<p>At $429, this power station is practically half its regular price but provides the capacity and functionality that makes portable power stations really useful and not novelty items.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ditch-your-ipad-amazons-new-gaming-tablet-at-40-off-is-flying-off-the-shelves-2000631749</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ditch-your-ipad-amazon%E2%80%99s-new-gaming-tablet-at-40-off-is-flying-off-the-shelves.1316476/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gaming on tablets has exploded in popularity, with more players discovering that pairing a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi controller with a portable screen creates an incredibly flexible gaming setup. The problem? A decent iPad Pro will set you back $800, and even the base iPad hovers around $400. If you’re looking for a capable tablet experience without the Apple tax, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4479/">Amazon’s Fire Max 11 represents the company’s most powerful tablet to date, and it’s currently hitting an all-time low at $139, down from $229</a> (64GB model, with lockscreen ads). This is the <strong>newest model in Amazon’s lineup</strong>, and seeing it <strong>drop 39% during Prime Big Deal Days</strong> makes it an accessible entry point for streaming and casual gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4479/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Fire Max 11 is all <strong>about its huge 11-inch screen</strong>, packing 2.4 million pixels into a 2000 x 1200 screen. That means text is readable enough to read ebooks or browse web pages, with videos and games benefitting from clear detail that does not force you to squint at blurry images. The screen is blue light low emission certified, which is something that stops eye strain when viewing for extended periods.</p>
<h2>Performance That Keeps Up With Your Entertainment</h2>
<p>Underneath the aluminum shell is an <strong>octa-core processor and 4 GB of RAM</strong> to offer a seamless experience for multitasking scenarios like keeping multiple browser tabs open while streaming background music. The eight cores divide the load evenly and never permits stuttering and lag that plagues lower-end tablets when jumping between applications. Wi-Fi 6 connectivity offers quicker data transfer rates and improved performance in busy network conditions so you can stream 1080p content on the couch even while family members are bandwidth-thirsty on their own devices.</p>



<p>The build quality of the tablet is a balance of portability and ruggedness <strong>through the aluminum frame and reinforced glass display</strong>. Amazon states it’s <strong>three times more durable than the iPad 10.9-inch in tumble tests</strong> which involve dropping the tablet repeatedly from specific heights onto hard surfaces.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life is 14 hours of continuous use,</strong> or a couple days’ worth of normal usage patterns if you’re not watching a whole season in one sitting. You get 64 GB of storage built-in at this price point, and you can expand capacity to 1 TB with a microSD card.</p>
<p>The stylus pen and keyboard case option turn the Fire Max 11 into a productivity tablet able to do email, note taking and document editing. The tablet includes a three-month trial of Microsoft 365 Personal so you can use Word, Excel, and PowerPoint with full cloud syncing across all your devices. The 8 MP front camera provides excellent video quality when using Zoom calls, so it’s perfect for remote work or keeping in touch with distant family members.</p>
<p>This is a great value for budget-minded customers who want current features without premium prices, make sure you don’t miss that Prime Day deal on Amazon.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-silently-offloads-v11-inventory-on-amazon-now-40-off-at-a-record-low-price-2000631741</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dyson-silently-offloads-v11-inventory-on-amazon-now-40-off-at-a-record-low-price.1316467/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dyson is the ultimate luxury in vacuum cleaners and it sets standards that competitors try to copy but never quite match. The brand’s combination of <strong>advanced performance and sleek design</strong> remains unrivaled in the industry. If you’ve been looking for a new-generation cordless stick vacuum without dropping $1,500 on the latest Dyson flagship model, the V11 <em>Origin</em> is a great breakthrough moment in Dyson’s evolution.</p>
<p>This was the first model to truly enter the <em>“new gen”</em> era of cordless cleaning power <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">and seeing it drop to $399 from $629 on Amazon is unprecedented</a> (nearly 40% off right now). The British company seems to be clearing inventory on earlier models, possibly to push consumers toward their premium $1,000+ options later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The <strong>Dyson V11 Origin delivers 185AW of suction, 60% more cleaning power than previous Dyson models</strong>. We’re talking about the difference between surface-level dust removal and deep extraction of embedded dirt from carpet fibers and hard floor crevices. The <strong>motor spins at up to 125,000 revolutions per minute</strong>, and it generates the kind of cyclonic force that pulls allergens, pet dander, and fine particles from every surface in your home.</p>
<h2>Three Intelligent Modes That Actually Make Sense</h2>
<p>The V11 has <strong>three different power modes</strong> that respond to real-world cleaning conditions. <em>Auto mode</em> takes advantage of sensors integrated into the vacuum to detect floor type and change suction automatically, balancing cleaning performance with battery life. <em>Eco mode</em> gets the most out of battery life for quick maintenance cleaning sessions, allowing you up to 60 minutes of steady use when you’re just doing a few quick touch-ups around the house. <em>Boost mode</em> lets out all the suction power for tough messes like ground-in cereal crumbs or tracked-in mud, but it does drain the battery faster.</p>



<p>The LCD display informs you of the mode you’re in, total amount of runtime remaining to the last second, and maintenance alerts when the filters must be cleaned or clogs form.</p>
<p>The Motorbar cleaner bar head itself is worth an accolade because it solves one of the greatest annoyances of vacuum ownership: Normal brush rolls become tangles of hairballs of mess within minutes of operation and you have to stop and snip away the mess with scissors. <strong>Dyson created this head on a spiral brush bar that actively untangles snarled hair</strong> and petting fur while you clean. The cleaner head automatically adjusts between carpets and hard floors, which makes a tight seal that doesn’t let dirt seep underneath.</p>
<p><strong>Converting the V11 into handheld mode</strong> is a matter of seconds by letting go of the wand which turns it into an all-around cleaning device for cleaning above floors. The whole-machine <strong>filtration system captures 99.99% of particles with a diameter of 0.3 microns</strong> or smaller such as most common allergens, bacteria, and mold spores.</p>
<p>This deal is unprecedented and it’s one of our favorite Prime Day deals right now.</p>

              <p>The laptop market has become impossibly crowded with dozens of brands and hundreds of models, which makes it very difficult to know where to start. If you want a safe bet backed by decades of reliability and support infrastructure, <strong>Dell remains one of the smartest choices you can make</strong>.</p>
<p>Within Dell’s lineup, there’s something for every budget and every use case. Right now, if you want maximum performance at the absolute lowest price, Amazon has dropped a deal that borders on absurd: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4475/">Dell Inspiron 16 with upgraded specs (Intel Core 7, 64GB DDR5 RAM, 2TB SSD) has plummeted to $1,195 from its typical $4,599 price</a>, which is a <strong>74 percent discount</strong> that requires a double-take to believe.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4475/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Intel Core 7 150U processor boasts <strong>10 cores and 12 threads with a turbo frequency of up to 5.4GHz</strong> and provides processing capability that tackles high-end workloads without pause. The 150U is part of Intel’s newest family of mobile processors using their power-efficient architecture, optimizing performance and battery life through smart power management.</p>
<h2>Huge Upgrades That Transform Daily Computing</h2>
<p>The memory and storage configuration makes it stand apart from bread-and-butter retail models. <strong>With 64GB of DDR5 RAM</strong>, you can have a bunch of browser tabs open, virtual machines and background processes simultaneously without any system slowdown. DDR5 is a generation improvement over DDR4 with exponentially greater data transfer rates, improved power efficiency and greater performance under heavy multitasking loads.</p>


<p>The 2TB SSD has enough space for your whole digital life without constant file management anxiety. You can have your whole software suite installed, store years of photos and video, download enormous game collections and store local backups without even approaching capacity limits. SSD technology means all loading nearly at the same instant, from system booting to application launching to file copying.</p>



<p>The<strong> 16-inch FHD+ touchscreen uses a 1920×1200 resolution with a 16:10 aspect ratio</strong> that gives you more vertical space than typical 16:9 screens. It comes in handy while working with documents, spreadsheets, or code when you’d rather see more content without scrolling. The 300-nit brightness delivers clarity in light rooms and the touchscreen feature (no need to use it if you don’t want to) delivers convenience for faster interactions when the keyboard gets too formal.</p>
<p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/windows-11-pro">Windows 11 Pro includes</a> enterprise-grade features like BitLocker encryption, remote desktop, and domain join functionality that are not included in Home versions. The Copilot key provides direct access to Microsoft’s AI assistant.</p>
<p>Connectivity includes Wi-Fi 6E for extremely fast wireless speeds on supporting networks, <strong>Bluetooth for peripherals, USB-C and USB-A ports for legacy and newer devices, HDMI output for external monitors, and an SD card reader</strong> for photographers transferring files from cameras.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life is 80 percent after just 60 minutes of charging</strong>, minimizing downtime when you simply need to have power ready at an instant between classes or meetings.</p>
<p>For $1,195, you’re getting technology that would otherwise cost three or four times that much.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/after-selling-out-amazon-brings-back-50-pack-pokemon-cards-at-a-new-record-low.1316446/</guid>

              <p>Building a Pokemon card collection from the ground up involves that you focus on quantity before hunting down specialty holographic Charizards or first edition old cards. The smart thing to do is to get a few inexpensive bulk packs like this and accumulate a solid base of cards that can be traded, sorted and used to build decks. You will have some duplicates in a bunch of packs but that is exactly what you want when you are just starting out: Duplicates become currency amongst friends and fellow collectors, and having the ability to have multiple copies of useful cards allows you to build functional decks without decreasing your collection.</p>
<p>There’s a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/">50-card miscellaneous lot that has dropped to an all-time low of $5 on Amazon from its usual $10 price point</a>, and it just came back in stock after selling out last week. You’re going to want to move quick because these bulk lots are short-lived.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The appeal here is simple value. <strong>For $5 for 50 cards, you’re paying 10 cents per card</strong>&nbsp;which is effectively floor price on Pokemon cards no matter what format. The <strong>individual booster packs cost $4 to $5 and contain only 10 to 11 cards</strong>, so you’d be paying $20 to $25 to get the same quantity through the traditional retailing method. This bulk approach bypasses the thrill of opening the sealed pack and the very low chance of obtaining ultra-rare cards but it provides you with maximum number of cards for minimum amount of money.</p>
<h2>Random Draw Gives Diverse Sets</h2>
<p>The pack includes <strong>random cards of all Pokemon series</strong> that represent the entire history of the trading card game from the very beginning Base Set to the most recent issues. You’ll receive a mix of core Pokemon cards with basic, Stage 1, and Stage 2 Pokemon from various generations and energy cards to power up attacks while playing. Randomization guarantees each lot acts as a surprise grab bag. You might receive popular Pokemon like Pikachu, evolutions of Eevee or starting Pokemon, or you might receive under-the-radar creatures from later generations.</p>



<p>Energy cards within such lots serve important gameplay functions. Energy cards on your Pokemon need to be played in order for the Pokemon Trading Card Game to use their attacks, with different Pokemon types requiring such energy types as Fire, Water, Grass, Lightning, Psychic, Fighting, Darkness, Metal, or Fairy. Possessing a solid base of energy cards enables you to actually build playable decks rather than simply gathering cards for their visual reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Duplicates are to be expected even in one 50-card lot</strong>. This is part of bulk card collections where the packaging process is more about speed than making each card unique. In reality, duplicates are less important than you’d imagine. Basic Pokemon cards and energy cards are intended to show up in multiples throughout your deck because competitive decks would have multiple copies of the same card.</p>
<p>The set is Amazon’s top-selling collectible card game set and deck, with over 20,000 sales in the past month alone.&nbsp;For $5, you’re getting the best value way to start a Pokemon collection or build upon one. The record-low price and recent stock shortages mean this won’t last long. If you’re even remotely interested in Pokemon cards, buying four or five of these lots puts you at 200 to 250 cards for $20 to $25, an immediate collection with high trading value.</p>
