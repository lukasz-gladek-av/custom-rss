              <p>The Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds feature an Active Noise Control system and an immersive audio system, and they fit well for extended periods. They also include soft ear tips that seal against the ear to eliminate ambient noise, but do not feel too tight. These earbuds feature Bluetooth compatibility for phones, tablets, laptops, and other devices. Additionally, the earbuds have a white smoke finish, have touch controls, and a compact charging case that is small enough to carry in a pocket. They were made to be portable while keeping the audio front and center.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6849/">You can find the Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds for $249 at Amazon.</a> This is a $50 discount from their normal price of $299. So this represents a 17% discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6849/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Earbuds with the style, comfort, and quality of Bose headphones</h2>
<p>The noise-cancellation on the Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds works to cancel out engine noise, conversations, and other background noise. If you would rather hear some outside noise, then the Aware Mode provides an alternative. It allows you to hear what is happening outside and smooths out sudden spikes in decibel levels caused by loud noises, such as clanging dishes and slamming doors. In addition to providing awareness of your surroundings, if you prefer more isolation, Quiet Mode reduces ambient noise so you can enjoy your playlists, calls, podcasts, etc., at a lower volume.</p>
<p>CustomTune technology in the Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds determines how sound behaves in your ears and adjusts noise cancellation and equalization accordingly. The earbuds produce a test tone when you insert them and measure the response. Then it sets the bass, midrange, and treble to match your ear shape. Bose Immersive Audio provides a spatial effect that creates the illusion that music and video are coming from in front of you rather than inside your head.</p>



<p>The fit and comfort of the earbuds are due to the combination of the soft silicone eartips and the flexible stability bands. There are multiple sizes of each component, and they can be combined in 9 ways. The umbrella-shaped tips provide additional blockage of ambient noise. Plus, they are rated IPX4, so they are suitable for use during sweating or light rain.</p>
<p>The call quality of the Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds depends on the noise-rejecting microphones and processing specifically tailored to ensure your voice is heard clearly. The microphones are focused on capturing your voice while rejecting wind and background noise; therefore, the caller hears you, not the surrounding noise.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, battery life and charging capabilities are configured to provide you with enough time to listen to whatever content you desire. Battery life is approximately 6 hours in Quiet, Aware, or Immersive Modes, and about 4 hours in Immersive Mode. The case supports 3 charging cycles and can be charged via a USB-C port or a wireless charging pad. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6849/">These are great headphones, and you’ll want to take advantage of the $249 sale price instead of the regular list price of $299 now.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-led-floor-lamp-drops-again-to-a-new-record-low-after-another-surprise-price-cut-on-amazon-2000662374</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="546">A new year often brings the urge to refresh your surroundings, and home upgrades don’t have to involve expensive furniture or major renovations. Small changes can dramatically shift how a space feels, and lighting sits at the top of that list. The right light can make a room feel warmer, calmer, and far more inviting. That’s exactly where the Govee LED floor lamp comes in, especially now that it’s available at a steep discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5950/">Normally priced at $100, this modern lamp is currently 35% off, dropping the price to just $65 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p data-start="548" data-end="968">The Govee floor lamp takes a sleek, minimalist approach. Its design features a single vertical light bar that tucks neatly into the corner of a room, projecting light outward across the walls. This indirect lighting instantly softens the space and eliminates harsh glare. Thanks to its RGB LED technology, the lamp can glow in virtually any color you can imagine, allowing you to adjust the mood of your room in seconds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5950/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="970" data-end="1368">Many people have grown tired of harsh overhead lighting—myself included. We have a strict, “No Big Light,” policy in my home. Ceiling fixtures and rows of recessed lights can make living spaces feel sterile and overly bright. Lighting placed closer to eye level or below creates a more relaxed environment, perfect for unwinding at the end of the day. The Govee floor lamp excels at this, delivering ambient light that feels intentional and cozy rather than clinical.</p>
<h2>Set the Mood, Any Mood</h2>
<p data-start="1370" data-end="1857">Customization with this lamp is near limitless. It supports multi-color displays and offers 85 built-in scene modes to match different moods and occasions. Warm oranges and yellows work well for quiet evenings with a book or movie, while vibrant color combinations can energize a room for social gatherings. Holiday decorating becomes effortless with themed color options, and music sync mode adds another layer of fun by matching light patterns to the beat of your favorite songs.</p>


<p data-start="1859" data-end="2260">The Govee floor lamp works with Alexa and Google Assistant, allowing you to control brightness, colors, and power with simple voice commands. Scheduling and automation options let you create routines that fit your lifestyle. Lights can turn on as the sun sets, dim automatically late at night, or shift scenes for special events without manual input.</p>
<p data-start="2262" data-end="2462">Setup is refreshingly easy. After assembling the vertical bar, you simply run the light strip through it, plug it in, and you’re ready to go. No complicated tools or technical experience are required.</p>
<p data-start="2464" data-end="2753" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5950/">This one lamp can completely change how a room feels, and at just $65, it’s a no brainer. Give your home the cozy refresh that it needs for 2026.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-3-queens-blood-snowboarding-2000662578</link>
            <guid>1414261</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</span></i><span> is known for its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-minigames-remake-trilogy-3-game-2000658234"><span>minigame glut</span></a><span>, but it did have at least </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-mini-games-best-worst-ranked-1851340606"><span>a few bangers</span></a><span> in the mix. One of those was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-rebirth-queens-blood-naoki-hamaguchi-interview-1851312733"><span>Queen’s Blood</span></a><span>, a card game that you could play with various citizens throughout the world, and it even had its own extensive side story to follow. This was new for </span><i><span>Rebirth</span></i><span>–apparently Queen’s Blood hadn’t yet caught on in Midgar, where </span><i><span>Remake </span></i><span>takes place–and it sounds like Square Enix wants to expand upon it in the upcoming third game.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-queens-blood-interview/"><i><span>Polygon</span></i></a><span>, director Naoki Hamaguchi confirmed Queen’s Blood will make a return in the as-of-yet-untitled third game, but it will be a little bit different.</span></p> <p><span>“Queen’s Blood is a very popular and beloved minigame, and I believe a lot of people are still wanting something like that,” Hamaguchi told </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i><span>. “I want to expand on Queen’s Blood so we are enhancing it, and giving you a more powered-up version of it when you see that third installment… Queen’s Blood is still going to be available in the third installment. We just want to expand on it.”</span></p>

 <p><span>What could those enhancements entail? New cards, mechanics, or maybe the board will just be twice as big, allowing for more territory-claiming plays? We probably won’t find out for a while, but Queen’s Blood isn’t the only minigame in the third entry, as it will also signal the return of the original </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span>’s snowboarding segment, which Hamaguchi says will be more than “just a simple snowboarding minigame.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000021618" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000021618"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000021618">© Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“I’m afraid I can’t delve too much into the details, but we understand that it’s not going to be just a simple snowboarding minigame. We want to make sure that it’s incorporated into the story to have that sort of connection with the theming of it,” he said.</span></p>

 <p><span>The third </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII </span></i><span>remake is probably still a ways away, but it does seem like the game is coming along and is in a playable state.</span></p> <p><span>“In terms of the third installment, I believe we are coming along very smoothly,” he said. “We have set a schedule for ourselves, and I believe we are tracking on time for the milestones we have set. So I’m really thankful for the development team and I have so much respect for them working on this project. I believe that at this point the game is playable, technically, but we are still trying to polish it so it is at a quality where we can deliver it to our players.”</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Remake </span></i><span>just launched </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-handheld-performance-2000661851"><span>on the Switch 2</span></a><span> and Xbox Series X/S, with </span><i><span>Rebirth </span></i><span>expected to launch on both systems later this year.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Starts a Streaming Device Clearance, Fire TV Stick 4K Plus (Newest Model) Hits Its Lowest Price of the Year]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-starts-a-streaming-device-clearance-fire-tv-stick-4k-plus-newest-model-hits-its-lowest-price-of-the-year-2000662384</link>
            <guid>1414258</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>No smart TV? No problem. If your screen is working fine otherwise, you don’t have to replace it to enjoy smart features. A Fire TV stick can do the job for considerably less, and you can now pick its latest model for under than $30.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6848/">Amazon is currently offering the newest Fire TV Stick 4K Plus at a 30% discount, bringing the price down to $35</a>. Use the code FTV4K25 at checkout, and you’ll save another $10, which drops the total to just $25. You’ll also get a one-month free trial to Xbox GamePass with your purchase, which sweetens the offer even more.</p>
<p>Those with an older Fire TV stick lying around can trade it in for 20% off this model, but you might not be able to combine the current discount with that.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6848/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easy Setup</h2>
<p>This small, but mighty stick plugs directly into the HDMI input of your TV. Then, connect the USB cable to the Fire TV Stick and the power adapter. Plug the adapter into a wall outlet, and turn your TV on. You can now follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes, even if it’s your first time using one.</p>
<p>Once it’s all set and running, you’ll be able to stream more than 1.8 million movies and TV episodes from popular platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Max, and more. Most of these require a monthly fee, but if you’re looking to cut back on those, no sweat. It also gets you instant access to over 400,000 free movies and TV episodes from popular ad-supported streaming apps like Fire TV Channels, Prime Video, Tubi, and Pluto TV. Basically, you’ll never be out of stuff to watch. Maybe start the night with a good horror movie, and then switch to a lighthearted comedy show to wrap things up (and keep nightmares at bay)!</p>
<p>Smart search is made possible with Alexa, which lets you simply use your voice to find movies by actor, plot, and even iconic quotes. For instance, you can say something like “Alexa, show me the latest Jake Gyllenhaal movies”, or “Alexa, show me crime thrillers with unexpected endings”, and your command will be answered in seconds.</p>



<p>The Fire TV Stick 4K Plus is made to help you maximize your TV’s potential. Dolby Vision and HDR10+ support means you can stream content in vibrant 4K Ultra HD, plus enjoy immersive sound with Dolby Atmos audio. There’s WiFi 6 for smoother streaming, which also ensures less interference from other connected devices.</p>
<p>Gamers will appreciate that you can also game with Xbox Game Pass via cloud gaming through the stick. We’re talking playing Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, Hogwarts Legacy, Outer Worlds 2, Ninja Gaiden 4, and hundreds of other titles without a console. And since you also get a month of Xbox GamePass with your purchase, you can jump in at no extra cost.</p>
<p>This version of the stick comes with early access to Alexa+ as well, which is Amazon’s smartest AI assistant yet. The access is available through the end of 2026, and after that, it will be included with Prime. Again, it’s a nice way to try the new features without committing.</p>
<p>We’re not expecting this 50% discount to last long, so it’s best to grab it without wasting time. Just make sure you use the code FTV4K25 at checkout to maximize savings.</p>

              <p>It feels like a rare treat for a Nintendo Direct to take us by surprise, now that the events are routinely being pre-empted by leakers. This latest, just revealed by Nintendo to take place on January 25 at 9 a.m. ET (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-set-for-january-25"><em>Gematsu</em></a>), snuck up on me. It’s a shame it’s just for the&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>, rather than meeting our desperate need for Switch 2 game news, but at least it means we’ll get to see Shigeru Miyamoto being all delightfully excited.</p> <p>Yes, January 25&nbsp;<em>is</em> a Sunday, which is a weird choice for a Direct. All right-minded games and film journalists are in bed at 9 a.m. on a Sunday morning, so expect some bleary-eyed coverage of the new footage and details being revealed ahead of the movie’s April 3 release.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Join us on Sunday, Jan 25, at 6am PT for the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoDirect?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoDirect</a> featuring an exclusive look at The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. Please note that no game information will be included in this presentation.</p> <p>Watch here: <a href="https://t.co/gTC114mMLz">https://t.co/gTC114mMLz</a> <a href="https://t.co/4DOoFU1fFJ">pic.twitter.com/4DOoFU1fFJ</a></p> <p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2014700056855687256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Nintendo says this will feature “an exclusive look at&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>,” but gives no more information than that. So far we’ve seen a&nbsp;<em>very</em> limited amount of the movie, mostly sticking to a single scene of Mario and Luigi’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-trailer-bowser-smug-jerk-2000643462">frustrating conversation</a> with a miniature Bowser in his teeny castle. Aside from the reveal of Rosalina, weirdly little has been shown of a movie that’s due out in just over two months.</p>  <p>The original 2023&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-review-chris-pratt-jack-black-1850309488">may not have been particularly good</a>, but it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-bros-movie-box-office-records-sonic-reviews-1850318954">wildly successful</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-miyamoto-negative-bad-reviews-1850380112">Miyamoto even claimed</a> the negative reviews helped the movie succeed. Nintendo and Illumination are presumably feeling very confident of a similar success for the sequel, which will hopefully make better use of the splendid&nbsp;<em>Mario Galaxy</em> setting than first movie did of its Mushroom Kingdom hodgepodge.</p>

 <p>Following Sunday’s Direct, we can expect promotion for the animated movie to really ramp up, although presumably continuing to try to feature Chris Pratt’s dull-ass voice as little as possible.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 VR Modder Locks Out Subscribers After New DMCA: ‘People On The Web Are Thirsty For Blood’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-luke-ross-patreon-2000662571</link>
            <guid>1414222</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The modder who goes by Luke Ross has made full VR mods for some of the biggest blockbuster games around. He’s now decided to take them all offline, at least for now. After reportedly trying and failing to get CD Projekt Red to pay him for a full-conversion VR mod for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, Ross was hit earlier this month <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-baldurs-gate-3-takedown-2000660987">with a DMCA takedown notice</a> from the Polish RPG maker. The modder has now been hit with another DMCA from the publisher of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghostrunner-is-actually-the-fall-s-sharpest-cyberpunk-g-1845917183"><em>Ghostrunner</em></a>, and has decided to suspend his entire Patreon, where access to dozens of other VR mods is locked behind a subscriber paywall, for at least the next month.</p> <p>“In light of the above facts, I’m being forced to take immediate action. I’m making unavailable all versions of the mods and also all the posts related to the wonderful work we have done here together for years, so that there will be no ground for further claims,” Ross wrote in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1qkavjg/luke_ross_removes_access_to_all_mods/">a reported email to subscribers last night</a> (via <em><a href="https://frvr.com/blog/cyberpunk-vr-modder-luke-ross-patreon-suspended-following-new-dmca-from-ghostruner-devs/">FRVR</a></em>). “And since I cannot stop people from subscribing without closing down the account altogether, I’m making it clear on the About and Welcome pages that new subscriptions will have the only effect of supporting me and that no access to the 40+ conversions can or will be provided at this time.”</p>

 <p>The dramatic move came after Ross reportedly feared losing access to the account entirely after a takedown notice from Ghostrunner publisher 505 Games. “No mention of any terms of service violation this time,” wrote the modder. “Again Patreon automatically complied. I don’t blame them; DMCA law is carefully worded to give infinite power to big companies, who only need to write on a slip of paper that they ‘believe’ their copyright has been infringed in order to nuke from the sky anything they don’t like—and to give infinite headaches to creators like me, who instead have the only recourse of going to court, sustaining huge costs to get through the legal process.”</p> <p>Ross’ frustration with the publishers who own the games he’s modding and the power dynamics of modern DMCA threats on the internet is clear throughout the email, but the modder also tries to address criticisms about him charging for the mods in the first place. Central to CDPR’s complaint against the <em>Cyberpunk 2077 VR</em> mod was that Ross was charging players to access it via a subscription. As with a similar VR mod for <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, the normally pro-mod game maker reiterated that it would be fine with Ross making the creations free and simply allowing users to voluntarily tip instead, as many other modders do.</p>

 <p>“People on the web are thirsty for blood because back in the <em>GTA V</em> and <em>RDR 2</em> era, an article came out stating that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23190201/luke-ross-vr-real-mod-gta-v-elden-ring-horizon-red-dead">I was raising $20,000 a month</a>. Is that ‘reasonable?'” Ross wrote. “Assuming that overall the work I poured into making my software support <em>Cyberpunk</em>, turning it into the ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q02UCNXLJY8" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer ugc">most immersive gaming experience’</a>&nbsp;some people had in their lives, amounted to a few months, say $50,000: is that ‘reasonable’ according to the arbitrary criteria of <em>Cyberpunk</em>‘s publisher? Something tells me it wouldn’t be considered reasonable, despite being a tiny fraction of the many millions they would have to invest for porting <em>CP2077</em> to VR themselves, and despite the fact that the cost was entirely financed by passionate gamers and none of it was incurred by CD Projekt Red.”</p>

 <p>Ross’ thankless crusade hasn’t won over the gaming masses quite yet. He accused users of trying to pirate the <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> VR mod even after it was taken down in order <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/creator-of-dmcad-cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-says-people-are-now-pirating-it-to-punish-him-for-breaking-cd-projekts-terms-of-service">to “punish” him</a>&nbsp;for breaking CDPR’s terms of service. “Wouldn’t making his mod free and accepting optional donations make him bulletproof to all claims?” asked one commenter on the VR subreddit where Ross’ latest email was shared. “Guy wants so bad to make some nice cash out of this, and got so upset that he is not even considering alternative ‘business models,’ he just said fuck it.”</p>

              <p><span>The UGREEN 7-in-1 Docking Station converts a USB-C connector on your computer or tablet into a multi-connection hub for additional monitors, storage devices, and accessories. Aluminum construction gives this docking station a slender profile that houses 7 connections, 2 HDMI video connections, 2 USB-A data connections, 2 USB-C data connections, and a dedicated input for powering the unit. In addition, you can connect monitors, storage devices, and a charger with a single, compact adapter, eliminating the need to manage multiple adapters/dongles.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6847/"><span>Visit Amazon and purchase the UGREEN 7-in-1 Docking Station for only $26, down from the regular price of $37, for a 31% savings.&nbsp;</span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6847/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A docking station to collect all your important tech in one place</h2>
<p><span>With this dock, you can drive two external monitors at resolutions up to 4K (3840×2160) and refresh rates up to 60Hz via its two HDMI ports. You can duplicate your primary screen on the second monitor, or expand your desktop to an additional monitor, freeing up space on the original monitor for other applications.</span></p>
<p><span>The four 10 Gb/s data ports provide the space for connecting your most frequently used peripherals. This dock has two USB-A and two USB-C connectors that support connecting external solid-state drives (SSDs), flash drives, keyboards, mice, etc., at much faster speeds than USB 2.0 ports. As these connectors are designed primarily to transfer data, and not to charge your laptop or to output video, they enable you to move large files and back up your data to external storage devices more rapidly.</span></p>



<p><span>There is a dedicated USB-C Power Delivery port on this dock that lets you keep your laptop charged even when the dock is connected to it. It can accept up to 100W of power from a compatible USB-C charger and pass power to the host cable. So, a single connection to the dock can perform both charging and expansion functions. Only power is transferred through the PD port, allowing the other 10 Gb/s ports to be used for data transfer.</span></p>
<p><span>The aluminum housing of this dock is compact, yet sturdy enough to withstand normal usage without being bulky in your travel case. The small size of the dock, combined with a relatively short host cable, minimizes clutter and prevents adjacent ports on the side of your laptop from being obstructed by the dock. You can either permanently keep this dock on a desk or include it in a travel kit with a charger and HDMI cables. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6847/">At a sale price of $26, down from its original list price of $37</a>, the UGREEN 7-in-1 docking station is a great solution that provides two 4K-resolution HDMI outputs, high-speed data ports, and power-through charging via a single USB-C connector.</span></p>
