Before you dive in with a friend or loved one, though, here are four things you should know about the game.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c70e9f7e4bc09609fa674b87fa40ff1b" data-recommend-id="image://c70e9f7e4bc09609fa674b87fa40ff1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe running through a sci-fi setting with a giant exploding sun in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe running through a sci-fi setting with a giant exploding sun in the background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c70e9f7e4bc09609fa674b87fa40ff1b" data-recommend-id="image://c70e9f7e4bc09609fa674b87fa40ff1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe running through a sci-fi setting with a giant exploding sun in the background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Whether you’re playing couch-based or online co-op, you only need to purchase a single copy of <em>Split Fiction</em> for both players to enjoy the experience. If the two of you are both sat on a couch, you can obviously share a screen. However, if you’re a pair playing online, the game’s owner can use a Friend’s Pass to allow their friend to join in free of charge.</p><p>Even better, your Friend’s Pass works cross-platform! This means if you grab the game on PlayStation 5 and your friend has an Xbox Series X, you’re still golden. Same goes for PC! No matter where you like to play your games, <em>Split Fiction</em> is good to go.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="68fb14e774071883280597cbf7426b6c" data-recommend-id="image://68fb14e774071883280597cbf7426b6c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe climbing poles outside of a winter castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe climbing poles outside of a winter castle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="68fb14e774071883280597cbf7426b6c" data-recommend-id="image://68fb14e774071883280597cbf7426b6c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe climbing poles outside of a winter castle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Split Fiction</em> isn’t an extraordinarily challenging game, but its difficulty is no doubt a notch above developer Hazelight’s previous title, <em>It Takes Two</em>. There are a lot of segments during the game that require intense focus and quick thinking to overcome, as both players help one another bypass obstacles or defeat enemies.</p><p>Luckily, <em>Split Fiction</em>’s checkpoint system is quite generous, and failure rarely puts you back more than a minute’s worth of gameplay. With this in mind, be patient if you’re playing with friends or family who don’t have your killer gaming acumen. With a bit of trial and error, you’ll get past even the most frustrating hangups!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="584c458b74d863ddf92bdd77b0990964" data-recommend-id="image://584c458b74d863ddf92bdd77b0990964" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe looking at a side story bubble in Split Fiction." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe looking at a side story bubble in Split Fiction." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="584c458b74d863ddf92bdd77b0990964" data-recommend-id="image://584c458b74d863ddf92bdd77b0990964" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image of Mio and Zoe looking at a side story bubble in Split Fiction." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As you venture through the sci-fi and fantasy lands thought up by main characters Mio and Zoe, you’ll also encounter quite a few side stories that can be explored. These bite-sized levels tend to have only one or two main gimmicks to focus on, and they provide some of the most unique, adorable, and funny experiences the game has to offer.</p><p>These shorter levels are accessed via side story bubbles (pictured above) that often sit off to the side of an area as you move through levels.

In addition to the game’s main path and exciting side stories, there are numerous optional things throughout its levels that you can interact with. Some of these, such as benches for your character to rest on, offer quiet moments of reflection with a good view. Elsewhere, you may come across hilarious interactions like a cauldron where you can make potions that turn you into funny creatures, just for laughs. So don’t rush! Take your time and soak in all the game has to offer.</p><hr><p><em>Split Fiction</em> is an exciting and endlessly creative outing that co-op fans shouldn’t miss.

There are plenty of funny and heartfelt moments for you and a friend to experience in this adventure. But if you’re wondering how many hours of cooperative fun there is to be had, we’ve got the answer for you. Here’s how long it takes to beat <em>Split Fiction</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195896" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Spider-Man 2's New Web Wings Make It Feel Like A Proper Sequel" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="112" data-playlist="195896,196578,194088" data-current="195896"><div><p>Spider-Man 2's New Web Wings Make It Feel Like A Proper Sequel</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195896/195896_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21410.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h3226"><a id=""></a><strong>How long does it take to beat <em>Split Fiction</em>?</strong></h2><p>Seeing as <em>Split Fiction</em> is an entirely cooperative title, the time it takes you to see it through depends largely on the skill level of both players. However, the average playthrough of <em>Split Fiction</em> will take roughly <strong>12 hours</strong>. This would be simply pushing through the game’s main storyline with minimal distractions.</p><p>It’s worth noting, though, that the distractions are half the fun of <em>Split Fiction</em>! Fully completing the game and snagging every trophy or achievement will take some dedication, as you’ll need to be on the same page about finishing every side story and finding a variety of optional one-off moments throughout the game.</p><figure id="" data-id="702a4f752baa8aa3de72fbc6b1356000" data-recommend-id="image://702a4f752baa8aa3de72fbc6b1356000" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image showing Split Fiction's main characters in split screen shooting at mechs in a sci-fi setting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image showing Split Fiction's main characters in split screen shooting at mechs in a sci-fi setting." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="702a4f752baa8aa3de72fbc6b1356000" data-recommend-id="image://702a4f752baa8aa3de72fbc6b1356000" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image showing Split Fiction's main characters in split screen shooting at mechs in a sci-fi setting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Luckily, <em>Split Fiction</em> has a very generous chapter select that allows you to revisit past segments of the game and wrap up any side content you may have missed on your first pass through a level. This makes full completion much less stressful, leaving you to enjoy your initial play at a pace that feels right for you and your gaming partner.</p><p>If you’re a completionist looking to get the absolute most out of <em>Split Fiction</em>, you can expect to spend around <strong>15 hours</strong> experiencing its sci-fi and fantasy worlds. This includes stopping to check out all of the side stories and fun little interactions, or using the aforementioned chapter select to catch up on any of these you missed your first time through the game.</p><hr><p><em>Split Fiction</em> is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC. And remember: Only one person has to buy the game, as it features a Friend’s Pass that allows a second person to play for free. So you only have half the excuses for not jumping into this thrilling co-op adventure right away!</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While plans can always change, what that means right now is that the meeting place for 200 million monthly users, over 90 percent of whom use it for gaming, is exploring going from a private company to a public one ruled by the founding principle of the stock market: number must go up. </p><p>“We understand there is a lot of interest around Discord’s future plans, but we do not comment on rumors or speculation,” a spokesperson for the company told <em>The New York Times</em>. “Our focus remains on delivering the best possible experience for our users and building a strong, sustainable business.” </p><p>Discord was released in 2015 by founders Jason Citron and Stanislav Vishnevskiy. After shipping a MOBA royale on iPad called <em>Fates Forever</em> in 2014 that never took off, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://venturebeat.com/games/hammer-chisel-pivots-to-voice-comm-app-for-multiplayer-mobile-games/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://venturebeat.com/games/hammer-chisel-pivots-to-voice-comm-app-for-multiplayer-mobile-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they pivoted to making communications platform for online gamers</a></span>. Online games were exploding at the time and the tools for communicating in them were pretty bad. Discord filled the void when it came to coordinating raids in  <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>or ganks in <em>Dota 2</em>. </p><p>It eventually became a one-stop shop for gaming conversations online, offering an alternative to boring, stilted workplace productivity tools like Skype and Slack, as well as archaic gaming forums, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/twitter-discord-elon-musk-buys-social-media-online-comm-1848853337&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/twitter-discord-elon-musk-buys-social-media-online-comm-1848853337">fire-hose social media platforms like Reddit and Twitter</a></span>. Discord is now fully-integrated on Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, and serves as a better solution to Nintendo Switch’s terrible voice chat app, and the frustrating hiccups of cross-platform party chat. Powering this takeover has been the fact 1) Discord works and 2) the majority of its features are entirely free. </p><p>Going public could change all of that. We’ve seen the playbook before. Tech company woos hundreds of millions of users with a great product that’s practically free, and then once they’re locked into the platform through history, network effects, or just old habit, squeezes as much financial value out of the thing by making it worse in almost every way possible. If this were A Christmas Carol and Discord was Ebenezer Scrooge then Facebook would be the Jacob Marley shaking its chains in the chat app’s face. <br></p><p>This is what the author Cory Doctorow <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has dubbed enshittification</a></span>. Online products and services get worse over time as the companies behind them are forced to extract more and more value no matter the long-terms costs. Being private doesn’t make a company immune from this, but going public certainly has the potential to be like throwing TNT into a dumpster fire. This shift was already evident in Discord—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wsj.com/tech/discord-to-start-showing-ads-for-gamers-to-boost-revenue-bf5848b9&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/discord-to-start-showing-ads-for-gamers-to-boost-revenue-bf5848b9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see its embrace of online advertising just last year</a></span>—but seems only likely to worsen with a potential IPO payout looming overhead. Look no farther then Reddit’s road to going public, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/24097069/reddit-ipo-public-investment-ai-training-data-google&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/24097069/reddit-ipo-public-investment-ai-training-data-google" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paved with generative-AI deals and API price hikes</a></span>. </p><p>The increasing enshittification of Discord is even more worrying. It’s now the defacto town square for many of the biggest games around, from <em>Marvel Rivals</em> to <em>Helldivers 2</em>. Rockstar Games just launched its own Discord channel <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-game-official-discord-server-launched-1851762536&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-game-official-discord-server-launched-1851762536">in preparation for <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></a></span>, likely to be the biggest game launch ever when it arrives later this year. The price of exiting the platform if features get worse or locked behind a paywall is only going up. And any communities that do leave will have to leave their pasts behind, sealed off like The Cask of Amontillado from the rest of the internet. Discord’s separation from that crumbling infrastructure has long been one of its greatest virtues, making it feel like a relative safe heaven from SEO spam and algorithmic churn. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/discord-forum-messageboard-amazon-lost-ark-new-world-pc-1850393695&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/discord-forum-messageboard-amazon-lost-ark-new-world-pc-1850393695">It could one day make it feel more like a tomb</a></span>.<br></p><p>High on a pandemic-fueled influx of new users, Discord once flirted with growing beyond its gaming roots. There was talk of it supplanting Slack and of Microsoft buying it for a potential $6.5 billion.
