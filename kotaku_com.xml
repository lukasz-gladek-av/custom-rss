              <p>I’ve mostly enjoyed the second season of Amazon and Bethesda’s live-action <em>Fallout</em> TV show. One thing I hated about this new season, however, was that each new episode premiered at midnight. Thankfully, Amazon is changing this release schedule for the rest of the season.</p> <p>On January 26, Amazon Prime Video announced its plans to release the next (and final) two episodes of <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-why-fans-are-convinced-fallout-3-and-new-vegas-remasters-are-about-to-be-revealed-2000660161"><em>Fallout</em></a> season two at 6 p.m. PT instead of midnight. Season two episode seven will now arrive on Tuesday, January 27, and episode eight will be available on Tuesday, February 3.</p>

 <p>“Good morning, Vault Dwellers!” posted Amazon on Twitter. “Due to strong participation and interest, we have amended the start times for the remaining Season Two presentations.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Good morning, Vault Dwellers! Due to strong participation and interest, we have amended the start times for the remaining Season Two presentations. Episode Seven will now begin Tuesday, Jan. 27 at 6 p.m. PT, and Episode Eight will now begin Tuesday, Feb. 3 at 6 p.m. PT. Your… <a href="https://t.co/x1LhnwEsRL">pic.twitter.com/x1LhnwEsRL</a></p> <p>— FALLOUT⚡️ (@falloutonprime) <a href="https://twitter.com/falloutonprime/status/2015832890433552799?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 26, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>While I’ve been a fan of the weekly rollout of <em>Fallout</em> season two, as it allows my friend group time to watch and then later chat about each episode at the same time as the internet, I really, really hated the midnight release time. It made it harder for sites to cover, made it more annoying for people to avoid spoilers the following morning, and didn’t really seem to have any benefit other than that some night owls got to watch the latest episode a bit earlier than everyone else. So I’m very happy with this change!</p>

 <p>In fact, it should work this way when <em>Fallout</em> season three arrives in the future. <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/fallout-season-2-season-3-prime-video">Amazon already confirmed a third season is on the way</a>, and I’ll be madder than a Deathclaw with a dart in its leg if the streaming giant decides to go back to midnight releases for that next round of episodes.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, if you haven’t been keeping up with <em>Fallout</em> season two but you are a big fan of the games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-finally-brings-back-two-classic-pieces-of-the-franchise-2000661833">you should at least check out who showed up in a recent episode, as it’s a very cool surprise for longtime players.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-launch-pc-ps5-free-to-play-servers-is-it-good-titanfall-apex-2000663135"><em>Highguard</em> is out on PS5, Xbox, and PC</a> and it’s been a weird day for the unique new hero shooter. There were <a href="https://kotaku.com/drdisrespect-lies-about-being-invited-to-highguard-preview-event-2000663184">false claims</a> it had worked with disgraced streamer DrDisrespect and a myriad of technical issues plaguing its first hours on Steam. Now, as the dust settles, <em>Highguard</em> has racked up over 9,000 reviews on Valve’s storefront, but the vast majority are negative.</p> <p>On January 26, after a period of radio silence <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">following its reveal at the 2025 Game Awards</a>, <em>Highguard</em> launched for free, offering players a 3v3 PVP “raid shooter” experience complete with destructible environments and cool mounts to ride into battle on. However, shortly after the game’s launch, players began reporting problems. One of the first was that many, myself included, couldn’t even play <em>Highguard</em> due to the overwhelmed servers. Far from the worst issue to have on launch day.</p>

 <p>Once players got in, many reported performance issues on PC, with rigs equipped with high-end hardware still struggling to play <em>Highguard</em> at a steady framerate. And after getting through all that, some players have found matches in <em>Highguard</em> boring and slow, complaining that the 3v3 format and large map don’t mix well. Sprinkle in some bad-faith users attacking the game for looking “woke,” whatever the hell that means, and you end up with a horrible Steam review rating.</p> <h2>What is <em>Highguard’s</em> Steam review rating?</h2> <p>As of 5:10 p.m. EST, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/#app_reviews_hash"><em>Highguard</em> has 9,442 user reviews on Steam</a> across all languages. Of those nearly 10,000 reviews, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/4128260/charts/#:~:text=19.8%25%20positive%20reviews-,7%2C230,-80.2%25%20negative%20reviews">SteamDB data shows 7,230 of them are negative</a>. This adds up to a “Mostly Negative” status on Steam with fewer than 2,000 positive reviews. Ouch. <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012011">Over on the PlayStation Store,</a> things are better, with <em>Highguard</em> sitting at nearly 2,000 reviews and a 3.34 out of 5-star rating.</p>

 <p>It might be easy to assume this is some nefarious review bombing, and I do think <em>some</em> of this can be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=highguard+woke">blamed on bad actors and annoying chuds</a>. But scrolling through the reviews does show a lot of players just don’t seem to like the slow pace of the game and the 3v3 format.</p>

 <p>“The maps in this game are way too big for 3v3; the size would fit better for 5v5 or 6v6,” posted one Steam reviewer. “In the looting stage, the map is too big and empty considering it’s only 3v3, and the only things in it are red and blue chests (and the crystals i guess),” shared another user. “The 3v3 format on such a huge map just doesn’t click for me, and the overall experience becomes chaotic without bringing anything new to the table,” said someone else.</p> <p>Of course, it should be noted that not even 12 hours have passed since <em>Highguard’s</em> launch. So all of these reviews are based on a dozen or so matches or less. The real question will be what happens in the next few days, weeks, and months–assuming <em>Highguard</em> sticks around that long–and if the devs can turn the ship around.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Replacing Your Gamer Friends With AI Chatbots Sounds Terrifyingly Effective]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/escape-tarkov-ai-chatbot-quest-ai-chatgpt-2000663213</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>You are not immune to AI psychosis. Much like cult indoctrination, it can happen to anyone given the right circumstances. Take Matthew Gault, games and tech writer at </span><i><span>404 Media</span></i><span>. After failing to convince his friends to play </span><i><span>Escape from Tarkov</span></i><span> with him, Gault thought it would be funny to </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/i-replaced-my-friends-with-ai-because-they-wont-play-tarkov-with-me/"><span>replace his buddies with an AI chatbot</span></a><span>. It ended up not being very funny at all.</span></p> <p><span>Gault is a self-described “certified AI hater,” though he concedes that LLM technology is useful in certain instances (I agree to disagree with Gault’s assertion that offloading transcription to an environmentally catastrophic machine built on stolen labor saves valuable time and energy). Gault’s friends were turned off by the difficulty of </span><i><span>Escape from Tarkov</span></i><span>, an extraction shooter which came out of early access last November. He described playing by himself as lonely. “Then I saw comic artist Zach Weinersmith making fun of a service, Questie.AI, that sells AI avatars that’ll hang out with you while you play video games,” he writes.</span></p>

 <p><span>What started as a joke quickly became more sincere. Gault found he genuinely enjoyed playing </span><i><span>Tarkov</span></i><span> with his Quest.AI companion, Wolf. “It was, I thought, not unlike playing with a friend who has more than 1,000 hours in the game and knows more than you. Wolf bantered, referenced community in-jokes, and it made me laugh.”</span></p> <p><span>Gault was surprised and concerned by his own enjoyment of the chatbot, his previous confusion over how people could fall victim to AI psychosis replaced by understanding. He states he will not continue using Quest.AI: “I never thought anything like [AI psychosis] could happen to me. Now I’m not so sure. I didn’t understand how easy it might be to lose yourself to AI delusion until I’d messed around with Wolf. Even with its shitty auto-tuned sounding voice, Wolf was good enough to hang out with.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Gault’s experiment ended with his real friends making fun of him for using Quest.AI by ironically using another LLM, ChatGPT, to send messages to him. Gault’s account is another entry in the emerging genre of seemingly normal people jokingly using AI chatbots and discovering things can get weird very quickly. YouTuber Eddy Burback popularized the phenomenon with his chilling </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRjgNgJms3Q"><span>documentary</span></a><span> “ChatGPT made me delusional,” which has garnered over 4 million views in the past two months. As Silicon Valley continues to shove LLM technology down our collective throats, it feels like only a matter of time until even more strains of AI psychosis—both simulated and sincere—begin to emerge. </span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Steam Game Devs Call Exploit Allegations ‘Clickbait Exaggeration’ And ‘Malicious Defamation’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/screeps-world-steam-game-exploit-pc-hack-2000663214</link>
            <guid>1416898</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The developers behind a popular “open source MMO RTS sandbox game for programming enthusiasts” on Steam, named </span><i><span>Screeps: World,</span></i><span> have been forced to update their game “in order to protect both players” and their “own reputation,” following the discovery of an alleged “remote code execution vulnerability” that would enable players to take control of other players’ computers. Even worse, the person who helped discover the vulnerability in question alleges that Valve “ignored” their reported findings.</span></p> <p><span>If you’re noticing an overabundance of quotes in the previous paragraph, there’s a good reason for that, as this story spawned out of a rather nasty back-and-forth </span><a href="https://x.com/IsaacKing314/status/2015195819251736630?s=20"><span>on X</span></a><span> between </span><i><span>Screeps: World’s</span></i><span> developers Screeps, LLC and an “information security” aficionado by the name of Isaac King.</span></p>

 <p><span>As King explained in his initial post, </span><i><span>Screeps: World</span></i><span> apparently allowed “any other player in the game world to gain remote access to your computer” through the use of a programming exploit. For context, </span><i><span>Screeps: World</span></i><span> is a programming game that lets players write their own code in JavaScript, which is then used to craft their own custom-made AI units.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663224" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663224"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663224">©Screeps, LLC</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As of this writing, the game is currently sitting at a “Very Positive” review score on Steam, having amassed roughly 1,876 reviews and, according to </span><a href="https://app.sensortower.com/vgi/game/screeps-world"><span>VG Insights</span></a><span>, over 113,000 individual purchases.</span></p>

 <p><span>If you want the exact explanation of the reputed vulnerability, I highly suggest reading King’s highly detailed write-up of the exploit </span><a href="https://outsidetheasylum.blog/screeps/"><span>on his blog</span></a><span>. I will, however, warn you in advance that it requires (at least) a base understanding of JavaScript to fully understand.</span></p>

 <p><span>Thankfully, King includes an analogy for “non-programmers” in the conclusion: “imagine if there were one particular kind of unit in </span><i><span>Starcraft</span></i><span> that, if you trained it, let people hack your computer. And when pointed out, the game designers said ‘well this is self-inflicted, the players all chose to train that unit’.”</span></p> <p><span>King also explains that the developers have been aware of the issue since July 2024, as one of Screeps, LLC’s two developers replied to a report </span><a href="https://github.com/screeps/screeps/issues/162#issuecomment-2223049479"><span>on GitHub</span></a><span> detailing the vulnerability. The dev in question replied, stating that they “do not see this as a serious security threat.” However, a user from the Screeps Discord </span><a href="https://outsidetheasylum.blog/screeps/usage.png"><span>noted</span></a><span> that the vulnerability had been successfully abused in the past.</span></p>

 <p><span>Once the initial post on X began to gain traction, the official Screeps X account replied stating that the accusation was “at the very least, a clickbait exaggeration, and at worst, malicious defamation intended to cause reputational damage.” Nevertheless, they also stated that the alleged vulnerability has, as of January 25, been removed from </span><i><span>Screeps: World</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The potentially more worrying side of this is that King noted in his blog post that he’d reported the issue to Steam directly, but didn’t receive a reply: “I reported the game to Steam, which of course they ignored. Their terms of service make them not liable for any hacks caused by malware on the platform, so if it’s getting sales from which they can take a cut, why do anything about it?”</span></p> <p><span>We’ve reached out to Valve to corroborate this, and will update the piece if they reply.</span></p>

              <p>We’re about to enter the Ship of Theseus phase of Nintendo. The winter gaming showcase season is about to begin. And is there any way to prevent <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> leaks at launch? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint<em>, Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. We’re one step closer to lopping off the “Morning” part since it keeps arriving so late. But hey, it’s a snow day in the Mid-Atlantic. Despite the winter wonderland outside, my kids decided to get obsessed with <em>Kingdoms: Two Crowns</em> this weekend. Now instead of building a snowman themselves, they keep looking around for poor villagers who they can pay to do so instead.</p> <h2>More Nintendo veterans are leaving</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">紺野さんの退職が話題になり始めた‥<br>時代を作った人たちが任天堂から離れていく‥。 <a href="https://t.co/5YMnx5w5vv">https://t.co/5YMnx5w5vv</a></p> <p>— 今村孝矢 / Takaya Imamura (@ima_1966) <a href="https://twitter.com/ima_1966/status/2014949188841439270?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 24, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Hideki Konno, who’s been at the Mario maker for decades and worked on games ranging from <em>Sim City</em> for the SNES to <em>Mario Kart 8</em>, left the company last summer. <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2026/01/26/161984.html"><em>Game*Spark</em> reports</a> that the developer actually signaled the news at the time with an update to his Facebook page status but fans have only been noticing this month. “Talk of Konno-san’s resignation is starting to buzz…” wrote another ex-Nintendo veteran, Takaya Imamura, <a href="https://twitter.com/ima_1966/status/2014949188841439270?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2014949188841439270%7Ctwgr%5E7de92d1ab1a78560db9a2b88471edd887146f0fb%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost.php%3Fpost%3D2000663175action%3Dedit">on X</a>. “The people who shaped an era are leaving Nintendo one by one…”</p>

 <h2>Ubisoft is looking to cut 200 more jobs from its Paris headquarters</h2> <p>The move was announced internally today and impacts people across marketing, admin, design, and more from the publisher’s head office, which among other things has in the past helped guide game design decisions. “At this stage, this remains a proposal, and no decision will be final until a collective agreement is reached with employee representatives and validated by French authorities,” the company said in a statement. “The proposal applies exclusively to Ubisoft International employees under French contracts and has no impact on other French entities or Ubisoft teams worldwide.”</p> <h2>The next Nintendo Direct is dedicated to <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em></h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Join us on Jan 29 at 6am PT for the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TomodachiLife?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TomodachiLife</a>: Living the Dream Direct!

 <h2>Blizzard said hold my beer and just announced four February showcases</h2> <p>A “series of developer-led spotlights” will have announcements for what’s coming ahead in 2026. There’s <em>World of Warcraft</em> – State of Azeroth on January 29 at 12:00 p.m. ET, <em>Overwatch</em> Spotlight on February 4 at 1:00 p.m. ET, <em>Hearthstone</em> Spotlight on February 9 at 12:30 p.m. ET, and <em>Diablo</em> 30th Anniversary Spotlight on February 11 at 5:00 p.m. ET.</p>

 <h2>Also maybe a PS5 State of Play</h2> <p>That one’s not official but it comes straight from the mouth of <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2015679942957138341">leak whisperer NateTheHate</a>.</p> <h2>An insider claims<em> Grand Theft Auto 6</em> might launch without a physical version to avoid leaks</h2> <p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/grand-theft-auto-6-may-not-have-a-physical-version-on-day-one-to-avoid-leaks-report-claims/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a> that Graczdari, of Polish site <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/397290/gta-6-a-wersja-pudelkowa-sprzedawcy-zwiastuja-smutna-wiadomosc-dla-fanow-fizycznych-wydan.html">PPE.pl</a>, is “hearing more and more that the physical version won’t be released simultaneously with the digital version to prevent leaks.” This person has previously leaked details on the physical version of <em>Oblivion Remastered</em>, so it’s possible there’s something to this rumor. And seeing as how every game that does have a physical release these days does appear to end up leaking early, I wouldn’t put it past Rockstar to try a different approach.</p>

 <p>At the same time,<em> GTA 6</em> is the&nbsp;<em>one</em> game that will bring random people in off the street asking for a physical copy, so I’m skeptical that combating leaks, which won’t hurt the game’s hype in the slightest, is enough of a reason to potentially endanger those sales.</p> <h2>You can now play<em> Super Monkey Ball</em> inside your web browser</h2>   <p>It’s really that simple.
