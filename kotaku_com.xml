              <p>The never-ending mission to port <a href="https://kotaku.com/its-2021-and-bethesda-has-announced-another-skyrim-port-1847521204"><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> to every possible platform continues</a>. This time, Bethesda has announced that the popular open-world RPG is getting a Switch 2 release. And you don’t have to wait long, as this new port of <em>Skyrim</em> is available now, and is free for previous owners of the game’s Anniversary Edition on Switch.</p> <p>On December 9, Bethesda released a trailer for the Nintendo Switch 2 edition of its <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-rogue-bee-kept-breaking-skyrims-iconic-cart-intro-1847504734">classic 2011 RPG, <em>Skyrim</em></a>. And yup, that sure looks like <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em>, a game that feels like it has always been a part of my life and which is visually aging worse than I expected.</p>

  <p>If you already own the Switch version of <em>Skyrim Anniversary Edition</em>, you can download the Switch 2 version for free. If instead you own the older, non-Anniversary Edition version of <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch (yes, there are multiple versions of the game on most platforms now), you’ll need to pay $20 to upgrade.</p>

 <p>So what do you get in this new version of <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2?<a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/fGtFCgI7J9FL3l6oi9j3B/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition-out-now-on-nintendo-switch-2"> Well, Bethesda claims</a> that its popular RPG loads faster and has better performance on Nintendo’s new console when compared to how it ran on the OG Switch. It also boasts enhanced resolution and DLSS anti-aliasing. And yes, it supports Switch 2 mouse controls, motion controls, and Amiibo, and features the old <em>Legend of Zelda</em> exclusive cosmetic DLC seen in the old Switch port.</p> <p>Did the world need yet another way to play <em>Skyrim</em> in 2025? Probably not. But I bet this is going to sell really well, and I can’t wait to write about Skyr<em>i</em>m being ported to the PlayStation 6 in a few years. Meanwhile, we’ll still get to play <em>The </em><em>Elder Scrolls 6…</em>eventually.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-is-clearly-taking-no-margin-on-its-nano-power-bank-as-it-returns-at-its-lowest-price-for-the-holidays-2000649289</link>
            <guid>1377229</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday are officially behind us. It was a week-long celebration of discounts and offers across every category you could possibly think of. Missed grabbing something? Don’t worry. There are new deals for holidays.</p>
<p>Apple users still looking to treat themselves to a reliable power solution without the typical cable mess should consider grabbing the ultra-slim. 5,000mAh Anker Nano power bank. I<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6310/">t usually retails for $55, but thanks to Amazon holiday deal, you can snap it up for just $41 right now, but only if you act fast.</a> The discount applies to all color options, so you can pick the one that complements your phone. Got an iPhone 16 in the stunning Desert Titanium? Go for the golden or the classic black version. Have an all-black model? Add some pop of color to it with the white or green power bank! Be sure to nab the deal quick, as these leftover discounts expire soon. We’re not expecting these to last more than a few more hours.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6310/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Attaches to Your Phone, Plus Supports Wired Charging</h2>
<p>It’s (mainly) a wireless power bank, featuring an ultra-slim design. At just 0.3 inches thin, it supports Qi2 certification and snaps at the back of your phone to deliver power on the go. Its 15W output is enough to juice your device up without waiting too long. You can expect an iPhone 16 Pro to go from 0 to 25% in just over 40 minutes. We won’t exactly label it as “ultra-fast”, but considering how it becomes a part of your phone and doesn’t make you feel like you’re carrying an extra accessory when out and about, it’s not too bad. The bulky versions offering better speeds are heavier and a bit inconvenient to carry around, so if ease of use and portability are what you’re after, it’s worth it.</p>
<p>Charging may stop automatically when your phone hits 80%, to preserve the battery and prevent overheating. Once your device cools down, the power bank gets back to work. To get you the best of both worlds, it also supports USB-C fast charging, which can get an iPhone 17 from 0 to 25% in 35 minutes. Recharging the power bank itself won’t take forever either. It’s capable of hitting 100% in just under two hours.</p>



<p>Reliability comes from graphene cooling, dual NTC chips, and smart heat control that Anker has packed it with. It says under 104°F, which is 14 degrees cooler than the industry standard for safer charging. Compatibility-wise, it plays nicely with iPhone Series 12 through 17. It won’t work with an iPhone 16e or iPhone SE Series, though. Best of all, you can even top your AirPods using the charger; great for non-stop jamming on the road. The box comes with the power bank itself, USB-C to USB-C charging cable, welcome guide, and a 24-month warranty for some extra peace of mind.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking for a reliable, fuss-free charging solution that’s super easy to carry around, this Anker Nano power bank offers all that and more. It becomes a part of your phone to provide it the power it needs, plus supports wired charging for when you want to prioritize speeds. This deal brings its price down to just $41, but it expires soon. It was a part of the Amazon’s holiday deals, the discount won’t be around for long either. Act fast before that happens!</p>

              <p>With there being little sign of the&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771"><em>Pokémon TCG&nbsp;</em>bubble</a> bursting any time soon, and many <em>Pokémon </em> cards literally worth more than their weight in gold, it’s becoming all too normal to hear stories of thieves breaking into stores and stealing the shiny cardboard. A particularly audacious example happened in California this weekend, where around $100,000 worth of cards were stolen by a masked gang in a matter of minutes—a gang who could well be responsible for a number of other similar crimes.</p> <p>As reported by local LA station <a href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/burglars-ransack-burbank-card-shop-steal-100000-worth-of-rare-trading-cards/"><em>KTLA 5</em></a>&nbsp;(thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-thieves-steal-cards-worth-100000-in-latest-californian-store-heist"><em>IGN</em></a>), a group of burglars were filmed on CCTV breaking into the Burbank card shop and making off with armfuls of <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>cards. The implication from store owner Kiet Nguyen’s description of the footage is that the team seem very experienced, getting in and out of the store in just a couple of minutes, seemingly knowing exactly what they wanted to take.</p>

 <p>“They tip over and smash a glass display case to grab its contents,” Nguyen told <em>KTLA</em>. “Moments later, they’re seen carrying three large bags filled with stolen goods to an awaiting getaway car. The vast majority, they were targeting <em>Pokémon</em> cards. They inadvertently took some lock boxes from the back that also had [rare] sports cards.”</p>

 <p><em>KTLA</em> goes on to report that the police suspect this particular gang of three could be responsible for a number of similar card shop break-ins around Southern California, not least because this particular burglary seemed so practiced.</p> <p>It’s not an exaggeration about the price of gold thing, by the way. I just looked it up; the average <em>Pokémon </em>card weighs just under two grams, and the same weight in gold is currently worth around $270. The Mega Charizard X ex SIR in <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-phantasmal-flames-charizard-chase-card-2000645074">the current Phantasmal Flames set</a> is currently selling for $600, while new sealed product sells on resale markets for at least twice its MSRP. Meanwhile, a sealed booster box of 2021’s Evolving Skies currently sells for $2,350, some&nbsp;<em>eighteen</em> times the original store price.</p>

 <p>This is not only making <em>Pokémon</em> cards close to impossible for regular fans to buy or even find on sale, but also making the product increasingly high-risk for stores given the suddenly ballooning value of their stocks. Nguyen had thought his Burbank store to be well protected in a safe area, saying that he believed, with his multiple layers of security, “the deterrents were good enough.” Sadly not.</p> <p>Clearly, given the incentives and ease with which stolen sealed product and non-graded cards can be resold, breaking into a card shop is now a more lucrative crime than breaking into a jewelry store, with less protection likely to be in place, but a far easier time grabbing the equally valuable loot.</p>

Well, if you play </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-overwatch-2-vendetta-magik-rip-off-react-2000646220"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i></a><span>, you’re probably about to hear it a whole lot more, as the game is adding a “6-7” emote to the hero shooter as it continues to chase </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-carter-wu-homer-simpson-nipples-skins-shirtless-2000650650"><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> pop culture conglomerate status.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6-7_(meme)"><span>“6-7” meme</span></a><span> is tough to describe because the joke is that it doesn’t really mean anything. It started as a repeated phrase in video edits about tall basketball players, then became associated with a pseudo-shrugging motion after a video of a kid saying it </span><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/trends/2025/10/21/six-seven-meme-gen-alpha/"><span>while doing one went viral</span></a><span>. It is functionally meaningless; kids are just saying it. And now, Soldier: 76 will be saying it too in </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>matches starting later today.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">To celebrate the meme officially dissolving into nothingness, let’s see your best 6️⃣7️⃣ clips when the emote drops tomorrow! <a href="https://t.co/di3L8uxh17">pic.twitter.com/di3L8uxh17</a></p> <p>— Overwatch (@PlayOverwatch) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1998169279795974371?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>I am a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-pride-month-parade-soldier-76-vincent-skin-1851785385"><span>Soldier: 76 main</span></a><span>, and seeing my grumpy gay grandpa performing memes in an obvious play for memetic virality from Blizzard is such a bummer. </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> keeps moving away from its own world in favor of using collaboration skins to chase the kind of crossover slop </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>has long been associated with, and while this addition isn’t a reference to another franchise, it is one of the most overt nods the game has ever made to a specific pop culture fad, and if Soldier actually says “6-7” when he uses the emote, as is implied in this video, it’s something that players can’t really ignore because players are absolutely going to spam this shit in the spawn room.</span></p> <p><span>I wish I didn’t have to dunk on </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>this much because I do think the game is in the best state it’s been in since the sequel’s fumbled launch in 2022. Blizzard has reinvigorated the shooter with its build-based Stadium mode, the Perks system that lets you customize your playstyle on the fly, and some really interesting new heroes like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-vendetta-reveal-trailer-cinematic-video-2000644926"><span>Vendetta</span></a><span> and Wuyang, but man, I don’t think I’ll ever get over the team </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-pve-canceled-campaign-null-sector-2000641177"><span>sanding away </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s world</span></a><span> in favor of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-persona-5-ryuji-junkrat-genji-futaba-dva-2000626027"><span>endless crossovers</span></a><span>, and now memes.

            <title><![CDATA[Kirby Air Riders: The Kotaku Review]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-review-switch-sakurai-2000651657</link>
            <guid>1377094</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>Shake </span><i><span>Kirby Air Riders</span></i><span> up in a two-liter bottle and crack it open over my face. A blast of color, speed, and delightful nonsense confront my senses at 200 miles per hour. This is a game in such a rush it will have you craving a dedicated acceleration button—like every other racing game—just so you can choose not to press it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>And under its sugary waterfall of selectable characters, meaningfully different vehicles, distinct game modes, and endless permutations of stat-boosting power-ups, the game tries to seduce you into believing it must be substantial. How could something with this many moving parts not be?&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s the same confidence you get from a Snickers commercial: all those layers, the caramel stretch, the peanuts tumbling in slow motion, the cross-section of nougat and chocolate shown off like a slice of Earth itself. “Snickers really satisfies,” they say, and for a moment you might believe it can take the place of a meal.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But it can’t. And we shouldn’t pretend it can. </span><i><span>Kirby Air Riders</span></i><span> is not deep; it’s candy. Good thing I like candy.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Whether you’re playing the standard race mode, Air Ride, or pinballing through the labyrinthian city of City Trial, the same thing becomes clear almost immediately: this game is an absolute delight in the moment. Rick the Hamster zooms past me like he’s running the most important errands of his life. King Dedede launches himself at enemies like they owe him rent.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Vehicles vary wildly. Some soar through the sky with an ease that feels like cheating. Some never leave the ground and exist solely to plow through anything unlucky enough to be in the way. One machine refuses to turn unless you come to a complete stop and pivot it like a couch wedged in a stairwell with rockets glued to its cushions. You pick a ride, angle your landings, follow another racer’s star trail for a boost. You are making decisions—just not always at the pace the game makes them for you.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Air Ride</span></i><span>’s endless forward propulsion means half the race is happening before you can even consciously participate in it. You slam into enemies you didn’t intend to hit, scoop up items you didn’t know existed, and cross the finish line because your momentum got you there five seconds before your intentions did. The tracks don’t present information so much as hurl it at you like a piñata detonating point-blank. Walls, enemies, items, other racers all fizz past faster than your brain can sort them. At times, I have no sense that I’m competing with other racers at all—just running my own little Kirby marathon and hoping the game taps me on the shoulder afterward and says, “Yeah, sure, you did it!”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000651659" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651659"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651659">© Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>City Trial should be the moment all this chaos finally gels into structure. Five minutes in a sprawling city full of crates, pickups, random events, and machines parked like abandoned shopping carts: it sounds like the place where all your choices might finally matter. The mode where the candy bar reveals its hidden protein. In practice, however, I’m mostly just sprinting toward whatever glowing object catches my eye like a foaming-mouthed raccoon loose in an arcade.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Every run starts the same way: I spawn, immediately spot some sweet nectar in the form of a giant stat icon, and chase it without a second thought. I crack open crates for upgrades I may or may not need the way I once tore open packs of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> cards. I swap vehicles entirely on impulse: Do I want to bulldoze players with a bruiser or sprint around scooping up gold? Some of the best moments happen when I accidentally fly into an item that arms my ride with a bazooka while another player is in view. It all feels impulsive and reactive—less like strategy and more like a string of magnificently sweet accidents.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Then the timer expires, and City Trial’s other half reveals itself.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>No matter what I’ve built—speed freak, flight savant, combat gremlin—the final Stadium event always comes down to choosing the challenge that flatters whatever numbers I’ve stumbled into. End up with a flying machine? Pick “soar as far as possible.” Stuck with the brick with a steering wheel? Smash into things. It’s not strategy; it’s choosing the activity that best matches the outfit you accidentally showed up in.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>What makes it stranger is that everyone is making this same calculation at the same time. We all wander off into finales tailored to our own careless smoothies of a build. My friend and I can spend five minutes in the same City Trial, diverge into completely different Stadium events, and both walk away clutching first-place trophies like we attended different sporting events at the same festival. The victory is immediately fleeting for any player who forgets to tap the screenshot button.</span></p>

 <p><span>I say fleeting because the game barely acknowledges any of it. Your character enthusiastically devours the center of the frame while a tiny scoreboard off to the side reveals the truth—another moment swallowed up without a thought, just one more sugar-coated delight Kirby inhales before moving on to the next.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>His appetite is insatiable.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Mine is not.</span></p> <p><span>Kirby can swallow moments whole without worrying about what comes after; I start noticing the repetition long before he would. And City Trial, for all its clippable glory, reveals its limits fast. The same sprint toward giant icons, the same bullying of whoever pinballed into my crosshairs. Matches blend together like different colors of M&amp;Ms. If I experience “chaos” the exact same way every run, is it even chaos anymore? No. It’s just candy.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>After hours of trying to taste a fire hose of content sprayed into my face, Top Ride is the first mode that politely hands me a plate and asks if I’d like to really appreciate what’s happening. Top Ride looks, at first glance, like the kind of small bonus mode many players might never click on. But in practice, it’s a compelling part of </span><i><span>Air Riders</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It reveals that the chaos in the other modes was never incomprehensible. It was just loud. </span><i><span>Air Riders</span></i><span> throws so much flashy information at you that it tricks you into feeling overwhelmed, even though most of that information is negligible. Top Ride simply pulls the camera back and proves it. With a little distance, everything becomes legible.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000651662" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651662"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651662">© Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Unlike other modes, in Top Ride you see every racer at once. Cause and effect—usually buried under spectacle—becomes clear. Misjudge a drift and you feel the punishment instantly. Take a cleaner line and you watch yourself gain ground in real time. It still uses the same propulsion-based movement as the rest of </span><i><span>Air Riders</span></i><span>, but now the information arrives at a pace a human being can actually process. And with that clarity comes something the rest of the game rarely offers: the feeling that I can learn, improve, and shape the next round through actual decision-making rather than chaos washing over me.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Road Trip attempts to congeal a sampler platter of the same short Stadium games from the other modes into a single-player roguelike. Every mini-game leads to a stat boost, but in all my runs, the boosts ramped up so evenly that the joy of creating a specific build surrendered to an experience where every number simply climbed at once. The choices don’t give way to branching paths so much as gently funnel toward an eventual victory over CPU opponents that never stood a chance.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Every so often Road Trip rewards players with a treat: a cinematic cutscene featuring production values that far exceed what the mode prepares you for. The sheer melodrama might seduce you into believing the story here is mysterious and chaotic, but it’s really just a simple storybook tale of good versus evil. Charming, fun, and no more than a little treat.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Air Riders</span></i><span> also comes bundled with a customization suite that lets players decorate their own machines with decals and silly hats. The most-downloaded creation online briefly included a Warp Star made to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-custom-vehicle-designs-market-best-2000645836"><span>look like Chef Kawasaki in a bikini</span></a><span>.

But the same shaken-soda-stream intensity that defines </span><i><span>Air Riders</span></i><span> ensures that every lovingly crafted custom machine becomes a blur the instant the race begins. Characters are tiny. Other players appear for a moment and vanish. I have never once noticed a custom ride in actual play, and I fear my SpongeBob machine reads only as a yellow-ish blur online.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>There is undeniable craftsmanship at play here: laughs alongside Rick the Hamster in a cowboy hat, peaks of excitement when Knuckle Joe lands a knockout uppercut on that winged freak Marx. But </span><i><span>Kirby Air Riders</span></i><span> is not deep. It’s not substantial. It’s never going to become the hearty dinner its curated clips or indulgent Nintendo Directs want you to believe it might be. Kirby, the godly creature that he is, can inhale an entire match and waddle straight into the next challenge without once wondering what he just ate. I can enjoy the rush, but I can’t live inside it like him. After an hour or two, the buzz wears off, the repetition settles in, and I’m left wanting something that lets skill accumulate or understanding compound instead of just teaching me to parse the screen more efficiently.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>After enough hours with it, I’ve learned to stop waiting for the game to transform into a meal and to simply enjoy the carbonated geyser it actually is.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-review-switch-sakurai-2000651657]]></content:encoded>
