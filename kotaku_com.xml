              <p>It’s fair to say that Nintendo’s had a pretty good few months. After just four days, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-sales-fastest-selling-console-ever-1851784293">the Switch 2 had sold 3.5 million units</a>, making it the most successful console launch of all time. <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801e.pdf">Nintendo is now reporting</a> it sold just shy of six million Switch 2s in the system’s first month, along with 8.6 million games. Of those, an incredible 5.63 million are copies of<em> Mario Kart World</em>. Alongside that, the console company still sold a million new Switch 1s in three months, and over 24 million games for that system. All told, from April to June, the company made sales of 572 billion yen, or $3.8 billion. It’s good to be Nintendo right now.</p> <p>All those numbers take us up to the end of June, meaning there’s actually a whole other month of as-yet unreported Switch 2 sales to take into account, meaning that number is likely closer (by our estimate) to eight million, ahead of Nintendo’s expectations, and well on the way to the company’s goal of 15 million units by March 2026. And don’t forget, they’ve got 2025’s holiday season to come before then.</p> <p>Interestingly, digital sales were down over 13 percent on the same quarter last year, which Nintendo attributes to, er, “a decrease in sales of downloadable versions of packaged software.” Well, yeah, selling fewer digital games would certain explain the lower sales of digital games. Piercing insight. There was also a drop in what Nintendo calls “IP related business,” down 4.4 percent, which is explained by “a decrease in movie-related revenue.” That’s actually a pretty impressively small drop, given it’s two years since&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> was released.</p>

 <p><em>Mario Kart World</em>‘s sales of almost six million, in large part a consequence of the game being offered as a bundle with the Switch 2 itself, make it the most successful <em>Mario Kart</em> launch ever–that’s pretty stunning given there was no previously established userbase for the console. For context,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart Wii</em> launched two years after the Wii came out, and sold an estimated 4.7 million copies in its first four months. <em>Mario Kart 7</em> was limited by the low sales of the 3DS, but <em>Mario Kart 8</em> had the reverse effect, causing people to finally buy the unloved Wii U, selling nearly 3 million copies in its first month. However, it only reached 8.5 million lifetime sales. <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</em>on the Switch is still the big leader, with astonishing lifetime sales of over 64 million copies, but even that was slower out of the gates than <em>Mario Kart World</em>. That game took a year to get to nine million copies, meaning&nbsp;<em>World</em> is well on its way to smashing that number.</p> <p>It’s notable that given 5.82 million Switch 2s have been sold (and that’s sold to real people, rather than just shipped to stores), and 5.63 million copies of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, that the game is almost ubiquitous among the console owners. That means people who didn’t opt for–or were unable to buy–the bundle have been buying a separate copy anyway. Yes, fair enough, it’s not like people were spoiled for choice when the Switch 2 launched, but it remains a remarkable number. It’ll be fascinating to see how&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> has sold, and even more fascinating to visit the alternate reality where Nintendo had that game ready for launch.</p>

              <p>The Nintendo Switch <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-zelda-botw-anniversary-1851767489">is over eight years old</a>. It’s never seen a price cut during that time. And now it’s actually about to get <em>more</em> expensive. On Friday, the<em> Mario</em> maker warned customers that the older gaming consoles and their accessories will see price changes in the U.S. “based on market conditions.”</p> <p>Video game consoles are supposed to get cheaper as time goes on, but this console generation has bucked that trend entirely. <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-price-increase-may-2025-1851778615">The PS5 and Xbox Series X/S</a> are all more expensive now than when they launched, and the Switch is about to join them. And update on Nintendo’s website says the Switch ($300), Switch Lite ($200), and Switch OLED ($350) will all be impacted, but the Switch 2 ($450) will remain unchanged…for now. Its accessories, on the other hand, are also getting more expensive (<a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-united-states-tariffs-price-1851776753">the second price hike this year</a>).</p> <p>Here’s the full statement:</p> <div> <blockquote> <p>Pricing for the original&nbsp;<span>Nintendo Switch</span>&nbsp;family of systems and products will change in the United States based on market conditions, effective August 3, 2025. These include Nintendo Switch – OLED Model, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch Lite and select Nintendo Switch accessories.</p> </blockquote> </div> <blockquote> <p>Other Nintendo products, including certain Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, select amiibo, and the Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo, will also see adjustments.</p> </blockquote> <div> <blockquote> <p>Pricing for the&nbsp;<span>Nintendo Switch 2</span>&nbsp;system, physical and digital Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 games, as well as Nintendo Switch Online memberships, will remain unchanged at this time. However, please note that price adjustments may be necessary in the future.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p>Nintendo isn’t revealing what the actual price changes are yet. It’s also not blaming <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-pro-game-console-prices-tariffs-report-1851779765">President Trump’s trade war</a> directly, but increased tariffs on imports into the U.S. are no doubt partly to blame. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/further-modifying-the-reciprocal-tariff-rates/">The most recent update from the White House lists</a> import taxes of 20 percent on Vietnam, 30 percent on China, and 15 percent on Japan. Depending on just how much more expensive the old Switch consoles become, it could make upgrading to the Switch 2 instead that much more appealing this fall. At least until that also gets more expensive. The company makes clear that more “price adjustments,” i.e. “price increases,” are on the table moving forward.</p>
