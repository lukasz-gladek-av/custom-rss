But exciting.” </p><p>The <em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em> director added that his goal with <em>Badlands </em>was to “find another essential piece of cinema that does what <em>Prey</em> did spiritually — pushing the franchise’s boundaries, letting us root for a hero we rarely get to root for — but in a different way.” According to the director, that led to this “big idea” to get the audience “rooting for the Predator<em>.</em>”</p><p>Meanwhile,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/predator-prey-2-badlands-secret-movie-animated-hulu-1851681811?_gl=1*ygtn2d*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTY5OTEwMC4xMTcuMS4xNzMxNjk5MjAzLjM1LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/predator-prey-2-badlands-secret-movie-animated-hulu-1851681811?_gl=1*ygtn2d*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTY5OTEwMC4xMTcuMS4xNzMxNjk5MjAzLjM1LjAuMA.."> we are also getting <em>another </em>Predator movie from Trachtenberg</a></span>.

Not only is the narrative exciting, but the missions vary quite a lot and give you plenty of options for how to accomplish objectives.

Compared to how much you usually get from a mission, the extra cash is certainly worth it. Whether you want an extra edge in the campaign or just can’t get past the related puzzles inside the base, we’ve got you covered with a breakdown for each safe. </p><h2 id="h79579"><a id=""></a>How to Open Safes in Black Ops 6</h2><p><strong>Each campaign safe has two vital aspects: the location of the safe itself and a radio that can transmit the code to open the former.</strong> You’re likely to find the radio first, as a message will pop up in the middle of the screen to inform you when there’s a signal nearby.</p><p>Interacting with the radio will start a frequency-tuning minigame. You’ll need to use the sticks on your controller to modify one frequency wavelength to match another. Successfully doing this will cause the radio to start repeating the four-digit code needed to open that mission’s safe. </p><p><strong>It is worth pointing out that these codes are random.</strong> That means no skipping a step and aiming straight for the prize – you need to find the code first. Fortunately, the safes and radios are near each other, and typically they’ll even be in the same room. We’ll be providing the locations for both.</p><h2 id="h79580"><a id="safehouse"></a>How to Open the Safehouse Safe</h2><figure id="" data-id="5d4f0497af6cab5539d07e94b46a180c" data-recommend-id="image://5d4f0497af6cab5539d07e94b46a180c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows machinery inside a boiler room with multiple valves, one of which is labeled as “Fuel”." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows machinery inside a boiler room with multiple valves, one of which is labeled as “Fuel”." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microsoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5d4f0497af6cab5539d07e94b46a180c" data-recommend-id="image://5d4f0497af6cab5539d07e94b46a180c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows machinery inside a boiler room with multiple valves, one of which is labeled as “Fuel”." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Opening every campaign safe isn’t too difficult, as a majority just require you to find their location. The biggest outlier to this is the one inside The Rook safehouse. <strong>Although you can find the safe easily enough on the second floor, the code is hidden behind six puzzles.</strong> These can be tackled whenever you’re at The Rook between missions, so feel free to unlock this safe first or last.</p><p>The first puzzle to solve involves the generator inside the Boiler Room. When facing the central area that the Evidence Board is in, look a little to your right to see a thin hallway. Immediately on the hallway’s right side will be a door leading downstairs to a basement and an attached boiler room. You can adjust the generator using the Fuel valve, a Boiler valve, and a Pilot dial. Here are the steps to take:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Turn the Boiler valve twice.</li><li>Turn the Fuel valve once.</li><li>Turn the Pilot dial once.</li><li>Turn the Boiler valve twice again.</li></ul><figure id="" data-id="08610ecff4c35701a7a4a080c794124a" data-recommend-id="image://08610ecff4c35701a7a4a080c794124a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A purple light is beamed at a wall, revealing a message saying “2 PE” and an arrow next to it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A purple light is beamed at a wall, revealing a message saying “2 PE” and an arrow next to it." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microsoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="08610ecff4c35701a7a4a080c794124a" data-recommend-id="image://08610ecff4c35701a7a4a080c794124a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A purple light is beamed at a wall, revealing a message saying “2 PE” and an arrow next to it." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This will unlock a door, but we’ll get to that once the Piano puzzle is solved. Go back upstairs and head into the room on the other side of the central area. Pick up the Blacklight that’s pointing toward the piano. <strong>You’ll be able to use this in the safehouse by pressing left on the D-pad as well as during puzzles by pressing X for Xbox or Square for PlayStation.</strong></p><p>Look around the room with the blacklight to find five different notations with numbers next to them. Interact with the piano and toggle the blacklight to find a series of notations above the keys. The following keys need to be played in order:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Mи </li><li>Pe </li><li>Cи </li><li>До </li><li>Pe</li></ul><figure id="" data-id="ddcfed0d3db16d9b6229d7def0a8f827" data-recommend-id="image://ddcfed0d3db16d9b6229d7def0a8f827" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A keypad is displayed next to a Decryption Log that tracks the potentially correct code." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A keypad is displayed next to a Decryption Log that tracks the potentially correct code." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microsoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ddcfed0d3db16d9b6229d7def0a8f827" data-recommend-id="image://ddcfed0d3db16d9b6229d7def0a8f827" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A keypad is displayed next to a Decryption Log that tracks the potentially correct code." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Some of the wood paneling next to the piano will swing open, revealing the entrance to a secret bunker. Remember that generator you turned on earlier? It unlocked the door at the bottom of these stairs. Go through it, walk down the hallway, and then take your first right to find a door with a keypad. This will start a common puzzle that can be found in the campaign. The code is random each time, so you will need to solve this.</p><p>Interact with the keypad and use the blacklight to see which buttons were used the most. <strong>Those with a bright fingerprint on them are part of the code, while any with multiple fingerprints means that it shows up more than once.</strong> You’ll be able to tell if the number is correct, in the wrong location, or not used at all.</p><figure id="" data-id="6983cee671438e69c165660ec8bd7130" data-recommend-id="image://6983cee671438e69c165660ec8bd7130" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A yellow-colored computer program displays a cipher that uses numbers to mask hidden words." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A yellow-colored computer program displays a cipher that uses numbers to mask hidden words." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microsoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6983cee671438e69c165660ec8bd7130" data-recommend-id="image://6983cee671438e69c165660ec8bd7130" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A yellow-colored computer program displays a cipher that uses numbers to mask hidden words." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Go through the unlocked door and then circle around the room until you find a computer. Interact with it to start a cipher puzzle, another recurring one throughout the campaign. All you need to do is use the cipher at the bottom to sort out the correct letters. The order will be random, but they’ll always be the following four words:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Bunker</li><li>Holding</li><li>Room</li><li>Open</li></ul><p>With this solved, exit out of the room and take a right down the hallway. The door on the left side will be open just ajar. Walk through it and then go to the door straight across to start a simple lockpicking minigame. Slowly rotate the lock pick with the right stick until each pin is lifted. Walk inside the torture room and grab the key on the small table.</p><figure id="" data-id="6ff2fd3a40085430c67818cafd759a4f" data-recommend-id="image://6ff2fd3a40085430c67818cafd759a4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player listens to a looping voice message while shining a blacklight against the room walls, revealing numbers painted on objects." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player listens to a looping voice message while shining a blacklight against the room walls, revealing numbers painted on objects." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microsoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6ff2fd3a40085430c67818cafd759a4f" data-recommend-id="image://6ff2fd3a40085430c67818cafd759a4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player listens to a looping voice message while shining a blacklight against the room walls, revealing numbers painted on objects." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Head back towards the hallway with the keypad door, but turn right to go across from it. Open the sole door on the left to discover the final puzzle, which involves tuning the frequency of a radio. Instead of directly revealing the safe code numbers as it does for all other safes, it will start repeating a random set of phrases.</p><p>I highly suggest writing down what the radio says. <strong>Specific keywords in these phrases relate to objects around the room. Turning on the blacklight and scanning the room will reveal various numbers next to the objects.</strong> It’s completely random which phrases you’ll hear and numbers can be associated with multiple things.</p><p>Once you have a decent idea for what the code could be (or at least know three of them so you can brute force the last one), go back to the first floor. Leave the piano room, walk past the main area, and enter the room with the front door. Walk up the stairs to the second floor and make two lefts.</p><figure id="" data-id="ed97bb1edbd5d4313df2c29aba0fa568" data-recommend-id="image://ed97bb1edbd5d4313df2c29aba0fa568" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An open safe is laid on the floor, while a weapon skin blueprint notification pops up on the right side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An open safe is laid on the floor, while a weapon skin blueprint notification pops up on the right side." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microsoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ed97bb1edbd5d4313df2c29aba0fa568" data-recommend-id="image://ed97bb1edbd5d4313df2c29aba0fa568" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An open safe is laid on the floor, while a weapon skin blueprint notification pops up on the right side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Open the door to Adler’s bedroom and then turn left to find the safe.

It will take a bit of time to reach it, as it’s available in the second half when you visit Chateau de la Haute Lune. There are a few options for how to enter, but to find this safe quickly I recommend going to the left side of the building. You’ll see a stack of boxes and a white van that are just right for jumping on. Above them will be a ledge you can climb over and a ventilation shaft leading inside.</p><p>Crawl through the vents and then take a right. <strong>Keep going until you find yourself above a room with two guards talking.</strong> Remove the grate and take them out, preferably without making a lot of noise. Drop down and look toward the sole door in the room to find the radio. The safe is meanwhile right next to the center desk and beneath a whiteboard.</p><h2 id="h79582"><a id=""></a>Where to find Most Wanted Safe</h2><figure id="" data-id="e71c62e360ec0404c83261f4caa44680" data-recommend-id="image://e71c62e360ec0404c83261f4caa44680" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt=" While viewing red and yellow curtains, notifications display to inform the player that they’re in a restricted area and have a medium-strength signal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt=" While viewing red and yellow curtains, notifications display to inform the player that they’re in a restricted area and have a medium-strength signal." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microsoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e71c62e360ec0404c83261f4caa44680" data-recommend-id="image://e71c62e360ec0404c83261f4caa44680" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt=" While viewing red and yellow curtains, notifications display to inform the player that they’re in a restricted area and have a medium-strength signal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It won’t take very long to find the safe in Most Wanted.

That means you’ll need to charge your Ki to its maximum and beyond at the cost of a skill count. <strong>Once you’ve entered Sparking!, use a Dragon Dash (RT+A for Xbox and R2+Cross for PlayStation) and then press the Guard button (RB or R1).</strong> Your character will quickly start vanishing left and right with little recovery time. Keep on pressing the button and they’ll look like they’re flickering across the stage.</p><p>You’ll mainly want to use this to dodge supers or Ultimate Blasts. With the right timing, you can even avoid supers with the most annoyingly perfect tracking. It won’t be as useful against obscenely large attacks such as a Spirit Bomb though.</p><p>Not everyone on the roster can use Super Movement. Larger characters like Toppo and Broly, in addition to giants like Great Ape Vegeta and Janemba, simply don’t have access to the technique. The lines do get a bit blurred when it comes to different forms, as Jiren normally can’t use Super Movement, but his Full Power version can. I was lucky to figure that out while unlocking his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-jiren-endings-guide-1851680142&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-jiren-endings-guide-1851680142">confusing endings</a></span>, but figuring it out for most other characters will just be trial and error.</p><h2 id="h87160"><a id=""></a>Don’t Mash – Use Super Movement Sparingly</h2><p>The biggest piece of advice I can give regarding this technique is to not overdo it. Yes, I completely agree that spamming it and seeing your character zip across the screen looks awesome! Unfortunately, there are some pretty big downsides to doing this:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Super Movement drains your Ki, typically around a quarter of a bar. With the Ki gauge already depleting in Sparking! and Super Movement costing a bar with just a few uses, it’s easy to waste your limited time in this high-powered state.</li><li>Your character won’t be moving around randomly – there is a pattern. Super Movement has you quickly swaying from side to side. This doesn’t mean the opponent will be able to easily hit you, but it is possible to dodge and then zip right back into a rush super or beam attack.</li><li>The technique will typically track toward your opponent. It’s pretty great for quickly converting from one direction back to the enemy, but sometimes it’s too quick for the camera to keep up. This is especially notable when using Super Movement with the stick pushed to the side, as the camera will struggle to stay focused on you.</li></ul><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-rush-super-landing-guide-1851673589&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-rush-super-landing-guide-1851673589"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s Rush Supers Can Be A Super-Rush Once Mastered</a></span></p><p><strong>As cool as it looks, I strongly suggest performing Super Movement only once or maybe twice at a time.</strong> It only takes one well-timed use to dodge a super or ultimate blast. The only reason to spam it a little is if you’re dashing straight to your opponent and want to freak them out a bit. It can look pretty intimidating when someone is zigzagging at high speeds in your direction.</p><h2 id="h87161"><a id=""></a>Consider Some Ability Items</h2><figure id="" data-id="e918ec1386b894e4e9fe390100f3862b" data-recommend-id="image://e918ec1386b894e4e9fe390100f3862b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Ability Items tab in the Shop menu, with The Secret to Super Movements item highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Ability Items tab in the Shop menu, with The Secret to Super Movements item highlighted." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e918ec1386b894e4e9fe390100f3862b" data-recommend-id="image://e918ec1386b894e4e9fe390100f3862b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Ability Items tab in the Shop menu, with The Secret to Super Movements item highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Being careful with Super Movement isn’t the only tip we’re sharing. If you need extra leeway to work around Super Movement’s limitations, or maybe just want to flex with it more, you might want to consider making room for some choice Ability Items.</p><p>The primary issue we want to treat with these is how much the technique drains your Ki. In addition to general Ability Items that help conserve Ki, some specifically work with Super Movement. Here are the ones to look out for:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The Secret to Super Movements – Reduces the cost of Super Movements for the Sparking! Gauge.</li><li>The Secret to Dragon Dashes – Reduces the Ki needed for Dragon Dashes.</li><li>Style of the Strong – Sparking! Mode lasts longer.</li><li>Dragon Heart - Increases Skill Count after dodging a Blast or Ultimate Blast with a High-Speed Movement.</li></ul><p>Super Movement is certainly one of the more niche mechanics in <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>, with plenty writing it off as being useless. While many are rightfully sad that spamming can be detrimental, you can benefit from mastering this. It’s still obscure enough that you can scare or confuse the hell out of someone online using it. Plus, I can confidently say that nothing has felt as cool as dodging a beam super and flying alongside it to deliver a beat down. It gives big power level energy and we should all be here for it. </p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
