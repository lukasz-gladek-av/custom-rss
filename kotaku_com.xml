              <p>Last week,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-1-5-changes-censorship-game-pass-steam-2000617865"><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> received a very controversial update</a> that made major changes to the Soulslike game, rendering multiple bosses impossible to kill, and formerly antagonistic characters into BFFs. The 1.5 update was seemingly a response to a negative reaction to the game’s reception in China, but this caused a whole other backlash in the rest of the world, seeing the game review-bombed on Steam. But over the weekend a fan-made mod has been released that will roll your Steam version of the game back to version 1.4.</p> <p>The whole situation of&nbsp;<em>Wuchang</em> is a peculiar one. Soulslikes are very big business in China, and games like&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> from Chinese developer Game Science celebrate Chinese mythology while gaining tacit approval from the Chinese state. However, <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, despite coming from Chinese developer Leenzee and clearly attempting a similar exploration of Chinese history, has fallen foul of public reception at home. The representation of various historical figures of the Ming dynasty, but not then including condemnation of the subsequent Qing dynasty, has been seen as inaccurate or disrespectful by some, and as such Leenzee updated the game to address these perceived issues, both changing how boss fights play out, and significantly affecting the later states of the game where far fewer characters will attack you. Thus, the enormous backlash. Well, the second backlash, after the game went through its first round of negative reviews <a href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feather-soulslike-pc-performance-patch-1851786948">due to performance issues on PC</a>.</p> <p>It’s very hard to appreciate the situation a Chinese developer will find itself, given the need for state approval to be able to sell a game, while their story stepped on controversial toes far less appreciable outside of the country. My understanding of the situation is rudimentary, but it appears analogous with the ongoing issues in the U.S. regarding how its history is represented, especially when it comes to race. With growing discontent surrounding the game in China, there would have been enormous pressure to make these changes, no matter how much the wider world might disapprove. It’s very much a rock and hard-place scenario for Leenzee.</p>

 <p>However, for those playing the game on Steam, there’s now a solution. The <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/213?tab=description">“Rollback censorship patch” via&nbsp;<em>NexusMods</em></a><em>—</em>created by DarkmoonBlade<em>—</em>will undo the mandatory Steam update, taking <em>Wuchang</em> back to its 1.4 state, and as such no longer have many of the bosses become “exhausted” rather than dead. It’ll also restore the original story. You’ll also need to disable the auto-update feature for the game in Steam, or it’ll just reinstall itself immediately, and then run the game via the game’s .exe rather than through Steam.</p> <p>For all the response, there’s little evidence it’s changed anything with regards to the game’s popularity. The game’s Steam player numbers have maintained the same continuous descent they were already on before the patch, rather than showing any steep decline or widespread boycotting. While <em>Wuchang</em> peaked at a very impressive 131,000 simultaneous players in late July, that’s steadily dropped to the 16,000 or so who showed up over the weekend. Like so many Soulslikes, it seems to have had its moment, failing to cut deeper into the zeitgeist like the likes of <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>. (The August 2024 game broke records with its 2.4m players, but has settled to a steady 40,000 for months.)</p>

<p>The latest game in the <i>AI: Somnium Files</i> series arrived last month, and it’s shorter than the previous ones. <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> is actually a spin-off that takes place between the first two games, <i>AI: The Somnium Files</i> and <i>AI: The Somnium Files -Nirvana Initiative-</i>, as well as sees the return of our original protagonist, Kaname Date.</p> <p>This time around, Kaname Date must save our favorite idol Iris after she gets abducted by a UFO and is forced to play various escape games to survive. Directed by Kazuya Yamada supervised by original series creator Uchikoshi, <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> implements escape room puzzles similar to that of the <em>Zero Escape</em> series, which Uchikoshi also created. These escape room scenarios help pad out N<em>o Sleep for Kaname Date</em> despite its much shorter length.</p>  <p><i>No Sleep for Kaname</i> has five chapters for you to play through, along with multiple “dead-end” endings.</p>

 <p>In the game, you’ll have to go through “Somniums” (different from the escape rooms) which are pseudo puzzles that you’ll need to solve in order to progress the story. During these Somnium investigations, you’ll be on a timer, so you won’t have time to examine every item. But examining every item unlocks “eyeballs,” which are in-game currency that lets you unlock bonus content for after you’ve beaten the main story (don’t worry, there are no real-world microtransactions). You can also earn more eyeballs by finding collectibles throughout the game.</p> <p>Some of the bonuses you can unlock include concept art and extra endings called “alternate alternate endings.” They cost a certain amount of eyeballs to unlock, and some of the bonuses may not appear until you’ve reached certain alternate endings in the story.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000618125" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618125"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618125">© Screenshot: Spike Chunsoft Co., Ltd.</figcaption></figure> <p>You will have to replay certain chapters, Somniums, and escape room puzzles to find the alternate endings, but thankfully, the game’s flowchart notes which chapters have them. That way, you won’t have to blindly search for them.</p>

 <p>That being said, a full playthrough of No Sleep for Kaname Date should take you about 12-15 hours to complete, depending on how good you are at solving escape puzzles.</p> <h2><span id="how-many-achievements-does-no-sleep-for-kaname-date-have"></span>How many Achievements does <em>No Sleep for Kaname Date</em> have?<span></span></h2> <p><i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> is available for Switch and Steam. While the former doesn’t have an achievement system, the latter does. Since this game is much shorter than the others, you’re looking at about an extra five hours to unlock all of the achievements.</p> <h2><span id="is-no-sleep-for-kaname-date-on-playstation-or-xbox"></span>Is No Sleep for Kaname Date on PlayStation or Xbox?<span></span></h2> <p>Right now, <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> is only on Switch and Steam. While the previous two games are on all platforms, including PC, PlayStation, Switch, and Xbox, <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> has not been announced for PlayStation and Xbox.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000618126" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618126"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618126">© Screenshot: Spike Chunsoft Co., Ltd.</figcaption></figure> <p>However, that doesn’t mean that developer Spike Chunsoft won’t bring them over later. 2023’s Master Detective Archives: Rain Code was a Switch exclusive until it came to all other platforms a little over a year later. Given <em>AI: The Somnium Files</em>, it’s definitely possible that <i>No Sleep for Kaname Date</i> will arrive on other platforms in the future.</p> <hr> <p><i>No Sleep for Kaname Date – From AI: The Somnium Files</i> launches on July 25 for Switch/Switch 2 and PC.</p>
