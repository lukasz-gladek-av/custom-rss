              <p>You didn’t have to watch the <em>Fatal Fury</em> finals bracket at Evo 2025 to see Kazuyuki “KojiKOG” Koji writhing around onstage in front of thousands. The moment instantly went viral online. It’s already been memed to South Town and back again. But there was more to KojiKOG’s Greek-tragedy-worthy theatrics than just performing for the camera.</p> <p>KojiKOG’s epic semifinals defeat was delivered at the hands of Goichi “GO1” Kishida, who eventually went on to win the entire tournament. The former was playing Billy while the latter rolled Kain, both considered S-tier fighters in the current meta since <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> launched earlier this year. But KojiKOG was immediately up against the ropes, unable to break out of GO1’s combos. He quickly lost the first round but found a couple of openings in the second. Twice KojiKOG almost reversed fate, getting GO1 down to within a sliver of his health before ultimately failing to finish him off.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="FATAL FURY: CotW ⭐ GO1 (KAIN) vs KOJI KOG (BILLY) ⭐ EVO 2025 COTW Top 8" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dJDRnkm9Qck?start=289&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The entire semifinal lasted less than five minutes, but KojiKOG howling in dismay at his defeat lasted nearly 60 seconds. While GO1 giggled, shrugged, and eventually tried to comfort his rival, people watching at home instantly began clipping the moment and sharing it around online. It was a perfect encapsulation not only of the stakes of that specific match but of the inner screaming we’ve all felt any time we’ve tried our best and still been found wanting.</p>

The two fighting game pros met in finals during an Evo 2015 side tournament for the 2D anime fighter <em>Aquapazza</em> as well. KojiKOG lost then, too, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fatal-fury-pros-dramatic-reaction-to-losing-at-evo-2025-goes-viral-but-it-was-actually-10-years-in-the-making">and pulled a similar stunt, acting as if his leg had been cut off</a>. This time, of course, there was a lot more money and bragging rights on the line. GO1’s wins last night eventually netted him an extra $10,000 in prize pool money. He’ll also be in pole position for the $2.5 million <em>Fatal Fury</em> prize pool at the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/1mfct3j/snk_announces_snk_world_championship_2025_%E3%83%BC_41/">SNK World Championship in November</a> (brought to you by Saudi Arabia’s human rights violation slush fund).</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">youtubeに動画をアップしました。</p> <p>10年ぶりに足を切断されてしまう小路KOG vs GO1 EVO2025<a href="https://t.co/sQTu3yb2xJ">https://t.co/sQTu3yb2xJ</a> <a href="https://t.co/DyPHT39YUu">pic.twitter.com/DyPHT39YUu</a></p> <p>— 小路ＫＯＧ (@kkkog) <a href="https://twitter.com/kkkog/status/1952342197220593705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“KOG, who had his leg amputated after 10 years, vs GO1 EVO2025,” KojiKOG <a href="https://x.com/kkkog/status/1952342197220593705">posted on X</a>. While dramatic pop-offs after winning are a staple of the fighting game scene, KojiKOG may have just elevated the inverse of that into an art form all its own. Fans are already hyped to watch him lose his next big tournament.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-the-kotaku-review-1850883627"><em>Starfield</em></a> and <em>Deus Ex</em> voice actor Elias Toufexis has a very simple message to anyone thinking of using AI-powered mods to add characters he has played to other games: Don’t do that, actually. It’s a topic the actor has spoken about before, and one he is extremely passionate about.</p> <p>In early July, a user on Twitter posted that people should download a mod that replaces the main character’s voice in<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> with that of Adam Jensen, the protagonist of the two most recent&nbsp;<em>Deus Ex&nbsp;</em>games, using AI. They also suggested customizing the main character to look like the <em>Deus Ex</em> character. They claimed that if you took these steps, it would turn CD Projekt Red’s 2020 open-world RPG into a “pretty convincing” <em>Deus Ex</em> game. A month later, on August 2, this tweet came to the attention of Jensen’s voice actor, Toufexis, and he had a simple, clear reply to this idea: “<a href="https://x.com/EliasToufexis/status/1951794192512061695?">No. Do not fucking do that</a>.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">No. Do not fucking do that. <a href="https://t.co/vQolcAP3Tg">https://t.co/vQolcAP3Tg</a></p> <p>— Elias Toufexis (@EliasToufexis) <a href="https://twitter.com/EliasToufexis/status/1951794192512061695?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>When another Twitter user asked Toufexis, who voiced Sam Cole in 2023’s <em>Starfield</em>, why they shouldn’t use the AI mod to add Jensen to <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, the voice actor replied: <a href="https://x.com/EliasToufexis/status/1951804424252441040">“You going to pay me for using my voice?”</a></p>

 <p>The voice replacement mod for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>&nbsp;mentioned in the original tweet was uploaded to the internet in October 2023. Its creator states that they mean no disrespect to Toufexis and claims that if the voice actor ever reached out to them and demanded it be removed, the modder would comply. “I would never want someone to feel like I’m robbing them of their right to own and dictate when or how their voice is to be used,” <a href="https://schaken-mods.com/forums/topic/153170-adam-jensen-as-v-ai-voice-over/#:~:text=I%20would%20never%20want%20someone%20to%20feel%20like%20I%27m%20robbing%20them%20of%20their%20right%20to%20own%20and%20dictate%20when%20or%20how%20their%20voice%20is%20to%20be%20used.">explained the modder</a>. It’s not clear if Toufexis has reached out to the modder yet.</p> <p>Adam Jensen appeared in <a href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-mankind-divided-the-kotaku-review-1785610152">2011’s<em> Deus Ex: Human Revolution</em> and its 2016 sequel, </a><em>Mankind Divided. </em>The brooding cyborg badass became famous for his raspy, deep voice and has remained a fan favorite. Toufexis loves talking about the character, so much so that <a href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-3-adam-jensen-actor-stop-talking-sequel-eidos-1851252201">he was told to stop by series developers Edios Montreal in 2020</a>. In 2024, a new, unannounced <em>Deus Ex</em> game was <a href="https://kotaku.com/embracer-group-deus-ex-cancelled-eidos-montreal-layoffs-1851205890">reportedly canceled</a> by Embracer Group.</p> <p>This is far from the first time Toufexis has spoken about AI generation tools being used to replace voice actors. <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-sam-coe-voice-actor-romance-elias-toufexis-1850826699">In a 2023 interview with <em>Kotaku</em></a>, Jensen’s iconic voice actor called AI a “tool that steals from other people’s work.”</p>

 <p>“I honestly feel that AI cannot replace real actors in the long run,” said Toufexis. “But it can take away a whole slew of jobs that normally go to actors. Big roles like Sam [from <em>Starfield</em>] are probably safe. AI is just a tool that steals from other people’s work and tries to create reality. But it’s not reality, and I believe people will know the difference and want the real thing. But it may take some time. I look at it like NFTs or 3D TVs. There will be a little while where people fool around with the new tech, but eventually they’ll realize how fake it is.”</p> <p>He also explained that if he catches people using AI to recreate his voice for profit or promotion, he’ll ask them to stop. If they do, that will be the end of it. However, if they continue, he’ll go after them, telling <em>Kotaku</em> in 2023: “We have to protect actors from replacement. It’s a dangerous slope. If my voice can be replaced, that is almost literally leading to taking food out of my kids’ mouths. This is a huge part of my livelihood.”</p>

<p><i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</i> features a handful of secret characters to unlock. Some are immediately available to buy in the Secret Shop, like Michelangelo and <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-bam-margera-how-to-unlock-easy-fast-tip-guide-1851785804">Bam Margera</a>. Others are only added to the shop once you’ve completed a hidden objective. One of the most difficult to unlock is the fan-favorite Officer Dick, who is lovingly portrayed by Jack Black for the second time.</p> <p>You’ll need to explore the deep corners of each level before this skater can be added to your roster. Using <a href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-photo-mode-option-tool-tony-hawks-pro-skater-1851786140">Photo Mode</a> to scour the map can help, but this guide will save you a lot more time.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614521" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614521"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614521">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><b>To unlock Officer Dick, you’ll need to collect the hidden Panda plush in each level.</b> These can be harder to find than most Secret Tapes, since the latter has the benefit of being a giant floating item that’s highlighted to boot.</p> <p>Once you’ve collected them all, a familiar-looking skater named Constable Richard will be added to the Secret Shop for $5,000. Pay up the cash to unlock him and an alternate outfit with his iconic Officer Dick look.</p> <p>Let’s dive into where each plushie is located. We’re going in order from the first map of the third game to the last new map for the fourth game.</p> <h3><span id="foundry"></span>Foundry<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614522" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614522"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614522">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Head to the other side of the map from where you start. Build up some speed and jump off the half pipe here to catch a grind on the upper level. Hop off the edge and go to the leftmost corner to find the plush.</p> <h3><span id="canada"></span>Canada<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614523" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614523"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614523">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Turn around and go towards the giant tree surrounded by half pipes. On the other side of these and right next to the tree is the plush.</p> <h3><span id="rio"></span>Rio<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614524" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614524"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614524">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>You want to turn right as soon as you can and head to the closest corner of the map. There will be a small opening with a fountain, and the plush can be seen directly across from it in the bushes.</p> <h3><span id="suburbia"></span>Suburbia<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614525" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614525"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614525">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This requires access to the haunted house that opens up after helping the Thin Man. Transfer over to the half-pipe-filled backyard and then reach the area behind the tree in the corner to get the plush.</p> <h3><span id="airport"></span>Airport<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614526" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614526"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614526">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Rush through the map until you get to the flight terminals. Go left to the C2 terminal that’s meant for Tokyo flights. Skate up the ramp in front and try to land behind the three monitors to easily access this plush.</p> <h3><span id="skater-island"></span>Skater Island<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614527" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614527"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614527">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Exit the building and head towards the overturned boat on your left. The plush will be found sitting on the other side of it.</p> <h3><span id="los-angeles"></span>Los Angeles<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614528" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614528"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614528">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Skate down the road to your right and then barrel through the fountain building’s glass windows. Transfer over the watery half pipe in front of you and venture into either hole to acquire this plush. If all you see are grates, you need to trigger the “They’re Grate” gap by grinding the rails nearby.</p> <h3><span id="tokyo"></span>Tokyo<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614529" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614529"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614529">©Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The Panda is located in the hidden left area of the map, which you can access after grinding the top levels of the left side and collapsing the giant circle advertisement. Technically, the plush is directly beneath you in this new area. Jump off and venture towards either side to grind the edges of their half pipes. A separate path can be grinded close to the plush, but you’ll zoom past. I could only reach this one by awkwardly jumping towards it.</p> <h3><span id="cruise-ship"></span>Cruise Ship<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614530" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614530"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614530">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Turn right from the start and hop down to the lower level of the cruise ship. The plush is well-hidden up in the planters on the left side. Grind the rails above to reach them.</p> <h3><span id="college"></span>College<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614531" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614531"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614531">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>From the start, head left and grind up the barrier arm that leads up to the parking garage’s second level. Turn around and jump between the college-decorated wires, the purple rail on the right, and finally the roof of the white building ahead to collect this level’s plush.</p> <h3><span id="san-francisco"></span>San Francisco<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614533" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614533"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614533">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Turn left and keep skating until you reach the Pier 12 building. Make a big jump to reach its roof, where you can find the plush in front of a pink dog graffiti.</p> <h3><span id="movie-studio"></span>Movie Studio<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614534" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614534"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614534">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Start moving forward and transfer off the half pipes to the left. Jump into the green bowl with the spaceship prop above it, and then cross the tied rope in the corner. The plush is sitting a little to the right, so you might need to fling yourself to collect it.</p> <h3><span id="alcatraz"></span>Alcatraz<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614535" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614535"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614535">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>You’ll need to head to the rooftops for this one. Once you’re up there, skate up the ramp leading to a red pipe and grind it around the old water tower and down the wire leading to a silo. Jump off the wire and try to land on the small walkway to reach the plush.</p> <h3><span id="water-park"></span>Water Park<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614536" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614536"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614536">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Jump off to the right as soon as you can and skate around until you reach a wooden ramp and a gigantic red bucket.

Follow the wooden fence perimeter until you see a blue dumpster next to a red half pipe. You can find the plush next to the former.</p> <h3><span id="shipyard"></span>Shipyard<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614540" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614540"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614540">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Go forward and then move between the buildings to the left. Enter the open warehouse on the left side to reach the rooftop. Jump to the adjacent roof and then jump to the grated walkway on the right. Hop over the small half pipe and then jump onto the walkway of the nearby rusted building. The plush is sitting on the other side.</p> <h3><span id="london"></span>London<span></span></h3> <figure id="attachment_2000614541" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614541"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614541">© Screenshot: Activision / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Go forward and approach where the blue van is for Stompy the Elephant.

Slow down and climb on the brown bolted-on bar on the left side. Position yourself with lots of room, because you need to climb up this wall. This is done by executing a wallride and then immediately jumping to grind the edge at the top and then hopping off before your skater zooms off. The only thing up here is the final plush, which will unlock Constable Richard in the Secret Shop.</p> <hr> <p><i>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</i> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch, and Windows PCs.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/titan-quest-2-early-access-out-now-2000614459"><em>Titan Quest II</em> snuck up out of nowhere</a> and surprised us all. The sequel to the 2006 classic may have nothing to do with the original developers, nor even the original publishers, but after spending a few hours with the game I’m left in no doubt that it understands the spirit of what it’s trying to recreate. It’s just that this Early Access release isn’t close to optimized, and lacks some incredibly obvious quality-of-life features.</p> <p>The original&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em> was released midway through the twelve-year gap between&nbsp;<em>Diablo II </em>and&nbsp;<em>Diablo III</em>, and even three years before the release of&nbsp;<em>Torchlight</em>. While hardcore action-RPG players had just been given 2005’s&nbsp;<em>Fate</em>, the market was so very open for a more immediately approachable&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>-like, and Iron Lore Entertainment’s Greek (and Egyptian) mythology game perfectly fit the bill. It’s super-low-key approach to the genre meant you weren’t worrying about min-maxing your intricate build, but were far more likely to just be methodically click-click-clicking your way through its luscious lands. Not quite an idle game (those were years from being a thing), <em>Titan Quest</em> allowed a nonchalance in its delivery of constant dopamine hits as you incessantly progressed, whether geographically or in the quality of your equipment. And this, from my admittedly brief time so far with <em>Titan Quest II</em>, seems to be entirely understood. In a lot of ways–and ways that leave me optimistic despite my laundry list of complaints–it’s the sequel you would want.</p> <p>Then, on the other hand, the game is causing my GPU to be transformed into a thermo-nuclear bomb, forcing me to turn it off lest I blow up my entire town.</p>

 <p>A lack of optimization is perhaps typical for an Early Access game, but&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest II</em>‘s crappy framerates and attempts at arson via my PC feel a bit too much. More frustrating to me are the obvious quality-of-life features that you just expect any game in this genre to already have in place, like, I dunno, being able to rebind controller buttons, or not have to hold down a key to be able to compare inventory items. It’s also not great that trying to use a ladder can see you endlessly spinning on the spot with no choice but to reload.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614551" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614551"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614551">©THQ Nordic / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Titan Quest II</em> starts exactly right. The opening of the original&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em> was so idyllic, such a perfect bucolic setting, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-seem-to-be-having-trouble-starting-titan-quest">that I didn’t want to leave it</a>. This sequel 19 years on seems to have fully understood this, and offers something that evokes the very same sense of serenity and safety. You stand atop a cliff, looking out over the gorgeous blue sea on the coast, a ruined building below, a shipwreck to your right, but it’s all so peaceful and pretty. However, you’re quickly urged on by another character to hurry and help, as a gryphon is attacking the nearby town, so off you go.</p> <p>After this, there’s definitely nothing that’ll especially surprise you if you’re familiar with action-RPGs.&nbsp;You left click to move, right click to attack, and enemies and items will drop you new equipment. After some inventory <em>Tetris</em>, you compare what you’ve picked up with what you’ve already got, swap it out, and then find a merchant on whom to dump the rest. And repeat. And that’s enough! That’s the joy of this genre, just enough to keep you distracted, ideally accompanied by a favorite podcast. However, for min-maxxers,&nbsp;<em>TQ2</em> does go the extra mile, with intricate information about your current build, allowing far more in-depth development should that be your thing; for everyone else, you can just make sure numbers go up, and when you gain a new level, add the abilities that sound the most interesting to you.</p>

 <p>Like in the original, there are various Masteries to choose from, although at this point in the sequel’s Early Access they number just four, all familiar. There’s Earth, Lightning, Warfare, and Rogue, and alongside these there’s Core, which lets you boost your main attack in various ways. Then there’s the usual stats to push upward as you go. However, this time out it’s all far more complicated than it should be, with each Mastery filled with a squillion different skills, and each of those skills then upgraded themselves with micro-skills, and given the result is just hitting something harder, or making lightning zap the enemies, it doesn’t need to be anywhere this muddled. The tutorials aren’t great at explaining it all at this point either, although I just sort of guessed and things seemed fine.</p> <p>There are a couple of more significant changes. Firstly, there’s now a dash, which makes for more interesting moments in combat when you’re being targeted by an attack that’s focused on a particular spot on the ground. And perhaps slightly controversially, the game has done away with proper potions, instead having sort of magic ones that refill as a result of your combat. Fight more, and you can heal more. It’s odd. I think I preferred just being able to buy a hundred health potions and not having to think about it. Along with these, there are little details that felt very positive; I was especially pleased with how arrows pierce enemies and can be used to take down groups charging in a line. Or the way a portal spawns nearby where you die, so you don’t have the misery of trudging all the way back to where you fell.</p>

 <p>I was happy! I found ranged attacks far more viable here than they were in the original, which is lovely, and I was happily switching between bow and club depending upon the circumstances, walloping everything and scooping up loot. But, the more I played, the more something felt off. And it’s not just the shitty framerates. But it is also the shitty framerates.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614553" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614553"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614553">©THQ Nordic / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Let’s get the tech stuff out of the way, as this aspect is likely to be fixed the most quickly. The game ran for me at around 40FPS, even when I’d lowered the settings from its recommendations, and even running it in a too-small window. Worse, that fluctuated, sometimes 55, sometimes 35, and all that jarring change made it feel clumsy. And remember, this is a fixed-camera isometric RPG. It’s also pretty astonishing that a PC game from a big-name publisher released in 2025 wouldn’t have sensible graphics settings, but <em>TQ2</em>‘s are a mess. I have an ultra-wide monitor, and was only able to choose between 3440×1440 in fullscreen (which I wouldn’t expect to be optimized for just yet) or the deeply obscure 2048×1152 in a window, which is tiny on this screen. There was no option for a bog-standard 2560×1440, which is pretty dreadful, especially since it clearly&nbsp;<em>can</em> run in those higher resolutions. This feels pretty amateurish.</p>

 <p>That leaden feeling to movement, likely caused by framerate issues, is I think the most off-putting aspect at the moment. But there’s more insidious stuff, like the weird way loot drops from all the wrong places. A real joy of <em>Titan Quest</em> is that enemies dropped what they had. If you killed a boar, the best you’d get is a boar hide. But if your enemy was equipped with a shield and axe, there was a strong chance of finding those on the floor after it was dead. But here, I watched the intense silliness of a giant eagle dropping a pair of shoes as it died. I also saw snakes flinging out gloves as they flopped to the ground. I’m not a fully qualified herpetologist, but I’m pretty sure they have little use for gloves. No, it doesn’t <em>matter</em>, but it’s kind of crap.</p> <p>Then there’s just inexplicable choices, like needing to hold down Alt to compare items in your inventory with those that are equipped. There’s no circumstance ever where you don’t want the comparison to pop up, which is why all games like this do it by default (or offer a toggle for the mad people). Here, when you’re trying to sort through your junk to sell to a merchant, you have to tie your fingers in knots holding down Alt to compare, the Shift to sell, and it’s all far more of a fiddle than could possibly be needed. Why no toggle? Who lives like that? Then there’s the inability to rebind controller inputs, and the astonishingly hard boss fights, and maybe most of all, the lack of a sense of place.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000614560" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614560"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614560">©THQ Nordic / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It says it’s set in ancient Greece, but if that’s true, why are there ruins everywhere? The developers know they didn’t start out that way, right? There’s a lovely intro video which explains how Nemesis is out of control, and the threads of Fate have been corrupted, and someone has to stop her, but then absolutely no sense of how that links to who you are and why you’re there. Everyone else seems to know who you are, but you don’t! You just start off with someone shouting about a gryphon and you just get on with it, but with no grounding. At least in <em>Titan Quest</em>, this blank slate start was understood by your having just arrived on a boat, with NPCs frantically getting you up to date.</p> <p>I dunno. I think I’m perhaps being overly fussy, and will likely get over all of this as soon as I can run the game at a steady framerate and a sensible scale without personally accelerating global climate change. I actually really like a lot about this, and think that with a few patches, it’ll be an Early Access game worth investing in. Sure, more Masteries would be good, but they’ve put in the most popular here, so you’ve plenty to get on with.</p> <p>It’s also worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest</em> isn’t&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>, and was never trying to be. This isn’t about rushing through the actual game in order to reach end-game sicko content–it’s about enjoying the journey. And it’s incredibly refreshing to pick up an ARPG that <em>isn’t</em> bloated with live-service faff of the sort that makes games like <em>Path of Exile 2</em> feel so incredibly inaccessible to me. I feel like&nbsp;<em>Titan Quest 2</em> might be exactly the game I’ve been wanting ever since the last time <em>Torchlight&nbsp;</em>was any good, and it just needs a little bit of work before it can deliver it.</p> <p>For now, you may want to hold off a couple of weeks while it gets its shit together. That it’s only $24 really does make a massive difference, it should be said, and once that sluggish feel is gone, I’ll likely be mainlining the game.</p>
