              <p>Several retailers kick off the new year by rolling out sales right away, and many of those deals stick around. Almost every category out there sees massive drops, making it a great time to stock up on holiday essentials, plus grab the items that feel a little out of reach the rest of the year (TVs, laptops, tablets, premium headphones, etc). You can even grab games for less, both board and digital ones!</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something action-packed, we just spotted Battlefield 6 by EA on sale at Amazon.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6650/"> The PS5 and Xbox Series X version are going for $64, after a nice 43% drop</a>. If you’re planning to relax and get some much-deserved playtime in during the holidays, today is a good time to prep for it. Note that if you don’t spot a discount on the page, click “See All Buying Options” on the left to view all the drops available. You might want to act fast, as the title is high in demand, and we’re not expecting the drop to stay around for long. In fact, keeping past trends in mind, it might not even make it through the weekend.</p>

<h2>The Ultimate Warfare Experience</h2>
<p>Tactile movement and overhauled gunplay make every shot and movement feel more precise, setting an entirely new standard of FPS combat. High-intensity infantry combat or aerial dogfights, you’re going to enjoy full control over every action, just the way you like it. There is more than one way to win and play; go for large-scale modes like Conquest, Breakthrough, and Rush to unleash chaos, or push your limits with fast-paced action with King of the Hill, Domination, and Payload.</p>



<p>Upgraded Battlefield Portal is a sandbox that lets you customize your gaming experience by changing rules, scaling things, and even duplicating objects; the possibilities are endless, and you can quite literally have anything you could think of. Want to have something entirely based on your own imagination? It makes it easy to develop a unique game mode using NPC scripting and a customizable UI, which can then even be picked as an official Battlefield mode. Then there’s Campaign, which puts you in an elite squad of Marine Raiders fighting tirelessly to save the world, so you’re constantly adapting and improvising to tackle what every moment unfolds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6650/">On a regular day, the upgraded Battlefield 6 would run you around $70, but this deal lets you pick it up for $40 for PS5 and Xbox Series X.</a> We know it’s huge discount, and considering how the game doesn’t go on sale often, definitely one that’s worth it. Plus, it makes it easy to pick a few titles during the sale without blowing your budget. Again, the sale is around for a short time, so it’s best to grab it quickly. Our shopping team is covering the best gaming deals as they come, so it’s worth keeping an eye out. More drops will surface as the sale goes on, and you can use this time to prepare a holiday library for that well-earned downtime.</p>
