              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-link-play-multiplayer-switch-2-1851787158"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> is the first game in the franchise to move from turn-based battles to real-time combat, and it sounds like it will take some getting used to. The first gameplay was revealed to content creators and critics ahead of the 2025 Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim, California, where it became clear developer Game Freak is unafraid <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-trailer-mega-evolution-az-1851766880">to change-up some decades-old formulas</a>.</p> <p>The demos were brief, split between 10 minutes of regular trainer battles and 10 minutes of a raid-like encounter against a Mega Evolution Abso. Unlike <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-alpha-pokemon-tone-nintendo-swit-1848478468">in 2022’s<em> Arceus</em></a>, <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> has you move around a battle in real-time, telling your Pokémon which moves to use or when to get out of the way at will. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/hands-on-pokemon-legends-z-a-proves-legends-is-still-pokemons-most-exciting-series/"><em>VGC</em> noted</a> that you can even sneak up on enemy trainers to get an advantage in battle, while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/759788/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-real-time-preview"><em>The Verge</em> compared</a> the Mega Evolution showdown to “a classic 3D&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>boss.” Your trainer can even take damage herself during these battles.</p> <p>You can see what they’re describing in some of the hands-on footage from <a href="https://serebii.net/">Serebii <em>Pokémon</em> expert</a> Joe Merrick:</p>

This lets you use any attack an unlimited number of times, but only once its meter is full. “<em>Legends: Z-A</em> didn’t feel like a full action game to me, but kind of more like an MMO, with its casting times, cooldowns, and behind-the-scenes math happening,” writes Casey DeFreitas.</p> <p>Like everyone else, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-trying-out-real-time-and-mega-evolution-fights/"><em>CNET</em> demoed</a> the game on <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-impressions-launch-games-comparison-1851785748">Switch 2 in docked mode</a> and noticed “no performance hiccups.” Nevertheless, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-with-overhauled-battles-and-denser-exploration-im-shocked-at-how-fundamentally-fresh-this-could-feel/"><em>Gamesradar</em> was</a> underwhelmed by the urban playground <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>&nbsp; takes place in “The streets and rooftops are bare and lack personality and, while appearing to be a bustling metropolis, Lumiose City is strangely quiet. The limited character animations are also quite noticeable,” writes Michael Leri. “It does make me wonder if the game is underwhelming in these areas because<em> Z-A</em> is still chained to the archaic original Switch compared to its more powerful successor.”</p> <p>While <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> might still be visually hemmed in by the franchise’s history, it sounds like the city’s map still shows it being densely packed with points of interest. Combined with reworked moves to cater to the real-time flow of combat and mechanics like collecting orbs of energy in fights to trigger your own Pokémon’s Mega Evolutions, it feels like at the very least, this year’s release, the first new one in three years, is taking some fresh risks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Once more unto the breach. Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news, interesting stuff, and more, is here. This morning we’re looking at a second screen for the Switch 2 and a wider Steam, we’ve got good news about that new <em>Mafia</em> game, and the devs behind<em> Battlefield 6</em> are making some changes to the beta. Oh, and don’t worry, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hspBUfY8IKs">we’re getting a new video game based on <em>Chicken Run</em></a>. I know everyone was waiting for that.</p> <h2><strong>Rush in the <em>BF6</em> open beta isn’t a great experience</strong></h2> <p>The<a href="https://kotaku.com/oh-thank-god-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-back-2000617797"><em> Battlefield 6</em> open beta is back for its second and final weekend</a>, and that’s great. This weekend also sees a new mode join the fun, Rush, which is a classic <em>BF</em> mode. Sadly, Rush in the beta is bad. I played a few matches last night and didn’t enjoy it. Maps are too small, points are too close, and attackers are at a big disadvantage when trying to blow up the MCOM stations.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">MCOM Timer Changes to Rush</p> <p>We've just made a change to Rush: the MCOM timer is now reduced from 45 to 30 seconds to better the balance between attacking and defending players.</p> <p>We’ll continue to monitor and are ready and able to make further balance adjustments.</p> <p>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1956257348684583143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>EA seems to get that Rush isn’t working, and a few hours after the beta went live, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1956257348684583143">the team changed how long it takes to blow up an MCOM station with a bomb</a>. Previously, it took 45 seconds, which gave defenders plenty of time to run in and defuse it. Now it takes 30 seconds, which should help. But if this mode is going to join my rotation in the full game in October, more changes will have to be made.</p>

 <h2><strong>Steam game pages are getting wider&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Don’t be alarmed if soon store pages on Steam look a bit wider. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/532106189043925406">Valve is testing out some new options</a> for developers and publishers that will let them customize and alter how store pages for games look on the popular digital storefront. Valve is also testing out the option to let devs upload high-quality videos to the store page instead of just gifs. Hopefully this makes store pages look nicer and doesn’t turn Steam into a giant mess.</p> <h2><strong><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> is selling really well</strong></h2> <p>2K’s linear action game <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-review-is-it-good-worth-playing-2000617529">Mafia: The Old Country</a></em>&nbsp;has received fairly good reviews and seems to be a hit with fans of the franchise. But more importantly for the bean counters at 2K, the new <em>Mafia</em> sequel, which is actually set before all the other games in the series, is selling like hotcakes. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vginsights_mafiatheoldcountry-hangar13-2k-activity-7361305503299186688-QyHf/">According to some data shared by Sensor Tower</a>, <em>The Old Country</em> has already sold 800,000 units in just two weeks. PS5 and PC are the biggest platforms for the game. Hopefully this is good news for Hangar 13, and they can avoid layoffs.</p> <h2><strong><em>Hardspace: Shipbreaker</em> devs now own the franchise</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1161580/view/836099892906557718?l=english">On August 14</a> Blackbird Interactive, developers behind spaceship salvage sim <em>Hardspace: Shipbreaker,</em> announced that it had bought back the rights to the game and the franchise from publisher Focus Entertainment. The devs also announced that they were now working on multiple projects within the <em>Hardspace</em> universe and promised a small <em>Shipbreaker</em> update in the future that will tweak some things to reflect the new ownership.</p>

 <p>“We’re eternally grateful for [Focus Entertainment’s] partnership and willingness to work with us so we could take ownership of the <em>Hardspace</em> IP,” said Blackbird Interactive.</p> <h2><strong>WNBA stars will be able to play with NBA stars in <em>2K26</em></strong></h2> <p>While women players from the WNBA have been a part of the <em>NBA 2K</em> series for a few years now, the latest game in the franchise will let them compete against NBA stars for the first time ever. <a href="https://nba.2k.com/2k26/courtside-report/myteam/">This will be possible only in <em>NBA 2K’</em>s popular (and profitable) MyTeam mode</a>. The women players will be available in all MyTeam game modes.</p> <h2><strong>Wait a minute, is that a Switch 2 dual-screen patent?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>People have spotted what appears to be a new patent from Nintendo for a dual-screen attachment or accessory for the Nintendo Switch 2. Of course, companies patent all sorts of stuff and then never do anything with it. So don’t expect Nintendo to announce this tomorrow, next month, or ever. But it is interesting, isn’t it?</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/finally-we-got-some-new-gameplay-of-that-scary-looking-jurassic-park-game-2000617830">We got some new gameplay of that upcoming <em>Jurassic Park</em> horror game</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-mods-star-wars-genesis-tattooine-mos-eisley-2000617835">Read our interview with a person trying to turn <em>Starfield</em> into a <em>Star Wars</em> game using mods</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-oddball-aspirational-character-hero-design-2000617761"><em>Overwatch 2</em> is moving away from adding more goofball characters</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="It's Time We Talked about Disco Elysium, Again" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lZEAs6M1wts?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-trial-trailer-story-gameplay-voice-2000616929"><span>Wuyang</span></a><span>, the 44th hero in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-oddball-aspirational-character-hero-design-2000617761"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s roster</span></a><span>, isn’t officially in the game yet, but he’s already showing a lot of potential. The water-wielding Support character is playable for the next few days as part of a trial period, and after just one day with the hero, players are coming up with some diabolical combos. I played around with him a bit, and I don’t think he’s my style of Support hero because his low healing output makes him feel a bit too passive for my liking. Despite this, I can see how a skillful player could make the most of his kit by setting up devastating opportunities for teammates. Wuyang feels evocative of the approach to Support hero design from when the first game launched, which was less about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-best-healer-gay-character-support-role-1850071120"><span>healing as the be-all, end-all utility</span></a><span> and more about, well, supporting other players to do their thing. As such, his ultimate, Tidal Blast, isn’t a big defensive ultimate that outheals incoming waves of damage. Instead, it’s one of the game’s new best set-up abilities.</span></p> <p><span>Tidal Blast has two major functions. First, it creates a water-based barrier around either Wuyang himself or an ally. This gives the target a bulky chunk of overhealth that will keep them safe from most incoming attacks. The second thing it does is detonate after a few seconds, doing a little bit of damage to enemies within its radius. However, it also knocks enemies to the ground, similar to Reinhardt’s Earthshatter ultimate, in a circular radius. This will give you a precious few seconds to follow up and do some real damage to an enemy team while they’re on the ground. On its own, this is a really solid ability that can take down enemy defenses and give you a window to wreck shop. However, with coordination, it can also be absolutely devastating when paired with characters like Tracer, Junker Queen, and Sombra, who can quickly dive into an enemy backline.</span></p>   <p><span>Coordination will be key in making these combos work. Timing is everything with Tidal Blast, because if your target is seconds early or late into a play, the whole setup can fall apart. </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>players like KarQ have demonstrated a few uses for the ability, like shielding Junker Queen as she heads in with her own ultimate which has her dash forward and inflict Wound damage on enemies, potentially cutting off a group of opponents at the knees and&nbsp; leaving them open for a quick finish. Some characters don’t even need to be dashing into the backline to get value out of Tidal Blast. Orisa’s ultimate, which sucks enemies into her position before bringing down a powerful charged strike onto the area around her, can be risky because it’s somewhat easy to move out of its range if you have a mobility skill. If she goes in covered in a water bubble, however, she can bring enemies into range, then Tidal Blast will knock them down for her to finish them off. It requires precise timing, but there’s potential, when two well-coordinated players are working together, to wipe out several enemies and clear a path to an objective.</span></p> <p><span>Wuyang is playable until August 18, and officially joins the roster on August 26.</span></p>

              <p>Super-realistic revenge shooter <em>Better Than Dead</em> has just been announced, along with an intensely violent trailer. The brutal game, in which you play as a Chinese woman who has escaped from slavery and is now exacting revenge on the photo-realistic streets of Hong Kong, is all depicted as if from bodycam footage. And—wow—even the trailer is tough viewing. It looks amazing and terrifyingly real, and I suspect this could become gaming’s next big controversy.</p> <p>With each new graphical generation over the last 30 years, the FPS genre transformed from the cartoonish arcade styles of&nbsp;<em>Doom</em> to the ultra-realistic visceral depictions of, well, <em>Doom</em>. Along the way, as fidelity improved, the FPS always courted controversy, with mainstream attention grabbed on the advent of games like 1999’s <em>Kingpin: Life of Crime</em>, 2000’s&nbsp;<em>Soldier of Fortune</em>, and any number of&nbsp;<em>Call</em>s<em> of Duty</em>. However, the genre has been so damned impressive-looking for so long now, it feels like the corners have rubbed down on the reactions. Attempts at moral panics have more recently focused on subject matter over looks, as we’ve all become inured to hyper-realistically shooting the kneecaps off our enemies. But I wonder whether&nbsp;<em>Better Than Dead</em> might trigger a new wave of concern.</p> <p>As a games critic who’s been around for the entire evolution of the genre, I think I’m pretty acclimatized to the whole shebang, and have read enough well-researched studies over the years to know that there’s never been a proven significant link between video-game violence and real-world violence. Which is my needlessly pompous way of saying: I love a good violent game! Gib me up any time. So it really took me back when I had such a visceral reaction to the trailer for <em>Better Than Dead</em>. It’s not because of the gun violence, or the blood splatters, or even that the protagonist’s targets are often running in fear (although it was that a bit); it’s that it’s all depicted as the most extraordinarily realistic bodycam footage.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Better Than Dead - MicroProse Publishing Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YqXZ1gPmU2E?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Real-world violence is something I go out of my way to avoid seeing, and when bodycam footage is released of police brutality and unlawful killings, I’ll desperately try to avoid seeing it. Like most people, I’m very able to separate fantasy and reality, and can enjoy blowing the brains out of perfectly rendered aliens at the same time as being horrified by seeing a living human in pain. But when video game brutality is depicted in such a specific format, complete with the curving of the fish-eye lens and those grainy textures typical of low-grade video recordings, that line for me is incredibly blurred.</p> <p>As a result, the footage of&nbsp;<em>Better Than Dead</em> incessantly swam down the uncanny valley, at times looking completely photo-realistic, and others clearly being video game graphics. What disturbed me more than anything else was not the blood from gunshots—that was cartoonish if anything—but the <em>walls</em>. I know that sounds silly, but there’s something about how utterly lifelike they were, the way the surface textures speckled with artifacts just like when you see real bodycam footage. They become the most incredibly convincing aspect of the trailer, selling the perspective such that everything else feels so much more real.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617987" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617987"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617987">© Ubisoft / Mobygames</figcaption></figure> <p>The slightly silly perspective from which FPS games have always been viewed gives off the feeling that you’re a head with a gun jutting out just below your chin. Yes, some let you look down and see your feet, but it’s always felt far more like you’re playing a floating camera than a person. But a bodycam—that makes sense of the whole format. That <em>is</em> a floating camera, and suddenly the genre is given a pragmatic reality that I’ve found incredibly jarring.</p>

 <p>Then, added to this view, is the fisheye lens and faux-low-grade footage. It’s really interesting how incredibly effective this is every time the game shows something set outside, and how bizarrely crap it appears when indoors. That’s largely due to how awful the textures are in the office interior where a weird amount of the footage is set—those drink bottles and monitors look like something from the early 2000s, so jarringly different from the moments when it cuts to exterior action and then, good god, it looks like real life. The pixelating of faces, however, works both indoors and out, because oh my goodness that’s chilling. It all adds to the sense of this being genuine footage, recovered and edited.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617986" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617986"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617986">© MicroProse / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Of course, were this idea being used for a game about, I dunno, saving people from danger, it would offer that same down-to-earth naturalism, but perhaps not be quite so disturbing.&nbsp;<em>Better Than Dead</em> is a game about a young woman who has escaped from cruel slavery exacting her murderous revenge on every single person involved—and from the footage, presumably everyone else nearby as well. According to the press release announcing the game, “In <em>Better Than Dead</em>, you’re not just surviving—you’re retaliating. Once held captive and humiliated on film by those who broke her, the protagonist now turns the camera on them. One by one, they’ll fall. Every mission is a ruthless, high-stakes raid through the underbelly of Hong Kong. No remorse. No hesitation. Only vengeance.”</p>

 <p>The game cites “gritty Hong Kong action cinema of the ’80s and ’90s” as its inspiration, although it’s hard not to think of Park Chan-wook’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vengeance_Trilogy">Vengeance Trilogy</a> when it comes to people released from unfair captivity and seeking brutal revenge on their captors. And those films didn’t exactly land without their share of controversy.</p> <p>Now, there’s a decent chance the game will be no good. This is being published by one-time PC gaming powerhouse MicroProse, the biggest surprise there being that MicroProse is still a thing. (In fact, I looked it up and it seems to be back in the hands of at least one of the original early-’80s founders.) Even more strange is that behind <em>Better Than Dead</em> is a solo developer who has previously only released a super-cute vertical FPS called (somehow)&nbsp;<em>Forza Polpo!</em>, and a demo for a chibi cartoon-like non-violent platformer called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2600000/Mountain_Boy/"><em>Mountain Boy</em></a>. This is, er, something of a shift.</p> <p>But of course, it’s not whether a game’s good or not that riles the pearl-clutching press who love to pretend to be horrified that games are training your kids for their next high school shooting. And yes, when this is eventually released (there’s no date yet), it could come and go with no one noticing—these things often do. But what remains so interesting to me, as an inoculated player of violent games for 40 years, is how it made me sit back in shock. I can’t think of a trailer that’s done that in years, perhaps even not since <em>Soldier of Fortune</em>‘s deeply unpleasant depictions of violence 25 years ago seemed to shock the whole games industry into backing off and focusing on excitement instead of brutality for a good few years after.</p>

              <p>We now know when <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-trailer-xbox-ps5-1851784008"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a> is coming out, how much it will cost, and that it’s not coming to Switch 2 at launch, at least if a new report from Dealabs writer billbil-kun is to believed, and they usually are. The apparent leaks raise questions about why the latest <em>Call of Duty</em> is still coming to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, but not Nintendo’s newest hardware which is more capable than both of those platforms.</p> <p>According <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/non-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ne-sera-pas-disponible-sur-la-nintendo-switch-2-a-sa-sortie-60383">to billbil-kun</a>, Microsoft will be revealing the launch info for <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-final-campaign-mission-will-reportedly-be-a-big-multiplayer-battle-2000617873"><em>Black Ops 7</em> at Gamescom next week</a>. That includes European pricing of €80, its standard cost overseas, suggesting it will also remain at $70 in the U.S. despite warnings earlier in the year that Microsoft would be raising the prices of some of its fall releases. The company retreated from that with<em>&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-xbox-80-price-tag-sgf-rpg-mario-kart-1851784014">The Outer Worlds 2</a></em> earlier this summer, and now it appears <em>Black Ops 7</em> won’t be crossing the $80 Rubicon either.</p> <p>The release date for <em>Black Ops 7</em> is apparently November 14, the latest an entry in the annualized multiplayer shooter franchise has ever appeared (this <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1945861417485099010">corroborates a similar leak from July</a>). But billbil-kun writes that none of the release information currently mentions Switch 2, making it seem unlikely the game will arrive on the handheld hybrid this year despite a 10-year agreement between Microsoft and Nintendo to bring <em>Call of Duty</em> to the platform.</p>

 <p>While Activision confirmed both sides are still committed to making that happen <a href="https://kotaku.com/will-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-come-to-switch-2-1851784023">with plans to reveal more information in the future</a>, it seems like <em>Call of Duty</em> is skipping Nintendo’s consoles again for the 12th year in a row, and two years into Microsoft’s completed acquisition of the publisher. One possible reason for the delay is that Nintendo has been just as stingy with sharing Switch 2 dev kits with Microsoft as with anyone else.</p> <p>While Activision executives met with Nintendo to discuss the specs for the Switch 2 in December of 2022, it’s possible the company was among those third-party development partners who missed out on pre-release access to the new hardware to begin porting games over to it. That shortage, potentially fueled by Nintendo’s paranoia about leaks, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-console-power-playstation-4-xbox-one-1850850348">has reportedly led to</a> lots of developers playing catch up with the Switch 2’s release. Even the makers of <em>Black Ops 7</em>, it seems.</p>
