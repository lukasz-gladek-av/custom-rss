              <p>I find myself in a simulation of a simulation, a modern recreation of a fictional jungle that I and many others fought and persisted through decades ago. As I crawl through the grass, sneak through Soviet weapons facilities, and survive on the animals of the wild, my mind oscillates through deja vu, the pleasant stupor of nostalgia, and the thrill of a sophisticated stealth experience that challenges my reflexes as well as my ability to plan several steps ahead to stay in control of dangerous situations. An inspired story threads these sneaking sequences together, telling a tale of fractured relationships, the pain they cause, and how grand forces beyond our control shape us. I’ve been here before; I’m struck with a strange feeling of being caught between memory and newness. As I crawl through the mud, I think, is this an authentic experience? Is this a substitute for the “real thing” that came ages ago? I take a step forward. “Huh? Footsteps? Is someone there?” says someone around the corner. It’s time to put those thoughts about reality, simulations, and authenticity to the side; I’ve a mission to complete. Into the fray I go, silently, swiftly, with new, deadly precision.</p> <hr> <p>To remake <i>Metal Gear Solid 3</i> is an interesting proposition. The winding, cryptic narrative of the <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> series starts with the events of <i>Snake Eater</i>. It’s a prequel, and a well-written, rightly celebrated one at that. It also represents a maturation of the formula series creator Hideo Kojima, along with the team of developers at Konami, started with 1998’s <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>. <i>Snake Eater</i> digs deeper into the series’ stealth focus, with enemies more attuned to the sounds of your footsteps and more capable of spotting you from a greater distance. You also have to contend with needs such as hunger and treating your wounds, and using camouflage is essential to staying out of sight.</p> <p>With the games that followed <i>MGS3</i>, the series began to lose much of its identity, becoming less an evolution of the original <i>Metal Gear </i>games that arrived on MSX in the late ‘80s and more a response to the third-person shooters of the Xbox 360 and PS3 era. With <i>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</i>, we drifted even further from the original mold, embracing an open-world format, fracturing the traditional narrative structure many were used to, and perhaps most controversially, replacing the iconic voice of the American version of Snake while eliminating such series’ staples&nbsp; as dedicated “codec” conversations. This fractured series identity is what <i>Delta</i> steps into.</p>

 <p>Fans of that original <i>MGS</i> experience might feel like we’ve lost our way from the kind of stealth and narrative adventures that we cherished so much in the late ‘90s and early ‘00s. <i>Delta</i> arrives as a potential reset for that, and succeeds with flying camo colors as a remarkably faithful remake of one of the all-time greats of our medium.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619271" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619271"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619271">© Screenshot: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku (taken in photo mode)</figcaption></figure> <p>After <i>MGS2</i>’s switcheroo forced players to contend with a protagonist who, to put it mildly, challenged the masculine archetype the series had centered up to that point, <i>MGS3</i> recenters traditional, Kurt Russell-inspired masculinity, the kind that defines itself through rugged violence essentialized as a struggle against nature; a thing to fight, a thing to kill, a thing to consume. And the women of the game are eager to show as much tits and ass as an M rating would allow at the time.</p> <p><i>MGS3</i>, and by extension <i>Delta</i>, is prone to complicated, often incorrect, assumptions about governments and economic systems, and its wiser moments can all too quickly be overshadowed by the excitement of wielding deadly weapons without caution and smashing up commies in the East. Still, it’s important to see <i>MGS3</i> as a bold reaffirming of what worked in <i>MGS</i> and a rejection of what didn’t, in the eyes of some, in <i>MGS2</i>. <i>Snake Eater</i> would go on to be one of the most celebrated <i>MGS</i> titles. Now we’re here in 2025, and once again <i>Snake Eater </i>exists as a kind of course correction for the series; it’s an opportunity to take the missteps of <i>MGSV</i>, its open-world structure that often felt directionless and bland, its fractured narrative that was hard to parse for a story already playing with some high level concepts, and correct them.</p>

 <p>In doing so, <i>Delta </i>stands to remind us of just how powerful this era of <i>MGS</i> was, when it was laser focused on captivating, linear level structure, along with a story you could enjoy as you would a film, not the disconnected threads that <i>Phantom Pain</i> asked players to stitch together themselves. It also streamlines those aspects of the original that saw you spending much of your time diving through cumbersome menus, and offers a more traditional camera and aiming experience via its “New Style” mode, which the game defaults to. It also, naturally, delivers the high level of graphical fidelity we expect from a modern AAA game, though some purists may take offense at differences in color grading (they should really just go play the original if it bothers them that much). I’d argue this stylistic change is in line with what <i>Snake Eater</i> was always aspiring to, and is in keeping with what Kojima envisioned for the future of the series, which was to bring it even closer to photorealism.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619272" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619272"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619272">© Screenshot: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku (taken in photo mode)</figcaption></figure> <p>And so, we come back to Kojima, whose stamp is all over <i>Snake Eater </i>and who is nonetheless conspicuously absent from <i>Delta. </i>To be frank, the lack of Kojima on this project feels weird, even preposterous. Would we accept a <i>Twin Peaks</i> “remake” or fourth season without David Lynch? Would we tolerate a shot-for-shot remake of <i>The Matrix</i> without the participation of the Wachowski sisters? Crazy talk! Would we even want those things if their creators <i>were </i>intimately attached?</p>

 <p>But of course, for all the genius and talent David Lynch gave to <i>Twin Peaks</i>, what would that show be without <a href="https://youtu.be/e-eqgr_gn4k">the incredible compositions of Angelo Badalamenti</a>? Would <i>The Matrix</i> have warped our minds in the same way without <a href="https://youtu.be/jYk0WHcmrYo">the technical and creative genius of John Gaeta</a>, who was able to bring bullet time to life? It is so often the case that the works which we remember and cherish dearly are collaborative works, brought to life by far more than just the director’s name.</p> <p>Video games are no different. While <i>MGS</i> wouldn’t exist without the enthusiastic, eccentric creative energy of Hideo Kojima, it takes far more than one person to build a video game as ambitious as any <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>. Major AAA titles are team efforts, and success can never be attributed to any one individual. Who’s to say what <i>MGS</i> would’ve been like if even one other person on the teams that built these games were swapped out?</p>

 <p><i>Delta</i> makes no attempt at hiding the work of Hideo Kojima, with his name showing up a number of times in the opening credits. With very limited exceptions that will certainly be dissected vigorously by the <i>MGS</i> fanbase, the camera work in the cutscenes stays true to that in the original with frightening accuracy. The environment and characters look incredible, conveying well the emotional depth the original aimed for with its lofty cinematic goals. Add the fact that the game uses the original’s voice acting and music, and the combined effect plays a trick on the mind: <i>Delta</i> gave me both the thrills of a modern, polished AAA game and an active dose of nostalgia for the PS2 era in all the best ways.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619273" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619273"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619273">© Screenshot: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku (taken in photo mode)</figcaption></figure> <p>When that camera is turned over to you, the default settings give you a different kind of perspective than what <i>Snake Eater</i> originally shipped with. You can freely rotate the camera, you can even move in first person like you could in <i>MGS4 </i>and <i>V</i>, though at a slower pace. You press the left trigger to raise your weapon, you fire it with the right. You reload with a face button.</p>

 <p>For all these modern comforts, however, the game still feels like it’s playing in the world that <i>MGS, Sons of Liberty</i>, and the original <i>Snake Eater</i> built. Smartly, the d-pad becomes of use in a way that preserves the left and right corners of the screen as your dedicated item and weapon management system. Gone is the more <i>Gears of War</i>-esque weapon selection system of <i>The Phantom Pain</i>. Added to this layout is an up-press on the d-pad to scroll through a selection of camo to change outfits way faster than you could in the original. You can also press down on the d-pad to bring up a new codec/radio menu and swiftly hop on a call with the game’s NPCs–and yes, you can still call Para-Medic to save your progress and enjoy snippets of cinema history afterwards.</p> <p>This streamlining takes elements of <i>Snake Eater</i> that once required you to sift through different screens to engage with them and instead places them in the heat of the moment, easier to reach for when you need them. In my experience, this improves the flow of <i>Snake Eater</i>’s gameplay so much that I prefer playing <i>Delta</i> over the original based on this alone. And while I have some serious reservations about the thought of any other <i>MGS</i> game getting remade, I have to say, if it’s going to play like <i>Delta</i>, have at it, Konami! (I will now hide under my desk to avoid getting struck by lightning.)</p> <p>Most mechanics remain largely faithful to the original, rather than undergoing the kind of deep expansion you might expect them to receive in a remake such as this. Close-quarters-combat, for instance, has not been expanded beyond some flashier animations that mostly occur during certain boss fights–one fight in particular relies on these fancier animations instead of a sound cue like the original did. This marks perhaps <i>Delta</i>’s most extreme deviation from the original.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000619274" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619274"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619274">© Screenshot: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku (taken in photo mode)</figcaption></figure> <p>You can, however, crouch-walk. This was not in <i>MGS</i> DNA until <i>Guns of the Patriots</i>, and it’s a welcome modernization here; moving from cover, crouching, then going to a crawl all feels suitably smooth, sophisticated, and intuitive. It makes for a wildly impressive and immersive stealth experience that demands an adherence to form in the way you approach situations. You need to learn and memorize how best to turn corners, when and where to emerge from tall grass. <i>Snake Eater</i> encourages you to build those best practices, that stealth form, like an athlete training for an event; <i>Delta</i> gives you increased mobility and camerawork to be more immersed in the experience. It can make the game easier, however. With that in mind, I recommend that veterans of the original start on Hard difficulty unless they’re looking for a breezy first trip through.</p> <p>The one downside to the new camera style is that it can, on occasion, feel claustrophobically close. There’s no FOV slider, even on the PC version, and the game’s environments are smaller than what we’re used to in modern shooters.</p> <p>The pacing of the game has not changed much either. Snake moves at about the same speed as he did in the original. No sprint function was added, and things like swimming and wading through mud still feel like a chore. I think Konami could’ve stood to be a bit bolder by speeding that pace up, but it fits with a game that’s already trying to make its combat feel meatier and more impactful than that in a rapid, twitchy shooter. Despite feeling similar to modern games in terms of its controls, <i>Delta</i> also still feels like the original <i>Snake Eater</i>, not an <i>MGS3</i> overhaul mod for <i>MGSV</i> or something. Indeed, it feels more like classic <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> than any <i>MGS</i> game has in decades, without feeling like a retro throwback that requires a rewiring of your brain.</p> <div>       <div>                                         <figure>                            </figure>                           <div>                      <p>             Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater           </p>                                       </div>       </div>               <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>Same great snake taste you love, now with four times the pixels!</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Konami</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Third-person stealth action game.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Faithful recreation of a classic, wonderfully improved controls.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Lack of an FOV slider, some slower elements of the original remain.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms: </p>                 <p>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows PCs (played).</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>August 28, 2025 (playable on August 26 for those who pre-order the deluxe version).</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>30 hours on a non-lethal, never-spotted run on the game’s Hard difficulty setting using the “New Style” camera.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>           </div>  <p>That extends to the menu systems, which have all of the character and detail that they exuded in the original. Eat a snake, and you’ll sometimes see a little cutscene of our protagonist chowing down, followed up by the sound of him chewing, swallowing, and commenting on how tasty it was. The game will play the audio every time you eat, as it did in the original. The remake could’ve given us an option to skip as it does feel a little tedious and repetitive when you’re more than a dozen hours into the game.</p>

 <p><i>MGS3</i> was always far from my favorite <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>. It lacked <i>MGS2</i>’s fourth-wall-breaking meta stuff that had me captivated, putting me in a weird liminal space where I obsessed about what the purpose of a “sequel” even is. Its plot twists, in my opinion, don’t match up to the wild revelations of the first <i>MGS</i> or, for that matter, those of <i>MGSV</i> later on. And its survival mechanics always slowed the action down too much for me. But <i>Delta</i> really helped me appreciate what this game is by breaking down the rigid barriers of the original’s menu-diving while giving me a more sophisticated set of movement options and camera controls. And the game is visually impressive not just because it’s a modern-day AAA game with the horsepower of our modern consoles and GPUs. There’s real care in the presentation, from the improved fidelity of facial animations to carry those wonderfully well-written lines of dialogue, to bits of grass, leaves, and sticks getting stuck to your clothes and falling off as you move around. <i>Delta</i>’s graphics got more than a few “wows” out of me.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000619275" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000619275"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000619275">© Screenshot: Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I’ve got my critiques of that 2004 premiere of Snake in the jungle, but there’s no denying that the original <i>Snake Eater</i> will remain one of the greatest games of all time and people should play it if they care about the history of this medium, and to see how the now humble processing power of the PS2 was pushed to its extreme to tell a captivating story about shifting allegiances, broken relationships, and the threat we humans pose to ourselves by using our intellect to build super weapons. For those returning to this jungle, expect a faithful and respectful rearticulation of a game you loved–and if you didn’t love it, maybe the slight modernizations will win you over as they did for me.</p>

 <p>Should someone come across <i>Snake Eater</i> for the first time with <i>Delta</i>, they’ll find a phenomenal modern stealth experience housed in the kind of classic narrative and linear structure that modern games have been neglecting far too often in their quests to make their worlds bigger. <i>Delta </i>knows its subject matter can stimulate the imagination, and no piece of silicon can out muscle that.</p> <p><i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater </i>modernizes the classic mechanics of the original while preserving the breathlessly tense feeling of its stealth gameplay, and its painstakingly accurate recreation of the original’s aesthetic and vibrantly beating cinematic heart preserve so much of why these games have withstood the test of time. Should <i>Delta </i>be not just a one-off but the dawn of a new generation for <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>, it’s a promising one indeed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cracker Barrel is changing its iconic and famous logo for the first time in nearly 50 years. Sadly, the new logo sucks, and is part of a larger trend of corporations ditching their unique qualities and going as broad as possible in order to make the line go up. And somehow this new boring logo, according to chuds online, is <em>also</em> an example of “<a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-microsoft-obsidian-anti-woke-dei-twitter-1851714901">going woke</a>.” Folks, it’s a mess out there.</p> <p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/21/cracker-barrel-cbrl-new-logo-branding.html">On August 19, Cracker Barrel announced</a> that it was ditching its <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/20/lifestyle/cracker-barrel-introduces-controversial-new-logo-and-menu-changes/">48-year-old logo</a> featuring a man sitting next to a barrel. Instead, the restaurant that specializes in “Southern comfort food” has replaced the well-known logo with a new one that is simply a yellow shape with the Cracker Barrel name slapped on it. It’s the kind of thing that I could whip up in Photoshop in under five minutes, though I wouldn’t get paid the likely tens of thousands of dollars (or more) that the people who actually created the new logo received.</p> <p>There’s no way around it: The new logo is boring, bland, and bad. People hate it. You don’t have to look hard to find plenty of people online sharing negative thoughts on the new, modernized logo. It’s also part of a larger, less talked-about rebrand that has been happening at Cracker Barrel over the last year or so, with old restaurants ditching their rustic look for chic white walls and modern design touches.</p>

 <p>“Our story hasn’t changed. Our values haven’t changed,” <a href="https://www.crackerbarrel.com/newsroom/news-releases">said Cracker Barrel’s CMO Sarah Moore</a>. “With ‘All the More,’ we’re honoring our legacy while bringing fresh energy, thoughtful craftsmanship and heartfelt hospitality to our guests this fall.”</p> <p>The reality is that Cracker Barrel’s “story” has changed, because it is now 2025 and it’s a publicly traded company. In this day and age, you can’t just be a successful restaurant that grandparents bring their grandkids to so they can share stories from “back in my day…” over large portions of so-so comfort food. You can’t just be a profitable company. You have to grow. You must always grow. The stockholders demand it. They’ll cut your head off and replace you if there isn’t steady, never-ending growth. Making that line go up is all that matters, and if that means ditching a classic logo that might have put off some younger eaters, &nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818">or laying off people endlessly,</a> so be it. Instead of trying to be one thing for some people, Cracker Barrel and other companies desperate to grow must be many things to everyone. And in trying to appeal to all, Cracker Barrel has stripped itself of its famous logo and unique characteristics, which makes it hard to justify going there for a meal.</p> <h2>Cracker Barrel, Welcome To The Culture War</h2> <p>But of course, also because it is 2025, this logo change can’t just be something we all look at, shake our heads at, maybe make a few jokes or comments about, and then move on from. Nope! Changing the logo has set off a firestorm online among chuds and weirdos, with <a href="https://x.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1958279379408372204">one of President Trump’s sons</a> complaining about the change as an example of a company “going woke.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">WTF is wrong with <a href="https://twitter.com/CrackerBarrel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CrackerBarrel</a>??! <a href="https://t.co/LkYB5N34Qi">https://t.co/LkYB5N34Qi</a></p> <p>— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) <a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1958279379408372204?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Conservative activist Robby Starbuck <a href="https://x.com/robbystarbuck/status/1958541477019074867">posted on Thursday:</a> “Good morning @CrackerBarrel! You’re about to learn that wokeness really doesn’t pay.” Over on the Cracker Barrel subreddit, which is a thing even if it has a very tiny community, you can find a strange mix of people complaining about food while sharing memes calling the food joint “Cucker Barrel.”</p> <p>“I think it’s time for the Employees and Customers to Stand Up. Go Woke Go Broke,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackerBarrel/comments/1mvv0n8/i_think_its_time_for_the_employees_and_customers/">said one poster</a>. Another person shared a petition to fire the CEO of Cracker Barrel over the changes. <a href="https://www.change.org/p/fire-the-ceo-and-restore-cracker-barrel-s-classic-look-and-rustic-feel?recruiter=326443188&amp;recruited_by_id=0e810e00-19b2-11e5-a5a1-cdf6156a9733&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_campaign=starter_onboarding_share_social&amp;utm_medium=mobileNativeShare">The petition had one signature</a>, and the poster had 0 upvotes.</p>

 <p>To be clear, I don’t think Cracker Barrel changing a logo is “going woke,” whatever that idiotic complaint means today. Nor do I think it’s an attack on old American values. I do, however, think Cracker Barrel’s simplified logo and shift to more sterile-looking dining rooms are bad and frustrating. I don’t want everything to be targeted to everyone with no distinct traits or features. I’d like to have the choice to go to a place that is filled with old-timey decorations and a charming logo from the ’70s.</p> <p>Also, Cracker Barrel, a few logo changes and some white walls aren’t going to trick me or younger people into eating there. I say lean into your clientele and make the menus cursive and put rotary phones on each table that you have to use to order your food. Give those grandparents even more stuff to point at and go, “Oh, I bet you don’t know what that is!” while their young grandkids roll their eyes.&nbsp; Not everything needs to appeal to the masses. That’s how you end up with boring Marvel movies and dull games that are overstuffed with every feature you can think of. And that sounds like a terrible future.</p>

              <p>Bungie CEO Pete Parsons is leaving after 23 years. Fellow veteran Justin Truman will take over as the storied Halo studio struggles with flagging interest in <em>Destiny 2</em>, the delayed launch of <em>Marathon</em>, and a painful Sony integration following a sky-high <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-ps5-destiny-2-bungie-playstation-microsoft-xbox-ex-1848453326">$3.6 billion acquisition back in 2022</a>.</p> <p>“After more than two decades of helping build this incredible studio, establishing the Bungie Foundation, and growing inspiring communities around our work, I have decided to pass the torch,” Parsons wrote in a blog post <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/passing_the_torch">over on</a> Bungie’s website. “This journey has been the honor of a lifetime. I am deeply proud of the worlds we’ve built together and the millions of players who call them home – and most of all I am privileged by the opportunity to work alongside the incredible minds at Bungie.”</p> <p>Parsons joined Bungie back in 2002 and was an executive producer on <em>Halo 2</em>. He took over the studio when previous CEO Harold Ryan left in 2016, the year before <em>Destiny 2</em> shipped. He helped engineer the studio’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-splits-with-activision-1831651740">exit from a publishing deal with Activision</a> in 2019, and Bungie continued to grow amid near-annual expansions for the hit sci-fi loot shooter.</p>

 <p>But things began to change after selling to Sony in 2022. Bungie’s expertise in multiplayer games didn’t stop PlayStation’s live service strategy from quickly going sideways, and the studio suffered mass layoffs in both 2023 and 2024, with key talent departing, including veteran designers Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy, after a <em>Destiny</em> spin-off <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-02/sony-s-bungie-maker-of-halo-and-destiny-faces-reckoning-after-mass-layoff">codenamed <em>Payback</em> was reportedly canceled</a>.</p> <p><em>IGN</em> reported that <a href="http://phere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover/">a “soul-crushing” atmosphere</a> among some staff in late 2023, amid the first round of cuts, as Bungie’s independence within Sony began to crumble following the declining fortunes of <em>Destiny 2</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-pete-parsons-layoffs-classic-cars-sony-buyout-de-1851610196">Parsons came under fire</a> during the 2024 layoffs after listings for his sports car collection indicated millions in purchases following the lucrative 2022 sale to Sony, even as rank-and-file staff were given pink slips.</p> <p><span data-contrast="none">“When I was asked to lead Bungie in 2015, my goal was to grow us into a studio capable of creating and sustaining iconic, generation-spanning entertainment,” Parsons wrote in his goodbye post. “We’ve been through so much together: we launched a bold new chapter for <em>Destiny</em>, built an enviable, independent live ops organization capable of creating and publishing its own games, and joined the incredible family at Sony Interactive Entertainment.”</span></p>

 <p>More recently, Bungie has faced an uphill battle with <em>Marathon</em>, the extraction shooter revival of one of its oldest franchises. The game was supposed to come out in September <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-delay-bungie-feedback-prox-chat-solo-update-1851784674">but was indefinitely delayed</a> following a middling reception to a closed alpha earlier this year and a plagiarized art scandal that saw the team forced to overhaul marketing assets, including trailers, <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-art-alpha-gameplay-posters-antireal-1851780911">to remove elements created by an outside artist</a>.</p> <p>Truman, a 15-year veteran of Bungie, began working at the studio on the original <em>Destiny</em>. He admitted to some of the studio’s recent fumbles but said it remains committed to “create worlds that inspire friendship.” “I’ve also been part of these efforts at Bungie when we’ve maybe not been at our best,” Truman wrote. “When we’ve stumbled and realized through listening to our community that we had missed the mark. I know I’ve personally learned a lot over the years, as have all of us here, from those conversations.”</p> <p>He added, “We are hard at work right now doing that–both with <em>Marathon</em> and <em>Destiny</em>. We’re currently heads down, but we’ll have more to show you in both of these worlds later this year.”</p>
