              <p>So much of the crap we own is beholden to a long cable and fat adapter to make it work. Our phones, our headphones, even our watches now all have a lithium battery that needs to be charged on the regular. When you need to plug in more than one device at a time, suddenly you space feels like a cobweb of cables running all directions, creating a tangled mess. Or worse, they don’t all fit. So now you’re on the hunt for multiple free wall outlets to get your AirPods up and running again just so you can relisten to the&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> soundtrack while you work. Thankfully, you can take control of your stress and clutter with a good charging station. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4161/">Baseus has a 10-in-1 desktop charge of which Amazon knocked 40% off the price</a>. The charger normally goes for $50, but the discount ends up saving you an even $20. That means you only have to pay $30 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4161/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multi-Device Charging</h2>
<p>This all-in-one charging block combines 10 different ports so you can charge up as many as 10 devices simultaneously. Between them all, you get six AC outlets, three USB-C ports, and one standard USB-A port. With a wide spread of options, you shouldn’t have any issue charging your various devices without the need for a unique charging block. You can just plug your device directly into the unit. In the event you still end up needing to plug an adapter into the AC outlet, you shouldn’t have that common problem of the block taking up multiple slots on the power strip. On the Baseus charger, each outlet faces a different direction to allow for better flexibility.</p>



<p>Designed for desktops and nightstands, the Baseus charging station comes with an adhesive strip for the bottom of the unit. This was it can stand firmly in place to the side of your desk, out of the way, but always where you want it to be.</p>
<p>Whether you’re charging your phone, earbuds, a MacBook, or all three at once, you can expect them to charge up quickly. The Baseus power station is able to deliver a maximum output of 67W. As a point of reference, the USB-C adapter that comes with iPhones nowadays is only 20W. And with GaN6 technology, you can trust your devices will stay safe and cool while charing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4161/">For a limited time, you can secure yourself this versatile 10-in-1 Baseus charging station for $20 off. Get it now for just $30.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re now in the no man’s zone between October’s Prime Day sales and November’s Black Friday sales. You might expect it to be hard to find a good deal across the online retail giant’s website during this time, but you’d be wrong. You can still find great opportunities to save on electronics if you know where to look. For instance, take a gander at this Anker power station. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/">The Anker SOLIX C1000 second-generation portable power station has dropped by nearly 50%</a>. Amazon has the unit listed normally for $799, but after the $370 discount, you can get it for just $429 for a limited time.</p>
<p>The Anker SOLIX C1000 power station has an output of 2,000W (peak of 3,000W). That should be plenty enough power for basically all the appliances you might have with you in your RV on a camping trip or in your truck in the parking lot of your next tailgate. It also serves well in an emergency at home like during a blackout. You can ensure everyone in the house has a fully charged phone and you can run necessary appliances, like your TV and Nintendo Switch 2. How else we going to pass by the time other than some Knockout Tour?</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>With its 10 different ports, you can charge up to 10 devices at once. You have five 2,000W AC ports along with two USB-C 140W ports, one, 15W USB-C port, on USB-A 12W, and one 120W car port.</p>
<p>Fit the power station easily into the trunk of your car. It only measures 15.1 inches by 8.2 inches by 9.6 inches and weighs 24.9 lbs. That’s 14% smaller and 11% lighter than the first-generation Anker SOLIX C1000. It can operate quietly too, running at between zero and 20dbs when discharging under 200W.</p>



<h2>Solar Power Generation</h2>
<p>The power station holds enough charge in its 1,024Wh capacity to fully charge an iPhone 67.7 times over before the Anker SOLIX C1000 runs out of charge itself. When that does happen, you can bring the power station back up to 100% capacity in just 49 minutes when you have it set to UltraFast recharging via the Anker app. You can choose to add on a solar panel and recharge the Anker SOLIX C1000 via solar, which only takes 1.8 hours. Great for extended weekended in the outdoors.</p>
<p>If you choose to add on the 100W solar panel, the full bundle will cost you $679. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/">For just the Anker SOLIX C1000, you can get it for just $429 for a limited time.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[HP 17.3″ Laptop Bundle (64GB RAM, 2TB SSD) Takes Over $3,000 Price Dive as Amazon Clears Out 5-Star Stock]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-17-3%e2%80%b3-laptop-bundle-64gb-ram-2tb-ssd-takes-over-3000-price-dive-as-amazon-clears-out-5-star-stock-2000635420</link>

              <p>We aren’t quite sure who to thank for this latest HP laptop deal at Amazon, but it’s kind of crazy how generous this one is. So, big shout-out to whomever is responsible for taking this 17.3-inch touchscreen HP Business Laptop, loading it with 64GB of DDR5 RAM and a 2TB SSD, and then installing the 12-core Intel Ultra 7 255U processor, and deciding it should be over $3,000 less than the list price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4781/">Granted, that original $4,400 list price was more than a little bit silly, but even so, the final price of $1,140 for a state-of-the-art touchscreen Windows laptop</a> that arrives as loaded as this one does is more than a little bit crazy too. There’s also a free accessories bundle which includes Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, a 7-in-1 USB hub, 128GB thumb drive, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4781/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Down to Business</h2>
<p>The Intel Ultra 7 255U processor would be a stone cold beast under any circumstance thanks to its max speed of 5.2GHz, but then when you add in the 12 TOPS of AI acceleration to drive the Microsoft Copilot AI assistant that’s preinstalled, that’s when the magic happens. Copilot’s bona fides as a top-notch AI assistant are well established, but the AI enhancements don’t end there — useful features like background blur and intelligent noise reduction for video calls and conferencing are also powered by AI.</p>
<p>The rest of the package under the hood of this 17.3-inch touchscreen HP Business Laptop is all about going big, especially the 64GB of DDR5 RAM that is basically a license to open as many tabs and apps as you want without fear of slowdown. That kind of workout also requires a fat storage capacity to hold all of your projects and other files, and this HP has a 2TB SSD ready and waiting.</p>



<h2>Roomy Everywhere You Look</h2>
<p>You can truly appreciate the 2TB of storage and the 64GB of RAM, but the other giant feature on this HP Business Laptop us the one you can actually see and touch — the beautiful 17.3-inch touchscreen display. Not only is there more than enough room for truly immersive streaming or as many windows as you want to open for multitasking, they’re all touch-controlled so this HP laptop can work like the world’s most powerful tablet.</p>
<p>Everything about this 17.3-inch HP touchscreen laptop is big, except its 0.81-inch thickness that makes it an easy backpack carry. The biggest feature of all is the price, or more accurately, the discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4781/">Amazon’s limited-time 74% off deal on this 17.3-inch touchscreen HP Business Laptop and its accessory bundle brings that price down to $1,140</a> — exceptionally good for a laptop this stacked.</p>
