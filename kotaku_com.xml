            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A new report claims that Activision’s upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-trailer-xbox-ps5-1851784008"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a> will merge the franchise’s famous multiplayer with the game’s single-player campaign by having the final mission take place in a 32-player online match.</p><p>In June, Xbox and Activision <a href="https://youtu.be/uUo5gnaYB_w">officially revealed <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a> as the next entry in the uber-popular shooter series. The game’s first teaser trailer offered up some glimpses of its future-based campaign as well as a brief look at multiplayer and Zombies, two <em>Call of Duty</em> staples at this point. We also know the game will feature a campaign that can be played solo or with up to three other players in co-op. That’s not a first for the series, but it isn’t common. What would be a first is that, reportedly, <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s campaign will end in a climactic mission set inside a multiplayer match.</p><p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-avalon-map-campaign/">On August 14, as reported by </a><em><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-avalon-map-campaign/">Insider Gaming</a>,</em> sources told the outlet that <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s campaign will feature 12 missions, and the final one will integrate the campaign into a 32-player multiplayer experience. The mission will take place in the map “Avalon,” which has been rumored for a bit now to be a battle royale location, but is actually the setting of this odd campaign experiment.</p><div data-player-id="plTxkEoh" data-name="Video_Collapse_Autoplay_SoundOff" id="cls-video-container-n9o50j6H"> <p><em>Insider Gamin</em>g says that the final mission sounds a lot like it will be an extraction-based experience with players needing to complete objectives before exiting the level and, presumably, finishing the game’s final campaign mission, though we’ll have to wait and see just what this all looks like in practice. While I’m always happy to see <em>Call of Duty</em> trying new things and shaking up the formula, I’m not a big fan of locking the game’s final mission behind an internet requirement. Will people be unable to play the last mission in 20-30 years when the servers are dead? Hopefully there’s a backup plan for offline folks.</p> <p>The merging of campaign and multiplayer like this is reportedly part of a larger push in <em>Black Ops 7</em> to merge the game’s various modes and offer players full progression across every part of the upcoming shooter, with the idea being that regardless of where you play, even in campaign, you can level up weapons, characters, and the battle pass. That’s a neat idea that seems inspired by <em>Fortnite’s</em> universal progression and XP system, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/coming-soon-progress-your-fortnite-passes-by-playing-any-experience?lang=en-US">which Epic implemented last year</a>.</p> <p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> doesn’t have a release date yet, but Xbox and Activision will show off the game’s multiplayer later this month at Gamescom, and that seems like a fine time to announce a launch date. If the past is prologue, I’d expect you’ll be playing <em>Black Ops 7</em> in October or November.</p> </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-final-campaign-mission-will-reportedly-be-a-big-multiplayer-battle-2000617873]]></content:encoded>

              <p>It feels like a long time ago that Saber Interactive and Universal announced<em><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/jurassic-park-survival--2"> Jurassic Park: Survival</a>.</em> And that’s because yeah, it’s been nearly two years! Since then, we’ve not gotten much else about the game, but earlier today, we finally got some fresh looks at <em>Survival </em>in action.</p> <p><em>Jurassic Park: Survival</em> is an upcoming first-person action-horror game set one day after the events of the original<a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-jurassic-world-rebirth-movies-ranked-1851776876"><em> Jurassic Park</em> film</a>. You play as a new character, Dr. Maya Joshi, who is left on the island after everyone else escapes. Now she has to survive (oh, I get the name of the game now) while trying to figure out a way off dino island, aka Isla Nublar. <a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-survival-fps-action-trailer-game-awards-1851083053">The game was announced 19 months ago, all the way back in December 2023</a>, and since then, we’ve not seen much about it. That changed on Thursday with a new behind-the-scenes featurette from Universal and developers Saber Interactive.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Jurassic Park: Survival | Behind-The-Scenes Featurette" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lLuxDHCY6kw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>On August 14, the official <em>Jurassic World/Jurassic Park</em> YouTube account posted <a href="https://youtu.be/lLuxDHCY6kw">a nearly six-minute-long video</a> featuring interviews with various developers and others working on <em>Survival.</em> And sprinkled throughout this video, which is mostly focused on all the movie-accurate details in <em>Survival</em>‘s environments,&nbsp;how it connects to the film, and the new main character–are some new looks at how the <a href="https://kotaku.com/dinosaur-games-dino-crisis-jurassic-park-horror-pc-ps5-1851771664">franchise’s iconic dinosaurs</a> will appear in the game.</p>

 <p>Look at that T. rex! I love it! And we get some more glimpses of how Velociraptors and the extremely tall Brachiosaurus look in<em> Jurassic Park: Survival,</em> too. As a massive <em>Jurassic Park</em> fan, all of this has me really excited to play the game. Sadly, we still don’t have a release date for <em>Survival</em>. And I’m not feeling good about it arriving this year. In a press release shared with <em>Kotaku</em> announcing this new video, Saber Interactive explained that “<em>J</em><i>urassic Park: Survival</i><i>&nbsp;</i>won’t be present at this year’s Gamescom.” Maybe it still shows up at Geoff Kielghley’s annual Opening Night Live ceremony later this month, but I’m not holding my breath about that.</p> <p>If you want to kill some time while waiting, you can always watch the original announcement trailer from 2023. It’s pretty cool.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Jurassic Park: Survival | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UinsNBOTNyU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>
