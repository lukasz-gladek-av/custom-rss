              <p>The 2026 Game Developers Conference (GDC), which has been renamed the GDC Festival of Gaming, takes place in early March. Ahead of the San Francisco-based industry event, GDC has released <a href="https://kotaku.com/gdc-2025-developer-survey-generative-ai-pc-switch-2-1851744292/2">its annual survey of game industry developer sentiment</a>. Over 2,300 industry professionals responded on topics ranging from genAI to layoffs, providing a small snapshot of what’s going on across video game companies big and small. It’s not a pretty picture.</p> <h2>A majority of game developers now think genAI will hurt the game industry</h2> <p>Back in 2024, game makers were relatively split on the advantages and downsides of the emerging LLM craze. Now they are increasingly horrified by it. Last year, 13 percent of respondents <a href="https://kotaku.com/google-ai-genai-nintendo-zelda-breath-wild-mario-64-project-genie-2000664227">thought genAI</a> would have a positive impact on the game industry. In 2026 it’s just 7 percent. Instead, 52 percent think the technology will have a negative impact, up double digits from just 12 months ago. Artists, storytellers, programmers–they’re all down on it. Still, actual adoption of the technology for things as simple as writing emails is growing.</p>

 <h2>Developers are bailing on making games for Xbox</h2> <p>According to the new survey, roughly 40 percent of respondents said they were interested in making their next game for PlayStation 5 or Switch 2. Only 20 percent were planning to bring it to Xbox Series X/S. That’s still above Android, iOS, and the original Switch, but <a href="https://kotaku.com/games-skipping-xbox-microsoft-asks-devs-studio-why-ps5-1851663611">it’s a steep drop-off</a> from last year when the Xbox number was 34 percent. PC is still far and away the most popular platform. Maybe that’s why Microsoft is pivoting to it.</p> <h2>Union support is surging</h2> <p>Over 80 percent of U.S.-based developers told the survey they support unionization, with 62 percent saying they were interested in joining one. Those numbers show there’s likely room for <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-devs-win-first-ever-union-contact-at-a-major-g-1851783142">many more game studios to organize</a>, as only 13 percent of respondents said they’re actually currently in a union. Union drives have been sweeping through Microsoft-owned subsidiaries thanks to a neutrality clause the company previously agreed to, but unions have struggled to take hold at many other big publishers like Electronic Arts and 2K Games.</p>

 <h2>A third of U.S. developers said they were laid off in the last two years</h2> <p>That’s a devastating number which shows that the full impact of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492">recent downsizing spree</a> will still be with the industry for years to come. Meanwhile, 17 percent of respondents said they were laid off within the last 12 months, a steady annual increase over the previous two years. Even worse, nearly 50 percent of people laid off weren’t able to find another job in the video game industry during that time.</p>

 <h2>Trump take game</h2> <p>The administration’s trade war and anti-immigrant crackdown appears to be taking <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881">a real toll on the game industry</a>. According to the survey, 31 percent of respondents canceled travel plans to the U.S. while another third are currently reconsidering future travel. A whopping 60 percent of non-U.S. industry leaders said the policies had negatively impacted their desire to conduct business based in the country. On the trade side, 38 percent of respondents said tariffs had impacted their financial decisions.</p>

              <p>Valentine’s Day is just around the corner, and what better way to show your love than flowers that you can build together and never have to replace? We’re talking about LEGO roses, which aren’t just a sweet gesture, but also look incredibly beautiful and require zero upkeep.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6962/">If you haven’t picked a gift up yet, or are looking for a second one, the LEGO Roses set is available for just under $10 at Amazon, after a nice $5 discount</a>. It’s a great time to grab one without overspending, and even pick up a few, because a bouquet never hurts.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6962/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Quick to Build</h2>
<p>It’s not one of those massive builds that takes days and weeks to complete. LEGO keeps it short and sweet with this one. You’re getting a total of just 120 pieces, which come together to make two beautiful roses with adjustable stems. The stem of each rose measures over 10 in. (26 cm) long, so it’s perfect for displaying in a vase. You can plan a cute LEGO date around building these with your partner, while also asking each other thoughtful questions for a meaningful conversation, or go down memory lane together. Maybe stream a cute, romantic movie as you build – the possibilities are endless!</p>
<p>These are great as Valentine’s Day gifts, but also make a thoughtful present for Mother’s Day, Women’s Day, birthdays, and anniversaries. You can even treat yourself to a set because hey, you need to appreciate yourself too.</p>



<p>Building these is pretty straightforward. The set comes with a detailed instruction booklet that takes you through each step one-by-one. The book includes visuals to assist you, which makes the process even easier. LEGO also has its own building app – the LEGO Builder – which offers 3D instructions. You can zoom in on the blocks from each angle to understand the steps better. The app also lets you track your progress, build with friends, and save sets.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6962/">You can now grab the LEGO Roses set for just under $10, after Amazon took $5 off its usual $15 price.</a> If you’re open to spending a bit more, it’s also worth checking out other sets in LEGO’s Botanical collection. Several options are discounted right now, so you can mix and match flowers for a fuller, more colorful bouquet!</p>

              <p>The Pokémon Company has issued an apology after a listing appeared on its official site for a&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG</em> event said to be taking place at the Yasukuni Shrine. This controversial site has repeatedly caused consternation in Japan when visited by political figures, and even by previous Pokémon employees, and once again people were upset to see the location listed as the site of a TCG tournament.</p> <p>The Yasukuni Shrine commemorates the Japanese people who died in conflicts from 1869 to 1954, and thus includes the soldiers who died as part of Japan’s forces fighting for the Axis powers in World War II, many of whom were charged with the most serious of war crimes. As such, it’s a very controversial site, both within and without the country, and it causes serious stirs whenever anyone of prominence chooses to make a public visit. Indeed, The Pokémon Company discovered this for itself in 2019 when a number of employees from Creatures visited the Shinto shrine for its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsum%C5%8Dde"><i>hatsumōde</i></a>.</p>

 <p>Given its hugely complicated politics and the controversies that arise every time it’s visited, TPC clearly doesn’t want it used as the site of a <em>PTCG</em> event. However, live events are added to the company’s site by those with an official <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>Play certification, rather than by TPC itself. It works the same all around the world—if you want to find a local Play event near you, <a href="https://events.pokemon.com/EventLocator/?locale=en-us">you can look them up on the U.S. version of the site</a>. So it seems someone with such a certification in Japan added the event to the vast numbers listed for the country.</p> <p>“On the event search page of the ‘Pokémon Card Game Trainers Website’ operated by our company,” <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/media/news/detail/368.html">begins a statement on&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em>‘s corporate site</a> (via machine translation), “information about an event scheduled to be held at Yasukuni Shrine was posted.” The statement goes on to call allowing this Yasukuni Shrine event to be listed the result of a “lack of due diligence,” adding, “even though it should not have been held in the first place.”</p>

 <p>The event was canceled once discovered, say TPC, adding an apology (again, via machine translation). “We have received feedback and opinions from various parties since the information about this event was released, and we sincerely apologize for this.” The company adds that it will “fundamentally change and strengthen the review system and confirmation process for event information” to prevent something like this happening again.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Nintendo Direct Rumors Point To An Incoming Flood Of Switch 2 Ports]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/february-nintendo-direct-switch-2-3d-mario-2000664537</link>
            <guid>1420885</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The usual suspects are buzzing about an upcoming Nintendo Direct to kick off February. This one will reportedly be a Partner Showcase, so while I wouldn’t expect teases for anything wild like a new <em>3D Mario</em> game, we’ll probably got a healthy influx of new <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ports-cyberpunk-2077-ps4-ps5-xbox-dlss-outlaws-1851782817">Switch 2 ports</a> to help button down the first half of the platform’s year.</p> <p>Nintendo traditionally holds a February showcase to preview what’s coming and help fill in release calendar slots for its loyal fans. Podcasting insider <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2016962284921249815">NateTheHate</a> and YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKp9okfMtdI">GameXplain</a> have both suggested 2026 will follow a similar pattern, though the event will be a Partner Showcase rather than a full-blown first-party Direct. <em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-coming-next-week-dedicated-to-partner-games/">VGC</a></em> was also able to corroborate those claims. So expect a new Nintendo Direct somewhere around February 3-5.</p>

 <p>But what is Nintendo likely to show? Well, we’re still waiting on firm release dates for <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Switch 2. The latter was recently rumored to be coming near the end of February. There’s also been plenty of smoke about <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> making it over to Nintendo’s latest console, as well as the port for <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> coming sooner than expected. <em>Metaphor: Refantazio</em>, <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, and <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> also seem like potential candidates.</p> <p>I’m more curious to see where this missing Microsoft support for the Switch 2 is. Some version of <em>Call of Duty</em> is rumored to be coming to the platform this spring and the company still hasn’t confirmed a <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> remake port for the Switch 2. There’s also plenty of lower-hanging fruit like<em> Sea of Thieves</em>, <em>Diablo 4</em>, and <em>Avowed</em>, which is coming to PS5 next month. <em>Starfield</em> would also be a big get. Is a Switch 2 port part of the game’s rumored 2.0 plans? Hopefully.</p>

 <p>Announcements for new games would also be nice. We know we’re getting FromSoftware’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-duskbloods-elden-ring-hidetaka-miyazaki-switch-2-1851774753">multiplayer action game <em>Duskbloods</em></a> sometime this year. It’ll be interesting to see if any other major studios reveal exclusive side-projects for the Nintendo platform. But in the new era of every game being playable on every device, that seems less likely than a slew of new AAA ports.</p>
