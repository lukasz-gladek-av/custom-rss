              <p><span>Extraction shooter and recent Game Awards winner </span><i><span>Arc Raiders </span></i><span>just dropped a massive, winter-themed update. Cold Snap, as it’s called, adds a map condition that can cause frostbite, a timed event that lets players earn rewards (including Raider Tokens), a Candleberry Banquet project that also offers up some currency and cosmetics, and, apparently, way more generous </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-blueprint-locations-night-raid-map-2000650966"><span>blueprint drops</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>A </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1pom4pm/keep_the_blueprint_drop_rate/"><span>popular post on the official </span><i><span>Arc Raiders </span></i><span>subreddit</span></a><span> titled “Keep the blueprint drop rate” argues for developer Embark Studios to make the alleged changes to said drop rate permanent. “</span><span>Instead of sitting on gear and going with free loadouts, this incentivizes players to use loadouts with safe pockets and get some skin in the game,” the post reads. “What this game needs is to better incentivize bold play.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>, you have the option to venture up to the dangerous surface with either a free loadout of random, low-tier loot that you won’t mind losing if you get jumped by another player or zapped by a Hornet, or a custom loadout that often includes a safe pocket, in which you can store one precious item in case you die aboveground or fail to extract. The benefit of the custom loadout is that you’re guaranteed to leave with </span><i><span>something</span></i><span>, so long as you put it in your safe pocket, but the downside is that you run the risk of losing an upgraded gun or a higher-quality shield.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Many </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span> players prefer to play conservatively, avoiding conflict with enemy squads at all costs. I can understand this, as I often run around the game with proximity chat on, yelling, “I’m doing a quest, please leave me alone!” But if there’s an elusive blueprint tucked away in my backpack, I can feel my trigger finger itching—this might mean that the next few weeks of </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span> gameplay are more ruthless than ever before…</span></p>

 <p><span>I played a bit yesterday after the Cold Snap update and got three blueprints over the course of a few matches, which is definitely more than I’ve seen before. In one match, I was in a pure panic trying to get to an elevator with a shiny new gun, several stacks of Candleberries (which are found outside in the cold), and </span><i><span>two</span></i><span> blueprints, all while frostbite steadily depleted my health and a damn Wasp flitted overhead. I made it out, knuckles whiter than the layer of snow covering my backpack.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>When asked if the blueprint drop was adjusted, a spokesperson for </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span> pointed me to two bullet points in the </span><a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/cold-snap-patch-notes"><span>most recent patch notes</span></a><span>:</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Increased some item and blueprint spawn rates in Stella Montis.</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Expanded blueprint spawn locations to improve availability in areas that were underrepresented.</span></li> </ul> <p><span>It’s not clear if this change is intended to be permanent, but of course Embark Studios may adjust the blueprint drop if it finds it’s become </span><i><span>too</span></i><span> easy to grab them. After all, avarice is a sin, and the greed on display by </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1po80ca/yeah_so_they_have_changed_the_blueprint_droprate/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>this player with 15 blueprints in their backpack </span></a><span>sickens me.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For now, there are more blueprints out there. Go forth and be merry, Raiders. Please don’t shoot.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span> hasn’t received a major update since 2021, and Nintendo previously showed no interest in continuing development on the five-year-old game. It was a huge surprise when Nintendo, in October, announced that </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </span></i><span>would get not only a Nintendo Switch 2 edition, but a 3.0 content update, too. On Oct. 30, Nintendo dropped </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-update-free-2000640118"><span>a 12-minute video breaking down the new details</span></a><span> and gave press an early, hands-off look earlier in December.</span></p> <p><span>Nintendo previewed the update in a 25-minute demo </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-30-first-impressions-of-the-switch-2-version"><span>covered by </span><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>, which said the update is largely focused on design and decor and Nintendo Switch 2 quality-of-life improvements. Here’s what we know so far.</span></p> <h2><strong>When’s it coming out?</strong></h2> <p><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span>‘ 3.0 update and Nintendo Switch 2 edition will be released on Jan. 15, 2026. The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition costs $64.99 on its own, or $4.99 for people who already own the game on Nintendo Switch. All players will get the 3.0 update content for no additional cost.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654254" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654254"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654254">Image: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <h2><strong>What’s new in the Switch 2 version?</strong></h2> <p><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span> on the Nintendo Switch 2 will benefit from the console’s mouse controls, which will make placing decor a bit less fiddly. And that makes sense, paired with a content update that’s largely centered on decor. Using the Joy-Con 2s as a mouse makes clicking and dragging stuff around the map much simpler.</span></p>

 <p><span>IGN said the </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span> Switch 2 edition also has an exclusive device—a megaphone. It’s used to call out to villagers and other visiting characters so they’re easier to find. To do so, you literally have to say a character’s name into the Switch 2 microphone, </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-updates-preview/"><span>according to </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i></a><span>. However, the megaphone can only be used for characters that are outside of buildings—ones that would actually “hear” you—so it isn’t as useful for anyone inside a structure, </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span> said.</span></p>

 <p><span>One initial draw is the upgraded multiplayer; up to 12 people can congregate on an island. But </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span> reported that this feature requires everyone to be on a Switch 2. Plus, the edition makes use of the new camera system to display a player’s face near their character.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654253" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654253"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654253">Image: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <h2><strong>How about the 3.0 content update?</strong></h2> <p><span>The big addition in </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span>‘ 3.0 update is the Kapp’n family’s hotel—your </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> island is now a destination not only for your friends, but visiting </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> characters. Leilani, Kapp’n’s wife, runs the hotel and gives you the opportunity to decorate up to 10 rooms, per </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>IGN </span></i><span>said it’s something to be unlocked, but it’s tied to the pier—not optional or moveable. It’s similar to the </span><i><span>Happy Home Paradise</span></i><span> DLC, IGN said, in which you’ll decorate rooms, just by theme and not to a specific character’s interests.</span></p>

 <h3><span>Designing hotel rooms</span></h3> <p><i><span>IGN </span></i><span>said that you’ll be able to design around themes—like, say, seaside—but don’t have to. You’ll be able to choose from different items, but aren’t required to use anything in particular, unlike in </span><i><span>Happy Home Paradise</span></i><span>. You’ll have your full catalog of items to use, as well as items related to the specific theme.</span></p>

 <h3><span>Hotel shopping and new items</span></h3> <p><span>You earn hotel tickets by designing rooms, and then use the tickets to earn more things from a hotel-specific shop manned by Gran. </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i><span> said that a number of new items were left out of the preview, but that it’s a “very large amount of furniture.” There are new Nintendo-themed items, too, like the Ultra Hand and different NES games playable on classic consoles purchasable from the hotel lobby shop. (These need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to play.)</span></p> <p><span>Other new items include </span><i><span>Splatoon</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Lego</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda</span></i><span> stuff.</span></p> <h3><span>Crafting tweaks</span></h3> <p><span>One of the quality-of-life adjustments in the 3.0 content update is the ability to craft several items at once, using materials from storage instead of inside a player’s pockets, Nintendo announced during its October preview. Simply put, crafting could be a pain in the ass before; this should help, especially when you’ve got a lot to make.</span></p> <p><span>With so much new design and decor content, easing the pain of crafting a lot of stuff feels essential to the experience. Making things easier once again, there’s also a Resetti “reset” service to quickly clear a part of your island.</span></p> <h3><span>Slumber Island</span></h3> <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/845242/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update-switch-2-edition-features"><i><span>The Verge</span></i></a><span> described the Slumber Island feature, seen in the December preview, as “extra sandboxes” to decorate and play in. You’ll be able to set the time of day and weather to create whatever vibe you’re into—without messing about on your permanent island. </span><i><span>The Verge</span></i><span> said it looked like a “quicker and smoother” way to dream up a design and build it all out: Items from your in-game catalog appear immediately, and terraforming has a little quality-of-life improvement, it seems, to help make the process less painful. Plus, Lloyd can build bridges and inclines immediately, according to </span><i><span>The Verge</span></i><span>. No waiting around.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-horizons-anime-mega-starmie-friede-episode-2000654235</link>
            <guid>1386400</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>We here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> have…complicated, multifaceted feelings on Mega Starmie. The Mega Evolved starfish started out being seen as one of the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-patrick-star-jokes-2000636057"><span>silliest new transformations</span></a><span> in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>, then turned out to be </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-jokes-memes-videos-art-2000638556"><span>one of the MVPs of the RPG</span></a><span>. Despite all the endearment I feel toward Mega Starmie and its weird long legs and arms now, seeing the thing in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>anime series has reawakened my innermost disgust reflex. I have many questions about this creature, but as far as the show goes, one comes to the forefront: Why does it look like Mega Starmie has been oiled up?</span></p> <p><span>The latest episode of </span><i><span>Pokémon Horizons</span></i><span>, titled “The Catcher in the Sky,” premiered in Japan last week, and in it, one the new series’ main characters, Friede, was revealed to have captured a Starmie that is capable of undergoing Mega Evolution. When the starfish is in this state, it stands as tall as its trainer and moves its arms and legs in a very uncomfortably human-like manner. Friede seems to be hamming up the human characteristics of Mega Starmie by calling it “Instructor Starmie,” though it’s unclear just what instructing it’s supposed to be doing.</span></p>

 <p><span>Anyway, the creature is shiny, as if Friede oiled it up before he reunited with the rest of the cast, and </span><i><span>Horizons</span></i><span> does a great job of exaggerating its animations to make it unnerving. Put it all together, and you’ve got a Pokémon that is just awful to look at. Way to go, team. You nailed it.</span></p>   <p><span>I haven’t been keeping current with </span><i><span>Horizons</span></i><span>, but I </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-horizons-anime-netflix-liko-roy-captain-pikachu-1851326504"><span>really enjoyed what I saw of the show when it made its English debut</span></a><span>. The series’ storylines have more of an arc compared to those in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389"><span>previous series</span></a><span> which was led by Ash Ketchum and kind of written for the series to have no real end goal and for episodes to stand alone. It seems like </span><i><span>Horizons </span></i><span>has been sticking with that storytelling approach as it enters its third season. The episodes that have been dubbed in English are streaming on Netflix.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Fresh off its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261"><span>Game of the Year</span></a><span> win, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a><span> has a new, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-free-dlc-patch-notes-photo-mode-2000653032"><span>free update</span></a><span> that adds additional levels, upgrades, and boss fights to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/best-rpgs-2025-clair-obscur-avowed-assassins-creed-2000654194"><span>the RPG</span></a><span>. If it’s been a while since you checked in with Verso, Maelle, and the rest of the expedition, maybe, I dunno, go practice your parrying before you head into the new content, because even the sickos who were already dodging the game’s most elaborate onslaughts are having trouble with these challenging fights.</span></p> <p><span>The “Thank You Update,” as Sandfall Interactive is calling it, includes an Endless Tower, which features revamped boss battles from the base game for an extra challenge. </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>’s late-game boss fights and secret battles were already daunting tasks, and now the game has added a plethora of new fights that are exhausting just to watch. Look at how long this combo goes on in the new Duollistes fight:</span></p>

   <p><span>Some of the update’s challenges come from a seemingly never-ending barrage of attacks, but a lot of its fights are pretty standard </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>fare in that they </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscure-parry-sakapetate-chromatic-troubadour-1851781507"><span>trick you with multiple fakeout attacks</span></a><span>, baiting you into dodging and parrying before an enemy actually strikes, throwing off your rhythm and leaving you open to attack.</span></p>

   <p><span>Oh, and one boss will just straight up nuke your team. Good luck parrying that one.</span></p>   <p><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> fans are no strangers to challenging boss fights, but some feel that the Thank You Update’s boss run is too much. This account from </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pnn1se/im_officially_done_with_this_update/"><span>Reddit user Maggot_6661</span></a><span> sums it up:</span></p>

 <p><span>“I love this game, truly,” they wrote. “This update is great, but these bosses are too much. Unless I spend a full 9 to 5 learning the reaction times only a robot can reach, I will never beat them. I already have to spend the day searching for a job and going disappointment after disappointment, I’m not mentally strong enough to suffer through these bosses afterwards, all it’s doing is making me not like the game… which is something I don’t want to happen.”</span></p> <p><span>Sometimes walking away from the biggest challenges a game has to offer is the right call. To this day, I’ve never played through some of the secret bosses in </span><i><span>Final Fantasy X</span></i><span>, and I have art from that game tattooed on my arm. I think I’d rather just enjoy the game I played than bang my head against a wall on some of its more challenging fights, so I won’t judge anyone who walks away from </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>’s Endless Tower. To those of you who do beat them, thank you for your service. “For those who come after.”</span></p>
