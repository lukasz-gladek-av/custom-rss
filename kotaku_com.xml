              <p>A TikTok content creator allegedly flew all the way from the United States to Edinburgh, Scotland to stand outside the offices of <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a> developers Rockstar North and yell at people entering and exiting the studio. According to the creator, he is “sick and tired” of waiting for a new trailer or information on any further delays.</p> <p>On September 30, <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/gta-6-devs-harassed-by-tiktoker/">as spotted by </a><em>TheGamer,</em> TikTok user Backonboulevard shared a video on the social media service that appeared to show him staking out the Rockstar North office in Scotland and then yelling at two different people that he seemingly assumed were developers working on<em> GTA 6</em> after spotting them entering and exiting the building. The video has over 140,000 views and is currently pinned on the TikTok user’s channel.</p>

 <p>In the first incident, a person can be seen walking toward the office when Backonboulevard yells at them: “When’s the delay? When’s the next trailer? I wanna know!” The person shrugs, starts walking away quickly, and replies, “I don’t know.”</p>

   <p>In another incident shown in the video, Backonboulevard seemingly follows a person after they have presumably left the office and shouts at them, asking: “When’s the delay happening? Is there another delay? What about the trailer? Another trailer? You can’t tell me? You can’t tell me? You can’t tell me nothing?” That person looks visibly scared and understandably nervous about a random dude aggressively confronting them in the dark, and quickly flees the scene as the TikTok creator follows before the video cuts.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted the TikTok user about the video and reached out to Rockstar Games.</p> <p>“I’m sick and tired of waiting for the answers,” explained Backonboulevard in the video. At another point, he showed the outside of Rockstar North’s offices to prove he was there. “Right now we are here, right here, live from Rockstar North. I told you guys I wasn’t playing around.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://x.com/GameRoll_/status/1973022044251152503">On Tuesday, the video was flagged by <em>GTA</em> content creator GameRoll on Twitter</a>. “If you’re waiting outside of somebody’s workplace to harass employees over a video game, give your head a wobble,” said GameRoll.</p> <p>While many in the comments below GameRoll’s post shared disbelief and anger over what Backonboulevard seemingly did, there are many, many comments below the original video on TikTok that take the creator’s side and blame Rockstar’s lack of information and new trailers for the harassment. And to be clear: That’s fucking stupid and you should never, ever, ever sit outside a video game studio and harass the people inside and demand answers from them. That will never work out, it might get you in trouble legally, and it’s just a dick move.</p> <p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> is set to launch in May 2026 <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-may-2026-too-many-games-rockstar-trailer-2-1851778860">after being delayed earlier this year</a>. It will launch on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Don’t yell at the devs about it, okay?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Peacemaker’s dance emote will return to <em>Fortnite</em> now that Epic Games is satisfied it had nothing to do with Nazi imagery. Following the reveal of the HBO show’s recent season 2 twist, the company implied it was concerned the dance moves<a href="https://kotaku.com/peacemaker-fortnite-nazi-emote-season-2-spoilers-2000629842"> intentionally recreated a swastika</a>. The emote will now return next week, with modified animations.</p> <p>“We’ve worked closely with our partners at Warner Bros. Games to confirm there were no creative intentions to connect the Peaceful Hips Emote and the current <em>Peacemaker</em> storyline,” the<em> Fortnite</em> account on X posted on Wednesday. “To avoid any confusion, we’re modifying the Emote choreography in next week’s update. If they prefer, players can return the Emote without using a ticket.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/ial5jDTIFI">https://t.co/ial5jDTIFI</a> <a href="https://t.co/CnsrL8QL7t">pic.twitter.com/CnsrL8QL7t</a></p> <p>— Leryensu (@iLegendTz) <a href="https://twitter.com/iLegendTz/status/1973484250289807592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><strong>Spoiler warning:</strong> we’re about to mention some major plot points from <em>Peacemaker</em> season 2.</p> <p>This whole thing started after the alternate universe that John Cena’s Chris Smith has been exploring this season was revealed to be one in which Hitler’s Germany won WWII and America is now run by Nazis. If you then went back and looked at the&nbsp; dance in the Peaceful Hips <em>Fortnite</em> emote, which is supposed to be the one Cena does in the season 2 intro, you can sort of see that maybe there’s a swastika in there somewhere if you overlay multiple freeze frames.</p> <p>Epic Games then pulled the emote and said it would investigate to see if this had been done by someone at Warner Bros. on purpose. It seems the company is now satisfied that it was just an unintended coincidence. But what fans really want to know is if the dance will actually sync up to the music this time the way it’s choreographed in the show. We’ll know when the emote returns during <em>Fortnite</em>‘s reset next week on October 9.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-failed-game-streaming-service-luna-pivots-snoop-dogg-ai-2000630696</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-turns-to-ai-snoop-dogg-to-save-failed-cloud-gaming-service.1314253/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-announces-luna-another-cloud-based-streaming-ga-1845170977">Luna, Amazon’s video game cloud-streaming service</a>, is shifting gears. While the service will still feature AAA video games like <em>Fallout</em> and <em>Dead Island,</em> the retail giant has announced new plans to “reimagine” Luna as a way for families to play casual, easier-to-learn games using their phones. And the first one of these games Amazon revealed is a courtroom comedy game featuring an AI-powered Snoop Dogg as the judge. Hmm.</p> <p>Launched back in 2020, <a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-cloud-streaming-war-xbox-ps5-ps-portal-luna-1851704159">Amazon Luna followed in the footsteps of Google’s video game streaming service</a>, Stadia. But unlike Stadia, <a href="https://kotaku.com/stadia-google-refund-cloud-streaming-assassins-creed-1849597014">which died back in 2022</a>, Amazon has continued to support Luna, offering a subscription service with access to over 100 games as well as giving Prime members a small catalog of games to play for free. It’s never felt like Luna was a big hit, though, despite some publishers like Ubisoft and EA continuing to support it. Well, Amazon seems to have admitted it wasn’t working, because the company just revealed big plans to rebrand Luna as a more casual experience built around couch co-op and new, unique games.</p>

  <p>On October 1, <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/new-amazon-luna">Amazon announced that later this year, Luna will change.</a> While the service will still allow you to buy and play AAA games, Amazon is going to target, as explained in a press release about the pivot, “the <span>100s of millions of people who&nbsp;</span><span>want</span><span> to experience the magic of playing games on the big screen but feel left out” due to games being too complicated or consoles being too expensive. Amazon’s play is to turn Luna into a place where friends and family members can gather around the TV, pull out their phones, and play less complicated games together. If this sounds a lot like Jackbox, well, congratulations, you too can be an Amazon Gaming executive.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p>The big centerpiece of this rebrand is Game Night, a new Amazon-developed hub within Luna that will offer a variety of Jackbox-like, family-friendly, casual games. Players just scan a QR code using their phone, and a few seconds later, they’re having a great time playing… a Snoop Dogg courtroom game powered by AI?</p>

 <p>Yeah, the big game revealed today is <span><i>Courtroom Chaos: Starring Snoop Dogg,&nbsp;</i>which Amazon describes as an “</span><span>AI‑powered improv courtroom game where players invent outrageous characters, spin wild stories, and do whatever it takes to defend their testimonies before Judge Snoop Dogg.” Gather around, grandma, pull out your Cricket Wireless smartphone, and let’s yell at an AI-powered recreation of a famous rapper who has, <a href="https://www.snooppassport.xyz/">let’s say,</a> <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/snoop-dogg-criticizes-lgbtq-couple-disney-lightyear-1236353064/">made some</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/01/20/g-s1-43733/snoop-dogg-trump-perform-inauguration">bad choices in recent years</a>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>Will this big pivot work out? I have no idea. A lot of this pitch reminds me of the same stuff Google said about Stadia and what Intellivision promised about <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-new-gaming-console-thats-become-a-giant-car-crash-1847699027">the disaster that is the Amico console</a>. Maybe Amazon will find success where others haven’t? Maybe. I mean, it’s not like Luna’s setting the world on fire at the moment. We’ll find out when the big pivot happens later this year.</p>

<p><i>No Man’s Sky</i> continues to impress with its regular updates, and the most recent one was surely one of the most eventful. That’s because it allows players to build massive ships of their own design, with fully explorable interiors, resulting in some epic ships their creators are sharing across the internet.</p> <p>If you frequent <i>NMS</i> spaces online, you’ve likely seen some of these. But whether you’re a regular spacefarer or it’s been some time since you’ve taken a look at Hello Games’ vast and ever-improving galaxy, I invite you to have a gander at some of the most impressive ship builds out there.</p>

 <h2><span id="from-star-wars-to-the-matrix,-five-awesome-recreations-of-famous-ships"></span>From <i>Star Wars</i> to <i>The Matrix</i>, five awesome recreations of famous ships<span></span></h2> <p>Give folks the ability to make stuff in a video game and you’ll quickly see recreations of beloved people, places, or things from TV shows, film, and other games. In <i>No Man’s Sky</i>, that mostly means ships, and there are tons of excellent recreations of famous ships out there in the <i>NMS </i>galaxy. Here are five standouts.</p>

 <h3>John_Dog_’s Millennium Falcon from <i>Star Wars</i></h3>  <p>It was hard to not just fill this list up with <i>Star Wars</i> recreations. Though it required a bit of glitching to make happen, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nui1ju/i_know_theres_been_a_lot_of_these_but_i_had_to/">this Falcon</a> is one of the most accurate I’ve seen.</p>

 <hr> <h3>Own–Astronomer-1296’s Sea Duck from <i>Duck Tales</i></h3>  <p>Maybe this one technically belongs in the collection of sillier ships you’ll find below, but given how ships can now land on water, there’s a satisfying fusion of form and function in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nhh5qz/i_think_ive_peaked_the_sea_duck/">this <i>Duck Tales</i> recreation</a>.</p>

 <hr> <h3>Due_Willow_137’s Pyramid ship from <i>Destiny 2</i></h3>  <p>No, this is not a screenshot from <i>Destiny 2</i>, though it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nu8e1s/pyramid_vessel/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">sure as hell looks like one</a>.</p> <hr> <h3>solidsharkey’s Eagle 5 from <i>Space Balls</i></h3>  <p>Having spent countless weeks traveling and living out of a van myself, I’ve often dreamed of having my own <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1ndkz7i/spaceballs_the_video_game/">Eagle 5</a> to just cruise space with.</p>

 <hr> <h3>AcoupleofIrishfolk’s Nebuchadnezzar from <i>The Matrix</i></h3>  <p>While the exterior design of this recreation of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n99tpb/the_nebuchadnezzar/">Morpheus’ ship from <i>The Matrix</i> looks sick</a>, it’s the faithfully recreated interior, complete with screens and cables running everywhere, that really sold this build for me.</p>

 <h2><span id="five-sick-original-ship-builds"></span>Five sick original ship builds<span></span></h2> <p>It’s wild how flexible <i>NMS</i>’ shipbuilding system is. I’ve particularly enjoyed seeing builds that deliver on aesthetics not normally found in Hello Games’ otherwise kinda cartoony presentation.</p> <h3>Barbed-Wire’s ‘Lived-in’ corvette</h3>  <p>Maybe I just have a thing for living out of vehicles? I’d call <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1njmnts/ive_finally_finished_my_livedin_corvette_build/">this place</a> home.</p> <hr> <h3>schmacobinc’s ‘Biblically Accurate’ corvette</h3>  <p>This one caught my eye immediately. And it’s a fantastic example of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1neq31b/a_biblically_accurate_corvette/">wacky and weird</a> shit you can kitbash together in <i>NMS</i>.</p> <hr> <h3>Leteramma’s ‘Trash Ship’</h3>  <p>There are plenty of OG ship creations that look fit for the cover of some space opera novel. And this “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nhny71/my_trash_ship/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Trash Ship</a>” looks like it has a story all to itself.</p>

 <hr> <h3>Beckhaver’s ‘Mini Salve Outrider with Trailer’</h3>  <p>I love the simplicity and originality of this two-part build. It uses some fancier build techniques to pull off, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nrylm6/voyagers_mini_salvage_outrider_with_trailer/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">but it looks so worth it</a>.</p> <hr> <h3>Lopsided_Wealth_7968’s ‘Desert Hovercraft’</h3>  <p>A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nnvyub/desert_hovercraft/">sick-looking spacecraft with outdoor seating</a> for some scenic views? The sandworms won’t catch you here (I hope).</p> <h2><span id="five%e2%80%a6creative-ship-builds"></span>Five…creative ship builds<span></span></h2> <p>Folks will always recreate cool things and come up with wild designs of their own…but then, well, then there’s everything else. Enjoy the silliness.</p>

 <h3>AcoupleofIrishfolk’s interstellar Clippy</h3>  <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nc1yqg/it_looks_like_youre_trying_to_explore_the_galaxy/">He’s probably just as annoying</a> in space as he is in a word processor.</p> <hr> <h3>murderwastheface’s starside Slayer performance</h3>  <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1napfv0/raining_blood/">Slayer</a> is far from my favorite metal band (I saw them live with Primus a few years ago and Primus was so much better), but I appreciate the creativity.</p> <hr> <h3>Huzbubber_Tim’s forklift corvette</h3>  <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n6a31n/made_a_forklift_corvette_lmao">Maybe this belongs in the recreation category</a> as it looks like a more capable version of the driveable forklift from <i>Halo Reach</i>.</p> <hr> <h3>AcoupleofIrishfolk’s Thomas the Tank Engine</h3>  <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n71xhw/we_spent_so_long_wondering_if_we_could_we_never/">Obligatory</a>.</p> <hr> <h3>Due_Willow_137’s ‘Larry the Lobster’</h3>  <p>I can’t tell if this is an <i>SNL</i> or a <i>Spongebob</i> reference. Either way, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1nme7f0/you_can_call_me_larry_the_lobster/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">it’s a sick build</a>.</p> <hr> <p>Whether you opt to rely on straightforward shipcrafting or you mix in a little bit of glitching, <i>NMS</i>’ ship- and corvette-building tools offer some really wild options for the impassioned virtual space mechanic. I’m sure this won’t be the only time I’ll be compelled to round up some highlights.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Best Jobs In Final Fantasy Tactics, Ranked]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-jobs-ranking-best-ivalice-chronicles-2000630679</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-jobs-in-final-fantasy-tactics-ranked.1314214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is renowned</a> for its clever, quirky, and deeply customizable job system. It might be the best job system in any game ever. It’s certainly the best in Square Enix’s long-running RPG franchise (<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> fans can fight me in the Dorter Slums after work). But how do you decide which one to choose? Here’s my list of the best ones, based on a combination of their sheer power and how fun they are to play with.</p> <p>A word of warning: you won’t find jobs like Time Mage, Mimic, or Arithmetician in the ranking below. That’s because while each of those contains some of the most powerful abilities in the game, they are each highly situational and/or better when paired with other jobs as the primary one. So while you should make sure everyone learns some of the Time Mage’s skills, you should never be fielding one just for fun. And while Mimic and Arithmetician are responsible for some of the deadliest combos in the game, they also both come with huge drawbacks that ultimately disqualify them for our purposes here.</p>

 <p>The jobs below are the ones that will get you <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-tips-guide-ivalice-remaster-jobs-2000630228">the most bang for your buck</a> and are the ones you’ll want to revert back to once your characters have mastered the rest of their skills.</p> <h2>10. Orator (Requires Mystic Lv.3)</h2> <p>Final Fantasy loves experimenting with offbeat character classes and in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> that’s the Mediator. This job talks and carries a gun. That’s it. While not the most powerful or effective, it’s pretty versatile and lots of fun. Intimidate lowers a unit’s Bravery and can turn them into a chicken. Mimic Darlavon can put even some bosses to sleep. All of these abilities cost zero MP and have no cast time. Also the hat rules.</p>

 <h2>9. Geomancer (Requires Monk Lv.4)</h2> <p>What if a knight also had magic? This is <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>‘ version of the Blue Mage. Geomancers can carry swords and shields but also hit enemies from far away with environmental magic based on what type of terrain they’re standing on. Each attack comes with its own chance to proc a debuff like slow or petrify. The attacks don’t do much damage but they are free, happen immediately, and can chip away at foes while you’re closing the distance.</p>

 <h2>8. Dragoon (Requires Thief Lv.4)</h2> <p>Dragoons have the tankiest stat growth and also the coolest-looking armor. They can hit from two squares away with javelins, keeping them out of harm’s way for enemy melee counters. Plus they can ignore elevation when moving, and Jump allows them to hit faraway enemies for extra damage while staying out of danger for most of their turn. They aren’t very flashy or fun but they can take a beating and still dish it out, one-shotting pesky enemy mages from far away.</p>

 <h2>7. Black Mage (Requires Chemist Lv.2)</h2> <p>Black Mages have the highest base magic attack power in the game and make things, including on occasion their friends or even themselves, go boom. All you really need to know.</p> <h2>6. White Mage (Requires Chemist Lv.2)</h2> <p>This is the most versatile magic class because it can revive fallen party members and attack with Holy. Like its Black Mage counter-part, Flare, Holy also only targets one square, letting you nuke enemies without fear of friendly fire. In addition to full-heal revives with Arise, Reraise lets you revive allies ahead of time before sending them to draw enemy fire. The only downside is that all of this costs a boatload of MP.</p>

 <h2>5. Summoner (Requires Time Mage Lv.3)</h2> <p>Summoners have the most powerful attack spells in the game. Unlike Black Mages, their summons can’t hurt allies and also have wider areas of impact. Cyclops and Bahamut do incredible damage and their casting times in <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> remaster have all been buffed. Plus Lich is absolutely necessary for late-game boss fights where enemies have over 1,000 HP. That’s because it does damage on a percentage of total HP basis, letting it hit for 999 damage. Also Golem is a great support summon for soaking up Archer fire in-between turns.</p>

 <h2>4. Ninja (Requires Archer Lv.4, Thief Lv.5, Geomancer Lv.2)</h2> <p>Two words: Dual-Wield. The only thing cooler than one sword is two swords, and the Ninja job gives you that. Or two flails if you’re an RNG sicko. Ninjas have great movement and speed, and can be outfitted with enough evasion to make their squishy HP less susceptible to being quickly depleted. The throwing attack isn’t the best but it’s another decent ranged option for picking enemies off from afar.</p> <h2>3. Samurai (Requires Knight Lv.4, Monk Lv.5, Dragoon Lv.2)</h2> <p>Okay, maybe I lied. The only thing cooler than two swords is one big sword that you lift up over your head to cast magic with. The Samurai is another interesting riff of the “what if Knight but also Mage?” question. The Iaido abilities scale with magic attack and let you heal, buff, debuff, and damage a big area around your character without having to worry about friendly fire. It can be expensive early on when your swords randomly break in-between uses, but more tanky-ness than the Ninja and Geomancer also adds to the appeal. Some other people would put Ninja ahead of Samurai, and that’s because they get a perverse satisfaction out of constantly having to revive them.</p> <h2>2. Chemist (Unlocked from the start)</h2> <p>Unlocked right from the start, Chemists are the true workhorses of the <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> combat economy. They’re far from flashy but they provide incredible value, instantly healing without needing to wait for spells to cast or hoping they have enough MP left in the tank. They also get guns and they automatically discover items hidden beneath them during battle sometimes. There is almost no battle in<em> Final Fantasy Tactics</em> you can’t eventually win simply by throwing dozens and dozens of potions and phoenix downs at it. Plus they have lots of fun pouches.</p> <h2>1. Monk (Requires Knight Lv.3)</h2> <p>The Monk. Where do I begin? They don’t need weapons or hats so you don’t need to spend a ton of money on upkeep. They have the best physical attack growth in the game and the Martial Arts ability is by far the most useful. They have ranged options and can revive allies or get rid of status effects for free. Plus they are the only Job that can restore MP to multiple characters at once, keeping your big Mage guns fueled up. The only drawback is these abilities are severely hampered by differences in elevation so you have to play smart. But when all else fails, just punch everyone in the face really, really hard. Works every time.</p>
