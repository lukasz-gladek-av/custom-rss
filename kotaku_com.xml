        <p><span>Mere days before the highly anticipated release of </span><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i><span>—a DLC and Kickstarter stretch goal turned mammoth sequel to one of the most impactful games of the 2010s–the lead developers behind the game, William Gibson and Ari Pellen, broke their near-monastic vow of silence and explained the reason for the game’s long absence from the public eye. After years of no communication, during which many assumed the long-delayed game was suffering through development hell, the pair revealed the exact opposite.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk"><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i></a><span>, they explained that </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>only took so long because the team had been </span><i><span>having fun</span></i><span> making the game. There was no behind-the-scenes catastrophe. No drama or rift between the members of the relatively small development team in Adelaide or the dozens of contractors who helped Team Cherry bring </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>across the finish line. There was no meddling from the various publishers that, at one point or another, seemed to vie for the team’s favor and the ability to promote the titanic sequel at one or several showcases. It turned out that </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>was just a really intense, and really prolonged, labor of love, a rarity in an industry that has only grown smaller and colder in the time the game’s taken to gestate.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>A funny thing happened during that self-imposed, years-long radio silence: </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>became </span><i><span>the </span></i><span>most wildly anticipated game of the generation, outside of only the next </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span>. Through little more than effusive word-of-mouth around its predecessor and a </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/06/21/hollow-knight-silksong-feels-wildly-different-and-incredibly-familiar-e3-2019"><span>few rock-solid previews</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span> came entirely undone from reality and entered the harrowed halls of gaming legend. For years, players would champ at the bit in livestream chats in which they endlessly screamed “</span><i><span>SILKSONG</span></i><span>???” to no avail.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>At last though, on September 4, 2025, </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>arrived, and with its arrival came the teardown of a long-held fantasy. Finally, we were able to see, hear, and feel the game in its entirety for ourselves, as it actually exists. Evaluate it for what it was rather than what we wanted it to be. This cherished thing that so many, across the game’s developers and its many fans, had poured an immense measure of love into for all these years.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>So, is </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>everything that I, a self-professed </span><i><span>Hollow Knight </span></i><span>sicko, wanted? Does it live up to </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/i-spent-all-weekend-playing-hollow-knight-silksong-and-im-totally-enthralled-but-nothing-could-completely-live-up-to-the-hype-after-so-many-years/"><span>the hype</span></a><span>? Does it reinvent the Metroidvania? Is it a cultural reset? Is it </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/goty-2025-silksong-clair-obscur-difficulty/?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;taid=68c466d11a96e10001d09c87&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bluesky"><span>too hard</span></a><span>? Was it worth the wait? Is it </span><i><span>fun</span></i><span>?</span></p> <h2>Act I</h2> <p><span>Well, what </span><i><span>should </span></i><span>a game of </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>‘s magnitude be? To understand that, I think you first have to get what </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> was.</span></p>

 <p><span>In 2018, </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> came to the Nintendo Switch. I could wax poetic about how much the experience meant to me and how thoroughly it rewired parts of my brain. How much of my own taste clicked into place while combing the depths of Hallownest, the collapsed bug kingdom in which the first game takes place. How in touch it felt with my own anxieties. How beautiful it felt despite the collapse, barbarity, and ruin that it invited players into.</span></p>

 <p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/v5e_ghRxYs8"><span>now thoroughly memed final encounter</span></a><span> against the game’s true villain, a deity-like figure known as the Radiance that at first disguises itself as the sun, has not only given me my desktop wallpaper, but also, in its hero’s resistance and determination, offered me a model of absolute defiance. The weirdos, adventurers, and screwballs tucked away in the darkest corners of Hallownest have time and time again embodied the virtues of diversity and acceptance that I live my life by. Quirrel, one of those very same oddballs, is one of my favorite characters of all time, and his odyssey through Hallownest is one of my very favorite threads of the whole adventure.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639593" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639593"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639593">©Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Of course, it’s hard to talk about that first game without mentioning its spectacular cadre of boss fights either, which goes well beyond that final confrontation I mentioned. While much continues to be made of the series’ difficulty, especially with the release of </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>, I’ve hardly ever seen the games as ones driven by a merciless bloodlust that tests the players at every turn. Don’t get me wrong, many a </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> boss has stumped me, but I’ve rarely thought of these fights as particularly grueling. They’re more…rhythmic. I’ve written before about how I think </span><a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/video-games/hollow-knight-silksong/silksong-reminds-us-that-theres-room-for-tough-games"><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>‘s combat can feel balletic</span></a><span> and, well, </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> was my first dance instructor. Through its rigorous gauntlets and tutelage, including the game’s now renowned bouts against the Mantis Lords, Watcher Knights, and Troupe Master Grimm to name a few, I learned my marks and how to hit them with something resembling grace and finesse.</span></p> <p><span>And as a reward for diving in headfirst and drinking so deeply of </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>‘s waters, I was granted the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ITtPPE-pXE"><span>keys to Hallownest</span></a><span>, one of the most thoroughly realized settings any work has ever spirited me away to. It’s a well-worn trope at this point to marvel at its construction and level of detail, but the City of Tears moves me so deeply that I </span><i><span>must </span></i><span>always invoke its quiet majesty. The city’s defining quality, outside of its lavish and stately skyline, is the rain. Despite being underground, a crack in the ceiling above it–a strong but subtle metaphor among </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>‘s numerous elements that echo with greater meaning–invites the pristine waters of an underground lake, casting a pallid blue light over the decaying city and drenching it in a never-ending rainfall as if trying to wash away its sins.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Though it never occurs in the game, I think about the day that crack rips the sky above the City of Tears wide open. In a rapturous moment, the lake it holds up will appear to the city’s precious few survivors like the ocean coming down on their heads, and in an instant, it’ll swallow the city whole.</span></p>

 <p><span>This, and so much more, is the precedent set forth by </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>. It is the legacy of that game, and it only grows with each passing year. Suffice to say, it is a hell of a thing to live up to, and a tough–some might even say impossible–act to follow and build atop. But that’s what </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>sets out to do. And I tell you what, it makes a tremendous attempt, even if some cracks begin to form in the foundation under the sheer weight of it all.</span></p> <h2>Act II</h2> <p><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>largely continues </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>‘s exemplary work. It once again casts players as a diminutive but fearsome warrior critter, though this time as the first game’s deuteragonist–and sometimes rival–Hornet. Much like the Knight of the previous title, Hornet is driven to Pharloom, </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>‘s similarly haunted kingdom, by forces greater than herself. Along her journey, she learns of a similar corruption to the one that threatened Hallownest before–</span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>does make clear it is a successor that follows after</span> <span>the events of the first </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>. And just like the Knight, Hornet befriends many oddball (and adorable) bugs, fells terrible foes left and right, discovers many secret passages, and uncovers the </span><a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/video-games/hollow-knight-silksong/hollow-knight-silksong-difficulty-explained-religious-themes"><span>unflinching cruelty of this doomed, yet beautiful setting</span></a><span> she’s now forced to save. You’d be forgiven for thinking </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>was a “lazy” sequel given these familiar parameters and beats, but the comparisons (outside of the game’s visuals and atmosphere) mostly end there.</span></p>

  <p><span>That’s because </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>knows its playing the hits–which its developers workshopped in </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> and then sharpened here–and then spends much of the rest of its runtime constantly fucking with the foundation in ingenious, and often dastardly, ways. Like </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>‘s inverted narrative–in which Hornet climbs from the depths of the kingdom as opposed to the Knight’s descent into the abyss–the game’s hostile design delights in toying with your expectations. Hunter’s March and Bilewater, two of the new locales nestled in Pharloom’s expanse (a word I do not use lightly in this game’s case), are now infamous for the way that they jostle the player and refuse to allow them the </span><a href="https://www.endlessmode.com/video-games/hollow-knight-silksong/theres-no-place-for-serenity-in-hollow-knight-silksong"><span>time and space for complacency</span></a><span>, but could you believe they’re only the tip of the iceberg?</span></p> <p><span>Later sequences, like a rad-as-hell prison escape and an icy climb against the clock, prove out how exciting it is that </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>, as a core principle, kind of fucking hates the player. In </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>, like in most Metroidvania fare, it’s enthralling to grow more powerful and open up doors that you were previously locked out of. </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>recognizes this, but slows that progression to a relative crawl and regularly forces Hornet, and the player, on their backfoot. The result is a tangibly scrappier game that is less and less decided by arbitrary numbers and levels and has more to do with what I can only describe as achieving a level of </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXTKa48-36Q"><span>drift compatibility</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>This antagonism bleeds into several of the pain points and criticisms that have been levied at the game, such as </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-silksong-drags-them-into-the-spotlight-again-have-boss-runbacks-had-their-day"><span>punitive and demoralizing runbacks</span></a><span> to several bosses, especially one to a certain fight in a sandblasted region ripped straight out of Hell. And yes, it also extends to </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>‘s several–and I do mean </span><i><span>several</span></i><span>–wave-based gauntlets, as well as its sometimes oppressive (not to mention optional) third act, both of which feel like exhaustive trials by fire. But I’ve gotta admit, I’ve learned to love this game throwing the whole damn book at me. For the most part. It keeps me on my toes.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639596" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639596"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639596">©Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p><span>If </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>is guilty of anything, it is knowing what the player expects to find at nearly every twist and turn and preempting them, sometimes with a new form of obstacle or gag, and trusting them to overcome these regular tests. This surely must be the mark of well-learned students of the medium and form, and makes the hackneyed turn of phrase “a love letter to the genre” into something resembling a more concrete argument. Since being released, </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>has been accused of being a pretty unforgiving game for many of the above reasons and more. If you ask me, though, what it really is pretty damn playful. Playful and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-plucky-squire-zelda-inspiration-too-on-rails-1851653126"><span>trusting</span></a><span> of your ability to pick up the game and triumph over anything it throws at you, especially with the arsenal of tools and movement abilities bestowed upon you, as well as Hornet’s natural grace.</span></p> <p><span>Reader, I hooted (I never hoot) at the </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/silksong-hunters-march-bench/"><span>fakeout bench trap in Hunter’s March</span></a><span>. I jumped in my seat at my triumph over the gauntlet in High Halls and hardly regretted the hours I spent chipping away at it. The climb up Mount Fay falls </span><i><span>just </span></i><span>shy of </span><i><span>Celeste</span></i><span>-level platforming in my eyes, and the Deep Docks? Well, they’re never boring. And with time, these lessons all taught me to dance through the Blasted Steps unscathed by any of the man-eating sandworms that occupy it. By the time I confronted The Last Judge for the final time, I emerged free of any burns, like only the warrior-princess Hornet could.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Uptown Girl, but make it haunting."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Team Cherry</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Metroidvania</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Gorgeous hand-drawn world filled with thrilling encounters and challenging level design around every corner, and driven by an all-time great platforming heroine.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Less cohesive than its predecessor in narrative and worldbuilding due to excess.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PC, PS5, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2 (Played on), Nintendo Switch</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date: </p>                 <p>September 4, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>About 73 hours, completing the entirety of the game's main story (including an optional third act), as well as most sidequests and optional bosses, and acquiring most collectibles in the game. Still only at 86 percent completion.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>relishes in a kind of defiance that I admire. Sequels, especially video game sequels, are often bigger than their predecessors, a sin which </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>is guilty of, but they’re rarely more frictional. And because </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>zigs where others would zag, it has a personality that I think is rare to come across in sequels, which are so often by-the-numbers. It’s got bite and verve, just like its sharp and commanding protagonist. It’s headstrong, and its architects–Team Cherry itself–feel like a friendly rival I’m in competition with, and that back-and-forth has consistently motivated me to push back and push further. Playing </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>feels like being in conversation with it, and with every session–with every talk–I regularly felt like I was learning more than I would playing a game perfectly content with playing it safe.</span></p> <p><span>And the thing is, </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>‘s heights are </span><i><span>largely </span></i><span>worth these long talks and toils, but that steadfast attitude and hardheadedness only get it so far.</span></p>

 <h2>Act III</h2> <p><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>is an exceptionally well-constructed game up to the end of its first act, filled with rousing fights against spectacular bosses that test your mettle early on, as well as locales that tease the imagination while simultaneously sating that thirst for adventure that the first game so thoroughly quenched. But it’s really in the game’s second act, which sees Hornet exploring the intricacies of the Citadel—a brass city and holy place at the very top of Pharloom—that it explodes and starts building the connective tissue that binds the entirety of this enormous kingdom together.</span></p> <p><span>Remember how I invoked the City of Tears from </span><i><span>Hollow Knight </span></i><span>earlier? How much I loved the depth of it, not only as a setting but because of the simple and powerful metaphor accomplished by linking it to Blue Lake above it? </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>’s vistas enthrall me to no end, and its visuals are no doubt more varied than those of its predecessor, but it fails to tell stories as succinct or as impactful as that first game did.</span></p>

 <p><span>To its credit, there are places where </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>rises to the occasion. Greymoor, a downtrodden village that sits squarely beneath the Citadel (and also boasts a rainy disposition) plays a familiar tune. That and the intended route of the Pilgrimage on which so many bugs find themselves reveal a lot about Pharloom and its people while saying very little. But by and large, I found looser connections between regions, fewer storytelling nuggets and pocket-sized narratives, and less opportunity for my own curiosity to thrive.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span> still yields so much to see, and there are inarguably more nooks and crannies than ever to explore in Pharloom, but Hallownest’s elegant and understated mystique is absent here, and it is instead replaced by a labyrinthine behemoth–complete with </span><i><span>many </span></i><span>proverbial Minotaurs–though one that instills in you the pressure of obligatory completionism rather than the liberating sense of adventure.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639601" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639601"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639601">©Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p><span>At this point in my own experience with it, the sheer excess of </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>began to weigh on the game, my own interest in it, and the world which Team Cherry had so immaculately constructed. Its cast of characters dwarfs that of </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>, but less of them stand out among the rest of the noise here. Shakra, the game’s recurring map maker and traveling warrior, is always a joy to interact with, and following her narrative thread to its end provided an emotionally satisfying resolution I’m grateful to have seen to its end, but she’s one of the game’s exceptions in this regard. By comparison, there are numerous threads I can remember following in </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>, like the stories of Quirrel and Cloth, as well as boss characters like the Traitor Lord and Soul Master, all of which provided narrative bows with which to wrap up and package the small, impactful vignettes across Hallownest.</span></p> <p><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>seems interested in turning some of these interactions and asides into a more concrete facet of the series, but they almost seem lost in the expanded scope of the game. For example, job boards filled with side-quests called “Wishes” seem like they’d provide ample opportunities to expand on characters in explicit ways—</span><i><span>Hollow Knight </span></i><span>preferred the </span><i><span>Elden Ring </span></i><span>approach of loosely threaded emergent narratives—but they mostly amount to busy work and chores which fortify pockets of community around Pharloom, but rarely dive deeper into the make-up of these towns and their bug denizens.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>What stings is that underneath it all, there are some truly awesome things tucked away in </span><i><span>Silksong</span></i><span>, a game whose depth in places frequently, yes, awed me. Awesome encounters and sequences that continued to test me right up to the very end, threads which tied the two games together, and glimpses at the world outside of the </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> series’ haunted kingdoms that I would love to see explored further down the line. But it does also feel at times like a sequel made for players with an eye towards awe and spectacle rather than profundity.</span></p> <p><span>Maybe that weight I’m referring to, the one that threatens to undo </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>at times, has less to do with literal bloat from the game’s prolonged development (though it has surely manifested in this way) and more to do with the impossible burden placed on </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>to be</span><span> the most incredible game ever. I reckon that when Team Cherry first released </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span>, they’d no idea the ripples it would make and the legacy it’d establish. And it’s impossible to separate what </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>wound up being–a fork-tongued middle finger of a game that nobly aims to avoid being a standard, conventional sequel but also feels stretched in places to meet the expectations of a </span><i><span>Hollow Knight </span></i><span>game–from the reputation it built up in its time outside the limelight.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Love breathed life into </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>all those years ago, transforming a would-be expansion into a sprawling title whose development was cultivated over many years with great care and attention, which makes it all the more ironic that over the course of that development, so much of what made </span><i><span>Hollow Knight </span></i><span>special to begin with feels diminished here. That very love pushes </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>to be a rich experience, one that makes you work to love it and prefers to shock rather than lull you with awe. At some point though, the former gives way to the latter, and underneath that weight, </span><i><span>Silksong </span></i><span>begins to crack. Its enormity hides these fractures well, but they’re still there. And maybe, just maybe, one day, like the City of Tears, that crushing weight will collapse the foundation and swallow it whole.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review-hornet-team-cherry-2000639568]]></content:encoded>

              <p>When you have a pet at home you like to check in on or just want to be able to monitor what’s happening while you’re away from home, a security camera can bring you that peace of mind or help to stay connected. Security camera systems can get pretty expensive, but they don’t have to be. The Blink Mini 2 is an indoor and outdoor security camera that already starts off at an affordable price of $40. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5059/">Right now, however, Amazon has the camera for 55% off, which brings the price down to just $18 — saving you $22.</a></p>
<p>If you’re hoping to grab yourself more than one, you can pick up a 2-pack of the Blink Mini 2 security cameras for 60% off at $28 ($14 per camera) or a 3-pack at 55% off at $45 ($15 per camera). It works out that the best deal is on the two-camera bundle.</p>

<p>This second-generation plug-in smart camera is capable of recording in 1080p HD. Whether it’s day or night, you can see a wide field of view in color. The built-in LED spotlight can go on to capture better clarity in low light conditions. The camera is designed for either indoor use or outdoor use. For outdoor use, you’ll need to set yourself up with the Blink Weather Resistant Power Adapter which is sold separately. Installation is easy too.</p>
<p>The Blink Mini 2 security camera is equipped with motion detection which can then notify you via your smartphone when it detects a person in its view. It’s able to identify the difference between a person versus an animal or object coming into frame.</p>

              <p>Sure, you can use your regular laptop for gaming, but those machines won’t really give you the immersive experience you’re hoping for. Even the supposedly powerful machines can struggle when it comes to demanding titles, which is why if you want to game seriously or maybe even work on creative tasks, you need hardware that’s specifically built for this.</p>
<p>Asus makes some of the best options out there, and right now, you don’t have to break the bank to grab one.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5058/"> Currently, the Asus TUF F16 Gaming laptop is going for just $1,660, thanks to a 54% discount on its $3,599 list price.</a> <strong>That’s a rare discount on this 2025 model, but it doesn’t end here</strong>. The bundle also includes an accessory box with a whole bunch of essentials to help you get started – for absolutely free. This is one of the biggest drops we’ve seen on a high-performance gaming laptop this year, but we don’t expect the discount to last long. Snag it up before the retailer pushes the price back up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5058/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Brilliant, Immersive Graphics, Paired With a Fast Processor</h2>
<p>Asus has packed the machine with Intel’s latest 14th Gen i7-14650HX processor that can clock up to 5.2GHz. This ultra-fast processor is paired with 32GB of DDR5 RAM that keeps slowdowns at bay, even when you’re playing heavier titles or working with resource-intensive applications. There’s a 1TB SSD for storage, so housing all your essentials won’t be a problem.</p>
<p>Graphics are handled by the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5060 GPU. Expect better frame rates, real-time ray tracing, and sharper visuals for an immersive experience. The 16-inch FHD+ IPS display takes the visual experience even further with a 165Hz refresh rate, Adaptive-Sync, and 100% sRGB color gamut that brings content to life.</p>



<p>Best of all, unlike most powerful gaming laptops out there, this machine stays quiet and cool while working. It features dual Arc Flow fans, full-width heat sinks, and built-in dust filters that make sure you enjoy consistent performance even during intense sessions. Connectivity-wise, you get Thunderbolt 4, USB-C 3.2, three USB-A ports, an HDMI 2.1 output, RJ45 Ethernet, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5058/">The free accessory bundle includes a gaming mouse, an RGB mechanical feel gaming keyboard, a six-pack cable organizer, and Windows 11 Pro pre-installed</a>. That’s all you need to get started right away! But again, just be sure to grab the offer before it expires for good.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today marks a monumental moment for the saga of video games: it is the 20th anniversary of the release of Strangelite’s <em>Starship Troopers</em> PC game. On October 28, 2005, the world received a truly terrible game based on a truly excellent film, a concept that modern audiences couldn’t even hope to understand. A phenomenon I truly miss. What ever happened to the wildly incongruous video game adaptations of action movies?</p> <p>In the late 1980s and early 1990s, every Hollywood action outing would receive a tie-in video game. Publishers would have a side-scrolling platformer or 2D action game ready to accompany any major movie, no matter how utterly inappropriate or gloriously irrelevant it might be. And no, we’re not talking about some obscure, backwater companies you’ve never heard of—we’re talking the biggest names in the industry. Thus it was that in 1989 you could visit your local gaming store and pick up a copy of Activision’s <em>Die Hard</em>, developed by&nbsp;<em>Tribes</em> legends Dynamix, or the abysmal NES release <em>Who Framed Roger Rabbit</em> made by [double-checks notes] Rare.</p>

 <p>These tie-ins weren’t exactly famous for sticking particularly closely to the films on which they were based. While the <em>Die Hard</em> I mention above is very much set in Nakatomi Plaza, another version was made for PC Engine and TurboGrafx-16 that, incredibly, has you battling through jungles and rivers to reach the Nakatomi building in scenes that would feel more at home in a game set during the Vietnam war. More normally, however, these games were primarily about stripping out all nuance, subtlety, and subversion to create a straight-faced action game.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000639579" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639579"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639579">© Ocean / Mobygames</figcaption></figure> <p>Who can forget Ocean Software’s 1988 Amiga tie-in <em>RoboCop</em>, for instance, a surprisingly great side-scrolling action game ported from an arcade machine release? A beloved game it might have deservedly been, but it’s perhaps fair to say it might have somewhat missed the satirical elements of Paul Verhoeven ‘s film. Or perhaps the best example of all time: 2004’s <em>Fight Club,</em> released for PS2 and Xbox. And yes, that’s right, 2004. You aren’t losing your mind, David Fincher’s deeply subversive and satirical film was released in 1999, and this—wait for it—<em>fighting game</em> came out a full five years later. Was it, too, a treatise on the self-destructive psyche of male violence? No, it was not. It was a game about the actual fight club, the men beating the shit out of each other, and had you winning fights to rise up the ranks, until you’re eventually able to unlock Limp Bizkit’s Fred Durst as a playable character. I’m not making that up. It took an anti-capitalist, anti-violence film and said, “I like the bit where the man punched the other man.”</p>

 <p>There are obviously a squillion examples of truly horrendous movie tie-ins, like the notorious <em>E.T.</em> disaster or 2003’s&nbsp;<em>Charlie’s Angels</em> flop, but my favorite examples are always the ones that just woefully miss the point of their subject matter. And that’s why 2005’s&nbsp;<em>Starship Troopers&nbsp;</em>has such a fond place in my heart.</p>

 <p>Once again, no, you aren’t slipping loose from time. Paul Verhoeven’s wonderful&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-movie-disney-1851269272"><em>Starship Troopers</em></a> was released to theaters in 1997, a full eight years before Empire Interactive released this outstandingly terrible video game tie-in. The anti-war film certainly was, and still is, willfully misunderstood. That’s not because there’s any ambiguity, but because a lot of people aren’t very clever, misunderstanding its loudly telegraphed satire as a sincere representation of militaristic campaigning, seeing its excoriating portrayal of the modern military’s fascistic core as some sort of enthusiastic thumbs up for Nazism. Whether furious because they thought it was endorsing fascism, or delighted to think it was, people failed to understand this film from impressively diametric positions. (We can put aside the much-debated nature of the book on which the film mostly wasn’t based, given Verhoeven’s vision was clearly distinct and—given his childhood in Nazi-occupied Holland—not exactly in favor of the obvious baddies.)</p>

  <p>But the film isn’t exactly a work of subtlety. From its gruesomely silly “WOULD YOU LIKE TO KNOW MORE?” propaganda commercials to its sequences directly spoofing movies like <em>Platoon</em> and <em>Full Metal Jacket</em>,&nbsp;<em>Starship Troopers</em> wears its furious satire on its sleeve. Verhoeven’s genius in films like this and&nbsp;<em>RoboCop</em> (heck, even&nbsp;<em>Total Recall</em> if you look beyond the cheesy veneer) isn’t delivered quietly, but rather with unavoidable brutality. Which is all to say, no, this was never a film about brave Americans fighting off the cruel bug armies. Can you sense the foreshadowing?</p>

 <p>My favorite thing about the&nbsp;<em>Starship Troopers</em> PC game was the way it would lock up my PC, forcing hard reboots. This offered merciful little moments between having to play the game for the review I was writing at the time. Created by a British studio called Strangelite (who would go on to be bought by Rebellion and folded into the teams developing the <em>Sniper Elite</em> games), the game made its failure to comprehend its source material apparent before you’d even taken it out of the box. “Hesperus, a planet perilously close to Earth, has fallen to the bug menace,” it stated, ensuring you knew that a) it wasn’t going to try to recreate the events of the movie, and b) woefully didn’t realize that the Bugs never were a “menace.” That was kinda the point.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639575" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639575"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639575">© Empire Interactive / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The game, a first-person shooter, was meant to be about taking on vast hordes of the arachnoid Bugs, desperately fighting to survive against the odds. Although those odds would often turn in your favor when all the dozens of identical enemies would choose to attack a nearby rock instead of you, kindly standing still while you shot them all in the side. It was a spectacular clusterfuck of atrocious graphics, dismal load times, lines of voice dialogue overlapping each other incoherently, and then to really drive home how bad this all was, super low-quality clips of the movie played at you to point out what it wasn’t portraying. (This reminds me of an utterly awful movie you hopefully never saw called <em>Carrie 2: The Rage</em>, that frequently included clips of Brian De Palma’s 1976 masterpiece to make sure you had constant context for just how outrageously terrible this sequel really was.)</p> <p>It sucked. That’s the point I’m trying to make.&nbsp;<em>Really</em> sucked. And you know what? I kind of miss that, a bit.</p>

 <p>Of late, we keep getting movie/TV tie-ins—albeit often years or decades later—that are really good! Games like 2023’s&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/robocop-rogue-city-new-game-2023-review-shooter-rpg-pc-1851000568"><em>RoboCop: Rogue City</em></a>, and 2022’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/tmnt-shredders-revenge-review-tribute-game-dotemu-multi-1849077972"><em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em></a>, that embrace the point of the source material in a winsome fashion. Which is brilliant, and bring it on! But there’s definitely a part of me that wishes 2025 could have seen a side-scrolling beat ’em up based on <em>One Battle After Another</em>, or a <em>Kpop Demon Hunters</em> platform game about collecting microphones. Where’s my egregiously misguided <em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> third-person action game that tries to recreate major scenes from the film through minigames? We didn’t even get a top-down racing sim based on&nbsp;<em>F1 The Movie</em>.</p> <p>So happy 20th birthday,&nbsp;<em>Starship Troopers</em>, you colossal pile of shit. You were one of the last of your kind.</p>

              <p>What would <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> have been like as an online game? Will <em>Civilization 7</em> finally be good before its one-year anniversary? And what lesson will publishers relying on game key cards for Switch 2 take from <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>‘s juggernaut physical sales? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint,&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Are you brave enough to <a href="https://x.com/mega64/status/1982951652811518329">spend a night in the Xbox haunted house</a>? The prices keep going up and the games keep leaving.</p> <h2><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> had the biggest physical launch since <em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></h2> <p>That’s with around 6 million copies sold globally, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m46ottuejc2c">according to Circana</a>. <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> sold 10 million copies at launch despite being Nintendo’s first $70 game, with millions of those being physical copies as well despite the overall shift to digital games in recent years. At the time, the 2023 Switch hit pushed “new physical video game software spending” to its highest May total since May 2014.</p>

 <p>This tells us what we’ve already known: some franchises can still buck the trend when it comes to the disappearance of physical games, especially on Nintendo’s platforms. But the question remains: are controversial Switch 2 game key cards a way to satisfy that same demand, or a clumsy band-aid the company’s better ripping off sooner rather than later?</p>

 <h2><em>Call of Duty</em> is still trying to rain on <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s parade</h2> <p><em>Black Ops 6</em> multiplayer and Zombies is once again going free from <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1982928103417753961?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1982928103417753961%7Ctwgr%5E11d055f620a693ec5cf2b2fa9081b608928c48f7%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Factivision-announces-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-and-zombies-go-free-again-today-just-as-ea-launches-battlefield-battle-royale-redsec">October 28 through November 3</a>. Is that just a fun Halloween treat from Activision, or another attempt to trick players out of engaging with <em>Battlefield</em>‘s latest content drop? The EA competitor’s new, free-to-play battle royale mode is coming later today. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-far-behind-battlefield-6-on-steam-preorders">Data firm Alinea Analytics projects</a> that Call<em> of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> has sold under 200,000 pre-order copies so far on Steam, compared to <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s million pre-orders during the same pre-launch period.</p>

 <h2><em>Civilization 7</em> is still trying to turn the corner</h2> <p>The embattled 4X strategy sequel will get a boost from the addition of a feature players have wanted since launch. Firaxis’ latest <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-oct-27/">status update on the status of its updates</a> says it’s currently testing lots of big changes, including an option to play as the same civilization throughout an entire match. One of the game’s big departures was forcing players to swap during age transitions. It’s by far one of the most unpopular new mechanics. Meanwhile, Tide of Power update 1.3.0 arrives next week with pirates and an overhaul of the game’s sea power dynamics.</p>

 <h2><strong><span dir="auto"><em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> started as an online co-op game because the dev loved <em>Battlefield 1942</em></span></strong></h2> <p>Creator Fumito Ueda reflected on the iconic 2005 PS2 game’s legacy in a recent interview <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/251027y#i-3">with <em>Denfaminico Gamer</em></a>. “<span dir="auto">Speaking personally, I used to play</span><span dir="auto">&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 1942</em></span><span dir="auto"> a lot at the time,” he said. “I was really impressed by the fact that all the characters on the screen were players, and I felt like, ‘This is the future of gaming.’ </span>I was really drawn to the energy and live feeling of online games, but at the same time, the feeling of excitement and disappointment over winning and losing gradually faded away.”</p> <p><span dir="auto">He continued, “I used to enjoy the excitement of competing against other people, but as I got older, I began to seek a different kind of immersion.
