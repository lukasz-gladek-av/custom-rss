              <p>With modern laptops, connectivity was sacrificed for thin designs and give you two to three USB-C ports where you used to have a variety of choices in connecting your devices. This minimalist architecture now creates constant frustration when you try to hook up monitors, external drives, charging cables and peripherals all at once.</p>
<p>The <strong>14-in-1 docking station from Anker resolves this limitation by taking that single USB-C port</strong> and breaking it out into fourteen connection options that cover every device you might need to plug in. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5770/">just dropped this hub to a record low of $39 for Black Friday, down from the usual $69 price</a>, which makes essential connectivity affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5770/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Triple Display Expands Your Workspace</h2>
<p><strong>Dual 4K HDMI and a 1080p VGA port</strong> enable three-monitor setups that transform how one works with multiple applications and documents. You can dedicate one screen to email and communications, another to active work, and a third to reference materials or monitoring dashboards. The 4K resolution on HDMI outputs brings sharp text and detailed images, which help reduce eye fatigue during extended work sessions. The VGA port keeps compatibility with older projectors and monitors that businesses and conference rooms still use frequently. Windows users get true <strong>extended desktops across all three displays</strong>, while macOS mirrors the same content to all connected monitors due to operating system limitations.</p>



<p>The <strong>five USB-A ports</strong> accommodate legacy devices like external hard drives, printers, webcams, and wired keyboards that haven’t yet moved to USB-C connections. The 5 Gbps transfer speed will handle file operations well, transferring gigabytes of data in minutes, not the glacial speeds of older USB 2.0 hubs. <strong>A dedicated USB-C data port adds another high-speed connection</strong> for newer devices while matching the same 5 Gbps throughput. That matters when backing up large photo libraries, transferring video projects, or syncing substantial data sets between devices.</p>
<p>The p<strong>ass-through charging of 80 watts powers</strong> your laptop through the hub while using all connected devices. You plug your laptop’s USB-C charger into the hub’s power input, and the hub distributes power to your laptop while maintaining all connectivity functions. This single cable solution means your laptop charges while accessing all peripherals without juggling multiple power adapters.</p>



<p>The <strong>Gigabit Ethernet port</strong> ensures solid wired network connections that avoid unreliable Wi-Fi in crowded offices or when maximum upload and download speeds matter. Wired connections eliminate the latency spikes and bandwidth competition that wireless networks introduce during video calls or large file transfers. The consistent throughput supports remote desktop sessions, video conferencing, and cloud backup operations that demand reliable connectivity. The <strong>SD and microSD card slots</strong> handle camera cards and storage expansion without separate card readers cluttering up your desk. The <strong>AUX port</strong> connects wired headphones or external speakers, preserving audio quality that Bluetooth sometimes compresses.</p>
<p>Compatibility extends to USB-C, USB4, and Thunderbolt-equipped laptops running Windows 10 and 11, ChromeOS, or macOS 12 and newer. The hub expects that your laptop’s USB-C port supports DisplayPort Alt Mode for video output and Power Delivery for charging functionality. Most modern business laptops and MacBooks boast both features, although some budget laptops with USB-C ports omit the required protocols.</p>
<p>For $39, you’re getting professional docking station functionality at almost half the $69 standard price that already undercut dedicated docking solutions costing $150 or more. The 43% discount brings essential connectivity to remote workers and office users who’ve struggled with inadequate laptop ports.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-shows-no-pride-silently-offloads-galaxy-watch-7-at-nearly-50-off-via-amazon-2000645949</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Smartwatches compete based on health tracking accuracy and ecosystem integration, and Apple Watch remains on top despite premium pricing starting at $399 for the latest Series 10. Samsung’s Galaxy Watch 7 brings similar health metrics, AI-powered insights, and advanced sleep tracking at a fraction of Apple’s cost, and Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5766/"> just dropped it to a record low of $129 for Black Friday, down from its $249 retail price</a>. That nearly 50% discount undercuts even older Apple Watch models, but you get hardware that Samsung quietly released earlier this year.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5766/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Galaxy AI Powers Personalized Health Insights</h2>
<p>The <strong>Energy Score calculates your daily physical readiness</strong> by analyzing yesterday’s activity, sleep quality, heart rate patterns, and recovery metrics. This AI-driven analysis tells you if your body is prepared for hard work or needs lighter activities and rest. The score updates every morning, based on the data collected during the night, providing actionable information before you plan your day’s training. <strong>Samsung’s AI analyses that data</strong> on the paired phone rather than in the cloud, keeping health data private while providing personalized recommendations. Over time, the system learns your patterns to fine-tune accuracy while gathering more data about your unique physiology and response to different levels of activity.</p>
<p><strong>Performance tracking provides real-time comparisons</strong> of your current run or bike ride to past sessions, showing exactly where you’re maintaining, improving, or falling behind your pace. It’s that real-time feedback that lets you dial in your effort during a workout, rather than finding out later that you underperformed. The Galaxy AI removes movement artifacts from the heart rate signals of exercising users, improving the accuracy in cases where an individual’s arms are swinging or vibrations impact sensor contact.</p>



<p>S<strong>leep tracking follows your rest cycles</strong> and detects patterns that show poor sleep quality or probable health issues. For example, the watch identifies light sleep, deep sleep, REM stages, and periods of wakefulness throughout the night with accuracy that rivals dedicated sleep tracking devices. From there, Samsung’s AI analyzes the data to provide recommendations for improving sleep hygiene, adjusting bedtime routines, or modifying evening habits that interfere with quality rest. The sleep apnea detection feature screens for moderate and severe cases by monitoring breathing disruptions and oxygen levels during sleep.</p>
<p>Wellness tips provides<strong> personalized recommendations from the advanced health data</strong> your watch gathers all day. Its AI looks at patterns of activity, stress levels, and sleep quality, along with heart rate trends, to identify areas in which small changes may help optimize overall wellbeing. Such advice isn’t just about general fitness; it comments on real-life behavior and physiological responses unique to each person. The system may recommend earlier bedtimes when it observes accumulated sleep debt, advise stress management techniques during especially tense weeks, or encourage one to move more on days when mostly sedentary.</p>



<p>The<strong> 40mm case size fits smaller wrists comfortably</strong> without the bulk larger smartwatches create. Bluetooth connectivity keeps a stable connection to your phone for notifications, calls, and data syncing without requiring cellular service that adds to monthly fees. Battery life extends through a full day and night of continuous health tracking, though exact duration varies based on which features you enable and how often you interact with the watch.</p>
<p>Samsung’s ecosystem integration works seamlessly with Galaxy phones but <strong>also functions with other Android devices and even iPhones</strong>, though some features require Samsung hardware for full functionality. The watch face customization options let you prioritize which health metrics appear prominently, adjusting the display to show the data you actually care about rather than generic layouts.</p>
<p>At $129, you’re getting Samsung’s latest smartwatch technology at nearly half the price of entry-level Apple Watch models that don’t offer comparable AI-powered health insights. For those who have been priced out of the smartwatch market by Apple’s premium positioning, this 48% discount brings flagship health tracking within reach.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagate-22tb-external-hard-drive-drops-60-amazon-clears-stock-for-black-friday-2000645970</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/seagate-22tb-external-hard-drive-drops-60-amazon-clears-stock-for-black-friday.1360252/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cloud storage subscriptions will drain your budget month after month and leave you dependent on internet connectivity to access your own files. The Seagate 22TB HDD offers enough capacity for massive photo libraries and years of accumulated digital content in one device, and Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5769/">just dropped this drive to a record low of $229 for Black Friday</a>, and while that compares to a typical $249 price, <strong>this same drive sold for $599 until just days ago</strong>. That represents a 60% discount from the price you’ve seen throughout the past year and the lowest this capacity has ever cost.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5769/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>22TB Eliminates Storage Anxiety Completely</h2>
<p>The h<strong>uge 22-terabyte capacity stores around 5,500 hours of HD video, 5.5 million high-resolution photos</strong>, or 440,000 songs at resolutions without compression or quality loss. With this much space, you can keep everything instead of making painstaking choices over what to delete or archive. Professional photographers maintain RAW file libraries spanning entire careers without resorting to cloud services. Video editors store entire project files complete with all source footage, renders, and iterations available instantly. It<strong> handles 4K and even 8K video projects</strong> that consume hundreds of gigabytes per hour of footage.</p>
<p><strong>USB 3.0 connectivity delivers transfer speeds up to 5 Gbps</strong> under ideal conditions; you could be moving large files in minutes, not hours. The real world, of course, will vary depending on the USB implementation on your host computer and the drive’s mechanical performance, but sustained transfers of about 100-150 MB per second for sequential file operations are within reason. This speed manages general backup tasks efficiently without tying up your computer for extended periods. Transfers of large files, such as moving an entire photo shoot or backing up a video project, complete within reasonable time frames.</p>



<p>Seagate includes <em>Rescue Data Recovery Services</em> that provide professional data recovery should the drive fail mechanically or suffer logical corruption. This service covers the cost of laboratory recovery attempts that cost hundreds, if not thousands, of dollars if you were to buy them separately. It’s the peace of mind when you’re storing family photos, work for clients, or a lifetime of creative work on a single device.</p>
<p>The plug-and-play design instantly works with Windows and Mac computers, requiring no software installation or complicated setup procedures. It means that Windows will immediately recognize the drive and assign a drive letter to it, ready for use. If you are a Mac user, you can easily reformat it to APFS or HFS+, although it will ship formatted for compatibility right out of the box.</p>



<p>The drive’s performance suits cold storage and archival purposes where you are writing data once and reading it occasionally, rather than running active databases or applications. Time Machine backups on Mac or File History on Windows work perfectly with this drive’s speed characteristics. Media servers streaming video to local network devices perform well since the sequential read speeds handle multiple concurrent streams.</p>
<p>Yes, this means that at $229, <strong>you are getting 22 terabytes of storage for just a little over $10 per terabyte</strong>. That is exceptional value that was not around at this price until now. The 60% discount from the $599 price that prevailed until recently brings enterprise-scale storage capacity to consumer budgets. This Black Friday deal has space enough to consolidate several smaller drives, cancel cloud storage subscriptions, or simply stop worrying about storage limitations for several years.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-200ft-outdoor-lights-pro-drops-40-on-amazon-now-cheaper-than-budget-home-lighting-2000645934</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/govee-200ft-outdoor-lights-pro-drops-40-on-amazon-now-cheaper-than-budget-home-lighting.1360234/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Permanent outdoor lighting takes your home’s exterior from drab to dramatic without the tacky holiday-only vibe some cheap string lights create. The Govee <em>Permanent Outdoor Lights Pro</em> serve as sophisticated daily accent lighting that switches to festive colors when the occasion calls while maintaining architectural elegance-never screaming seasonal decoration-all year long. This <strong>200-foot system features 120 individually controllable RGBIC LEDs</strong> for ample coverage at most homes and color flexibility to match any mood or event. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/">just dropped this complete system down to a record low of $459 for Black Friday, down from its usual $759</a> which makes professional architectural lighting accessible at nearly 40% off.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>RGBWWIC Technology Delivers True White Light</h2>
<p>The upgraded warm white and cold white capabilities differentiate these lights from cheaper RGB alternatives which tend to produce muddy, off-color whites. Color <strong>temperature ranges from 2700K to 6500K</strong>, from cozy warm candlelight tones to crisp daylight whites matching your home’s existing exterior lighting. Each LED produces 50 lumens for real illumination, not a dim decorative glow that makes you run additional lighting. This level of brightness works for daily accent lighting that highlights architectural features, pathway illumination, or subtle perimeter lighting that enhances security without harsh floodlight aesthetics.</p>
<p>The anti-glare lens design creates a triangular lighting effect that directs light out but doesn’t blind anyone who looks directly at the fixtures. This optical engineering prevents the harsh glare that makes cheap LED strips uncomfortable to be around. The light spreads evenly along your roofline or architectural features without hot spots or dark gaps between LEDs. Enhanced lens technology keeps color accuracy high across the entire RGB spectrum and improve the white light quality that most outdoor lighting actually uses.</p>



<p>The cuttable and extendable design allows you to tailor the installation to your home’s exact dimensions rather than deal with excess cable or come up short. You can cut the strand at designated points and reconnect sections with waterproof joints every 16.4 feet. This flexibility accommodates complex rooflines, multiple buildings, or layouts that require wrapping corners and spanning gaps.<strong> Up to 200 feet of connected length</strong> can be supported in the total system, covering substantial properties without needing multiple separate systems.</p>



<p><strong>Water submersion up to 1 meter is protected by the IP67 waterproof rating</strong> on the adapter and the lights themselves, while the control box is IP65 for heavy rain and snow. These <strong>lights will survive from -4°F to 140°F,</strong> and cover most extremes of temperature that any climate will see in the course of a year. The 50,000-hour lifespan equates to roughly 17 years of daily use at 8 hours per day, eliminating concerns over frequent bulb replacements or system failures. In fact, this durability justifies this permanent installation approach, as the lights really do last several years, rather than needing seasonal replacement like temporary holiday decorations.</p>
<p><strong>Installation takes about 8 seconds per light</strong> with the included VHB adhesive and mounting clips that attach securely to eaves, soffits, or trim. The system recommends placing lights 2 to 4 inches from the wall surface to develop the optimum lighting effect and to prevent shadows. Waterproof splice connectors join sections together without exposed wiring or weak points where moisture could infiltrate.</p>
<p>The Govee Home app gives you individual control over each of the 120 LEDs, allowing you to create custom patterns, gradients, and effects flowing along your roofline. You could program schedules that automatically turn lights on at sunset and off at midnight, or create scene triggers that respond to weather conditions or special occasions. <strong>Of the 75 pre-programmed scene modes, holidays, seasons, and moods</strong> are already set up and don’t require you to manually select colors or design patterns.</p>
<p>At $459, you’re getting permanent architectural lighting for $300 below the standard retail price that puts this system out of reach for many homeowners. The 39% discount brings professional installation-quality results to a price point typically occupied by temporary seasonal decorations that last one or two years.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-november-2025-reanimal-trailer-free-demo-2000645835</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/we-saw-12-games-during-the-latest-xbox-showcase-and-some-of-them-definitely-have-my-attention-now.1360228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft’s November Xbox showcase didn’t have any major reveals but it did have plenty of nice surprises. Most of them were all geared around making the now $30 Game Pass Ultimate subscription seem a little more worth it thanks to a slew of promised upcoming day-one releases. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgOiQPxEF-I">The livestream</a> confirmed that <em>Dave the Diver</em> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/slot-machine-horror-steam-cloverpit-balatro-2000631009">recent Steam hit <em>CloverPit</em></a> are now both available on Xbox, each with new DLC coming early next year. But it also offered updates on a bunch of stuff that’s not out yet, including trailers for some new games we didn’t previously know about. Here’s all of them:</p> <h2>The <em>Godfall</em> studio is making a third-person roguelike shooter</h2>  <p>Counterplay games confirmed it’s <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-godfall-dev-counterplay-games-quietly-closed-down">not closed</a> and has actually been hard at work on its upcoming game <em>Armatus</em>. The very <a href="https://kotaku.com/remnant-ii-dark-souls-handler-class-does-the-dog-die-1850540297"><em>Remnant</em>-looing</a> action game has you wandering around the ruins of Paris and facing off against demons following a mysterious, urban-fantasy-coded cataclysm. The run-based game will have you collecting upgrades and experimenting with different powers. Hopefully, it can marry <a href="https://kotaku.com/next-gen-launch-title-godfall-really-really-wants-you-1848149707"><em>Godfall</em>‘s excellent combat</a> and neat visuals to a more rewarding progression loop. It’s coming out in 2026 and will be day-one on Game Pass.</p>

 <h2>The next wave of <em>Silksong</em>-likes is coming with <em>Crowsworn</em></h2>  <p>2D action platformer? Check. Metroidvania world? Check? Plague Doctor-inspired hero? Check. It’s impossible to tell if <em>Crowsworn</em> has the goods from the gameplay trailer alone but there are secrets to find and loadouts to optimize as you kill enemies in front of stylish scene art. There’s no release window but it’s also day-one on Game Pass.</p>

 <h2><em>Erosion</em> promises isometric action in a glorious voxel art world</h2>  <p>It’s a Western-themed, time-warping sandbox. Every time you die, you respawn 10 years in the future. The world around you changes and evolves in the meantime. A really neat idea helped by a really neat aesthetic. It looks like you’ll be exploring different towns and making choices that affect the future, too. It’s headed to Xbox Game Preview on PC in spring 2026 with a console launch to follow.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Echo Generation 2</em> looks like a promising sequel</strong></h2>  <p>The first <em>Echo Generation</em> was a humble little <em>Stranger Things</em>-style adventure that took inspiration from games like<em> Paper Mario</em>. There was turn-based combat, puzzle solving, and the occasional narrative-driven quick-time event. This time it looks like you’ll be propelled into a cyberpunk future fighting evil robots with a <em>Gremlins</em>-esque sidekick. It’s coming “soon” but doesn’t have a release date yet.</p>

 <h2><strong>Multiplayer horror gets a period piece</strong></h2>  <p><em>The Mound: Omen of Cthulu</em> is a co-op horror game that has players exploring a Lovecraftian haunted coastline in the colonial era. They’ll have to navigate “shifting perceptions” to survive and find treasure. This one’s out summer 2026 and <em>not</em> coming to Game Pass on day-one.</p>

 <h2><strong>Indie darling <em>Raji</em> levels up&nbsp;</strong></h2>  <p><em>Raji: Kaliyuga</em> is a sequel to Nodding Heads Games’ 2020 action adventure. It swaps the isometric perspective for a full third-person view and adds Raji’s brother Darsh as second playable character for a story that leans even deeper into mythology. The blue cat monkeys are the big highlight of the cinematic trailer reveal, though we haven’t really seen gameplay yet. It’ll be on Game Pass but there’s no release date yet.</p>

 <h2>The wait for <em>Reanimal</em> is almost over</h2>  <p>The upcoming horror game from the original <em>Little Nightmares</em> developers got a new trailer, a release date, and a demo. The co-op adventure arrives February 2026 and its first demo is out today. Not surprisingly, the price to bag this one was too high and it won’t be a day-one Game Pass release.</p> <h2><em>Roadside Research</em> looks like <em>Supermarket Simulator</em> with aliens</h2>  <p>You’re still stocking shelves, still checking out customers, and still trying to stay in business. Except this time you’ll also be wearing disguises and trying not to raise the suspicions of the local populace that you’re actually from another planet.&nbsp;<em>Roadside Research</em> aims to engineer some co-op comedy in addition to the smooth-brained satisfaction of succeeding at capitalism. It’s coming Q1 2026 to Game Pass.</p> <h2><em>Tides of Annihilation</em> has some wild boss fights</h2>  <p>This one gave me big “<em>Harpy fight from Final Fantasy XVI</em>” vibes, in a good way. <em>Tides of Annihilation</em> is playing loosely off of the King Arthur mythology but mostly just seems interested in figuring out how it can mash up cool combat ideas from other flashy dark fantasy action games. The lack of a coherent visual identity probably won’t matter too much if the combat and boss fights can stay on point. Still no release date, unfortunately.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Total Chaos</em> is out today</strong></h2>  <p>The follow-up to <em>Turbo Overkill</em>, about surviving creepypasta horror come to life, was shadow-dropped today on PC and console. It’s also on Game Pass. It looks way darker than its neon-fueled predecessor.</p> <h2><em>Vampire Survivors</em> turns into a 3D pixel art dungeon crawler</h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-vampire-survivorssequel-was-just-revealed-and-its-a-dungeon-crawler-2000645860"><em>Vampire Crawlers</em></a> might be too good to play. Like, I’m seriously afraid to actually pick this one up once it’s out lest it consume all my free time against my will. Unlike the top-down first game, this one is a deck-building roguelike that seems to weigh strategy more than RNG. Mostly it just looks cool as heck.</p> <h2>Furry May Cry</h2>  <p><em>Zoopunk</em> also looks cool as heck. It’s set in the same universe as <em>F.I.S.T.: Forged in Shadow Torch</em> and looks like someone learning to use Unreal Engine mashed together <em>Destiny 2</em> and <em>Star Fox</em>. Unfortunately, it’s also leveraging <a href="https://kotaku.com/zoopunk-generative-ai-demo-trailer-xbox-showcase-2000645874">some generative AI tools</a> to let players craft and customize user-generated content in the game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s video game awards season, which has now become synonymous with the annual reminder that </span><i><span>Clair Obscur:</span></i> <i><span>Expedition 33 </span></i><span>star Ben Starr is an absolute gem. Not only is Starr once again being a total goofball for everyone else’s enjoyment, but he’s also using his voice to speak out against the industry’s inability to retain talent. Go off, anti-layoff king.</span></p> <p><span>Though he’s been an actor for a while, Starr catapulted to gamer fame after playing Clive Rosfield in 2023’s </span><i><span>Final Fantasy XVI</span></i><span> and </span><a href="https://x.com/The_Ben_Starr/status/1732968375423209538"><span>going viral during that year’s Game Awards</span></a><span>. He then became the face of 2024’s breakout card battler </span><i><span>Balatro</span></i><span>, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AamFDYUaMhM"><span>doing weird advertisements as Jimbo</span></a><span>, its Joker mascot, proving once and for all that he commits to a bit. This year, he’s been nominated for several year-end awards for his role as Verso in </span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span>, and is back on his delicious bullshit.</span></p>

 <p><span>During the November 20 Golden Joystick Awards, the UK-based award ceremony that’s been around in some form since 1983, Starr walked up on-stage to present the award for Best Indie Game wearing a Golden Joystick-style </span><i><span>Balatro</span></i><span> card with a face hole cut out that placed him at the top of the trophy. “I am classically trained Golden Joystick-winning actor Ben Starr,” he said, standing there with just his face and legs showing behind the card. “Isn’t independence empowering? You can do whatever you want.” </span></p>

 <p><span>Watch the entire presentation <a href="https://x.com/GoldenJoysticks/status/1991548621012234573">here</a>, it’s worth it.</span></p> <p><span>But Starr wasn’t satisfied with being silly. When it was announced that he’d won Best Supporting Performer for Sandfall Interactive’s </span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span>, he spoke about Verso as a character, about his flaws, and how they make him a polarizing figure. “I think that is what this industry does best,&nbsp; it presents us with flawed characters that reflect the lives we have on the outside,” Starr said. “‘Cause life, guys, as we know—and I’m gonna be the first one to swear—is fucking hard.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Starr also made sure to speak plainly about the video game industry’s deluge of layoffs over the last several years. “This industry is hard. We are celebrating today, astonishing video games, but there are many people who should be here who aren’t because they are laid off from the industry,” he began. (As he paused, someone in the audience shouted, “Well said, Ben.”) He continued:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>Many people might criticize me for grandstanding right now, but the one thing that Sandfall do and have done is respect people that work for them. They respect the people that they are making games for, and they want to make them good. That is why this game is great, it’s because they wanted to make it good for the people they’re making it for. They didn’t want it to be popular. So they wrote characters that are flawed, they wrote characters that are broken, they wrote characters that, ultimately, you might hate. And I’m very very fortunate to potentially play one of them.</span></p></blockquote> <p><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span> won seven </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/events-conferences/golden-joystick-awards-2025-all-winners/"><span>Golden Joysticks</span></a><span> and set a record for the most nominations at this year’s Game Awards with 12. Let Ben Starr give every winning speech.</span></p>

              <p>Ho, ho, ho! Happy holidays! Everyone is getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a>‘s first DLC for free because the game needed so much post-launch fixing that Gearbox couldn’t finish the DLC in time, and will make it up to fans who paid for the pack with extra DLC next year.</p> <p>When <a href="https://kotaku.com/12-tips-borderlands-4-guide-help-better-loot-gold-keys-side-quests-tricks-2000626554"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> launched in September, it received praise for its open world, improved gunplay, and better-than-ever co-op gameplay. I really liked it! <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">But performance issues and bugs</a> on PC and console derailed some of the excitement, leading to Gearbox having to spend a lot of time fixing, improving, and updating the co-op-focused online looter shooter. In fact, according to Gearbox and 2K, the team spent so much time fixing stuff in <em>Borderlands 4</em> that it screwed up the original roadmap.</p>

 <p><a href="https://x.com/GearboxOfficial/status/1991545250532208879">On November 20, Gearbox announced</a> that <em>Borderlands 4′</em>s first post-launch DLC, Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day, <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/news/borderlandsr-4-bounty-pack-1-how-rush-saved-mercenary-day-releases-today-for-borderlandsr-4-players-for-free">will no longer be locked behind a paywall</a>. Previously, the plan was for <em>Borderlands 4</em> to get four smaller DLC drops, known as Bounty Packs, and you’d only have access to this new content if you had purchased the Deluxe Edition or Super Deluxe Edition, or had separately bought the Bounty Pack Bundle.&nbsp; However, things have changed as Gearbox was unable to include as much content as planned in the first DLC due to having to update <em>Borderlands 4</em> so much, as explained in a press release.</p>

 <p>“However, with the continued efforts to improve the <em>Borderlands 4</em> experience, the team ran out of time to stuff as much mayhem-fueled content into the Bounty Pack 1 stocking as originally planned,” explained 2K and Gearbox. “So in the spirit of the season, and as a thank you to the community for their passion and support, 2K and Gearbox are excited to provide Bounty Pack 1…to all <em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>players for free!”</p>

 <h2>What’s included in <em>Borderlands 4′</em>s first DLC?</h2>  <p>In the new DLC, How Rush Saved Mercenary Day, <em>Borderlands 4</em> rebel leader Rush faces off against a new enemy, the miserly Minister Screw. This doofus is in charge of making sure people don’t celebrate the holidays and have fun. So across a series of new missions that make up a new questline, players will celebrate the holidays in defiance and take on Screw.</p>

 <p>Bounty Pack 1 includes a new Vault Card with fresh rewards, 24 new cosmetic items, and new weapons, too. It looks like parts of the map will become Christmas-themed, too, complete with gifts and snow. To start the new DLC, just update your game and head to any major hub in <em>Borderlands 4.</em> There you’ll find a large gift-wrapped present marked on your map, which can be interacted with to start the holiday fun.</p>

 <p>Keep in mind that Bounty Packs are smaller bits of paid content, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pearls-roadmap-takedown-dlc-free-update-2000621708"><em>Borderlands 4</em> will also get two proper, much larger expansions as well as new playable characters next year, too</a>.</p> <p>Also arriving on Thursday <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">is a big new gameplay update for <em>Borderlands 4</em></a> that makes a lot of changes to the looter shooter. Perhaps the most exciting is that Wildcard Missions, which make up the bulk of the FPS’s endgame content, will no longer force you to play through the entirety of missions. Previously Wildcard Missions, which are just normal missions you replay with variables, forced you to sit through all the content, even if it was all tutorial crap. Gearbox is now promising new start points to drop players into the action sooner. And that sounds like a real holiday treat that will make grinding for loot in <em>Borderlands 4</em> a lot more enjoyable and less annoying.</p>
