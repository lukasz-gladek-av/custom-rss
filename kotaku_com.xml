              <p>Thanksgiving brings a welcome surprise as <strong>LEGO’s most popular Christmas set returns to Amazon inventory</strong> after two weeks of complete stock depletion that frustrated holiday shoppers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6021/">At $25, down from $39, the Santa’s Sleigh building set hits a Black Friday price</a> that likely removes LEGO’s profit margin entirely as they race to clear seasonal inventory before Christmas passes and demand evaporates.</p>
<p>The aggressive pricing reflects LEGO’s urgency to move remaining units rather than holding stock that becomes instantly obsolete on December 26th. With over <strong>30,000 units already sold</strong> and limited time remaining before the holiday, this inventory replenishment at record-low pricing creates the optimal purchasing window.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6021/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>343-Piece Build That Is Fun and Challenging</h2>
<p>The <strong>343-piece count gives builders a lot of time to build, about 2 to 3 hours for experienced builders</strong> and even longer for kids working on their first multi-hour LEGO projects. This piece count strikes a good balance between being fun and easy to use. It has enough pieces to keep kids ages 9 and up happy without overwhelming younger builders with too many pieces that make them angry.</p>



<p>The <strong>Santa minifigure and four poseable reindeer figures</strong> that come with it let kids act out Christmas Eve delivery scenes instead of just looking at static displays. The saddles can be taken off and decorated, which lets you personalize them. The<strong> eight wrapped gifts</strong> that can be built also give you props for storytelling which makes the toy more fun to play with after it’s been built. The <strong>guitar, skis, and teddy bear accessories</strong> hint at certain story elements, but they also leave room for people to use their imaginations to figure out whose gifts these are and where Santa brings them.</p>
<p>The <strong>sleigh is 3 inches high, 11.5 inches long, and 2.5 inches wide</strong> which makes it a great holiday decoration that doesn’t take up too much space on mantels or shelves. The size is perfect for showing off on fireplace mantels, entry tables, or holiday vignettes without needing special furniture. LEGO’s precise manufacturing tolerances guarantee that the structure will stay strong even when it is handled carefully and stored once a year.</p>



<p>The set works just as well as a <strong>hands-on gift that the recipient puts together themselves or as a decoration that the gift-giver</strong> puts together before giving it. Kids who get the unbuilt set get to build it and use it at the same time while adults who get pre-assembled sets like how they look right away without having to spend time building them, which they may not have during busy holiday seasons.</p>
<p>Because it’s seasonal, the set naturally follows a pattern of being displayed in December and then packed away with other holiday decorations. This way, it stays fresh each year instead of becoming stale decorations that are always there. This cyclical use makes the perceived value last longer by building up excitement around yearly unpacking traditions that kids look forward to along with other holiday traditions.</p>
<p>LEGO Santa’s Sleigh comes with 343 pieces, a Santa mini-figure, four reindeer and the ability to display Christmas decorations. LEGO’s zero-margin seasonal clearance pricing combined with restocked inventory after 2-week depletion creates the optimal moment to secure this popular set before final sellout.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Razer Ergonomic Gaming Chair Just Hit a Black Friday Record Low, Not Even Prime Day Went This Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/bag-the-razer-iskur-v2-x-ergonomic-gaming-chair-while-its-going-for-just-250-on-amazon-2000647135</link>
            <guid>1366759</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As someone who’s in front of the screen for several hours a day, six days a week, I can tell you just how important a good-quality chair is. You’re not just sitting on it; it’s providing your upper and lower back, plus arms, the support they need so you can keep working comfortably.</p>
<p>As you’d expect, the best options on the market don’t come cheap. On a regular day, you can expect to pay over $300 for a top-rated option from a known brand. Thankfully, that changes today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6019/">Right now, you can grab the Razer Iskur V2 X ergonomic gaming chair for just $250, after a nice 17% discount on its retail price of $300.</a></p>
<p>It’s a Black Friday deal, and the offer applies to both black and dark gray color options. The discount, however, ends soon, so it’s best to bag it as soon as you can.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6019/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Adjustable Design With Plush Fabric</h2>
<p>The fabric is cool to the skin and smooth to the touch. Thicker cushion padding molds to the unique shape of your body, while the breathable, multi-layered fibers prevent sweat and moisture buildup during those longer, intense work and play sessions.</p>
<p>The wide seat base is sculpted with reduced edges that distribute the pressure around evenly, which prevents soreness in the buttocks and thighs. It also promotes healthy blood flow, so you won’t have to change positions every few minutes to keep those uncomfortable numbness or tingling sensations away. There’s an integrated lumbar arch that encourages a neutral sitting position with lower back support, because it’s high time you start taking your posture seriously. We don’t mean to creep you out, but Tech Necks don’t just look awkward; they can lead to long-term spine damage and nerve pinching if you don’t make necessary adjustments.</p>
<p>Of course, sitting upright for longer hours can get tiring. To tackle that, the Razer Iskur V2 X has an adjustable recline of up to 152 degrees. Stretch out a bit, and use this mode for relaxing gaming or streaming sessions that don’t require intense focus.</p>



<p>Arms get a break, too. The 2D armrests can be adjusted in height and rotated inwards or outwards for a neutral position. When typing long documents, adjust the height to match your desk and keep them in the outward position for proper arm and wrist support. Planning to relax with a quick gaming session? Pull them inwards for a bit more stability with the console.</p>
<p>The chair is available in two color options, so you can pick whichever suits your aesthetics the best. Go for the black one for a cleaner, classic look. Like your gaming setup with a bit more personality? The dark gray version is going to upgrade the overall look instantly!</p>
<p>This gaming chair does not come pre-assembled, so you’ll need to put it together yourself. The process is straightforward (instruction manual included), and should not take more than 30 minutes. If you’d rather skip the hassle, you can get professional assembly through Amazon for an additional $100.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6019/"> To wrap it up, this Black Fridy deal brings the price of this ergonomic gaming chair down to just $250, after a nice $50 discount.</a> It’s great for gamers, work professionals, creatives, and even casual users looking for better support as they use their PC or laptop. It ends soon, though, so it’s best to grab yours before the price goes back up, or the stock ends for good.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Alienware 16 Aurora Gaming Laptop Was Pricier Than a MacBook Air at Launch, Now Black Friday Makes It Even Cheaper Than One]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/treat-yourself-or-a-gamer-in-your-life-with-the-16-inch-alienware-aurora-gaming-laptop-while-its-discounted-2000648026</link>
            <guid>1366729</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gaming laptops can cost a pretty penny. The exact price depends on what you’re looking for, but generally, most powerful options from known brands sit well over $1,000, with some even touching $2,500 and above. If a scary price tag has been holding you back from upgrading, we come bearing good news.</p>
<p>Black Friday technically starts tomorrow, but early sales are going in full swing already. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/">Thanks to that, Amazon has dropped the price of the 16-inch Alienware Aurora gaming laptop to just $900.</a> You’re saving a straightforward $350 on its retail price of $1,250, and the sale is open to all shoppers. Even better, there are no coupon codes required to score the drop. Just add the laptop to your cart, and the discount applies automatically.</p>
<p>Plus, you can also enjoy the Xbox Game Pass new-user bonus if you’re new to the platform with your purchase. To claim it, click on the “Shop items” option on the deal page. On the following page, add the laptop to your cart. Both the discount and the bonus will apply automatically at checkout. Both deals, however, are expected to expire soon. Act fast before that happens because once it does, there’s no guarantee they’ll return.</p>

<h2>Designed for Everyday Use</h2>
<p>The build is sturdy, flaunting premium materials inside out. Its smaller profile makes it easy to fit into any bag and take it with you on the go, while smoother contours make the laptop comfortable to hold. The 16-inch WQXGA display offers plenty of screen space to play your favorite titles and push creative boundaries, plus delivers bright, sharp visuals consistently. Color accuracy is just as great; greens won’t turn into neon, and yellows won’t feel orange. ComfortView+ integration rounds it all up nicely by actively reducing blue light emission for a more comfortable viewing experience. You won’t be left with eye strain after a single gaming session.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, you’ve got a series 2, 10-core Intel Core 7 processor that’s capable of handling all your demanding day-to-day tasks without throwing a fit. The chip is thoughtfully paired with an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5050 card. This one balances performance and efficiency like a pro, which makes it an excellent option for gaming at 1080p resolution and performing creative tasks. Multi-frame generation&nbsp;and enhanced Ray Reconstruction support make ultra-smooth frame rates possible, while the Frame Warp reduces the latency even further based on your game’s latest mouse input. The result? A smooth, fluid gaming experience for both the classic titles and the latest releases.</p>



<p>Multitaskers will appreciate the modest 16GB DDR5 RAM. It’s not massive, but still enough to let you work on at least a few different programs at the same time. Spacious capacity comes from the built-in 1TB SSD, which not only lets you house all that you own, but also enjoy fast load and boot times that make it easy to get on with your day without much delay. Despite all this, the laptop stays calm and cool as you go about your day. That’s thanks to its new Cryo-Chamber design that promotes airflow in a quieter way. Another feature that deserves a mention is the backlit keyboard, which lets you use the laptop comfortably even after the shadows fall.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5793/">All in all, it’s a solid gaming laptop, especially at this price. You are currently saving $350 on it, which brings the price down to $900.</a> Considering how most entry-level everyday laptops fall in this range, this one is a steal at under $1,000.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Apple Sends Millions of MacBook Air to Amazon for Black Friday, M4 Model at Zero-Profit Pricing Defies Logic]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-sends-millions-of-macbook-air-to-amazon-for-black-friday-m4-model-at-zero-profit-pricing-defies-logic-2000648128</link>
            <guid>1366681</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple releases new MacBook iterations almost annually with more powerful custom silicon that pushes performance boundaries forward. <strong>March brought the MacBook Air with M4 chip</strong>, succeeding the previous M3 generation through enhanced efficiency and AI capabilities.</p>
<p>Each year follows the same pattern where Apple maintains strict full pricing across official channels to preserve premium brand positioning. But today, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4498/">at $749, down from $999, this marks the first time Apple has authorized Amazon to sell the 256GB MacBook Air M4</a> at razor-thin or potentially zero profit margins for Black Friday. The <strong>25% discount</strong> represents unprecedented accessibility to current-generation MacBooks that typically resist price reductions for years after launch.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4498/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ultra-Portable Computing</h2>
<p>The <strong>M4 processor has an 8-core CPU and an 8-core GPU</strong> architecture that can handle professional workflows while being fanless and weighing less than 3 pounds. The improved Neural Engine processes Apple Intelligence features on the device which keeps data private because it doesn’t send it to cloud servers where third parties could get to sensitive information. The fanless cooling works well enough because the processor doesn’t get too hot even when it’s under a lot of stress: This makes it quiet, which professionals like when they’re working with clients or in the library.</p>



<p>The <strong>16GB unified memory is a big improvement</strong> over the old 8GB base configurations which made it hard for users to run more than one program at a time. This memory architecture lets<strong> the CPU and GPU share RAM</strong> which gets rid of the performance problems that happen when separate components copy data between different memory pools. The memory bandwidth sends data to processors quickly enough to keep them running at their best, instead of waiting for slow memory access that slows down less powerful systems.</p>
<p>The <strong>13.6-inch Liquid Retina display has great picture quality thanks to mini-LED backlighting</strong> that lets it reach 500 nits brightness and supports the P3 wide color gamut. This level of brightness makes it easy to see outside in direct sunlight, where regular laptop screens wash out completely. The color accuracy is also good enough for professional photo and video editing without needing extra monitors<strong>. True Tone technology changes the white balance based on the light around you</strong> to make it easier on your eyes when you use it for a long time.</p>



<p>The <strong>M4 chip and optimized macOS power management</strong> that changes performance based on workload demands make the battery last 15 to 18 hours during normal mixed use. <strong>Video playback can last up to 20 hours</strong> but tasks that use a lot of power, like rendering video, drain batteries faster but still give you a lot of time to use them without plugging them in. This long battery life lets you work on the go instead of just using a laptop that is tethered to a power source and covers full workdays and evenings without having to worry about running out of battery.</p>
<p>The <strong>integration of the ecosystem with the iPhone</strong> makes workflows easier with features like Universal Clipboard, which lets you copy text or images from your iPhone and paste them directly into your Mac. Handoff lets you switch between devices in the middle of a task, and FaceTime and Messages keep conversations going no matter which device you pick up. And AirDrop lets you send files between Apple devices right away.</p>
<p>For $749, the MacBook Air M4 with 256GB has the latest Apple Silicon, a 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display and a battery that lasts all day. This Black Friday, it’s 25% off the regular price. Apple’s authorization for Amazon to sell at minimal margins creates exceptional value that rarely occurs on current MacBooks. If you want Apple’s latest ultra-portable without paying full premium pricing, <strong>this record-low deal is the best MacBook value available</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Google Breaks Its Own Pricing Logic as Pixel Watch 4 (2025) Drops to an All-Time Low Despite Being Its Latest Smartwatch]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/googles-newest-and-best-pixel-watch-is-100-off-for-the-first-time-this-black-friday-at-amazon-2000647344</link>
            <guid>1366678</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One of 2025’s best Android smartwatches has just become one of the best Black Friday deals of the week. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5735/">The 41mm version of the outstanding Google Pixel Watch 4 is 22% off at Amazon, bringing it to an all-time low price of just $350.</a> The best-in-class display jumps out at you immediately, being 50% brighter than the previous model of the Pixel Watch, and its Gemini AI integration comes into play early and often to enhance the user experience.</p>
<p>As a fitness watch, the Pixel Watch 4 is among the very best, with amazing accuracy in measuring and evaluating your exercise. It’s also an elite-level health and sleep tracker, easily in the same class as the best Apple Watches and Samsung Galaxy Watches. All of its features are bolstered by the outstanding battery life of the Pixel Watch 4 — 40 hours per charge in standard mode and 72 hours in low-power mode, with the ability to get back to 50% strength after just 15 minutes on Google’s new side charger, and all the way from 0 to 100% in roughly 45 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5735/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easy on the Eyes</h2>
<p>It’s impossible to look past the face of the Google Pixel Watch 4, which is an enormous upgrade from previous models. The first-of-its-kind Actua 360 display lives beneath a dome of sturdy scratch-resistant 3D Corning Gorilla Glass 5, and is 10% larger and 50% brighter than the Pixel Watch 3 — up to 3,000 brilliant nits, which can be lowered to as little as a single nit when you need to keep things dark. It’s a 320 ppi AMOLED screen that’s remarkably easy to see even in bright sun, and highly reactive as a touchscreen for ease of control.</p>
<p>Beneath the Actua 360 display lives the Snapdragon W5 Gen 2 processor and Cortex M55 co-processor, which drives all of the Pixel Watch 4’s many features and keeps them moving with smooth, seamless, pro-level speed. That’s handy whether you’re using any of the 40+ exercise modes for a workout, the dual-frequency GPS for accurate location, or the Gemini AI as a hands-free assistant for pretty much anything you ask of it.</p>



<h2>An Actual Fixable Smartwatch</h2>
<p>What do you do when your smartwatch’s battery fails, or when its display gets cracked or damaged? Most likely you shop for a new one while hoping against hope for a semi-reasonable trade-in deal to lessen the blow. The Google Pixel Watch 4’s battery is replaceable, as it its display. You can’t do it yourself at home, but it can be shipped to Google or taken to a certified Google repair technician for a fix. Of course, with its robust battery and Gorilla Glass-encased display combined with IP68 water and dust resistance, the odds are low you’ll need to seek service, but it does provide peace of mind.</p>
<p>Need a Cliff’s Notes rundown of the Pixel Watch 4’s many fitness features? How about Daily Readiness score, real-time run guidance, Morning Brief, Heart Zone Training, Cardio fitness score, Calorie Tracking, and Floors Climbed? That’s maybe a third of them, just to give you an idea of how impressive the Pixel Watch 4 is if you’re thinking about a new workout watch. And now’s the time to make that upgrade, thanks to the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5735/">22% off Black Friday sale at Amazon that makes the Google Pixel Watch 4 a total steal at just $350.</a></p>
