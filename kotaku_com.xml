              <p>Consoles used to come in fun colors, sometimes with transparent shells and other wild features. Those days are long gone, and now we mostly get stuck with black and white consoles with a few limited color options for accessories. So I’m happy to see Sony announcing some genuinely cool-looking console covers and controllers for the PlayStation 5 arriving in March.</p> <p>On January 7, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/01/07/revealing-the-hyperpop-collection-with-three-new-designs-for-ps5-accessories-launching-this-march/">PlayStation unveiled its Hyperpop Collection</a>, which features three vibrant new PS5 console covers and controllers. You can get a PS5 shell or Dualsense gamepad in Techno Red, Remix Green, and/or Rhythm Blue. Silly names aside, these console shells look awesome, sporting a gradient design that goes from black on the top to a vibrant color at the bottom, assuming you have your PS5 standing up next to your TV.</p>

  <p>However, what I really find exciting are the three new controllers, which also sport the same black to color gradient pattern. These things look sick as heck, and I want one right now to replace the boring black Dualsense controller I’ve been using for a bit now.</p>

 <p>Sony says the console covers will cost $75, and the Hyperpop Dualsense controllers will be priced at $85. That’s $10 more than a standard Dualsense, which is annoying. But that gradient design is soooo good that I’m willing to pay the extra price. I’ll just consider it a cool tax.</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, I’ll have to wait a bit before I can get my hands on that Remix Green Dualsense controller. The Hyperpop Collection launches on March 12, 2026, with Sony starting pre-orders for the slick-looking hardware on January 16, 2026 at select retailers and on PlayStation’s official store.</p>

              <p>The case between Rockstar and fired <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> developers who were unionizing gets messier. Discord is secretly preparing for a possible IPO. And Square Enix might ban you if you share <em>Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</em> spoilers. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>I’m trying to go into this new year by once again <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/coreybrickley.bsky.social/post/3mbtmvsb7xs2l">limiting my social media intake</a>. There are a lot of cool things that get shared around and I love to see, and also too much of anything will kill you. Curated feeds. Strict time limits. This is the way.</p>

 <h2>Discord is getting closer to an IPO</h2> <p>Bloomberg reports that the gaming chat platform “filed confidentially for an initial public offering.” While that doesn’t guarantee it will move forward with a Wall Street stock offering, it does suggest the company has moved <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-reddit-ipo-gaming-server-gta-6-enshitification-1851768033">another rung up the ladder toward enshittification</a>. Discord recently boasted over 200 million monthly users and has promised to remain a user-first enterprise that doesn’t monetize its audience for short-term gain. We’ll see!</p>

 <h2>Rockstar shares new details about the unionizing <em>GTA 6</em> developers it fired</h2> <p>Claims were heard from both sides at a labor tribunal this week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/union-asks-judge-to-grant-fired-gta-6-devs-interim-relief-at-preliminary-tribunal-hearing-rockstar-denies-claims"><em>IGN</em> reports</a>. Rockstar also shed more light on the union-focused Discord that developers <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-union-firing-rockstar-protests-2000646881">were chatting in before they were fired</a>.&nbsp;“This channel contained at least 25 non-Rockstar employees, including employees of competitor game developers, a video games industry journalist, as well as dozens of anonymous, unidentifiable members,” the company said in a statement to <em>IGN</em>.&nbsp;“Meanwhile, employees who posted union-supportive messages, but who did not breach confidentiality policies, were not dismissed.”</p>

 <p>While the IWGB has claimed only union business was discussed, Rockstar maintains that game features were also leaked. “We regret that these dismissals were necessary; however, confidentiality is fundamental to everything Rockstar Games does,” its new statement continued. “Global interest in our games is unparalleled.”</p>

 <p>Rockstar went on, “Even the smallest leak of any information relating to our products and practices can cause major commercial and creative damage — as we have seen in the past — and damage the experience of our loyal players and dedicated team. This was never about union membership. We have always taken a zero-tolerance approach to unauthorized releases of information — and we always will.”</p>

 <h2>The free <em>Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</em> demo is out</h2> <p>Players will get an in-game reward for trying it, and save progress carries over to the final game which is out on console and PC on February 5. Be careful, though, as <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/square-enix-bans-posting-certain-parts-of-dragon-quest-7-reimagined-for-a-month-after-the-demos-launch-with-strict-guidelines-on-spoilers/"><em>Automaton</em> reports</a> that Square Enix is threatening to ban anyone who potentially posts <a href="https://www.dragonquest.jp/guideline/dq7r/">unmarked spoilers</a> for the remake of 25-year-old game. The spoiler warnings will continue until morale improves.</p>

 <h2><em>Fallout</em> season 3 starts filming in just a few months</h2> <p>Amazon is wasting no time getting the next batch of episodes for its hit TV adaptation of the RPG series going. According to a <a href="https://productionlist.com/filming-may-frederick-e-o-toye-direct-upcoming-series-fallout-season-3-santa-clarita-ca-united-states/">new production alert</a>, filming will resume in May.</p> <h2><em>Balatro</em> and <em>Silksong</em> prove conventional wisdom can’t always predict hits</h2> <p>That’s one of the points NYU professor Joost van Dreunen made in a recent interview <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nobody-wants-ai-slop-joost-van-dreunen-on-the-future-of-ai-and-the-shifting-economics-of-the-games-industry">with <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>. “The success of a <em>Balatro</em>, a <em>Silksong</em>: These are all games that shouldn’t really exist,” he said. “They don’t make rational sense financially, and yet somehow they are deeply loved and commercially very viable and popular.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-resident-evil-village-star-wars-outlaws-2000657166">Some big blockbusters are headed to Xbox Game Pass this month</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-red-blue-remake-logan-paul-firered-leafgreen-2000657176">What Logan Paul doesn’t get about Pokémon</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/fantasy-fps-where-you-shoot-skeletons-to-stop-the-game-from-crashing-looks-incredible-2000657233"><em>FPS Quest</em> is a neat-sounding game with an incredible trailer</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>
