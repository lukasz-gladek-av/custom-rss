It was a bit like <em>Borderlands</em> through the lens of <em>Heart of Darkness</em>, with third-person combat that revolved around gear drops and magic powers. It had the whiff of a live-service grind which repelled some players at launch and left others feeling like its endgame was a bit light on repayable content, but it offered a decent multiplayer story campaign elevated by some of the most fun I’ve had with third-person shooting in a long time. </p><p>It was the type of AA-going-on-AAA franchise that deserved a second shot to see how it could grow and where the developers might take the formula next, especially if it was free of having to disguise itself as a live-service shooter to convince a publisher to greenlight it in the heyday of <em>Destiny 2</em>. It’s unclear if there’s still an outside chance <em>Outriders 2</em> could eventually see the light of day under a new publisher, but that seems unlikely. Square Enix is currently in the midst of a three-year plan to double down on its biggest franchises and pull back from riskier outside bets.

The only thing that could make the Bramble Blast sighting even better is if <em>DKC2</em>'s other brambly stages, Bramble Scramble and Screech’s Sprint, have secret homages tucked away in the game as well.</p><p>The <em>DKC2</em> levels were magical but also got progressively more punishing, with extended sections where players have to navigate between hazardous brush by hanging onto the parrot Squawks, whose fluttering can feel imprecise and hard to control. It was sort of like a precursor to <em>Flappy Bird</em>, though with mixes of enemies and barrels thrown in, and a soundtrack that helped players keep their sanity no matter how many times they died. The original <em>Donkey Kong Country </em>had nothing like it, and it turns out that none of the subsequent <em>Donkey Kong</em> games would either, though the song did appear in <em>Super Smash Bros. Brawl</em>. </p><p>While the “Stickerbush Symphony”/Bramble Blast mashup carried over to <em>Donkey Kong Land 2 </em>on Game Boy and <em>Donkey Kong Country 2</em>'s<em>&nbsp;</em>GBA port, the Bramble motifs didn’t return in <em>Donkey Kong 64 </em>or the character’s subsequent 2D spin-off, <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns</em>. That game’s follow-up, <em>Tropical Freeze</em>, did have a remix of “Stickerbrush Symphony” and a level called Bramble Scramble, but the two elements were separated from each other. The song appeared in the beginning of the level  Twilight Terror instead, with a jazz version buried in the end credits. Now they’re back together, and the new cover sounds great.</p><p>“Not to bash the <em>Brawl </em>and <em>Tropical Freeze </em>versions, but it’s nice we are finally getting a remix of the song that sounds like the original,” wrote <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/comments/1lp2xla/the_bramble_scramble_inspired_challenge_level_in/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/donkeykong/comments/1lp2xla/the_bramble_scramble_inspired_challenge_level_in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one fan on Reddit</a></span>. “<em>Tropical Freeze</em>’s biggest miss,” wrote another. “Had a bramble level, had Stickerbush Symphony, didn’t put the thing in the thing.” At long last, <em>Bananza</em> does. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-stickerbush-symphony-bramble-blast-1851785457]]></content:encoded>

As you make your way through the mansion, you’ll find videos of actors Vinny Monroe (Starr) and Chase Lowry (Newbon), who are both shown portraying a character named Willie in the footage. These videos will be broken up and out of order, so a key part of solving the game’s many mysteries is finding them on flash drives throughout the mansion and splicing them together.

Perks are a key part of the game’s progression, letting players unlock new abilities—like being able to get rid of status effects by jumping—and changing how you play the game. Previously, they were hard to unlock as you had to collect resources, some of which the game did a poor job of highlighting.

It is simultaneously an adventure with a defined end goal and an open world (or I guess open house?) mystery, so the question of “how long <em>Blue Prince </em>is” will depend entirely on what you want to get out of it. This ambiguity has also led to some discourse among the game’s fans that I <em>personally </em>take umbrage with, even if said discourse was well-intentioned. Let’s break it down.</p><h2 id="h359282"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to beat Blue Prince?</h2><figure id="" data-id="c431f5f48995253c284bff360d75b3e5" data-recommend-id="image://c431f5f48995253c284bff360d75b3e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Blue Prince.

Three gems are shown on a shelf in front of a crest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At the outset of <em>Blue Prince</em>, you have a clear objective: reach the 46th room of the randomized 45 room house you’ve inherited from your uncle Herbert Sinclair. While it is <em>technically </em>possible to accomplish this task in one in-game day (there’s a trophy for it, even), 99.999999999% of players will need to aimlessly stumble throughout the house while they gather clues and unlock permanent upgrades first. <strong>The game’s credits will play after finding Room 46</strong>, so you could consider this “beating” <em>Blue Prince</em>.</p><p><strong>While you can finish <em>Blue Prince</em> in 15 to 20 hours</strong>, this estimate can swing wildly. If you’re really good at puzzle games and luck is on your side, you could find your way to the end of <em>Blue Prince </em>in under ten hours. However, if you aren’t accustomed to roguelikes or puzzle games (or both), you could easily spend 25 or 30 hours to reach the credits. Frankly, there’s nothing wrong with that! <strong><em>Blue Prince </em>leaves a lot up to chance by design</strong>, so you could go hours without seeing clues that other players might find incredibly early on their journey.</p><p><strong>That said, <em>Blue Prince </em>has a <em>ton </em>of mysteries to solve after the credits</strong>. These relate directly to the main story and include some pretty big discoveries, but uncovering these will take <em>a lot</em> more notetaking and out-of-the-box thinking. <strong>Peeling back every layer of <em>Blue Prince </em>and seeing every challenge to the end can absolutely take you over 100 hours</strong>. Again, that estimate should be taken with a grain of salt, as many secrets will depend on whether a lot of random events line up just right for you on a given in-game day. Your completion time will also change if you use guides or want to solve absolutely everything yourself.</p><p>This massive postgame is why many fans have taken to calling the quest for Room 46 “the tutorial.” That said, if you haven’t played <em>Blue Prince </em>yet, I’d strongly advise <em>against</em> looking at the opening act as an appetizer to overcome before you get to the game’s main course.</p><h2 id="h359283"><a id=""></a>Why I don’t think you should call getting to Room 46 in <em>Blue Prince </em>“the tutorial”</h2><figure id="" data-id="dc6ffa5d5c5d5ad960f91a6462108af2" data-recommend-id="image://dc6ffa5d5c5d5ad960f91a6462108af2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Blue Prince.

Before I could even press play, I was barraged with tips and facts about <em>Blue Prince </em>that I <em>had </em>to know if I wanted to play it the <em>right </em>way. You gotta take notes about everything! You haven’t <em>really</em> started <em>Blue Prince </em>until you reach a certain point! You’re just a <em>noob</em> if you complain about the Billiards room! You won’t believe how many layers there are to <em>Blue Prince</em> and you have to <em>see them all</em>!</p><p>I’ll be frank; this discourse damn near ruined <em>Blue Prince </em>for me. I was <em>so </em>stressed out in the opening hours of the game that I obsessively noted every observation I had about every room, worried about all these intricate and complex puzzles that would await me when the game <em>really </em>started. I wasn’t even sure <em>what </em>I was looking for, I just <em>had </em>to get through this “tutorial” fast so I could understand why everyone’s losing their mind about this game. What spectacular secret will I find once I enter Room 46? What will <em>Blue Prince</em> be like once I finally get to the “real” part of the game?</p><p>Without outright spoiling, I’ll say this: <strong>there’s no reality-shifting moment in Room 46</strong>. There is no “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doki-doki-literature-club-plus-deserves-to-be-replayed-1847202498&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doki-doki-literature-club-plus-deserves-to-be-replayed-1847202498">Just Monika</a></span>” or “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/portal-the-companion-collection-switch-valve-nintendo-1849117877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/portal-the-companion-collection-switch-valve-nintendo-1849117877">The Cake is a lie</a></span>” twist that will force you to make that shocked face you see in 90% of YouTube thumbnails. The only big reveal is—as mentioned above— there are several extra puzzles in <em>Blue Prince </em>that involve more obsessive note taking and riddle-decoding to solve. When people call the first act of <em>Blue Prince</em> “the tutorial,” they just mean there’s a lot more game remaining.</p><p>By focusing so much on what was next in <em>Blue Prince</em>, I wasn’t able to enjoy those opening hours of the game. I nearly put it down for good until I started playing it alongside my girlfriend, which finally helped me ignore the sky-high expectations put in my brain from internet commentators. I really regret that my first hours with the game were tainted by focusing on what came next, so my advice is to take <em>Blue Prince </em>slowly and enjoy every phase of the game however you’d like.</p><h2 id="h359284"><a id=""></a>Play as much of <em>Blue Prince </em>as you want, even if you don’t “beat” it</h2><figure id="" data-id="470f8c61ae4f9b067b2bc6694705b371" data-recommend-id="image://470f8c61ae4f9b067b2bc6694705b371" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Blue Prince.

At best, it’s redundant: You’ll inevitably find bread crumbs for extra puzzles and objectives on your journey to Room 46. <em>Blue Prince </em>naturally does a good job of prodding your curiosity, so you’ll know which threads to pull next if you’re ready for more after the credits. </p><p>At worst, the tutorial framing is patronizing. It undermines the accomplishment of getting to Room 46, as if to say the player shouldn’t feel proud because the puzzles that lie ahead are just so much harder. Even if there’s no ill intention involved, it’s the same vibe as telling someone they haven’t <em>really </em>played an MMORPG until they’ve participated in high-end raid content, or you haven’t played <em>Elden Ring</em> unless you use a strength build and never use Spirit Ashes and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-missmikkaa-erdtree-boss-fight-dance-pad-1851606332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-missmikkaa-erdtree-boss-fight-dance-pad-1851606332">play exclusively with a dance pad</a></span>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/skip-boss-fights-elden-ring-metroid-prime-argument-1851781231&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/skip-boss-fights-elden-ring-metroid-prime-argument-1851781231">Not everyone enjoys video games the same way</a></span>, and that’s okay! Reaching Room 46 is worth celebrating, whether it took you five or fifty hours to pull off.</p><p><strong><em>Blue Prince </em>is about the journey, not the destination</strong>. So if you aren’t enjoying the journey, there’s no big moment at the end that’ll make it all worthwhile. The post-credits puzzles in <em>Blue Prince </em>are way more intricate and cryptic than everything that came before, and you might not enjoy those challenges as much as the straightforward quest to find Room 46. Others may say that the endgame challenges of <em>Blue Prince </em>are the best part. It’s up to you to decide whether or not you want to dive so deep into the game that you become a walking wiki for it.</p><p><br>All of this is to say, don’t worry too much about what the “true end” of <em>Blue Prince </em>is. It is, indeed, a quick adventure if you want it to be. But if you want to dig deeper into it, you’ll be pleased by just how deep this rabbit hole goes. For best results, <strong>I recommend going slowly with the game and taking breaks if you get stuck, as a good night’s sleep can make all the difference between a puzzle being fun or frustrating</strong>. And most importantly, enjoy your time in Mt. Holly manor!</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/blue-prince-how-long-to-beat-room-46-tutorial-puzzles-1851785424]]></content:encoded>
