But if it ain’t broke (and <em>THPS 1+2 </em>wasn’t), don’t fix it. Within ten minutes, I had my <em>THPS</em> legs back under me and was effortlessly flipping, grinding, manualing, and hopping around the two maps included in the demo.

I want to play the whole thing right now.</p><p>Meanwhile, much better digital skaters than I are already pulling off sick high-score combos in the demo’s levels. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/iBIAJuGn51U&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/iBIAJuGn51U" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s someone nailing an insane 219 million point combo in Foundry</a></span>. </p><p>And here’s another person pulling off a sick 105 million combo in College. In both cases, the players are using lines and tricks that worked back in the original games, a testament to how perfectly <em>THPS 3+4</em> has nailed the feel of the old games, as well as making sure the fancy-looking levels still play (mostly) like you remember. </p><p><em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 </em>launches July 11 on <em>*deep breath* </em>PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, Switch 2, and PC.<br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Got it? Now replace it with the Illuminate Stingray. When these pesky flying headaches spawn, they zoom in from the edge of the map, slowing down momentarily to launch a barrage of lasers in your direction, then speed off into the sunset. If you’re quick enough, when they slow down, you can hit them with a high-powered weapon, likely a support weapon, to take one down.</p><p>While they’re speedy, Stingrays don’t have much in the way of armor. The moment they stop, swap to your heavy weapon and unleash hell. Even if all you have is your primary, you can still take one down, but it’ll take longer and likely a more concerted effort from the team.</p><h2 id="h902"><a id="2"></a>Best weapons to use against Interlopers</h2><figure id="" data-id="09dd28d2c6fd1e0d98e9a980d78dfc3d" data-recommend-id="image://09dd28d2c6fd1e0d98e9a980d78dfc3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Recoilless Rifle in Helldivers 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Recoilless Rifle in Helldivers 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Arrowhead Game Studios / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="09dd28d2c6fd1e0d98e9a980d78dfc3d" data-recommend-id="image://09dd28d2c6fd1e0d98e9a980d78dfc3d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Recoilless Rifle in Helldivers 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As previously mentioned, your primary weapon would suffice in a pinch, but you’ll want to rely on your heavy support weapon more often than not.

Once fired, the rocket continues chasing its target until it either hits or the enemy disappears off the map.</li><li><strong>EAT-17 Expendable Anti-Tank</strong>: Like the GR-8 Recoilless Rifle, a single shot will bring down a Stingray, so long as you can land said shot. As this isn’t a lock-on weapon, you must manually aim and fire, which causes all manner of headaches mid-combat.</li></ul><p>Now’s the time to stop the Illuminate, soldier! <em>Helldivers 2</em> is available now on PS5 and Windows PCs.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They’re expensive and  limited, which is why some longtime fans hate them.

Fans were ravenous. </p><p>“The Secret Lair website is currently experiencing extremely high traffic and wait times may be longer than usual,” Wizards of the Coast <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MTGSecretLair/status/1932106751882481848&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MTGSecretLair/status/1932106751882481848" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced</a></span> just five minutes after the <em>Final Fantasy</em> X Secret Lair drop went on sale. “Please monitor the queue page for real-time updates, including product availability in your region.” Long waits and payment processing bugs ensued. It was enough to make some people want to quit the hobby altogether.</p><p>“To get on the site exactly at 11:00am then wait three hours in the check out queue and watch every single thing be bought under me,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1l7ol7r/scalpers_for_the_final_fantasy_secret_lair_make/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1l7ol7r/scalpers_for_the_final_fantasy_secret_lair_make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one collector on the MTG subreddit. “Then going on eBay and seeing hundreds of scalpers.” Some people were already reselling full<em> Final Fantasy</em> X Secret Lair sets  for $400 on eBay.

It’s worth remembering that Wizards doesn’t make any money from the second-hand market. Outside of wanting to gin up FOMO to artificially inflate demand, there’s no reason for the company not to just print as many cards as people actually want to buy. </p><p>That seemingly sound logic doesn’t appear to be applying to the regular <em>Final Fantasy</em> Universes Beyond set either, at least not yet. Officially launching on June 13, there’s no word on when re-prints for the best-selling expansion ever will start pouring back into stores. Rumors have suggested as early as July while others have suggested a worst-case scenario of <em>Final Fantasy MTG</em> cards <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1l7d5z8/no_final_fantasy_reprints_expected_until_q4_2025/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1l7d5z8/no_final_fantasy_reprints_expected_until_q4_2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being sold out until the mid-fall</a></span>. Maybe by then the scalpers will have moved on to other sets. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
