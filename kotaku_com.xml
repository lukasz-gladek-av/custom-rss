              <p>Most people assume that they need to spend over a thousand dollars on a MacBook Air to get a decent laptop that will run everyday tasks smoothly. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5402/">HP 15.6″ laptop flips that assumption on its head by providing solid performance, a generous 16GB of RAM, and a massive 1TB SSD for just $599, down from $2,599</a>. That’s roughly half the price of Apple’s entry-level laptop but with more storage and a bigger screen. Suddenly, this becomes a no-brainer, based on what you actually get for your money.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5402/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Performance That Covers All Your Bases</h2>
<p>The processor at the heart of this HP laptop is an <strong>Intel Core i3-N305 that runs at 1.8GHz, turbocharging at 3.8GHz</strong> when you need it to. This eight-core chip runs multiple browser tabs, video calls, document editing, and media streaming without choking or forcing you to wait. The 6MB cache memory makes it possible for the processor to access data sooner because such data has been previously accessed repeatedly, which means faster performance when switching between applications or loading up programs you use regularly.</p>
<p>That 16GB of DDR4 RAM makes all the difference in the usage of the laptop: The operating systems and web browsers of today are voracious devourers of memory, so with 16GB, you’ll be able to keep dozens of tabs open at the same time, run Microsoft Office apps, stream music, and handle video conferencing-all without lag. The 1TB PCIe SSD provides blazing-fast boot times and application launches while giving you enough room for years of documents, photos, and videos.</p>



<p>The 15.6-inch FHD touch screen features a 1920 x 1080 resolution for crisp text and detailed images. The IPS panel technology keeps colors accurate and vibrant when you’re looking from an angle, which comes into play when sharing content with others or using the device in different positions. Coming with a screen brightness of 300 nits, you can comfortably use this without squinting at a screen that’s too dimly lit, in well-lit rooms or near windows.</p>
<p>Touch capability brings convenience for those kinds of actions that are just awkward on a trackpad: scrolling through long documents, zooming into images, and navigating <strong>Windows 11’s touch-optimized interface</strong> are all more intuitive when you can simply reach out and touch the screen. The anti-glare coating cuts down on reflections from overhead lights and windows to help save your eyes during long work sessions. The <strong>Intel UHD Graphics run video playback and light photo editing with ease</strong>, though you’ll want a dedicated GPU if you’re planning serious gaming or professional video work.</p>
<p>The USB Type-C port transfers data at 5Gbps to let you move large files to external drives in record time. Dual USB Type-A ports accommodate older peripherals-mice, keyboards, and external hard drives that haven’t made the jump to USB-C. An HDMI 1.4b port connects to an external monitor or TV for a dual-screen setup that’s pretty much a productivity necessity. Wi-Fi 6 delivers faster wireless speeds and better performance in crowded networks than earlier Wi-Fi standards, while Bluetooth 5.4 connects your wireless headphones, mice, and other accessories with improved range and stability.</p>
<p>For $599, you’re paying less than a quarter of the original $2,599 price, which is an absurd discount that puts this laptop within reach of buyers who think decent computing power requires a four-figure investment.</p>

              <p>Winter storms have a way of knocking out power at the worst possible times but the <strong>Jackery Explorer 1000 (1500W) portable power station</strong> offers a solid solution to keep your essentials running when the grid goes dark. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5401/">Amazon has slashed the price from $899 to $449</a>, which makes this one of the best times to grab reliable backup power without emptying your wallet. You’ll also get a <strong>free 3-port 103W fast charger as a bonus</strong>.</p>

<h2>Delivers Power When You Need It Most</h2>
<p>The Explorer 1000 houses a 1<strong>,070Wh LiFePO4 battery within its compact frame, weighing only 23.8 pounds</strong>. This capacity translates to real-world performance that matters during an outage: running a full-size refrigerator for roughly 10 hours to preserve your groceries, powering a space heater for about 1.5 hours to stay warm, or keeping your internet router and laptop running for an entire day to work from home. Most household appliances are handled easily with its<strong> continuous output of 1,500W, while the 3,000W surge capacity</strong> is there when devices like refrigerators need that initial power boost to start.</p>
<p>The LFP battery chemistry separates this model from the more affordable options: Typical lithium-ion batteries do not last long, but this LiFePO4 arrangement retains <strong>upwards of 70 percent of its original capacity after 4,000 charge cycles</strong>. That kind of longevity equates to well over a decade of service, making that $449 price tag seem much more reasonable if you calculate it on a cost-per-year-of-ownership basis. This battery technology is also less susceptible to temperature extremes than a standard lithium-ion cell.</p>



<p>Getting from empty to full in just one hour through the emergency charging mode via the Jackery app changes how you can use this power station. If you hear about an incoming storm, you can top it off quickly instead of waiting overnight. The default 1.7-hour charging mode balances speed with battery health for everyday use, which helps explain that 10-year lifespan claim. <strong>ChargeShield 2.0 technology automatically regulates voltage and temperature</strong>, and safeguards both the power station and whatever devices you plug into it.</p>



<p>Port selection matters when you try to keep multiple devices alive during an outage: The <strong>Explorer 1000 has three AC outlets for standard plugs, two USB-C that provide up to 100W for fast charging laptops and tablets, one USB-A for older devices, and a DC car port for 12V equipment</strong>. This means not having to choose between charging your phone and powering your CPAP machine.</p>
<p>The <strong>foldable handle and relatively light weight</strong> make this truly portable despite its capacity. You can take it down to your basement during bad weather, toss it in the back of your truck for that weekend camping trip, or bring it to an outdoor concert where your band requires power for amps and mixers. Lighting from built-in LED lights helps navigate through darkened homes during nighttime power outages, with no fumbling for flashlights in the dark.</p>
<p>At $449, you’re getting backup power that costs less than a typical emergency generator while offering more flexibility and cleaner energy. Gas generators require fuel storage, regular maintenance, and produce fumes that make indoor use impossible. The deal is a massive 50% discount from the regular $899 price (and you get a free fast charger as well) which makes this an all-time low worth grabbing before winter weather arrives in full force.</p>
