While that scene was apparently filmed, it was cut because, according to Washington, the people in charged chickened out. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The original <em>Gladiator </em>was released all the way back in 2000 and became a massive hit for director Ridley Scott. It starred Russel Crowe as Maximus, a powerful Roman general who is betrayed, made a slave, and forced to fight in the gladiator arena. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gladiator-2-paul-mescal-pedro-pascal-trailer-date-1851570038&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gladiator-2-paul-mescal-pedro-pascal-trailer-date-1851570038">The sequel stars Paul Mescal as Lucius Verus</a></span>, the son of Maximus, who finds himself in a similar situation. The movie also stars Denzel Washington as Macrinus, a former slave looking to take over Rome, and according to returning director Scott, the character was supposed to have a “twinkle” of bisexuality. However, one scene showing this part of the character has seemingly been cut. </p><p>In a recent interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LRLe9bpGTQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2LRLe9bpGTQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gayety</em></a></span>, Washington sat down to talk about just how gay the Roman Empire is in the new historical epic. That’s when the <em>Equalizer </em>actor revealed the deleted gay kiss. </p><p>“I actually kissed a man in the film but they took it out, they cut it,” said Washington. “I think they got chicken. I kissed a guy full on the lips and I guess they weren’t ready for that yet.” </p><p>Washington then explained that the man he kissed in the deleted scene didn’t last long, adding: “I killed him about five minutes later. It’s <em>Gladiator</em>. It’s the kiss of death.” </p><p>Meanwhile, Denzel Washington is set to have a role in the next<em> Black Panther</em> movie from Marvel and Disney.
