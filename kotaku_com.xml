That episode will be the last gasp of an ambitious sci-fi universe the developers at Firewalk Studios helped to jumpstart this year. Unfortunately, the game itself ended up being an unprecedented flop, and Sony shut down the studio just last month. </p><p> “I don’t feel bad that it’s a part of the show, because I think it’s an episode that turned out really well, and you can kind of see the potential of this world and the characters,” Tim Miller, the lead creative behind<em> Secret Level</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/tim-miller-secret-level-prime-video-1235161263/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/tim-miller-secret-level-prime-video-1235161263/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Rolling Stone</em></a></span> this week. “If it’s the remaining vestige of that product, I hope the developers feel that it’s in some way worthy, just a little bit, of the blood, sweat, and tears they put into it.” </p><p>He added that he personally has no idea why <em>Concord</em> failed the way it did. “There was no nicer, more invested group of developers than the team on <em>Concord</em>,” Miller said. “I honestly don’t understand why it didn’t work. I know that they were trying to do the best they could, and they were a talented group of artists, so I feel terrible for that.”</p><p><em>Secret Level</em> premieres on Amazon’s streaming service on December 10 with new episodes dropping throughout that week. That might be when players finally catch a better glimpse of what <em>Concord</em>’s developers hoped would make it so special. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It seems it’s more that the company is worried they’ll play with it the wrong way. “By the time you notice, it’s already covered in drool...”</p><p>I have three cats, and I can’t say this has ever proved an issue. My ten-year-old is far more likely to cover the screen in that inexplicable sticky residue all children exude, even more so than Archie, the giant, lumbering ginger. Although, in fairness, I don’t own a slavering St. Bernard or Mastiff, leaving those ghastly tendrils of slobber everywhere they go. I wouldn’t want one of those playing <em>Zelda</em> on my device.</p><p>The tweet continues, “Pet saliva and urine can cause the device to malfunction due to water exposure. If you have pets, be careful about where you place your Switch.”</p><p>“Pets” seems to be doing rather a lot of work, trying to cover up for the real culprits here: <em>dogs</em>. Just name them, Nintendo. Stop trying to be all woke and refusing to profile. We’ve also got a pet corn snake, and I’m not in the least concerned about Cornflake running my Switch under the faucet.</p><p>However, according to the image accompanying the warning, it looks like Nintendo might be more concerned about rabid foxes than anything else.</p><p>Look, it’s good advice. You <em>should</em> stop your pets from peeing on your electronic devices. You also shouldn’t put them through the washing machine, run them over with your car, or drop them into a volcano.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Post-Activision Blizzard acquisition, the company has moved to bring its Xbox exclusives to rival platforms like the Switch and PlayStation 5, reach more players through cloud gaming on mobile, and bring PC gamers into its ecosystem through the Game Pass subscription library. </p><p>While an Xbox handheld sounds exciting on paper to longtime fans, it’s still not clear what it would bring to the table that’s missing from the Steam Deck, Rog Ally, and Switch. Still, that question hasn’t stopped it from continuing to invest in its line of Surface laptops. It’s not hard to imagine seeing one of those transformed into a gaming-first device, though no doubt more challenging in practice. </p><p>And plans can always chance.

Instead, the company opted to work directly with smart TV manufacturers to integrate that functionality. The company’s much hyped Xbox mobile gaming store is also still MIA. Still, it sounds like Spencer thinks the overall market is trending away from walled gardens, whether on Xbox, iPhone, or beyond.</p><p> “I think the ball is moving in the right direction,” Spencer said. “I think this idea of open platforms, where users have more choice, creators have more choice, you see the momentum, right?” </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
