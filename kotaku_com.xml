              <p>While <em>God of War Ragnarök</em> came out in 2022, the series as a whole has hardly been in Odinsleep. From remasters to new games and cancelled ones, much has stirred in Kratos’ mythological realm. After spotting <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstations-santa-monica-studio-is-developing-a-new-franchise-within-the-god-of-war-universe.1449790/">a now-deleted LinkedIn page</a> regarding Sony Santa Monica Studio, fans believe a big new <em>God of War</em> game is in the works, albeit one without its titular vengeance-seeker.</p>

 <p>The page from a Senior Writer at Sony Interactive Entertainment says they “Helped shape narrative vision and creative direction for a new franchise within the <em>God of War</em> universe” and ended their time at the studio last September. While speculative threads on ResetEra don’t hold much water on their own, reporter and industry fortune-teller Jason Schreier chimed in, <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstations-santa-monica-studio-is-developing-a-new-franchise-within-the-god-of-war-universe.1449790/page-4#post-151996075">posting</a> “I suppose now it’s become obvious what I meant by ‘not a new IP but it might feel like one.'”</p> <p>It’s been a busy month for the ol’ <em>God of War</em>. During the most recent State of Play, Sony <a href="https://kotaku.com/original-god-of-war-trilogy-getting-a-full-remake-2000668356">unveiled a remake for the entire original trilogy of games</a>, in which Kratos cleaves the entire Greek pantheon from Hades to Olympus. It was paired with <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-war-sons-sparta-prequel-2d-retro-shadowdrop-2000668367">a surprise 2D prequel, <em>Sons of Sparta</em></a>, which dropped that same day. On the other end, Sony <a href="https://kotaku.com/bluepoint-sony-playstation-ps5-god-war-2000671390">shuttered Bluepoint Games</a>, who recently saw their live-service <em>God of War</em> spin-off <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-multiplayer-bluepoint-days-gone-2-concord-1851742012">cancelled following the dramatic fall of <em>Concord</em></a>. Somewhere in the middle, <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-the-god-of-war-show-oh-no-oh-noooo-2000674450">the first glimpse</a> at Amazon’s live-action adaptation dropped online, leaving fans to contend with something that resembles a Super Bowl commercial.</p> <p>Prequels and adaptations address the past and present for <em>God of War</em>, but what does that leave for the future? Schreier’s recent post about a new-but-not-new IP seems to refer to one made <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot46-back-to-the-beach.1172010/page-406#post-142670637">last July</a>, in which he scratched out a rumor that Cory Barlog was developing a new sci-fi adventure. Put together, these two posts suggest that new IP and this spin-off are one in the same. This new game might see another dramatic departure, not only from the series’ main protagonist but its genre as well, similar to when <em>God of War</em> descended from a frenzied <em>Devil May Cry</em> hack-em-up to an over the shoulder affair. It would certainly be more consistent for Sony, who seem more eager to tease out their existing characters with spin-offs, cross-media adaptations, <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-colorful-three-player-co-op-game-ps5-pc-trailer-2000666041">live-service games</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-sony-parappa-1851653602">self-congratulatory cameos</a> than develop something new.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Zoomer Obsession With DVDs Is A Blueprint For Saving Gaming]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/dvds-zoomers-physical-media-retro-games-2000674865</link>
            <guid>1450027</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week the <a href="https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/business/story/2026-02-23/why-gen-z-wants-to-buy-rent-dvds-blu-rays-in-age-of-streaming"><em>Los Angeles Times</em> reported on a surprising trend</a> among young people. Physical media sales, DVDs especially, are experiencing a new burst of popularity. After a decade of freefall, enthusiasm among Gen Z halved a 20 percent sales decline in 2024 to just 9 percent in 2025. Stores have noticed. The <em>Times</em>’ Karla Gachet spoke with staff at cultural hubs like Cinefile and Vidiots to discover why 2026 is already shaping up to be their biggest year, with the latter renting a surprising 1,000 DVDs a week.</p>

 <p>It begs the question, could this pleasant trend take hold in video games too? “I definitely notice that younger people are actually interested in seeing where the game series of today first originated,” Daniel Teixeira of the long-running <a href="https://acgamesonline.com/">Toronto indie shop A&amp;C Games</a> tells <em>Kotaku</em>. “It’s cool how some are taking such a historical approach and paying respect to the roots.”</p> <p>For DVDs, it’s no mystery. There’s a perfect storm for a new fascination with physical media. Big names like A24, Criterion, and Letterboxd are fostering a new generation of cinephiles who are engaging with more than just routine tentpole blockbusters. On the other end, Netflix and other major streamers are failing to service a generation that actually cares about film. They are raising fees and playing ads, all while the relentless streaming war consolidation is <a href="https://kotaku.com/looney-tunes-max-warner-bros-streaming-original-hbo-1851770395">tossing back catalogues into a black hole</a>.</p> <p>The vinyl revival amongst millennials was partly about fidelity, partly about prestige. The return of DVDs is about necessity. The only practical way to dependably enjoy the films you love without corporate interruption is to own them on plastic. Add in some interesting third spaces to chat with like-minded folks and mill around in and suddenly you’ve got a burgeoning new scene going.</p>

 <p>The conditions rhyme in gaming. Mass distribution has overwhelmingly gone digital. Frustrations with <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-next-fest-feb-2026-gen-ai-art-demos-2000673280">curation</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/mastercard-denies-pressuring-steam-to-censor-nsfw-games-2000614393">censorship</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/john-wick-hex-delisting-steam-removed-three-days-ps4-pc-1851786259">long-term access</a> are as concerning here as anywhere else. The ennui from frictionless blockbuster releases is also clear. Players are picking up fewer games, and those who play the most are sticking with <a href="https://kotaku.com/most-playstation-5-owners-have-been-playing-the-same-games-since-2022-2000672009">games released years ago</a>. It has provoked the likes of Sony and Xbox into half-baked or shortsighted responses, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-hunters-gathering-closed-beta-open-beta-server-slam-same-time-ps5-pc-playstation-2000673261">live service</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/xboxs-new-boss-promises-not-to-flood-it-with-soulless-ai-slop-2000672087">AI</a>, leading to results that will inevitably shrink both the industry and the diversity of releases, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-industry-generational-divide-roblox-nintendo-2000672648">intensify disinterest</a>.</p>

 <p>But there are gaping chasms between the two mediums as well. Film and music survive because of the efforts of movie houses, rental, and record shops. Games have historically thrived in permanent third spaces like stores and arcades, but those traditionally put commerce before culture. When you think of them, you think of how much, or how little, is in your wallet. Games culture has more recently thrived in competitive spaces and online file sharing sites, though <a href="https://kotaku.com/myrient-retro-video-game-preservation-roms-ai-ram-cost-2000674477">digital spaces are even more precarious than real ones</a>.</p> <p>Teixeira shared these concerns. While young people are interested in exploring the past, the price point has been a barrier, making the pursuit “elitist” as a result. “I feel bad at how much they need to spend to acquire physical copies,” says Teixeira. “Ever since the pandemic, being able to collect older video games is far more difficult, particularly with whatever is most popular.”</p>

 <p>It puts a lot of pressure on used stores, whose sellers need to respect rising prices to attract goods, even if it locks out younger fans. Correcting this negative feedback loop requires an unorthodox approach.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000674879" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674879"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674879">Photo by the author</figcaption></figure> <h2><strong>Diamonds in the rough</strong></h2> <p>Since opening four years ago in San Bernardino County, <a href="https://linktr.ee/itsratnest">RATNEST</a> has also noticed the uptick in younger customers. “My younger demo has seen a significant increase,” says store purveyor Robbie Ratnest. “Especially with the kind of more obscure titles I carry involving anime, as well as the Japanese/Eastern horror, drama, tokusatsu, kaiju, etc. They’re very much looking for more than what modern media is offering for an average experience on top of it.”</p> <p>RATNEST looks a little less like your traditional games store and more like a punk haunt. The original walls are lost behind a mosaic of stickers and old TV feeds. The lighting is dramatic, darkness pierced with bangs of purple and static hums. The trail of vintage games, arcade cabinets and vinyl is like a treasure hunt. Robbie tells me that after working in “far too many places that do not reflect what they claim to be about,” he wanted a space that reinforced the culture first, the cash second.</p>

 <p>“I’m not here to make money, I make money to be here,” says Ratnest. “We generally shun those who are very outspoken about flipping games or getting them graded. Absolutely do not give a shit about that. I want these games in people’s hands who want to enjoy them.” Even if it puts his retirement in peril, he’d rather games be enjoyed than fed into another speculative asset market <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-30th-anniversary-pikachu-plush-scalpers-2000674775">that overshadows the entire scene</a>.</p> <p>Last fall I hit up the <a href="https://www.torontogameexpo.ca/">Toronto Game Expo</a>, a retro convention, at the CNE grounds. When I buy, I don’t buy for commercial value. I already own the most <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/nintendo-64/clay-fighter-sculptors-cut">valuable Nintendo 64 game</a>. I have it because I was a weird kid who fished it out of Blockbuster’s $5 bin. I buy items that speak to me. A boxed copy of <em>Myst</em> for the Atari Jaguar CD. A strategy guide for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantei_Jing%C5%ABji_Sabur%C5%8D:_Shinjuku_Ch%C5%AB%C5%8D_K%C5%8Den_Satsujin_Jiken"><em>Shinjuku Central Park Murder Case</em></a>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuoso_(video_game)"><em>Virtuoso</em></a>. When one vendor asked what I was looking for, I said “something interesting.” He immediately reached for his most expensive item. I respect the hustle, but it illustrates why games fail to foster themselves the way other mediums do.</p>

 <p>Vinyl and film have their intense collectors too, obviously, but unlike in retro games they are not the norm. Likewise, even big box game stores have provided a community space. It’s no secret that GameStop can function like an after-school daycare, the former CEO even <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-09-11/gamestop-s-new-ceo-adds-couches-and-tournaments-in-comeback-bid">planning to install couches to help students settle in</a>. But if you want to invest in games culture for the long haul, you’ll have to put profiteering aside.</p> <p>Once upon a time home media sales were half the battle. Box office busts like <em>Blade Runner</em>, <em>Fight Club</em> and <em>The Thing</em> were redeemed by VHS and DVD numbers over a lifetime. We’re still a ways out from restoring that ecosystem, and industries across entertainment are more short-term-profit-motivated than ever. But if you want games for 100 years over one, if you want off the live-service ride, it will require more imaginative thinking.</p> <p>“Video games provide you with pieces of your future self in a way that other media cannot,” says Ratnest. “That piece of that culture made from inspiration built upon inspiration will always overshadow the ‘collectability.'”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marathon Is A Thrilling Shooter With A Big Onboarding Problem]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/marathon-onboarding-update-ammo-meds-2000674872</link>
            <guid>1450024</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-server-slam-beta-ps5-review-impressions-guns-extraction-shooter-2000674107"><em>Marathon</em> is brutal</a>. That’s kind of the point. You play a futuristic gig economy worker paid by cyberpunk corpos who’s repeatedly getting murdered as you scavenge a dangerous, abandoned space colony for valuable gear, tech, and data. In a single-player game these vibes could be hitched to a meticulously calibrated campaign where every moment is carefully designed, engineered, and tested to keep things ultra-tense without repeatedly kicking the player’s teeth in. That’s a lot harder in a multiplayer game where every level comes with up to 18 super-sized human variables.</p>

 <p>This is the promise of <em>Marathon</em> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-ammo-pvp-ui-bungie-feedback-server-slam-2000674385">also its curse</a>. Play a couple of rounds and you will not be shocked to see that the game’s free beta weekend has a massive bounce rate on Steam as people try and it and seemingly don’t return. Bungie’s extraction shooter requires a lot of the player. They are at a severe disadvantage if they’re alone and not on the mic. Their characters start out weak and incredibly impaired. Sprinting quickly overheats your body. Even sliding at the wrong time can leave you hopelessly vulnerable.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">yeah learning how to properly cycle through a map does a lot more for getting people into it then anything else I've found. and without any help learning how to do that is fucking Hard</p> <p>— Paddy (@HorrorBuffPaddy) <a href="https://twitter.com/HorrorBuffPaddy/status/2027771488095306184?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 28, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>There are nuances to <em>Marathon</em> that are hard to immediately pick up on and the game routinely punishes you for being even a little dumb, impatient, or underprepared. You might think the point of the game is to drop into a match, kill tons of stuff, complete an objective, and escape with great loot. That’s what most other shooters have taught players, including Bungie’s own <em>Destiny 2</em>. In actuality, <em>Marathon</em> is about dropping down to a planet’s surface, hoarding your bullets like gold, and trying to avoid fights whenever and wherever possible.</p> <p>Doing so will help you slowly accrue all the gear and upgrades you need to start projecting yourself as a real badass threat on Tau Ceti IV. Failing to do so will make you feel like you’re hitting your head against a wall and making no progress because you’re terrible at the game and playing it wrong. You might actually be terrible and you are definitely playing it wrong, but one of those things is fixable and can still lead to a lot of enjoyment with<em> Marathon</em>. But the game itself currently offers little in the way of guardrails to steer players into how to approach <em>Marathon</em> and have fun with it while they’re still figuring it out.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Please do not change / make drastic changes to make things easier.</p> <p>The scarcity of resources + focus on stats makes this game completely unique and fun. </p> <p>Overheat is literally solved through a skill tree and items, it's not even remotely a big deal.</p> <p>— aaalex.hl (@aaalexhl) <a href="https://twitter.com/aaalexhl/status/2027926616748527627?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 1, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>In some ways it’s like the opposite of <em>Destiny 2.</em> Bungie’s ongoing loot shooter, despite its notoriously convoluted and confusing early game, is overwhelmingly generous, showering players with rare gear and second chances at every turn. If I had one main criticism of the game in recent years it’s that it’s gotten too trivial at the bottom end of the grind. But <em>Marathon</em> is like if you introduced players to <em>Destiny 2</em> by throwing them all into one of its end-game raids together. But also friendly fire was turned on, loot was scarce, and you only got to keep what you survived with.</p>

 <p>That’s an incredibly bold and exciting way to shake things up, and also an experience designed to chew most people up and spit them out before they ever catch a whiff of what makes <em>Marathon</em> so special they might want to spend $40 on it. We’re in day four of the game’s free server slam and Bungie has kept reassuring players that it’s listening to feedback about <a href="https://x.com/MarathonDevTeam/status/2027924343800648062">how to re-tune everything</a> from med pack and ammo economies to the gorgeous but overbearing UI, the lack of PVP, and heat generation during movement.</p> <p>I think it’s easy to look at any of those and understand why they might make <em>Marathon</em> less fun for people. They certainly don’t make it easier to play. But they’re also all things you can start to rationalize and come around on the more you play, especially once you start trying to adapt to the game that’s actually in front of you rather than the one you’re expecting. Unfortunately, I think <em>Marathon</em>‘s initial hostility will stop most people from ever getting to a place like that.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/god-war-tv-kratos-ryan-hurst-amazon-ugly-sonic-2000674861</link>
            <guid>1449988</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon revealed a first look at its <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-the-god-of-war-show-oh-no-oh-noooo-2000674450"><em>God of War</em> TV show</a> on Friday and it went terribly. People rushed to gawk at the live-action adaptation’s set image <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-amazon-show-cast-kratos-atreus-mimir-actor-2000666932">featuring Ryan Hurst as Kratos and child actor Callum Vinson</a> as a very young Atreus. The internet immediately spit out its Kombucha juice in collective confusion and bemusement. Hurst has now responded to the backlash on Instagram with a cryptic message that has some fans praying for an “ugly Sonic” turnaround.</p>

 <p>“Don’t believe everything you see on the internet, kids,” the <i>Sons of Anarchy</i> actor wrote on his Instagram stories <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWarRagnarok/comments/1rgzptt/this_was_posted_on_ryan_hursts_kratos_instagram/">over the weekend</a>. Fans were confused given that the image everyone was reacting to was an official marketing beat from Amazon to promote the upcoming series and not, like, a weird leak from the set or AI deepfake. But some fans are hoping that the image was just terribly assembled and touched up with AI effects and so the <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-amazon-live-action-image-online-reactions-kratos-atreus-2000674479">Spirit Halloween-looking result</a> isn’t actually representative of the real end product.</p>   <p>Look, out of context TV and movie promotional photos often look like crap. Remember everyone freaking out about Superman lacing his shoes while aliens shot purple lasers in the background in the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/2024/06/29/new-superman-set-photos-generate-strong-fan-reactions/">first photo</a> for James Gunn’s reboot? First looks like these also give studios a chance to adapt costumes and makeup in light of fan reactions. Maybe this was just an elaborate trial balloon to figure out the final design?</p> <p>That’s basically what some <em>God of War</em> fans are hoping for as they stick Amazon’s Kratos in the same bucket as “ugly Sonic.” People reacted so poorly to the initial trailer for CGI Sonic in the live-action movies that the filmmakers ended up going back and spending a bunch of money and time fixing every frame of his face. That’s one possible outcome here, though it’s still unclear what deeper truth Hurst is referring to. Is the image above failing to correctly capture how Kratos actually looks in the new TV series, or is he suggesting the show has already changed things up since back when this was taken?</p> <p>I can’t wait to see how this all pans out.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-next-fest-feb-2026-outbound-demo-firewatch-cozy-2000674849</link>
            <guid>1449955</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There’s a game I love called </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-long-dark-is-boring-and-thats-why-its-great-1775860048"><i><span>The Long Dark</span></i></a><span>. It’s a relentless survival sim that pits you against the elements out in the wilderness. You can starve, freeze to death, or get mauled by a pack of wild wolves. It has this oppressive, foreboding vibe to it that few games can match. <em>Outbound</em> is kind of the cozy sim version of that.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I played the Steam Next Fest demo for </span><i><span>Outbound</span></i><span>, a campervan driving survival game from developers Square Glade Games, and it feels like someone ran </span><i><span>The Long Dark</span></i><span> through a Pixar filter. These two games share so much in common: light crafting elements, a need to scavenge to fill your stomach, an intentionally light focus on your sense of direction, and that lonely feeling of living within a world that other people have left behind.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000674851" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674851"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674851">Square Glade Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>And yet, </span><i><span>Outbound </span></i><span>is also kind of the very antithesis of </span><i><span>The Long Dark</span></i><span>. You get hungry, sure, but you won’t starve to death: you’ll just pass out. The world is devoid of human interaction, but there’s plenty of cute little animals to make friends with instead (and a co-op mode I, ironically, couldn’t convince a friend to try with me). You can’t even run the animals over with your massive, unwieldy campervan. Trust me, I tried. There’s friction but the world isn’t out to make you fail.</span></p> <p><span>Strangely, that’s what I loved about my three hours with </span><i><span>Outbound</span></i><span>, whose demo is one of the most popular of February’s Steam Next Fest</span><span>. It’s an easy, breezy experience. It’s a survival game about trying your best to live as opposed to one about desperately trying not to die. There’s really no wrong way to play it, either, because the focus is on, if you’ll excuse the pun, simply enjoying the ride. You’re not even really tasked with accomplishing any specific goals. Sometimes you’ll get a prompt telling you there’s a new schematic you can unlock or a location you’ve yet to visit, but there’s always this “only if you want to” mentality to it all. </span><i><span>Outbound </span></i><span>won’t scream at you for playing it the wrong way, because there’s no right way to begin with.</span></p>

You can build a big house, start your own farm, or even amass a friendly army of bunnies by feeding them heaps of berries. All of these mechanics are straightforward to use and, most importantly, extremely forgiving. If all you wanna do is munch on some wild mushrooms and sit by a fire with your dog, </span><i><span>Outbound </span></i><span>doesn’t care, man. Put your hulking brute of a motorhome in park and just watch the sunset go down if you want, dude. No wolves are gonna rip you limb from limb once the moon appears, bro. Just pet the cute bunnies and let the chill, outdoor vibes wash over you.</span></p>

 <p><span>I saw a few reviews poke fun at <i>Outbound</i> for being “cozyslop,” and my heart goes out to those poor souls. Do we always need a deep endgame or a grand cause to work toward? Does there have to be a destination? Because if you go into </span><i><span>Outbound </span></i><span>expecting </span><i><span>Dark Souls</span></i><span> meets </span><i><span>Burnout</span></i><span>, you’re gonna come away disappointed (even though that sounds sick). But if you go in expecting </span><i><span>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance </span></i><span>mixed with </span><i><span>Firewatch</span></i><span>, you’ll get what you came for: a relaxing game about doing nothing in particular. I’m already looking forward to cozy-friend-slopmaxxing my </span><i><span>Outbound </span></i><span>playthrough </span><span>when the full release drops sometime before summer 2026.&nbsp;</span></p>
