Less than three years and 41 episodes later it’s been unexpectedly canceled by Nickelodeon, and one of the most emotionally gut-punching viral pieces of animation I’ve ever seen is not how I expected to find out. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197586" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Disney+ Pulls The Abyss Over Controversial Rat Scene — Again" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="128" data-playlist="197586,197585,197583" data-current="197586"><div><p>Disney+ Pulls The Abyss Over Controversial Rat Scene — Again</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23107.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I know <em>Tiny Chef</em> mostly through my kids who watch older episodes streaming online. A riff on both cooking shows and late night talk show hosts, it’s a bit like foodie’s equivalent of<em> Reading Rainbow </em>presented in a stop-motion style with a Wes Anderson-like sensibility. It educates kids on the basics of how the food they put in their bodies is grown and prepared. Maybe they learn a greater appreciation for cooking. At the very least they aren’t rotting their brains on algorithmic YouTube garbage. </p><p>So like most people, including those who watch <em>Tiny Chef</em>, I stumbled upon its cancellation announcement completely by accident when a now-viral short of the titular character getting the bad news directly from the execs at Nickelodeon popped into one of my social feeds. “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2uQbr3f_-I&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2uQbr3f_-I" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tiny Chef needs your help</a></span>,” reads the title of a YouTube video uploaded on June 24. In it, Tiny Chef is humming to himself and dusting his room when the news gets broken to him that the show is finished. “But I have ideas that will blow your mind,” he adorably lisps into the phone. <br></p><p>Instead of getting angry and blowing up he finally says, “I understand,” and tries to go back to cleaning before breaking down and sitting on his bed with his head in his hands. It’s crushing. “That little attempt to straighten himself out and then get back to what he was doing only to immediately break down...that’s REAL grief right there,” reads one of the top YouTube comments. “I didn’t know about this show until 10 minutes ago,” reads another. “But the depiction of the chef trying to be strong while this clearly gets to him is something I can relate to a lot and that clearly the creators understand very well.”</p><p>“<em>Tiny Chef</em> and the team need your help now more than ever!” reads a call for donations on the show’s website. “Many of you have said that you would die for <em>Tiny Chef</em>, we don’t need all that (!!!) but we do need crowd funding to keep going.” The creators have asked people to subscribe to the YouTube channel as well. It’s unclear at this point if the plan is to keep producing new episodes independently or try to demonstrate enough support so that one of the streaming services orders new episodes. </p><p>The show was created by animator Rachel Larsen, co-creators Adam Reid and Ozlem Akturk, and counts Kristen Bell of <em>Veronica Mars</em> fame as one of its producers and most frequent guest star. It’s the kind of kids’ programming that seems like a perfect fit for Disney or Apple. Brian Grazer and Ron Howard’s Imagine Entertainment took an equity stake in <em>Tiny Chef</em> back in 2019, so I’m sure it will find its feet. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/tiny-chef-nickelodeon-canceled-season-3-kristen-bell-1851785074]]></content:encoded>

It’s a daunting prospect, considering the size of the sandworms below and the spaceships above all vying for your head. Thankfully, <em>Dune: Awakening</em> offers options. You’ll always play on a server with other people, but how social you want to be is completely up to you. From one solo player to another, multiplayer isn’t all that scary. Here’s how it works in <em>Dune Awakening</em>!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196307" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="10 Minutes From The Last Of Us Part II’s Roguelike Mode " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="657" data-playlist="196307,196909,195891" data-current="196307"><div><p>10 Minutes From The Last Of Us Part II’s Roguelike Mode </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21857.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h174813"><a id=""></a>How multiplayer works in <em>Dune Awakening</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="ebbdbcf5aca6c002448360b14ae83e2c" data-recommend-id="image://ebbdbcf5aca6c002448360b14ae83e2c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player satanding in front of a sandworm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A player satanding in front of a sandworm." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Funcom / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ebbdbcf5aca6c002448360b14ae83e2c" data-recommend-id="image://ebbdbcf5aca6c002448360b14ae83e2c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A player satanding in front of a sandworm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When you first start your journey in <em>Dune: Awakening</em>, you’re thrust into a smaller zone that’s more story-centric, allowing you to grasp the ropes of desert survival without worrying about the greater overarching war ongoing across Arrakis: the war for spice. You’ll find yourself traversing Hagga Basin, a mostly PvE zone filled with quests, events, and opportunities to learn the game’s mechanics, combat, and crafting.</p><p>It can take some folks approximately 50 hours to fully prep for the game’s endgame, known as the Deep Desert, though some take up to 100 hours to reach this point by playing slowly. What is the Deep Desert in <em>Dune: Awakening</em>? It’s the ultimate battleground. Here, you’ll battle with 300 other players, fighting for spice and politics far above your station.</p><p>But worry not, the Deep Desert also features a PvE zone, should you rather avoid open combat with other players!</p><h2 id="h174814"><a id=""></a>How to play with friends in <em>Dune Awakening</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="ce6826bd566af634de914c46d9ad5416" data-recommend-id="image://ce6826bd566af634de914c46d9ad5416" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The guild screen in Dune Awakening." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The guild screen in Dune Awakening." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Funcom / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ce6826bd566af634de914c46d9ad5416" data-recommend-id="image://ce6826bd566af634de914c46d9ad5416" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The guild screen in Dune Awakening." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Everything is better with friends, right? Sure, some of those things are better left unsaid, but we’re talking about playing <em>Dune Awakening</em> multiplayer, of course. You have options here, including joining a guild, partying up with others, and spending a bit of real-world money to host a private server with just you and your buddies.</p><p>To play with your pals:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Open your map, then select the social menu from the bottom of the HUD.</li><li>Check the players tab to see active players in the server, or search for your friend’s name manually, before sending out a friend request.</li><li>Select your prospect once they add you, then hit invite to party.</li></ul><p>Alternatively, your friend can invite you, which causes a pop-up to appear on your HUD. If you hit ‘Enter’ when it appears, you’ll join their group, so long as there’s room. Only four players can play in a group.</p><p>You can also form a guild for 1,000 Solaris—<em>Dune Awakening</em>’s in-game currency—and amass a small army of players for when you reach the Deep Desert. Sure, it’s expensive and you could use that money for better gear and other investments, but think about all the fun you’ll have with your buddies!</p><hr><p><em>Dune Awakening</em> launches on June 10th on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-multiplayer-1000-solaris-pvp-pve-hagga-1851784965]]></content:encoded>

Each glimpse we get of him using his powers appears to be from one of two scenes in the movie. This final trailer shows him just a little more, but I still want to see that stretchy king smack someone around with long, flailing limbs. I hope the fact that Marvel has kept it under wraps in the trailers isn’t indicative of him not being in the action as much.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197556" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="GTA 6 Trailer 2: 13 Details You Might Have Missed" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="210" data-playlist="197556,197583,197586" data-current="197556"><div><p>GTA 6 Trailer 2: 13 Details You Might Have Missed</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197556/197556_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197556/197556_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197556/197556_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23080.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The final trailer for <em>First Steps </em>doesn’t really tell us much that we didn’t already know. Galactus is coming and the Silver Surfer is here to foreshadow his arrival. We still don’t see more than the planet-eating invader’s foot in this trailer, and at this point, I guess we won’t get a really good look at him until the film premieres on July 25. These trailers have shown a lot of the same stuff each time—this latest trailer perhaps showing even less than previously—and the most charitable read I can give is to assume that Marvel is keeping this movie’s secrets close to its chest. The Fantastic Four’s debut is a big deal for the MCU, and maybe you don’t want to spoil every surprise and cool sequence, but in doing so it’s kept me from finding anything to latch onto. How many different times can I hear Invisible Woman say that they’ll handle this apocalyptic moment as a family? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-first-steps-trailer-silver-surfer-mcu-1851776570&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-first-steps-trailer-silver-surfer-mcu-1851776570">Julia Garner still looks pretty sick as the Silver Surfer, though</a></span>.</p><p>Check out the full trailer below:</p><p><em>Fantastic Four: First Steps </em>is the first film in the MCU’s Phase Six, and then the movies will take a break for a bit until the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-secret-wars-delay-gta-6-1851782163&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-secret-wars-delay-gta-6-1851782163">recently delayed <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em></a></span> premieres on December 18.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-first-steps-last-trailer-mcu-marvel-1851785068]]></content:encoded>
