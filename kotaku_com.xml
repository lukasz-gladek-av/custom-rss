              <p>Winter storms have a nasty habit of knocking out power right when you need it most. Your heating system goes silent, the fridge starts warming up and suddenly you’re digging through drawers for flashlights while your phone battery ticks down to single digits. The <strong>Jackery Explorer 1000</strong> exists to keep your essentials running when the grid fails, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/">and it’s currently sitting at an all-time low of $429, slashed from $799</a>. It’s Amazon’s number one best-seller in portable power stations, with over 3,000 reviews averaging 4.6 stars.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Serious Power in a Package You Can Actually Carry</h2>
<p>The Explorer 1000 has 1,070Wh storage<strong> with a 1,500W continuous and 3,000W surge output</strong>. Those specs translate to real capability during cold winter power shortages: you can heat a room with a space heater, power your fridge to prevent food spoilage, charge several devices at a time and have lights throughout a house.</p>
<p>The pure sine wave AC output translates to sensitive equipment like laptops, medical equipment and modern appliances receiving clean power with no voltage spikes that will destroy equipment. You can <strong>power up to seven devices at a time with three AC outlets, two 100W PD fast-charging capability USB C ports, a single USB A port, and a DC car port</strong>.</p>



<p>The one-hour charging capability is game-changing and addresses the biggest weakness of traditional power stations: If you hear a winter storm warning and realize your backup power is sitting at 20%, you can fully charge the Explorer 1000 in just 60 minutes using the emergency charging mode activated through the Jackery app. Most competing units need 5-8 hours to reach full capacity which means you’re often caught unprepared. The default charging mode takes 1.7 hours which balances speed with battery longevity but having that emergency option provides real peace of mind when severe weather is approaching fast.</p>



<p>The LiFePO4 chemistry makes this unit distinct from more affordable lithium-ion competitors: The LFP batteries support in excess of 4,000 charge cycles with 70% or higher retained original capacity, which translates to a period exceeding a decade in continuous reliability. Common lithium-ion batteries significantly lose their integrity following 500-800 cycles.</p>
<p>Weighing a mere 23.8 pounds, the Jackery Explorer 1000 is incredibly portable for its capability. The collapsible handle makes moving a breeze from your garage to your living room during a power outage, or your trunk to a backcountry camping trail away from the power grid. <strong>Compare that to gasoline generators that weigh 50-80 pounds with storage for gasoline and maintenance</strong>, and that put fumes and noise throughout your home. The Jackery is silent as a whisper, zero emissions, and can be safely moved indoors where a gasoline generator would be lethal.</p>
<p>At $429 down from $799, you are receiving the portable power station that thousands rely on to power their homes in the winter months when power reliability is most critical. Make sure you don’t miss that opportunity before it runs out of stock.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s something about owning an iPad that feels like stepping into the Apple ecosystem the right way. It’s the device that bridges the gap between your phone and a full laptop and it’s perfect for taking notes in class, watching Netflix in bed or getting actual work done without lugging around a heavy machine. The problem has always been the price tag that comes with that Apple polish.</p>
<p>Right now, though, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">Amazon has slashed the 11-inch iPad with the A16 chip, 128GB storage and WiFi option down to $279 from $349</a>, and this is a very rare opportunity. Apple doesn’t love discounts and you won’t find this price on their official website where it’s still sitting at full retail.</p>

<h2>A More Balanced Power and Portability</h2>
<p>A16 chip on this iPad is the same processor that was used to power the iPhone 14 Pro so you have f<strong>lagship power in a tablet form</strong>. The processor handles intensive processes like Lightroom photo editing, iMovie video editing or multitasking with dozens of apps without skipping a beat or lagging behind. 6<strong>-core CPU and 5-core GPU deliver seamless power across everything</strong> from casual web surfing to CPU-intensive creative work.</p>
<p>The <strong>11-inch Liquid Retina display offers a 2388 x 1668-pixel resolution</strong> or 264 pixels per inch. Text is clear and readable, colors spring to life with precision and the True Tone technology dynamically adjusts the white point to complement your environment lighting. That means the screen appears natural under direct sunlight, soft interior lighting or the bluish tint of night. The full P3 wide color gamut is also incorporated into this display, so photos and videos are shown their full complement of colors instead of the squeezed palette found on lower-end tablets.</p>



<p>Touch ID built into the top button gives you <strong>secure and one-touch access to your iPad</strong>. A press of your finger and you’re in, no typing passwords or remembering complex passwords required. And yes, even for making App Store purchases and confirming payment methods, and offers a sense of security that feels convenient.</p>
<p>The 12MP rear and 12MP ultra-wide-angle front camera are found on the landscape edge of the device: That placement of the front camera is smarter than that might sound because if you are holding the iPad in landscape to Zoom or FaceTime, the camera is centered above the display rather than awkwardly positioned off to the side. The Center Stage feature uses machine learning to zoom and pan automatically during Zoom or FaceTime calls, and keeps you in the picture as you move around.</p>



<p>Wi-Fi 6 capabilities translate to faster wireless throughput and higher throughput in busy network scenarios such as college campuses or busy coffee shops where dozens of devices are competing with each other for bandwidth. Greater efficiency translates to greater battery life with ratings by Apple at a full day of use. In the real world, that t<strong>ranslates to up to 10 hours of video playback</strong> or web surfing per recharge cycle.</p>
<p>At $279, we are getting the iPad experience at a price that at long last makes sense, and with Apple’s typical reluctance to depreciate their merchandise, this deal will not last long.</p>
