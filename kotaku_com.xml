Registration will open tomorrow, January 17, at noon PT / 2 p.m. CT / 3 p.m. ET and will last until noon on January 26 local time for each city.

After a waterfall of leaks, it was expected that the Japanese company would make an announcement for the official reveal this week, and then went and threw everyone by just surprise-announcing it at 8 a.m. ET without warning. Within that announcement was a screen showing a date for a new Nintendo Direct.</p><p>This will be the first Nintendo Direct since July 2024, the <em>Mario</em> makers having entirely skipped their usual September edition, which only fueled confusion over what was happening with the Switch 2. It’s described as being for the “Nintendo Switch 2,” but doesn’t make clear if this will be purely detailing the console itself (which many had hoped would already be available by April), or games that will be available for it too.</p><p><em>Mario Kart 9</em>, already widely expected to be a release title (given it’s been an extraordinary 11 years since <em>8</em> first came out), <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-9-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-trailer-1851740833&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-9-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-trailer-1851740833">is pretty certain to be among them</a></span>, but fans are obviously hoping to see a new tentpole <em>Super Mario</em> title, given it’s been well over seven years since <em>Odyssey</em> shifted the original Switch.</p><p>We know that Switch 1 (as we’ll have to get used to calling it now) games will mostly work on the new system, both physical and digital editions, but obviously there’s going to be great clamor for brand new titles that’ll take advantage of the new system specs which will also hopefully be fully revealed before or during the Direct.</p><p>Best guess: the Direct will be pre-empted with a lot of leaks from stores about dummy boxes and stock expectations for the Switch 2 itself, with a release date revealed in the Direct broadcast. Maybe early May? Please don’t be later than that, Nintendo.</p><p>Until then, more speculating, rumor-pondering and thumb-twiddling.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We didn’t get a the release date today beyond the fact that it’s coming sometime in 2025, but we did get the official name. Switch successor is indeed called the Nintendo Switch 2. How un-Nintendo of them!</p><p>The trailer shows off a bigger, sleeker upgrade to the 2017 hardware that’s sold over 150 million units. The new Joy-Con are black instead of red and blue, and the right one has a new, mysterious c-button. They attach to the screen—which is larger with a smaller bezel—with magnets. But Nintendo still hasn’t gone into detail on the official specs or what the hardware will be capable of. It looks cool though:</p><p>A quick segment near the end of the trailer appears to show the upgraded Joy-Con moving like a PC gaming mouse, possibly an allusion to a new optical tracking capability. The company also reiterated that the Switch 2 will play Switch games, but with a major caveat. “Certain Nintendo Switch games may not be supported on or fully compatible with Nintendo Switch 2,” a disclaimer at the end of the trailer reads. It’s unclear which games will be included in that carve-out, but more information is promised on Nintendo’s website at a later date. </p><p>Nintendo’s official Switch 2 reveal comes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-genki-ces-2025-official-1851736830&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-genki-ces-2025-official-1851736830">after weeks of alleged leaks purporting to show everything</a></span> about the new console from its motherboard to its new magnetic Joy-Con connectors.

And they basically all turned out to be right.</p><p>Whether the Switch 2 can pull off a similar year-one coup will depend mostly on what first-party exclusives the system launches with. The one-two punch of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> was a powerful recipe for success with the original hardware. Can the Switch 2 muster a similarly impressive lineup? <em>Mario Kart 9</em>, which certainly looks like what’s been revealed in the Switch 2 preview trailer, would make for a great start. </p><p>One thing that might help is a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/halo-master-chief-collection-ps5-switch-2-port-1851737175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/halo-master-chief-collection-ps5-switch-2-port-1851737175">steady drumbeat of third-party ports from Xbox, Ubisoft, and others</a></span>.

It’s coming out this year, has a bigger screen, magnetic joy-con controllers, and can play the original Switch’s games through backwards compatibility. Also, Nintendo may have nonchalantly announced a new <em>Mario Kart </em>game alongside the system announcement.</p><p>As you can see in this trailer, the Switch 2 is shown playing a <em>Mario Kart </em>game, and while I initially thought it was <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe </em>at a glance, <em>Mario Kart </em>fans <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/adifying/status/1879877991414812977&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/adifying/status/1879877991414812977" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">don’t seem</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/nemesislacroix/status/1879878852769640544&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/nemesislacroix/status/1879878852769640544" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to recognize</a></span> the track players are racing through. It looks like the Switch 2 could launch with <em>Mario Kart 9</em>. One of the most notable differences between the game we saw and previous <em>Mario Karts</em> is Donkey Kong. If you look at the gorilla racer in the background of different shots, you’ll notice he looks pretty similar to his <em>Super Mario Bros. Movie </em>incarnation, rather than  the classic design seen in games like <em>Mario Kart 8</em>. Some fans have observed that Mario’s proportions seem to be a little more cartoony and similar to what we saw in the recent <em>Super Mario Wonder</em> as well. So while Nintendo didn’t officially put a name to the footage, it’s a pretty reasonable leap to assume this is <em>Mario Kart 9</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,196626,196698" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Fans have been combing through the brief bits of footage to determine some of the playable racers, and the roster we can see includes: Mario, Luigi, Bowser, Peach, Yoshi, Toad, Daisy, Rosalina, Donkey Kong, and what appears to be Pauline, Toadette, a Goomba, and a Koopa.</p><p>Nintendo has confirmed it will hold a Direct presentation on the system <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848">on April 2</a></span>, and we’ll almost certainly get a better look at the new <em>Mario Kart </em>then.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
