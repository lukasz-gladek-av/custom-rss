              <p>2022’s&nbsp;<em>Strange Horticulture</em> was a breakout indie hit for brother developers Bad Viking. The puzzle game about running an esoteric plant store hid so many depths beyond its species-identifying core, with rich lore, character stories to become invested in, and the rumbling sense of a sinister underbelly. Today arrives its sequel <em>Strange Antiquities</em>, which I’m delighted to report not only maintains everything that made the first game so adored, but also improves it in almost every possible way.</p> <p>Returning to the fantasy city of Undermere, we’re now working in an adorable little antiques shop that sells mystical obscura such as bejeweled statuettes, charm necklaces that vibrate with peculiar energies, and objets d’art that give you the heebie-jeebies when you hold them. The shop’s owner, your boss, has to head out of town for a few days, and you’re left in charge despite not knowing what <em>any</em> of the weird items on the shelves actually are. Thankfully the boss, a Thaumaturge named Eli White, also left behind his copy of <em>Strange Artefacts: A Guide To Occult Objects</em> by T.S. Gill, which contains descriptions of all manner of magical items. Sadly very few pictures of them, but enough information that, upon scouring the shelves and holding each object, you will be able to deduce which might be which, and as such supply them to your customers.</p>  <p>In this sense, things are much the same as in <em>Strange Horticulture</em> and your dealings with its otherworldly plant life. However, in <em>Strange Antiquities</em>, everything is a lot more detailed and involved. For instance, in the previous game you could pick up any plant and look at it, but that was about it. In&nbsp;<em>Horticulture</em>, every strange item in the collection can be investigated in four different ways. You can study its “Color and Composition,” use your “Sense of Touch,” seek out “Scent and Sound,” and apply your “Inner Perception.” The first three are self-explanatory, and each gives you a unique response for the object (unless they’re not applicable), while the fourth is a more psychic response to what you’re holding. For instance, a red bottle with a raised snake motif will tell you it’s made of red clay, while the snake’s eyes are “small green gemstones,” the bottle feeling smooth with the snake as “raised detailing,” and no particular special smell or noise. But you’ll also learn that to hold it is “unsettling,” and “the eyes seem to pierce my soul.” Such details are all essential to narrowing down exactly what this odd red bottle might be, and what it might contain.</p>

 <p>Not only do you consult the indexed pages of Occult Objects, but you also have a tome written by Eli himself called <em>Gemstones &amp; Their Thaumic Properties</em>, an ancient pamphlet entitled&nbsp;<em>On Curses &amp; their Effects</em>, and an ever-growing pile of papers and notes that will provide further information. And then, as if all this weren’t enough, you’ve also got a detailed map of Undermere with which you can interact, clicking on one of its 32 named and dozens more unnamed locations in an effort to discover new antiquities to add to the shelves. Locations are identified through solving puzzles either dreamt during the night, or on notes given to you by clients, and some of these locations then reveal their own detailed maps to explore, such as the two floors of Gleaston Castle, and the Catacombs beneath the city.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000626497" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626497"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626497">© Bad Viking / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>That’s a lot! And yet it never feels unmanageable,&nbsp;<em>Strange Horticulture</em>‘s superb delivery ensures you gain all these elements at a steady pace, and the game is never in a rush. You can take as long as you need for every customer, without any antsy comments or nagging, meaning you can just relax and leaf through the pages of the books, or decide to solve a map puzzle for a break, never pressured. Also, the game comes with a hint system if you ever do get stuck, and it’s a super-smart one. Rather than just spoiling a puzzle, it begins with far more gentle nudges, like reminding you to check a note you received, or asking if you remember what a customer recently said about something. Prompts like these never feel like they’re taking away from your solving the puzzle, rather just turning your head to face the right direction before you start. Keeping asking for more help and things get more specific, of course.</p>

 <p>But even more than hints, the way the game is presented does wonders for clarity. Like <em>Horticulture</em>, the whole game is played in the single location of the store, but this time the shop is so much better arranged. Customers appear in the middle, with shelves stretching off-screen to the left and right, and cupboards and drawers down below. Open the map and it’s spread out beneath the counter, and the same table is also capable of…well, I’m not going to tell you. Hidden all around this are tiny details, little knobs that, if pulled, can reveal secret drawers, and even places just below the counter with room for three of the mystical objects. Place the correct three in the correct order (based on other clues you receive) and even more secrets are uncovered. It means everything feels so special, all that thrill of a beautiful puzzle box, in the cozy setting of a candle-lit magical store.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000626498" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626498"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626498">© Bad Viking / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The game’s puzzles, whether the core identification challenges that make up the bulk of what you do, or the extra elements that appear in the form of playing cards or furtively passed notes, are engagingly challenging without requiring Pentagon clearance to solve. Every character is an intriguing oddity, and the game’s overall storyline is much more involving than that of the previous game. The whole thing has a much greater sense of depth, and the sinister undertones feel more pronounced, more intriguing. It is everything a sequel should be: the same superb idea, better developed in every area, to produce something that reaches higher, wider, and deeper.</p> <p><em>Strange Antiquities</em> is out now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2885870/Strange_Antiquities/">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Strange-Antiquities-2888529.html?srsltid=AfmBOoq1YohG3Je7f20IciRveA5b2Pg0pXeXQF4pxEGce_D_fu6vikOD">Switch</a>, for the ludicrously reasonable price of $16.</p>

              <p>Whether you’re gaming on an Xbox console, PC, or Android device, the first-party Xbox Core controller is still one of if not the very best gamepad out there. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4145/">Right now, it’s been discounted down from $65 to just $50 for the robot white version</a>. That’s a solid $15 discount. If you want something a bit funkier than that, colorways like the deep pink, shock blue, and pulse red are on sale too in the $50 to $55 range.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4145/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>While Sony each generation has decided to push forward, adding on new bells and whistles to its DualShock controller design like a touchpad or haptic triggers, Microsoft had different plans. Xbox firmly planted its flag in the dirt back in 2013 with the release of the Xbox One controller and said “We’re done here.” 12 years later, the design is mostly unchanged with some slight adjustments to keep with modern times such as Bluetooth support and a change over to USB-C. Other than that and some slightly upgraded materials, you’re basically looking at the same controller that launched the same year<em> Grand Theft Auto V</em> came out the first time.</p>
<p>Nothing’s really changed within the form factor of the Xbox Core controller because it just works.</p>

<h2>Unbeatable Controller Design</h2>
<p>I played through <em>Hollow Knight</em> on my PlayStation 5 in the lead up to the release of&nbsp;<em>Silksong.</em> It’s fine, but I decided to gift myself a new Xbox controller for playing the new one on PC Game Pass. I haven’t updated my Xbox controllers since those first few years of the Xbox One. I’d been mostly using either PlayStation or some third-party stuff like 8BitDo’s selection of retro controllers, but unboxing my brand new Sky Cipher Xbox controller felt like returning home.</p>



<p>An underrated, less talked about, standout of the Xbox controller is its D-pad. Dashing and hopping around with Hornet through Pharloom with that just sings. Feels comfortable to grip onto for long game sessions.&nbsp;The textured grips on the triggers, bumpers and back-case are a nice touch which are very welcomed when my hands are dripping with sweat as I go up against the Splinter Sister for an eighth time.</p>
<p>Some new improvements that have actually come in this last decade is a whole suite of customization options. You can map out button layouts to your own personal preference with the Xbox Accessories app. Anything that adds accessibility for folks who need it is a win in my book, even if the person using it is just someone who grew up on Nintendo that keeps forgetting which one is the A button.</p>

              <p><span>We know </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-most-popular-netflix-streaming-2000620409"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span>, Netflix’s animated musical that has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381"><span>set the world on fire for the past few months</span></a><span>, is likely </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-theories-questions-netflix-2000620717"><span>getting a sequel</span></a><span> after the movie’s runaway success. However, it seems like we might not have to wait too much longer to see Huntr/x, the film’s demon-slaying K-pop group, again, as the Motion Picture Association has leaked that a short film follow-up has been rated.</span></p> <p><span>A </span><a href="https://www.filmratings.com/Content/Downloads/cara_rating_bulletin.pdf"><span>document on the MPA film ratings website</span></a><span> includes a listing for something called </span><i><span>Debut: A KPop Demon Hunters Story</span></i><span>, which is rated PG for “some action/violence and scary images.” Sony is listed as the distributor, and the listing says it is a “short subject,” which is a designation given to short films rather than the feature-length movies the ratings board usually handles. The fact that it’s already been rated means that its release is probably imminent, and the title suggests it could cover the early days of Huntr/x’s K-pop career. Maybe we’ll get to see the girls meet for the first time, learn the truth about the demons preying upon humanity, and establish themselves as a dominant force in the K-pop world. If so, we might also get some new songs?</span></p> <p><span>All of this is speculation right now, but it was established back in 2023 that Sony would produce a short film based on </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><a href="https://variety.com/2023/artisans/news/spider-verse-short-film-spider-within-sony-animation-1235567757/"><span>through its LENS mentorship program</span></a><span>, which was also responsible for </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcGPpwFdE1Y"><i><span>The Spider Within: A Spider-Verse Story</span></i></a><span>, a seven-minute-long short based on the </span><i><span>Spider-Verse </span></i><span>movies. It’s unclear if </span><i><span>Debut </span></i><span>will be streaming on Netflix like the full movie or if it will be on publicly available channels like YouTube.</span></p> <p><span>If there is new music, I’ll have to update our </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><span>ranking of the movie’s original songs</span></a><span>, though it will take something really special to dethrone the song in the number one spot.</span></p>
