            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ahead of <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s November 14 release date and the early access beta running from October 2 to 5<em>, Call of Duty </em>Next showed off some live footage from the latest entry in the long-running of the military shooter series. The game looks like a solid, speedy, competitive shooter that’s utilizing its futuristic setting for some war-themed sci-fi fantasy. So let’s jump into what stood out during CODNext.</p>  <h2><em>Black Ops 7</em> multiplayer looks tactile and fast</h2> <p>I don’t blame those who think all of these games look the same, but if you like a fast shooter with some interesting opportunities for gravity-defying tactics, you might want to check out footage from today’s event–especially if you’re a fan of&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 2</em>, to which <em>7</em> is intended as a spiritual successor.</p>

 <p>Set in the near future,&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em> has some fancy tech that builds off the advanced movement techniques in&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>. Wall-jumping, sliding, tactical stance, it all combines very seamlessly in both the scripted sizzle reels and the actual gameplay shown off today.</p>

 <p>The wall-bouncing, which looks like it’ll owe&nbsp;<em>Titanfall&nbsp;</em>a royalty check, is particularly exciting as various streamers showed off how these techniques can be used for some vertically lethal plays and opportunities to get new, unexpected sight lines.</p>

 <h2><em>Black Ops 7</em> will ship with 18 maps, mostly focusing on 6v6</h2> <p>In what’s shaping up to be a healthy roster of maps,&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7 </em>will feature 16 6v6 maps, with 13 of those being brand new designs joined by three remakes of&nbsp;<em>BLOPS6 </em>maps. The remaining two maps are for 20v20 battles.</p> <p>During the beta, folks can jam on six of these maps, all of which are of the smaller, 6v6 variety. Map design in&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7 </em>is particularly focused on standard, three-lane construction. That tried-and-true design, however, might be just what allows the game’s advanced movement techniques to really let players mix things up.</p>

 <h2>Overclocking equipment</h2> <p><em>BLOPS7</em> will contain many of the usual loadout options we’ve long come to expect from&nbsp;<em>CoD</em>, but you’ll be able to further customize your class by “overclocking” lethal, tactical, field upgrades, and score streaks. Once unlocked, these let you equip two modifications in addition to the ordinary functions of the equipment. One such example shown off today was the Stim Shot, which lets you either cancel out enemy-induced debuffs&nbsp;or gain a speed boost when using it.</p>

 <h2>Weapon build sharing</h2> <p>In what stood out to me as one of the coolest features in&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7</em>, folks will be able to quickly share weapon builds with each other by way of a simple code the game generates when you finish a specific setup. This should make it pretty easy to just grab an effective meta build and jump into a match.</p>

 <h2>Season one aims to be the ‘biggest’ in <em>BLOPS</em> history</h2> <p>Though&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7</em> has a pretty sizeable stock of maps to choose from at launch, Treyarch announced today that seven additional multiplayer maps will join the game over the course of its first season, with six of them for the 6v6 mode. Ranked play will arrive in season two.</p> <h2>Nuketown returns</h2> <p>Looking like it came straight out of Bethesda’s&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em> games, the end of the multiplayer reveal showed off a couple of shots of fan-favorite&nbsp;<em>CoD</em> map Nuketown. Check it out:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000630311" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630311"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630311">© Screenshot: Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Nuketown is expected to arrive “soon” after&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7</em>‘s launch.</p> <hr> <p>All in all, the big takeaway from CODNext is that if fast-paced, competitive shooters are your thing, <em>BLOPS7</em> is looking pretty solid.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>EA has released a content roadmap for <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-battlefield-6-trailer-direct-attack-against-call-of-duty-celeb-trailer-skins-ea-2000629910"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> that outlines all the new goodies and free DLC players can expect during the online shooter’s first season.</p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em>, EA’s next installment in the popular military sim series, is nearly here. The FPS arrives on October 10 on console and PC. But in 2025, games like <em>Battlefield</em> can’t just launch and be done. No, they need roadmaps! Promises of more content coming down the pipeline. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-season-1-roadmap-preview">And that’s just what’s been revealed,</a> with <em>BF6</em>‘s season one roadmap confirming two new maps are arriving in <em>BF6</em> before the end of the year, as well as new modes, guns, and more.</p> <p>As seen in the new roadmap shared on September 29, season one of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-framerate-fps-xbox-series-s-ps5-2000626043"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> doesn’t start at launch. Instead, it begins on October 28, a few weeks later. The first season is being split into “phases” that will bring in new content every month for the rest of 2025.</p> <figure><figcaption>© EA</figcaption></figure> <h2>Phase One of <em>BF6</em>‘s first season</h2> <p>The first Phase is Rogue Ops, and it adds a brand new map: Blackwell Fields. This is a big map set in the California badlands, and it will support all modes as well as land and air vehicles. The first phase also adds Strikepoint, a new 4v4 mode all about “intense, small team tactical” combat. Squads fight over an objective across multiple rounds, but only have one life each round. Sounds tense. Not sure it’s something I’ll play, but different strokes, etc.</p>

 <p>Also being added in the first phase are an APC vehicle, a compact carbine rifle, a new sidearm, and some extra attachments for weapons.</p> <h2>Phase Two of <em>BF6</em>‘s first season</h2> <p>Phase two of <em>BF6</em>‘s first season kicks off on November 18 and adds a new map, Eastwood, which seems to be a bit smaller than Blackwell Fields. This new battlefield is also set in the United States and is located in a “sleepy, affluent suburb” next to a golf course. All modes supported, but it seems no jets will be available on this one, just helis. A new mode called Sabotage is being added in this phase, too. The new mode is another smaller one focused on 8v8 combat as teams try to destroy as many objectives as possible before time runs out. One team defends, the other attacks. Once again, not sure if this is what I want from <em>Battlefield</em>, but cool for folks who like it.</p>

 <p>Also being added in phase two: Battle Pickups. This is a returning feature from some past<em> Battlefield</em> games. Players will be able to find powerful and advanced weapons that can be picked up and used until they run out of ammo or you die and drop them. I’m excited to see how this might change up some maps.&nbsp; A new double-barreled pump shotgun, revolver, and attachment is also being added during this phase.</p>

 <h2>Phase three of <em>BF6</em>‘s first season</h2> <p>Finally, on December 9, phase three of the season arrives. EA says this is the last phase of the season. This phase doesn’t add a new map, but instead changes up an existing map. <em>BF6</em>‘s Empire State map, set in NYC, will temporarily be covered in snow during this phase of the season. According to the roadmap, this won’t simply be a fun cosmetic change, but will actually affect gameplay. There will be a new “Freeze” mechanic introduced on the snow-covered map that EA describes as a “gameplay modifier.” No other details yet.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the third and final phase will add an ice-climbing axe as a new melee weapon option, and a new limited-time “Ice Lock” even that will happen exclusively on the snowy Empire State map.</p> <hr> <p>Phew! That’s a lot of content and all of it is, assuming nothing gets delayed, arriving in the game’s first few months. I’ll be curious to see how much content future seasons include. Can we expect two maps and multiple guns in every season? That seems like a lot. But if the devs can pull it off, <em>Battlefield 6</em> might end up being one of the best entries in the series. And that might help distract people from the news that <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">EA is being bought up by Saudi Arabia’s prince and Jared Kushner’s investment firm</a>.&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em> is out on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-devs-%E2%80%98want%E2%80%99-people-to-cheat-during-the-black-ops-7-beta.1312687/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In a few days, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a> beta launches on console and PC. This will be the first time players get a chance to go hands-on with the upcoming FPS. It will also be the first chance hackers and cheaters get to possibly screw up the game. And Activision not only expects that to happen, but <em>wants</em> it to happen.</p> <p>On September 29<a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-ricochet-anti-cheat-update">,</a> <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-ricochet-anti-cheat-update">Activision and the team behind <em>Call of Duty’</em>s anti-cheat tech posted a lengthy blog</a> about what they are doing to stop cheaters from ruining the game. As previously announced, this time around, <em>Call of Duty</em> players on PC will have to have Secure Boot activated on their rig to <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blackops7/beta">play <em>Black Ops 7</em> and the upcoming beta</a>. For most players, this shouldn’t be much of an issue as newer PCs running Windows 11 are likely to already have Secure Boot activated. But for other players planning to run the game on older PCs or rigs that don’t support Secure Boot, this could be a problem.</p>

 <p>We saw similar issues with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/battlefield-6-requires-secure-boot-to-run-and-its-coming-to-more-games-soon-including-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-heres-what-it-is-why-linux-gamers-are-mad-about-it-and-how-to-enable-it/"><em>Battlefield 6</em> and its open beta</a>, which also required Secure Boot. The idea is that this extra level of security can help stop some PC cheat tools, but some players have complained that it can be a pain to turn on Secure Boot if you aren’t experienced with messing around with your PC’s BIOS settings. Others claim it doesn’t do much to stop hackers and cheaters, and point to the fact that <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-cheating-cheaters-hacks-ea-dice-secureboot-pc-2000616686"><em>BF6</em>‘s beta reportedly had cheaters in it almost immediately.</a>&nbsp; Regardless, Secure Boot is needed to play <em>Black Ops 7</em> and the beta.&nbsp; And if cheaters do try to play the <em>BLOPS7</em> beta despite Secure Boot, Activision and its anti-cheat team, Team Ricochet, are waiting for them and ready to ban them forever.</p>

 <p>“Cheaters will try to test the limits during the Beta. That’s exactly what we want because #TeamRICOCHET is here, watching, learning, and removing them as they appear,” explained the team in the previously mentioned blog post. “Any account permanently banned for cheating during the Beta will be banned across all<em> Call of Duty </em>titles, from<em> Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> to future releases.”</p>

 <p>The studio further explained that all of its anti-cheat tech, which includes machine learning tools and more, will also help make Activision’s free-to-play battle royale <em>Call of Duty Warzone</em> safer from cheaters, adding: “Everything we’re building for <em>Black Ops 7</em> will also protect <em>Call of Duty: Warzone.”</em></p>

 <p>I still expect cheaters will break through Activision’s defenses and cause problems in <em>BLOPS7</em>‘s beta and the full game, which launches in November on consoles and PC. But it sounds like the folks building the game’s anti-cheat tools are not just ready for a fight, but actively encouraging it.</p> <p>The <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> beta launches on all platforms on October 2 via early access. It then opens up to everyone on October 5 and ends on October 8.</p>
