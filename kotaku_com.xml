              <p>If you’ve been looking for a premium pair of earbuds that offer impressive sound and a long-lasting battery without blowing your budget, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6565/">The latest Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 FE are currently going for just $110 at Amazon, after the retailer took a massive 27% off their usual $150 price.</a> The offer applies to both the classic black and the stunning gray color options, but there’s a catch. The discount is only around for today. It ends at midnight, which means you don’t have a lot of time left to save. Additionally, you’re also getting a two-month free trial to Audible with your purchase, which adds even more value to the deal. We highly recommend placing your orders before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6565/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Two Distinct Listening Modes</h2>
<p>This stylish pair of earbuds features a sleek blade design with newly redesigned round eartips that keep the buds securely in place. The lightweight frame makes it easy to wear them for long; perfect for never-ending commutes and extensive workout sessions. Samsung has packed these with a bigger 11mm dynamic speaker with rich bass and powerful sound that brings all your favorite music to life. You will be able to enjoy all those energy-packed tracks during the day, plus calming theme songs at night, to the fullest.</p>
<p>There are two listening modes to choose from; active noise canceling and transparency mode. The ANC mode blocks all external background distractions to deliver an immersive listening experience. It’s great for when you want to block the outside world for a bit, such as when in a coffee shop or in a packed subway. The transparency mode, on the other hand, lets external sounds in while still delivering solid audio. It’s designed to keep you aware of your surroundings.</p>
<p>Catching up with friends on the go and taking work meetings will be just as easy, thanks to the added microphone and enhanced background noise reduction. These come together to isolate your sound from all that chatter and laughter in the background, ensuring you come through clearly on the other end. Gemini support also makes it easy to communicate with the smart assistant throughout the day without pulling your phone out. Just say something like, “Hey Google, what’s the weather today?”, and you will have your answers within seconds.</p>



<p>Managing music and taking calls can be done right through the buds. A simple pinch lets you play audio, pause songs, and attend calls. Similarly, simply swiping the blade adjusts the volume. Another feature that deserves a mention is real-time translation, which converts spoken audio into your preferred language on the fly. Battery-wise, you’re looking at around 8.5 hours of listening with ANC off, and a total of 30 hours with the charging case. You can easily go a couple of days without worrying about plugging these in.</p>
<p>All things considered, the Samsung Galaxy Buds 3 FE are a great option for anyone looking to enjoy powerful sound, deep bass, stable battery life, and hands-free AI assistance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6565/">This deal brings the total down to $110, which is nothing considering all the features the pair comes packed with.</a> Additionally, you’re getting a two-month free trial to Audible, which gets you instant access to a wide range of audiobooks, podcasts, and Audible Originals.</p>
<p>Be sure to grab the discount sooner rather than later, as the deal is only going to be around for a few more hours.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Is Scrambling To Address AI Accusations Over Double-Barreled Gun]]></title>

              <p>The player backlash against generative AI in gaming <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-loses-indie-game-awards-after-being-accused-of-lying-about-ai-use-2000655119">has hit a fever pitch as we close out the year</a>, and <em>Battlefield 6</em> is the latest target of fans’ ire.<em> Kotaku</em> understands that EA is currently investigating accusations of AI slop in season 1’s recent <span dir="auto">winter cosmetics and trying to determine just exactly how the controversial technology may or may not have been used in their production.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>The accusations started over the weekend when fans circulated one of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a>‘s new stickers from the Windchill bundle, which is currently being sold for just under $10. The cosmetic shows a character aiming down the scope of a double-barreled rifle. “Two barrels on the M4A1, sure,” read one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1prq9x9/remove_this_ai_shit_from_the_store/">angry viral post</a> on the game’s subreddit. “I would literally prefer to have no sticker than some low quality AI generated garbage. You can look at <em>BO7</em> and see how many favors AI generated rewards won with them.”</p>

 <p>This led some fans to start doing an AI “vibe check” on other cosmetics in the game. While nothing as glaring as <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>‘s six-fingered <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-generative-ai-call-duty-gamescom-2025-slop-2000618833">Santa Zombie loading screen</a> has been found, it’s raised questions about how widespread the issue might be. For example, there’s an in-game sticker of a bear who appears to have more than <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ps4ze4/there_are_a_lot_of_things_that_dont_really_pass/">10 claws on its paws</a>. Is this just sloppy quality control or evidence that <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s post-launch development has been outsourcing designs to generative AI tools?</p>

   <p>An AI-generated double-barreled rifle would fun afoul of a promise made earlier this year by EA VP Rebecka Coutaz, who oversees DICE and the other teams making <em>Battlefield</em>. In an <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xrkxdkkrno">interview with the BBC</a>, she promised fans they wouldn’t see any AI-generated imagery in the final game, but admitted that the technology is used in the earlier phases of production “to allow more time and more space to be creative.”</p>

 <p>There are a couple of increasingly common ways AI slop like this might make it into a big-budget blockbuster that’s on its way to being the best-selling game of 2025. The first is that concept artists might use generative AI to create references for a design before digitally painting over those by hand. The second is that an outsourcing team EA subcontracts with ends up submitting designs for cosmetics that then slip through a rushed review process.</p>

 <p>EA has been uniquely bullish on the potential for AI to transform game development. “We view AI as a powerful accelerator of creativity, innovation, and player connection,” CEO Andrew Wilson told investors during the company’s earnings report last May. Staff across various departments, from art and QA to marketing and customer service, have been strongly encouraged to find ways to experiment with AI tools in their daily workflows. <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-ai-divide-roiling-video-game-giant-electronic-arts-2025-10"><em>Kotaku</em> reported just last month</a> that the tools were used to create an entire cover for the Deluxe Edition of <em>NHL 26</em>.</p>

 <p>But while a double-barreled rifle might be a dead giveaway that AI was involved, other errors might simply be a result of quality control going down as teams rush to flood <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s post-launch window with new content and microtransactions. According to a source familiar with the game’s production, the scope of its current roadmap has stretched resources thin when it comes to reviewing it all for any potentially embarrassing mistakes.</p> <p>EA did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
