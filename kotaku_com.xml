              <p><span>Someone at either developer Build a Rocket Boy or </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-hitman-io-interactive-roadmap-update-metacritic-2000623129"><span>publisher IO Interactive</span></a><span> hasn’t given up on </span><i><span>MindsEye</span></i><span>, because several high-profile content creators are still being sponsored to play the game following its December 2025 patch.</span></p> <p><span>As spotted by </span><a href="https://frvr.com/blog/mindseye-devs-are-still-sponsoring-streamers-following-mass-lay-offs-and-single-digit-players-on-steam/"><i><span>FRVR</span></i></a><span>, YouTube creator and Twitch streamer </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsJS-SfccUg"><span>Criken</span></a><span>, whose channel currently boasts over 1 million subscribers, recently uploaded a sponsored video of their </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>playthrough on January 14. While Twitch and YouTube are full of sponsored video game playthroughs, Criken’s video has people scratching their heads since </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>has barely peaked above 30 concurrent players on Steam since its disastrous June 2025 release.</span></p>  <p><span>Several commenters on Criken’s video were shocked to discover that the creator isn’t just playing the game as a joke. “Oh I thought you were playing this because it’s basically a meme at this point, I can’t believe they’re still sponsoring people,” wrote Didorial. “They’re still sponsoring? I’m impressed that the company wants to keep this game alive. (7 current players on steam btw),” wrote Dazcoolman.</span></p>

 <p><span>Stranger still, he’s not the only high-profile creator who seems to be getting paid to produce new videos for the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-review-bad-ps5-update-boring-open-world-pc-gta-1851785108"><span>lousy open-world shooter</span></a><span> at the moment. A quick browse through the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/mindseyepartner"><span>#MindsEyePartner</span></a><span> tag on YouTube shows that YouTubers like SweeetTails, Blue Thunder Gaming, and Willyrex (the latter of whom has over 17.2 million subscribers) have all been sponsored to play the game in the last month following its version 6.1 patch on December 18. According to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TSq8ZaG7gnY"><span>Blue Thunder Gaming</span></a><span>, the PR team that reached out with the sponsorship even agreed up front to let creators “say whatever [they] want” about the game.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000661015" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661015"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661015">YouTube / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Sponsored streams were also a part of the marketing strategy around <em>MindsEye</em>‘s original launch, but ended up </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-steam-reviews-bugs-glitches-update-refunds-1851784312"><span>resulting in viral moments</span></a><span> that only further solidified the shooter’s reputation for being boring and busted. Twitch streamer CohhCarnage was even asked to cancel his sponsored livestream of the game </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lre7iutssk22"><span>mere minutes after</span></a><span> he’d just told his viewers it was about to begin.</span></p>

 <p><span>This all leads to the inevitable question: why? To be frank, I don’t have an answer for you, as the sponsored videos and streams don’t seem to have made much difference to the player numbers on Steam. Maybe things are going better on console. Admittedly, the game does look to be in a better state now than it was at launch, but I think the damage has already been done. A </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span> turnaround story this is not. At least for now. </span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals Promises A Crackdown On The Recent Epidemic Of ‘Lord Farming’]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Season 6 of </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span> launched last week, finally introducing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-marvel-rivals-role-fourth-wall-break-meta-2000659834"><span>Deadpool</span></a><span> to the hero roster, as well as a new battle pass and various gameplay tweaks. Part of the update includes a major reworking of the hero proficiency system, a way for players to earn cosmetic rewards for characters. The revamp added new rewards for players to earn but unintentionally promoted a new epidemic of “lord farming” in the process.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The updated system changes how players earn proficiency. Rather than a tiered system in which players earn proficiency through universal and hero-specific challenges, there is now a linear system that players progress through solely via universal challenges, so each hero progresses identically regardless of role. There are now 70 levels for players to progress through, with rewards across various milestones. Players now also earn more proficiency per minute spent playing. You can find a full breakdown of the changes </span><a href="https://www.boostingfactory.com/marvel-rivals/blog/new-marvel-rivals-hero-proficiency-system-explained"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>The overhaul has led to a spike in players farming for cosmetics by staying in spawn and spamming abilities in order to quickly progress through the updated system. Players who engage in this behavior are </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1qgze5x/marvel_rivals_starting_to_take_action_against_afk/"><span>sometimes referred to as</span></a><span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1qgze5x/marvel_rivals_starting_to_take_action_against_afk/"> lord farmers</a>, who create deeply unbalanced matches by essentially being AFK the whole time.</span></p> <p><span>The phenomenon calls to mind </span><i><span>Civilization </span></i><span>designer Soren Johnson’s </span><a href="https://www.designer-notes.com/game-developer-column-17-water-finds-a-crack/"><span>2011 blog post</span></a><span>, in which he writes, “Many players cannot help approaching a game as an optimization puzzle. What gives the most reward for the least risk? What strategy provides the highest chance—or even a guaranteed chance—of success? Given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of a game.”</span></p>

 <h2>A new behavior detection system is on the way</h2> <p><span>Fortunately, NetEase is aware of the behavior and already working to address it. “Recently, we’ve noticed that some players are exploiting matches by remaining stationary and repeatedly farming stats to gain hero proficiency points. This behavior disrupts normal gameplay and seriously affects the match experience of other players,” the </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span> team </span><a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/2013176993383133552"><span>wrote on X</span></a><span> on January 19. “To address this, we are planning to introduce a combat behavior detection system. Players found engaging in such behavior may face penalties including, but not limited to: warnings, short-term suspensions, long-term suspensions, or permanent account bans.”</span></p>

 <p><span>NetEase has not yet stated when the countermeasure will go live, or if any efforts will be made to prevent lord farmers from creating new accounts in the free-to-play game once the old ones are banned. In the meantime, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJsn3W26ghM"><span>some vigilante players are messing with lord farmers</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>While a combat behavior detection system will hopefully help deter lord farming going forward, it doesn’t address the fundamental game design decisions that are encouraging the behavior in the first place. Only time will tell if the hero proficiency system receives additional reworking.</span></p>
