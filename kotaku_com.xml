              <p>Amazon is making it easier than ever to grab a new laptop without breaking the bank. We’re spotting plenty of amazing deals on a wide range of machines from popular brands like HP, Dell, Asus, Lenovo, and even Apple – basically, there’s something for everyone.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6521/">One of our favorite discounts, however, is this 70% drop on the 15.6-inch HP touchscreen laptop, which brings the overall price down to just $650, but that’s not all.</a> You’re also getting a 6-in-1 accessory bundle worth almost $200 with your purchase for free, which adds even more value to the offer. This deal applies to the stunning moonlight blue version, which gives off a premium, sleek look. Just note that the discount wraps up soon, so it’s best to grab it before the price shoots back up to $2,200.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6521/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Power</h2>
<p>You’re greeted with a stunning 15.6-inch Full HD display upon opening the laptop. The screen features an ultra-thin 6.5 mm micro-edge bezel for a bigger viewing area, while the anti-glare coating keeps the visuals easy on your eyes. Touch support takes this a bit further by making navigation a breeze. You won’t have to rely on the trackpad or the mouse solely to get things done. Need to scroll a long document? Just use your fingers directly on the screen. The included touchscreen pen also makes it quite easy to swipe, draw, sketch, and even type!</p>
<p>The screen is paired with a full-sized keyboard, alongside a dedicated numeric keypad, which is quite comfortable to use. It provides your wrist with the support it needs for jotting down long documents, plus includes a dedicated Copilot key that launches the helpful AI assistant instantly. There’s also a built-in webcam, with integrated microphones for convenient video calls.</p>



<p>Power comes from the combination of an Intel Core i3-N305 processor and a modest 16GB RAM. Together, these let you push through busy, productive days with ease, regardless of the task at hand. The 1TB SSD, on the other hand, offers ample space to store all your important documents and files in a single place, without feeling limited.</p>
<p>Battery life is another strong selling point. A single charge offers over 9 hours of use, which means you can go an entire workday without worrying about running out of power. Recharging is fast too, so you won’t have to stay tethered to an outlet for long when running low. And finally, the free accessory bundle includes a touchscreen pen, a 128GB thumb drive, a laptop bag, a cleaning cloth, a camera protector, dust plugs, and Windows 11 Pro pre-installed. That’s everything you need to get started with work and entertainment, right away, and you’re basically getting far more than just a direct discount with this deal.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6521/">This laptop is currently down to just $650 at Amazon, which is practically nothing for a device this packed.</a> This is the lowest we have seen it drop to in a long while, but the offer won’t be around for long. Grab it while there’s still time, as it could wrap up any moment now. Once it’s gone, we don’t expect it to be back at this price anytime soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A quality Bluetooth speaker is a must-have for pretty much everyone. Whether you’re spending time with friends at the park or tackling household chores, a portable speaker can completely set the mood. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6243/">The JBL Clip 5 is the ideal companion for any situation where you’d want to reach for a Bluetooth speaker, and right now, you can grab it at a 25% discount on Amazon.</a> Originally priced at $80, the JBL Clip 5 is now available for just $60. With powerful sound, a durable design, and a range of stylish color options, it’s a high-quality option for music lovers on the move.</p>
<p>The JBL Clip 5 delivers powerful, clear sound with deep bass, no matter where you take it. Whether you’re at the beach, by the pool, or on a hike, this portable speaker ensures your music stays crisp and vibrant. It’s built with an IP67 rating, meaning it is both waterproof and dustproof. So whether you’re caught in a rainstorm or accidentally drop it in the sand, the JBL Clip 5 is made to withstand the elements. The rugged exterior combines durable fabric with rubber, ensuring the speaker can handle the outdoors and a bit of rough treatment.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6243/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Portability at Its Finest</h2>
<p>The “Clip” in JBL Clip 5 isn’t just a name. The whole design is built around it. The speaker includes an integrated carabiner clip. While the speaker itself is compact and easy to carry, the clip allows you to securely attach it to your bag or belt loop. Once you’re at your destination, the clip can be used to fasten it to your beach chair or whatever else, making sure your music is always within reach and ready to go.</p>
<p>A portable speaker isn’t much good if the battery runs out halfway through a playlist. Fortunately, the JBL Clip 5 offers impressive battery life, delivering up to 12 hours of playtime on a single charge. And if you need a little extra time, you can activate the Playtime Boost feature, which prioritizes power and gives you up to three additional hours of listening time—bringing the total playtime to 15 hours. With this extended battery life, the JBL Clip 5 is equipped to last through a full day of adventure or relaxation alike.</p>



<p>JBL speakers are known for their stylish and vibrant designs, and the JBL Clip 5 continues that tradition. Beyond just the classic color options like black and white, the JBL Clip 5 offers a variety of fun and bold choices. You can opt for a sleek black-and-orange combination or choose a playful pink-and-blue, sand-and-green, or solid blue, purple, or red color schemes. For those who prefer something a bit edgier, there’s even a camouflage “squad” pattern. Just make sure not to set it down in the grass. You’ll never find it again.</p>
<p>As a JBL speaker, the JBL Clip 5 is equipped with Auracast. This lets you pair two or more Auracast-enabled speakers together, synchronized to the same audio, to create even bigger sound. It’s great for having a party, and making sure the same music is playing throughout different rooms of the house or both inside and outside in the backyard.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Nintendo Switch 2 Just Got Another Last-Minute Discount]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-just-got-another-last-minute-discount-2000654829</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re in the market for <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-better-tech-enshitification-google-review-1851784417">a Nintendo Switch 2</a> and live close to a Microcenter, you’re in luck. The PC store chain currently has the console marked down to just $400 in a surprise last-minute discount for the most popular new gaming hardware of the year.</p> <p>Microcenter is <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/695288/nintendo-switch-2-console">currently advertising</a> the console at $50 off it’s regular sticker price. Not bad for the Switch 2’s first holiday. The catch is that you have to actually go to Microcenter to get it, however. There’s no shipping, so you either need to live close or drive far. The store closest to me says it has 25 unit in stock as of this writing, though it’s not clear how long the discount will be in effect.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nintendo Switch 2 is $399.99 at Micro Center (in-stores) <a href="https://t.co/Jw6BrF6Ufj">https://t.co/Jw6BrF6Ufj</a> <a href="https://t.co/SpmMKtmVIx">pic.twitter.com/SpmMKtmVIx</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/2001655303683678709?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s worth noting that this is only for the standalone console, not the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle. If you were planning on also buying that game, which costs an additional $80, you’d basically only be saving $20 off the normal bundle price. Still something, but not as good as the <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle discounted to $450 that <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sale-cyber-monday-mario-kart-world-walmart-amazon-2000649232">Walmart and some other stores</a> were selling earlier this month.</p> <p>Any savings on a new console, especially one that’s sold as well as the Switch 2 in its first year, comes as a nice surprise. It’s also been an unexpectedly tough holiday season for new console sales. Circana recently reported that only <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-sales-inflation-economy-2000654196">1.6 million units were sold in November</a> across Switch 2, Switch 1, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S, making it the worst pre-holiday sales month for gaming hardware since 1995. That’s because even with Black Friday discounts, the average cost of a new console keeps going up.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ASUS Clears Out Gaming Laptops After GPU Deals, Offloading the TUF Gaming F16 (2024) Ahead of Christmas]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-clears-out-gaming-laptops-after-gpu-deals-offloading-the-tuf-gaming-f16-2024-ahead-of-christmas-2000654695</link>
            <guid>1388188</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Handheld gaming PCs have been enjoying a surge in popularity over the last few years. The Steam Deck was the device that truly opened the floodgates, proving that a near-full PC gaming experience could be packed into a portable form. Not long after, other handhelds like the Lenovo Legion Go and the Asus ROG Ally started popping up, giving players even more options. These systems are undeniably convenient and surprisingly powerful for their size, and there’s a certain appeal to curling up on the couch and launching full PC titles without dragging out a bulky laptop.</p>
<p>That said, handheld gaming PCs still come with a fairly narrow focus. They’re designed for gaming, and can’t do anything else. If you need a machine that can handle your workload, web browsing, content consumption, and gaming all in one package, a traditional gaming laptop remains the more practical choice. At the moment, Amazon is offering a particularly strong deal on the Asus TUF F16, making it worth serious consideration. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6520/">Normally priced around $1,000, the 2024 laptop is currently discounted to $800, representing a substantial $200 price cut.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6520/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This configuration of the TUF F16 is powered by an Intel Core 5 210H processor paired with an NVIDIA GeForce 4050 laptop GPU and 8GB of RAM. If you want something a bit better than that, the 2025 model is also on sale. That one comes with and Intel Core i5 13450HX processor and the NVIDIA GeForce 5050 laptop GPU with16GB of RAM. This one is $300 off, bringing the price down from $1,300 to just an even $1,000. Either comes with a 512GB SSD to for all your storage needs.</p>
<h2>Gaming Performance</h2>
<p>While the Asus TUF Gaming F16 is not a top-tier powerhouse built to max out every new AAA release, it offers very respectable performance for the price. Indie titles will run effortlessly, and many larger games should perform smoothly at medium settings without major compromises.</p>



<p>The Asus TUF F16 features a 16-inch display with a taller 16:10 aspect ratio. It runs at Full HD resolution and supports a smooth 144Hz refresh rate, making it well suited for fast-paced games and competitive play. Adaptive-Sync technology works to reduce screen tearing and stuttering for a more fluid experience. Slim bezels surround the display, giving you more usable screen real estate without making the laptop feel overly large or cumbersome.</p>
<p>In terms of design, Asus keeps things relatively understated. The keyboard is full-size and includes a dedicated number pad, something that has become less common on modern laptops. The gold-accented WASD keys add a touch of personality without pushing the system into flashy, over-the-top territory.</p>
<p>When it comes to battery life, the Asus TUF F16 holds its own. The 90Wh battery supports fast charging, allowing it to reach 50% capacity in roughly 30 minutes. There’s also a 100W USB-C port for charging phones or accessories.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6520/">Overall, at just $800, the Asus TUF F16 delivers strong value. It’s a capable gaming hub that can easily handle your basic, everyday laptop needs.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Need an additional Xbox controller? It’s always a good idea to have an extra in case you want to play with a friend or have one on reserve if you run out of battery. We’ve found one that you can grab right now for a great price, this close to the holidays.</p>
<p>The Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Wireless Gaming Controller is built for players who want more control, comfort, and customization from their gaming sessions. It feels great in your hands, with textured grips and a balanced design that helps you stay comfortable even during long play sessions. No matter what kind of games you like to play, you’ll find this model comfortable and easy to get used to.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6519/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A hardcore Xbox controller that’ll soon become your main</h2>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6519/">You can get the Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Wireless Gaming Controller right now for just $110, down from its usual price of $150.</a> That is a discount of $40 and 27% off. This is a top of the line controller for the Xbox, so you’re getting a pretty decent price here, considering you’ll usually pay nearly $50 more.</p>
<p>Right out of the box the Elite Series 2 Core feels like an upgrade from a standard controller. The thumbsticks are responsive, the buttons click with just the right amount of feedback, and the overall feel is one of quality. It connects wirelessly to your Xbox or Windows PC, so you can enjoy gaming without cords getting in your way. The Bluetooth support also means you can pair it with other compatible devices for more flexibility.</p>



<p>One of the biggest benefits of this controller is how customizable it is. You can change stick sensitivity, remap buttons, and fine tune settings to match your personal play style. Normally, core Xbox controllers aren’t so easy or versatile when it comes to personalization, so you get a lot more options here to work with. That’s especially useful if you like to change things for shooters or even fighting games to better fit the way you play.</p>
<p>The Elite Series 2 Core also includes additional components you can swap in and out. Different thumbsticks and paddle options let you tweak the feel and response of the controller, so you can tailor it to different genres.</p>
<p>With a solid mix of premium build quality, customization options, and wireless convenience, the Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Wireless Gaming Controller stands out among controllers in its class. For this price, you should go ahead and snatch one up before they raise in price again. Everything gaming-related seems to be getting a price hike, after all.</p>

              <p>Happy holidays and Merry Christmas. This is the time of the year when radio stations start playing holiday-themed music nonstop and commercials are filled with festive tunes. But not all Christmas music is good. In fact, I’d say at least 80 percent of holiday jingles are old, boring, and terrible.</p> <p>However, I won’t toss all Christmas music under the bus; some holiday tunes have a way of making you feel the warmth and merriment of the season. With that in mind, here are the 15 best tracks to play this year if you want to get into the festive spirit but don’t want to listen to boring old crap. Christmastime is a fun time of year, when people should be feeling good and enjoying time off and the company of loved ones. Or at least getting cool presents. Why ruin that with some slow, sad song from the 1930s?</p>

 <p>So here are some good, fun tracks that range from newer hits to oldies that won’t make you fall asleep. And if you work in retail, I am so sorry that you have to spend, like, five weeks listening to all of these and more over and over again, and you all deserve huge bonuses for that torture.</p> <p>Oh and let us know what your favorite Christmas songs are in the comments below. I’ll be waiting for someone to share <em>Grandma Got Ran Over by a Reindeer.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>Father Christmas – The Kinks</h2>  <h2>Santa Claus Is Comin’ To Town – Bruce Springsteen</h2>  <h2>Linus And Lucy – Vince Guaraldi</h2>  <h2>Last Christmas – Wham!</h2>  <h2>Run, Rudolph, Run! – Chuck Berry</h2>  <h2>Feliz Navidad – José Feliciano</h2>  <h2>All I Want For Christmas Is You – Mariah Carey</h2>  <h2>Christmas Wrapping – The Waitresses</h2>  <h2>Christmas (Baby Please Come Home!) – Darlene Love</h2>  <h2>You’re a Mean One, Mr. Grinch&nbsp;– Thurl Ravenscroft</h2>  <h2>Holly Jolly Christmas – Burl Ives</h2>  <h2>Santa Baby – Eartha Kitt</h2>  <h2>Rockin’ Around The Christmas Tree – Brenda Lee</h2>  <h2>Underneath The Tree – Kelly Clarkson</h2>  <h2>I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus – The Jackson 5</h2>
