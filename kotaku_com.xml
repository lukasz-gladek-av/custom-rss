Today we were treated to another lovely look at some games coming to both the original Switch and the fancy new Switch 2. Nintendo’s latest Direct went all in on third-party titles, so alas, no <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>. But there were still a ton of cool-looking titles, many of which feature co-op, so you’ll be well equipped to get some GameShare going on. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195719" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="195719,195755,196578" data-current="195719"><div><p>Tears Of The Kingdom's Newspaper Questline And The State Of Hyrulean Journalism</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195719/195719_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21229.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Let’s get to it!</p><hr><h2 id="h2325"><a id=""></a><em>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</em></h2><p>Today’s showcase opened up with a nice look at Capcom’s upcoming fantasy adventure, <em>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</em>. And yes, there are monsters, in case you were worried about that. In fact, that egg at the end may have had <em>two</em> beasties.</p><p>It’s expected to arrive next year on Switch 2.</p><hr><h2 id="h2326"><a id=""></a><em>Once Upon A Katamari</em></h2><p>You know you’ve been waiting for this. One of the weirdest game franchises ever returns, promising more trash collection by rolling around. This time around you can also team up with a friend to engage in the ultimate kleptomania sim.</p><p>The game arrives on the original Switch on October 24, 2025.</p><hr><h2 id="h2327"><a id=""></a><em>Just Dance 2026 Edition</em></h2><p>This game will never not look weird to me. But hey, dancing is a ton of fun. <em>Just Dance</em> showed off its upcoming co-op and party mode too, so you won’t have to tear up the carpet on your own.</p><p>The game arrives on Switch on October 14, 2025.</p><hr><h2 id="h2328"><a id=""></a><em>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero</em></h2><p>Oh hell yeah. <em>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero </em>is a blast, letting you play out some of the most legendary battles, and even some that have never happened before. It’s arriving on Nintendo Switch where you can also use JoyCon to actually act out some of these classic moves.</p><p><em>Sparking Zero</em> arrives on Switch 2 on November 14, 2025.</p><hr><h2 id="h2329"><a id=""></a><em>Plants VS. Zombies Replanted</em></h2><p><em>Plants Vs. Zombies</em>, the smash hit mobile game that had people everywhere glued to their phones back in 2008, is back, arriving with local co-op and PVP on October 23, 2025 for Switch and Switch 2.</p><hr><h2 id="h2330"><a id=""></a><em>EA Sports FC 26</em></h2><p>How about some sports? <em>FC26</em> is arriving on Switch and Swtich 2 this year, September 26, 2025.</p><hr><h2 id="h2331"><a id=""></a><em>Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac</em></h2><p><em>Pac-Man World 2</em> is getting a nice-looking remake. Like so many other games at this event, you can also play this one with a friend via co-op.</p><hr><h2 id="h2332"><a id=""></a><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em></h2><p>No it’s not the enormous AAA fancy graphical remake that you might’ve been hoping for, but <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>,  the cult classic from the ‘90s, returns on Switch and Switch 2 on September 30, 2025.</p><hr><h2 id="h2333"><a id=""></a><em>Persona 3 Reload</em></h2><p>High school’s a weird time, even without all the strange shadow monsters. But if you fancy returning to that time and saving the world while you’re at it, then <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> on Switch 2 might just be what you’re longing for. The game arrives on October 23, 2025.</p><hr><h2 id="h2334"><a id=""></a><em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em></h2><p>Oh how we love seeing some Hyrulian action. Today we got a nice look at <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em>, which looks set to tell an ambitiously epic tale of war and struggle. Also, what was that little thing at the end, hmm??</p><p>This is likely to be an essential chapter leading up to 2023's fantastic <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. </p><hr><h2 id="h2335"><a id=""></a><em>Madden 2026</em></h2><p>Sports! Balls! Teams! Concussions? Well not here, since it’s a video game.

I don’t do it nearly enough. Good thing <em>Chilling by the Fire </em>is here to let me do it whenever I want. Having built a few fires myself in the wild, this game looks surprisingly authentic, so hey, maybe you’ll learn a life-saving skill while you’re at it.</p><p>There’s also co-op. And no bugs, thank god. The game arrives today.</p><hr><h2 id="h2337"><a id=""></a><em>Apex Legends</em></h2><p>The hit battle royale FPS is coming to Switch 2. It will never be the <em>Titanfall 3</em> we all deserve, but damn if it isn’t a good time. The game arrives on August 5, 2025, just in time for its new season.</p><hr><h2 id="h2338"><a id=""></a><em>Hela</em></h2><p>OMG! Cute little mouse with a frog backpack? I can’t even, ya’ll.

It arrives on 2026, but I really need to try this out like now.</p><hr><h2 id="h2339"><a id=""></a><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></h2><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> arrives on Switch 2, which is pretty awesome. It’s also going to be a nice test of the Switch 2's horsepower. Can it handle this galaxy far, far away? We will find out on September 4, 2025.</p><hr><h2 id="h2340"><a id=""></a><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em></h2><p>Looking for a grim-looking survival horror experience that kinda sorta screams <em>Dead Space </em>but with time travel? <em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> might just scracth that itch on September 5, 2025.</p><hr><h2 id="h2341"><a id=""></a><em>Yakuza Kiwami II</em></h2><p>More <em>Yakuza</em> is always better.

That includes single-player story campaigns, online battles, and the scenario creator mode where fans cook up their own wild battles for one another to play. I’m still curious to see how it runs on the hardware considering some of the framerate and graphical issues that exist even on PS5 and Xbox Series X. </p><p>While <em>Sparking Zero</em> was one of last year’s bestselling games, fan energy around the game has cooled in recent months <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1k1cb7c/if_this_is_the_real_dlc_then_i_really_dont_see/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1k1cb7c/if_this_is_the_real_dlc_then_i_really_dont_see/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as they wait on delayed DLC</a></span> and grapple with the ongoing shortcomings in the base game, including a somewhat shallow and frustrating branching episode battle mode. Plus, despite the gargantuan roster, there are still plenty of fan favorite characters and transformations that haven’t yet made it into<em> Sparking Zero</em>, if they ever will.</p><p>Even so, it’ll be nice to finally have the game on Nintendo’s handheld hybrid system and, perhaps even more importantly, a fresh influx of new and non-jaded players into the online battle mode. A lack of balance has led ranked play to stagnate, but having more players in casual quick matches who just want to have fun and mess around with all of <em>Sparking Zero</em>’s myriad matchups will be great. Even better would be seeing the game get some features unique to Switch 2, like local wireless GameShare with other nearby Switches. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-switch-2-release-date-trailer-1851787412]]></content:encoded>
