              <p>Many people don’t need the latest MacBook Pro with its $4,000 sticker shock but they also can’t do real work on a $300 Chromebook that chokes on anything beyond web browsing. The middle ground does exist, and HP has hit it out of the park with<strong> this 17-inch laptop that offers real productivity features without the premium price</strong>.</p>
<p>The brand appears to be clearing inventory and rather than advertising these savings on their own site, they’re unloading units under the radar on Amazon at historically low prices. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4476/">HP 17″ laptop (Intel Core i3, 32GB RAM, 1TB SSD, Windows 11 Pro) has been chopped from $2,399 down to $699, a 71 percent discount</a> that puts professional-grade computing in the budget of students and remote workers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4476/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The 17.3-Inch Display Changes Your Workflow</h2>
<p>This is driven by the <strong>Intel Core i3-N305 8-core processor up to 3.2GHz</strong> and Intel UHD Graphics. This configuration handles everyday multitasking, web surfing, document editing and media playback without frustration or lag. The i3-N305 is Intel’s energy-efficient hybrid architecture designed for laptops that balances performance and battery life by dynamically shifting workloads between the performance and efficiency cores based on what you’re doing. You won’t be rendering 4K video or playing AAA games on max settings, but for office work and streaming entertainment, this processor delivers smooth performance.</p>



<p>Screen size matters more than many people realize until they’ve actually worked on a larger display: The <strong>17.3-inch HD+ screen gives you much more workspace than standard 15.6-inch laptops</strong>, reducing the constant window juggling and tab switching that breaks your concentration. The 1600×900 resolution packs approximately 1.4 million pixels and delivers crisp text rendering and sharp graphics for documents and videos. The anti-glare coating reduces reflections from overhead lighting and windows.</p>
<p>The 32GB of RAM changes how you work by eliminating the performance limitations of heavy multitasking. You can have dozens of browser tabs open, several <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/microsoft-365">Microsoft 365 applications</a> open simultaneously, be in video calls as you work on presentations and still have apps running in the background without noticing the slowdowns.</p>
<p>The <strong>1TB PCIe NVMe SSD provides fast and spacious storage</strong> with Windows boot times in seconds and instant app opening. PCIe NVMe technology provides read and write speeds up to 15 times faster than traditional mechanical hard drives, which transfer files quickly and make opening large documents instant.</p>
<p>At $699, you’re getting a genuinely capable laptop that performs real work without compromise.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">unpopular Game Pass price hikes</a> have caught the attention of Lina Khan. The former head of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) took to social media on Friday to once again criticize the company’s acquisition of <em>Call of Duty</em> maker Activision Blizzard. “As dominant firms become too-big-to-care, they can make things worse for their customers without having to worry about the consequences,” she wrote just a day after the price of Game Pass Ultimate rose to $30 a month.</p> <p>It was Khan’s FTC during the Biden Administration <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-ftc-deal-court-call-duty-xbox-ps5-1850623628">that sued Microsoft to prevent the $70 billion Activision Blizzard deal</a> from going through. The regulator argued that further market consolidation in gaming would harm consumers, and ended up taking the matter to court. A judge ultimately ruled in favor of Microsoft, but that hasn’t stopped Khan and others from criticizing the outcome in the years since.</p>

 <p>“Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision has been followed by significant price hikes and layoffs, harming both gamers and developers,” she posted on X today alongside a chart showing Game Pass prices doubling since the trial concluded. “As we’ve seen across sectors, increasing market consolidation and increasing prices often go hand-in-hand.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision has been followed by significant price hikes and layoffs, harming both gamers and developers. </p> <p>As we’ve seen across sectors, increasing market consolidation and increasing prices often go hand-in-hand. </p> <p>As dominant firms become… <a href="https://t.co/FoI50tlEsL">https://t.co/FoI50tlEsL</a></p> <p>— Lina Khan (@linamkhan) <a href="https://twitter.com/linamkhan/status/1974192096841265511?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>A similar point was made <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-ftc-black-ops-6-appeal-1851599323">when Microsoft raised prices last year</a>. “Microsoft’s price increases and product degradation—combined with Microsoft’s reduced investments in output and product quality via employee layoffs, see FTC’s February 7, 2024, Letter—are the hallmarks of a firm exercising market power post-merger,”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24852374-24-07-18-ftc-letter-re-microsoft-game-pass-price-increases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the FTC wrote</a> last July when it was still appealing the merger.”</p>

 <h2>Microsoft promised regulators Game Pass prices wouldn’t go up</h2> <p>Khan isn’t the only one going “I told you so” this week. Shortly after the latest Game Pass price hikes were announced, players started circulating the company’s old quotes back during the Activision merger fight. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority also tried to block the deal over pricing concerns.</p>

 <p>“Game Pass prices will not increase as a result of the Merger, and certainly will not increase to a point that offsets the substantial benefits of Activision titles coming to Game Pass on a day and date basis,” the company <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/microsoft-insists-game-pass-prices-will-not-increase-as-a-result-of-activision-merger/">claimed back in 2023</a>. “This is especially so given Game Pass will continue to be constrained by B2P [buy to play].”</p>

 <p>In the years since, Microsoft appears to have done exactly that, <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-game-pass-call-duty-points-discount-changes-2000631483">adding <em>Call of Duty</em> to Game Pass</a> but jacking up the price as well, even though players can still choose to buy the game à la carte for $70 on console and PC.</p> <p>Microsoft might argue that $30 a month is a fair price to pay for subscription-based access to <em>Black Ops 7</em> and hundreds of other games. It’s impossible to know without access to rest of the Xbox math, most of which Microsoft stopped reporting to the public years ago. All we know is that according to Microsoft, Game Pass was profitable and generating $5 billion in revenue a year, even before the latest price hikes.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[5 Things To Know Before Starting Digimon Story: Time Stranger]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-tips-guides-side-quests-2000631593</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/5-things-to-know-before-starting-digimon-story-time-stranger.1316152/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>In most ways, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-the-kotaku-review-2000630341"><i><span>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</span></i></a> <span>isn’t a complicated RPG. The turn-based monster tamer’s battles are mostly straightforward, and it’s got waypoints telling you where to go for most missions. However, after spending 40 hours in the game, I do have a few quick tips for those of you heading to the Digital World now that the game is out. Grab your Digivice and let’s go.</span></p> <h2><b>You will lose access to side quests for dozens of hours</b></h2> <p><span>Easily the most frustrating thing I encountered in my first playthrough of </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>was the way it gates side quests. Without getting into spoilers, there’s a point when the game will warn you that some of the side quests you’ve been doing will be inaccessible for an undetermined amount of time. Years of playing video games had me expecting this meant I wouldn’t be able to complete those quests until I finished the story mission I was about to embark on. As it turns out, it would be dozens of hours before I could go back to those quests. This would normally have been fine, but side quests have a lot more to offer in </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>than just a side story and some loot. Throughout the game, you’ll get Anomaly Points that raise your Agent rank. Digivolution levels are gated behind leveling up this rank, and if you can’t complete more quests, you might be stuck at a lower rank and unable to level up your party until much, </span><i><span>much </span></i><span>later in the game. So heed this warning when you hit it, because it really fails to adequately warn you just how long it will be before you can go back to those missions.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Using items doesn’t cost you a turn</b></h2> <p><span>One of the merciful things </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>does is that it allows you to use an item </span><i><span>and </span></i><span>attack each turn, rather than choosing between them. This means you’ll be able to heal up your team, raise stats, or remove a status effect without having to give up doing some damage as well. A lot of other turn-based RPGs tend to make you choose between these options as a strategic challenge, but you’ll be glad </span><i><span>Time Stranger</span></i><span> doesn’t when you endure one of its long, drawn-out boss fights.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Upgrading your Agent rank helps circumvent grind</b></h2> <p><span>Those Anomaly points you get for completing quests are used to upgrade your Agent rank, which enables you to unlock Agent skills on a skill tree. Some of these perks are universal, such as giving you access to new high-impact Cross Arts abilities that can benefit your whole team. However, some of them are applied only to certain Digimon with different personality types. If you go down one skill tree, you’ll be able to raise stats and experience for the friendly Digimon in your team, while another path will grant you those perks for brave Digimon. So don’t just go down these skill trees without some plan in place, as they can help you reach powerful new heights if you target specific traits and personality types. It’s much simpler than grinding random battles.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Don’t get precious about saving your Cross Art</b></h2> <p><span>Cross Arts abilities can have a wide variety of uses in battles. They can heal your team, raise their stats, or they can take a chunk of your enemy’s health bar down and leave them with debuffs for a few turns. Since they can be so impactful, you might feel like you need to hold your Cross Art for a big boss fight, but this ability charges up fast when you do pretty much anything in battle. Attacking an enemy or using an item can give you points toward your Cross Arts gauge, so it’s pretty easy to fire off multiple uses of this in a longer fight. Feel free to use it often, and keep in mind that the more actions you can do in a turn, the more charge you’ll get toward using it again.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Try to have a rideable Digimon on your team at all times</b></h2> <p><span>Some Digimon can double as both a party member and a rideable mount. I rode my Growlmon for much of the game, but when he digivolved to WarGrowlmon, he couldn’t carry me on his shoulders anymore. Thankfully, WereGarurumon stepped up and put me on his shoulder, and later, when he became MetalGarurumon, I was able to ride on his back. Riding your Digimon gets you places faster than walking on foot, but as they transform into new, stronger versions of themselves, they might lose the ability to carry you around. Just be mindful of this as you move throughout the evolution tree.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Kingmakers</em> was due out in Early Access in just a few days but it’s apparently not ready yet. The medieval sandbox shooter has been indefinitely delayed as the team at Redemption Road works on getting everything working as intended. “We just need a bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it,” the studio wrote in an announcement on Friday.</p> <p>Odds are you’ve seen a <a href="https://kotaku.com/this-time-hopping-action-game-brings-a-grenade-launcher-1851274937">bit of <em>Kingmakers</em> here or there</a> over the years, even if you didn’t know it. The multiplayer game features sprawling maps and giant armies and is supposed to facilitate real-time destruction as you engage in everything from medieval combat to blowing up a bunch of armor-clad knights with tanks. The game’s impressive physics simulation helped it go viral on social media, land a big trailer at Summer Game Fest this year, and become the sixth most-wishlisted game on Steam. So it’s surprising to see it pulled from launch at the last minute.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/HhiDBLQrOS">pic.twitter.com/HhiDBLQrOS</a></p> <p>— Ian Fisch – Lead Coder on Kingmakers (wishlist!) (@Ian_Fisch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ian_Fisch/status/1974143748419563537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“After much contemplation, we realize that the scheduled<em> Kingmakers</em> launch on October 8 will no longer be possible,” the team <a href="https://x.com/Ian_Fisch/status/1974143748419563537">announced today</a>. “We want to apologize to all of the fans who are eagerly anticipating this game. We are sorry for letting you down.”</p>

 <p>The rest of the message goes on to try to explain why the game is being indefinitely delayed. TL;DR:<em> Kingmakers</em> is ambitions and delivering on that is hard!</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">GTA6, but you're dropped in the 1400s.<br>No cops. Just the angry knights you ran over 🚗 <a href="https://t.co/tLmQjUgmM3">pic.twitter.com/tLmQjUgmM3</a></p> <p>— Kingmakers ⚔️ (@Kingmakers_Game) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kingmakers_Game/status/1929956825589584144?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“We currently have tens of thousands of soldiers, each with AI and pathfinding that rivals what you’d expect from an AAA third-person shooter,” Redemption Road states. “When you walk away from a battle, it continues to play out. Nothing is faked. We have giant 6-story castles where every room can be entered and every wall, floor, and ceiling destroyed. When you build a lumbermill, it’s a real place that can be entered, or, in an enemy invasion, turned into a combat arena.”</p> <p>The studio doesn’t really go into much more detail than that but promises that a deep-dive overview will be livestreamed soon to update players on where things are at. That makes it sound like the delay won’t just be a couple of weeks or months. Will it still be out before the end of 2026? We’ll see. “We’re making sure everyone who buys the game is enthralled and feels like their money was well spent,” the developers wrote.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-life-showgirl-reaction-reviews-songs-wood-2000631553</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-internet-reacts-to-taylor-swift%E2%80%99s-new-album.1316077/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Every time Taylor Swift, the country star turned pop royalty, releases a new album, it’s a cultural event, whether you’re a Swiftie or not. This is because the algorithm will no doubt feed you reactions and commentary just because you are, at most, one degree removed from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-shakes-her-polys-in-band-hero-5329622"><i><span>Band Hero</span></i></a> <span>star’s fandom at all times. </span><i><span>The Life of a Showgirl </span></i><span>is Swift’s 12th album, and turns the dial back into radio/TikTok-ready pop after </span><i><span>The Tortured Poets Department </span></i><span>went for a more melancholic, folky sound. But is it any good? Well, Swifties are sorting through their feelings.</span></p> <p><span>Like most of Swift’s work, </span><i><span>The Life of a Showgirl</span></i><span> is pretty transparent in its references to her personal life. As that personal life has become so </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-life-of-a-showgirl-announcement-cover-date-2000617177"><span>well-known in and out of her music</span></a><span>, it’s usually pretty obvious who a song is about. So there’s some lore to unpack with a lot of these songs, but the ones that are getting the most attention right now are the ones that seem to reference her </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-engaged-ring-reaction-2000620394"><span>fiancé Travis Kelce’s hog</span></a><span> and seem to escalate an apparent feud between her and pop star Charli XCX that, at least publicly, appears largely one-sided at the moment.</span></p> <p><span>Let’s start with the song that is all about how well-endowed the Kansas City football player is. “Wood” starts out with a funky riff and a catchy beat, and you can already hear the Sabrina Carpenter influence in the composition. Then you hear the lyrics and you can tell that Swift is trying to emulate the </span><i><span>Short n’ Sweet </span></i><span>singer’s trademark graphic, sexual punchlines. Here, let’s look at the lyrics of the second verse.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>Forgive me, it sounds cocky</span></p> <p><span>He ah-matized me and openеd my eyes</span></p> <p><span>Redwood tree, it ain’t hard to see</span></p> <p><span>His lovе was the key that opened my thighs</span></p> <p><span>Girls, I don’t need to catch the bouquet, mm</span></p> <p><span>To know a hard rock is on the way</span></p> <p><span>And baby, I’ll admit I’ve been a little superstitious</span></p> <p><span>The curse on me was broken by your magic wand</span></p> <p><span>Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck</span></p> <p><span>New Heights of manhood</span></p></blockquote>   <p><span>If the clear reference to Kelce’s </span><i><span>New Heights </span></i><span>podcast wasn’t enough to make it clear that this is about her man’s schlong, the reference to a “hard rock” like the one on her finger would make it pretty clear. There’s an episode of </span><i><span>How I Met Your Mother </span></i><span>in which Marshall (Jason Segal) realizes he can’t tell any sexy stories from his dating life to his friends without everyone knowing they’re about his long-time partner Lily (Alyson Hannigan) because she’s the only one he’s really been with. Part of what makes love songs such a popular genre of music is that there’s a universality to them that people can project onto their own relationships. Who among us wouldn’t love to sing about a man’s dick lifting a curse and solving all our problems? But Swift’s very public personal life and clear references to her husband-to-be mean that I can’t hear this song without knowing whose dick it’s about.</span></p>   <p><span>That being said, the song is pretty catchy. What Swift may lack in Carpenter’s clever jokes, she makes up for in a fun song about love and lust. And hey, Kelce seems cool with it?</span></p>   <p><span>One song I have a less charitable read on, however, is “Actually Romantic,” which takes the other side of “everyone knowing your business” and seems to be essentially a diss track against Charli XCX. For those who don’t know, Charli has a song called “Sympathy Is a Knife” on the album </span><i><span>Brat</span></i><span> that addresses her insecurities in the pop girl space, and seemingly references Swift specifically triggering those feelings of comparison in her. “Actually Romantic” is being called a diss track aimed at the “360” singer, and at first blush, some think Swift may have straight-up misunderstood the intent behind “Sympathy Is a Knife,” which is actually fairly complimentary to her.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>However, “Actually Romantic” does seem to gesture at further drama behind the scenes, even as Swift has been publicly supportive of Charli. Specifically, it references Swift’s past relationship with Matty Healy of the band 1975, which also includes Charli’s husband George Daniel, and things Charli has allegedly said about Swift in private.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>I heard you call me ‘Boring Barbie’ when the coke’s got you brave&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>High-fived my ex and then said you’re glad he ghosted me&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Wrote me a song saying it makes you sick to see my face</span></p> <p><span>Some people might be offended&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But it’s actually sweet&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>All the time you’ve spent on me.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>I guess I can buy that maybe there’s more happening than “Sympathy Is a Knife” lets on. It’s giving </span><i><span>Reputation</span></i><span> era, when Swift was very publicly calling out other public figures like Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, or </span><i><span>1989</span></i><span>’s “Bad Blood” which referenced her now-ended feud with pop star </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/katy-perry-womans-world-music-video-pokemon-pikachu-1851590464"><span>Katy Perry</span></a><span>. Again, it’s the effect of someone’s personal life being so public that these songs end up weaving a story that’s already playing out on social media and in gossip magazines. Though if this is all spun off from “Sympathy Is a Knife,” then it feels like punching down.</span></p> <p><span>The problem with </span><i><span>Life of a Showgirl</span></i><span> is that Swift’s status as a billionaire mega-celebrity clashes against the “relatable” persona she exhibits in her music here more than ever before. “Eldest Daughter” laments how mean everyone on the internet can be, when she’s enveloped in a massive cocoon of wealth and status. Like, girl, why are you even reading TikTok comments when you could be doing literally anything else with all that money?</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="und" dir="ltr">lol <a href="https://t.co/a78pUaSvCU">https://t.co/a78pUaSvCU</a> <a href="https://t.co/quyrERr07R">pic.twitter.com/quyrERr07R</a></p> <p>— grace spelman (@GraceSpelman) <a href="https://twitter.com/GraceSpelman/status/1973974944607580252?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Another song that really sticks out as an expression of Swift imagining threats to her status is “CANCELLED!” which I saw someone say is destined to become the new anthem of MAGA wine moms, and I can’t stop thinking about it. As the title suggests, the song is all about perceived judgments of her for who she chooses to associate with, with her singing that she likes her friends “cancelled” and cloaked in “scandal.” Broadly, this could be a song about cancel culture and how Swift is unwilling to drop people just because they run afoul of public scrutiny, but given that she has </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fauxmoi/comments/1n4fj0i/taylor_swift_celebrates_brittany_maga_mahomes/"><span>friends who are public Trump supporters</span></a><span>, that feels like underselling or minimizing people’s criticism as some kind of petty scandal, rather than a legitimate concern.</span></p>   <p><span>Ultimately, all of these reactions are born from the relationship with her fandom that Swift has cultivated over her decades-long career. When your personal life is the source of the characters and stories people listen for references to in each song, every album is like a new season of a television show for which millions of people tune in just to lap up every new lore drop. But is the music any good? In my first listen, I came away thinking that </span><i><span>Life of a Showgirl </span></i><span>is an obvious low point in Swift’s discography. I don’t think I’m alone in that assessment, but the album has been out for all of 12 hours at this point, and people will sort their feelings out over the next few weeks or months. Tonight, Swift is putting out a movie in theaters called </span><i><span>The Official Release Party of a Showgirl</span></i><span>, which will include commentary and context for the album from Swift. Maybe that will work in its favor. For now, the music is speaking for itself. For better or worse.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/fEAu5T8XnL">pic.twitter.com/fEAu5T8XnL</a></p> <p>— emily (@grIgenius) <a href="https://twitter.com/grIgenius/status/1973971796795011134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">every year a taylor swift album comes out and she goes roses are red grass is green i love travis and my haters are mean and her fans go Omgggggg the lyricism</p> <p>— zade (@zadtwt) <a href="https://twitter.com/zadtwt/status/1973855618890158350?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">she did it omg <a href="https://t.co/pRaiOFRgtG">https://t.co/pRaiOFRgtG</a> <a href="https://t.co/idYwgDuRH0">pic.twitter.com/idYwgDuRH0</a></p> <p>— Wendell (@RhodeToLove) <a href="https://twitter.com/RhodeToLove/status/1973970282617667816?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">yall im CRYINGNSIDNDHF <a href="https://t.co/nC25tp2KcZ">pic.twitter.com/nC25tp2KcZ</a></p> <p>— allypally (@allypallyxcx) <a href="https://twitter.com/allypallyxcx/status/1974027869689983175?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/3CIXeCfhyy">https://t.co/3CIXeCfhyy</a> <a href="https://t.co/NAQvUVy9Qp">pic.twitter.com/NAQvUVy9Qp</a></p> <p>— The Coke That Made Charli xcx Brave (@Neil_McNeil) <a href="https://twitter.com/Neil_McNeil/status/1974002104575328501?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/O23bECsSMr">https://t.co/O23bECsSMr</a> <a href="https://t.co/iK8u3dO19T">pic.twitter.com/iK8u3dO19T</a></p> <p>— keira (@kettlevinyl) <a href="https://twitter.com/kettlevinyl/status/1973991187330576725?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">These aren’t lyrics born of depth, just reference points engineered to ride the current wave internet talking points like ‘eldest daughters suffer more than jesus’ and spark a shallow ‘she’s just like me’ emotion from its listener.
