              <p>It’s February. The weather is cold, love is in the air, and there’s a Nintendo Direct to tune in for. Nintendo, as it often does, scheduled it for the ass crack of dawn, so if you were still sleeping or getting ready for work and missed the whole shebang, we’ve got you covered. If you want to watch the stream yourself, you can do so below, but if you just want the highlights, read on.</p>  <h2><em>Orbitals</em></h2> <p>Kicking things off is <em>Orbitals</em>, a game often described as “anime&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>.” The co-op puzzle game sports a retro anime aesthetic and has two players doing co-op-centric puzzles, platforming, and a ton of mini-games. It’s coming to Switch 2 this summer and will support Game Share, so you’ll only need one copy of the game to play with a friend.</p>

  <h2><em>Paranormasight: The Mermaid’s Curse</em></h2> <p>Next up is the next entry in the&nbsp;<em>Paranormasight&nbsp;</em>series.&nbsp; The mystery adventure series is going to an island setting where you’ll solve puzzles and a larger mystery. It’s coming out on February 19.</p>  <h2><em>Captain Tsubasa II World Fighters</em></h2> <p>If you’ve ever wanted to live out a sports anime, the latest entry in the&nbsp;<em>Captain Tsubasa&nbsp;</em>series is giving you that chance with its extreme soccer action. It’s coming to Switch later this year.</p>

  <h2><em>Tokyo Scramble</em></h2> <p><em>Tokyo Scramble&nbsp;</em>is a horror game in which you run around a subterranean world beneath Tokyo while trying to avoid dinosaurs, sometimes activating traps to hinder them. You can play alongside friends by splitting the game’s controls across multiple systems such that one person controls character movement, another steers the camera, and so on. That sounds…frustrating but in a way that would probably make for a good livestream. It’s coming to Switch 2 February 11.</p>

  <h2><em>Valheim</em></h2> <p>Survival game&nbsp;<em>Valheim&nbsp;</em>is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 after being just about everywhere else for years. It’ll arrive on the system later this year.</p>  <h2><em>Hollow Knight: Switch 2 Edition</em></h2> <p>If you want to play the original <em>Hollow Knight&nbsp;</em>on the go with better framerate, it’s coming to Switch 2 today. If you have the Switch version, you can upgrade for free.</p>

  <h2><em>eFootball Kick-Off!</em></h2> <p>And we’re back to soccer with&nbsp;<em>eFootball Kick-Off!</em>, Konami’s evolution of its legendary <em>PES </em>soccer series, which is coming to Switch 2 this summer.</p>  <h2><em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</em></h2> <p><em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales </em>is the next HD-2D RPG coming from Square, and it looks pretty despite the silly name. It’s coming to Switch 2 on June 18.</p>  <h2><em>Super Bomberman Collection</em></h2> <p>If you’re feeling nostalgic and want to play all five <em>Bomberman</em> games released on the SNES, including ones that weren’t released worldwide up until now, the <em>Super Bomberman Collection&nbsp;</em>is coming to Switch and Switch 2 today.</p>

  <h2><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></h2> <p>The second game in the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Remake&nbsp;</em>trilogy is coming to Switch 2, so you, too, can play a whole bunch of mini-games and be annoyed by the ending on the go. It’s coming to Switch 2 on June 3.</p>  <h2><em>Pragmata</em></h2> <p>Capcom’s new sci-fi puzzle shooter&nbsp;<em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>is coming to Switch 2, and what I played of it last year makes it seem like it’s going to be pretty cool in a kind of nostalgic Xbox-360-era shooter sort of way. It’s coming to Switch 2 on April 24, and a demo is available today.</p>

  <h2><em>Turok: Origins</em></h2> <p>If one dinosaur game was not enough for you or you want one that’s gonna be a bit more action and a bit less running away, <em>Turok: Origins&nbsp;</em>is bringing all that to Switch 2 in the fall.</p>  <h2><em>Kyoto Xanadu</em></h2> <p><i>Kyoto Xanadu&nbsp;</i>is a cross between hack-and-slash and sidescrolling action and&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>-style social sim. It’s coming to Switch and Switch 2 this summer.</p>  <h2><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em></h2> <p>Oh hell yeah,&nbsp;<em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger&nbsp;</em>is coming to Switch 2 and Switch. It’s a great turn-based RPG that I probably would’ve preferred playing on this system the first time around. It’s coming to Nintendo systems on July 10.</p>

  <h2><em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink – Endless Ragnarok</em></h2> <p>The latest entry in the&nbsp;<em>Granblue Fantasy&nbsp;</em>action RPG series is coming to the Switch 2 on July 9.</p>  <h2><em>Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</em></h2> <p>If you’ve ever been interested in&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter</em> but find its dense systems intimidating, the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Stories</em> subseries is probably a better entry point. The next entry,&nbsp;<em>Twisted Reflection</em>, is coming to Switch 2 on March 13, and a demo is coming out today. If you play it, you can transfer your save data to the full game when it launches.</p>  <h2>Arcade Archives&nbsp;/&nbsp;Console Archives</h2> <p>New games are coming to Arcade Archives and Console Archives, including&nbsp;<em>Rave Racer</em>,&nbsp;<em>Doraemon</em>,&nbsp;<em>Sonic Wings Special</em>,&nbsp;<em>Cool Boarders</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden II: The Dark Sword of Chaos.&nbsp;</em></p>  <h2>Montage</h2> <p>Next up we got some rapid-fire trailers for games like <em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em> (March 3),&nbsp;<em>Another Eden Begins&nbsp;</em>(Summer 2026),&nbsp;<em>Reanimal&nbsp;</em>(February 13),&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K26&nbsp;</em>(March 13),&nbsp;<em>Star Trek: Voyager – Across the Unknown&nbsp;</em>(February 18),&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em> (Switch 2 Edition) (March 25), <em>PGA Tour 2K25</em> (February 6),&nbsp;<em>Culdcept Begins&nbsp;</em>(July 16),&nbsp;<em>Goat Simulator 3</em> (April 1),&nbsp;<em>Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun&nbsp;</em>(March 18), and <em>Tales of Arise – Beyond the Dawn Edition</em> (May 22).</p>

  <h2><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></h2> <p><em>Resident Evil Requiem&nbsp;</em>is launching on Switch 2 alongside all other current systems on February 27. Folks who have played the game on the console have said it runs pretty well, though it doesn’t look quite as good, so it’s, ya know, a Switch version of a game. <em>Resident Evil VII&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Village&nbsp;</em>will also launch on the Switch 2 that same day. Amiibos of Grace and Leon are coming out this summer and will unlock weapon skins in <em>Requiem</em>.</p>  <h2>Bethesda is bringing games to Switch 2</h2> <p>Wrapping up the show is Bethesda, which is bringing&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition&nbsp;</em>on February 24,&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> on May 12, and&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</em>later in 2026.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Wastes No Time Coming To Switch 2]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> will come to Switch 2 just six months after the <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-handheld-performance-2000661851">first game in Square Enix’s remake trilogy</a> arrived on Nintendo’s portable console. It’s also getting a special “boost” mode to help streamline combat.</p> <p>Out on Switch 2 on June 6, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> follows Cloud and co. after they leave the first game’s Blade Runner-infused megacity of Midgar and head out on an open-world-ish adventure to find Sephiroth and save the world. Its peaks are higher than those of the first game but its troughs are also deeper. The big question will be how well the Switch 2 can handle its much larger environments. Valve’s Steam Deck has <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-steam-deck-verified-performance-1851748592">more than struggled</a> with the much more sprawling sequel.</p>

 <p>Here’s how the game looks in action on Switch 2:</p>  <p>The game will arrive with a new “boost” mode, which I’m guessing will come to the existing versions of the game on other platforms as well. If it’s anything like the new settings added to the Switch 2 version of <em>FFVII Remake Intergrade</em>, it’ll essentially be a combat god mode in which every hit does 9,999 damage and all Materia are maxed out. It’s a way to make the experience almost frictionless for people who might be intimidated by the RPG’s hybrid combat mechanics and just want to get to the next mini-game or cutscene.</p> <p>The speed at which <em>Rebirth</em> is coming to Switch 2 is the real surprise here. While we’ll have to wait to see just how much it tests Nintendo’s new hardware, the move certainly lends more credence to the possibility <a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-remake-part-3-unreal-engine-4-ue5-gen-ai-2000663075">that the third game</a> in the remake trilogy, which is reportedly playable and almost finished, won’t be a timed PlayStation 5 exclusive like the others. Hopefully for Switch 2 and Xbox owners, the next game comes to every platform day-and-date.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[One Of 2025’s Biggest Flops Is Trying To Engineer A Big Comeback Almost No One Asked For]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mindseye-reboot-update-7-leslie-benzies-2000666008</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Developer Build a Rocket Boy might be trying to stage a </span><i><span>No Man’s Sky</span></i><span>-level comeback story for its heavily maligned, frequently mocked 2025 open-world game </span><i><span>MindsEye</span></i><span>, and it would appear that the developer is attempting to do so without the help of its original publisher, IO Interactive.</span></p> <p><span>This week, </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>received an unexpected new update. Build a Rocket Boy </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3265250/view/511856483278782537"><span>touts Update 7</span></a><span> as “another step forward in overall polish, guided by player and community feedback.” That statement does line up with the contents of the patch itself, as Update 7 essentially amounts to a list of bug fixes.</span></p>

 <p><span>However, the patch notes were followed up by a much grander statement in an official press release. According to Build a Rocket Boy, Update 7 serves “as a reset for the brand and the title” and the beginning of a “new era” for </span><i><span>MindsEye</span></i><span>. This statement lines up with the omission of IO Interactive’s branding and copyright info in the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VM9gc4dauyM"><span>latest trailer</span></a><span> for the game, which seemingly proves that the leak detailing Build a Rocket Boy and IO Interactive’s split was correct.</span></p>  <p><span>It’s not been a great week, month, or year for </span><i><span>MindsEye</span></i><span>. At the end of January, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-mission-mindseye-build-rocket-io-interactive-2000664566"><span>it leaked</span></a><span> that Build a Rocket Boy would reportedly be parting ways with IO Interactive, ending any plans for </span><i><span>MindsEye’s </span></i><span>future </span><i><span>Hitman </span></i><span>crossover. On February 2, co-CEO Mark Gerhard </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-ceo-threatens-youtuber-after-epstein-video-2000665097"><span>threatened a YouTuber</span></a><span> with a “formal cease and desist demand” via Discord 18 minutes after said YouTuber released a video titled “Leslie Benzies is in the Epstein Files.” Then, yesterday, Build a Rocket Boy’s other CEO, the aforementioned Leslie Benzies, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/leslie-benzies-epstein-allegation-gta-mindseye-2000665340"><span>released a statement</span></a><span> denying allegations of sexual assault by an alleged victim of Jeffrey Epstein.</span></p>

 <p><span>Build a Rocket Boy confirmed that Benzies remains working at the studio despite a wave of layoffs last summer, suggesting MindsEye’s attempt at a reboot will happen under his oversight. This week’s tease promised that a “new expansion that adds end-game content and enhanced world exploration” and multiplayer support are on the way, with details regarding the fresh 2026 content roadmap to be revealed “within the coming months.”</span></p>
