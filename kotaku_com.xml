              <p>A contingent of right-wing online figures and their followers have been using the recent assassination of conservative podcaster Charlie Kirk to punish people they don’t like. That includes a developer at <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> maker Sucker Punch Productions who Sony confirms it has parted ways with after she made a joke on social media about the shooting.</p> <p>“I hope the shooter’s name is Mario so that Luigi knows his bro got his back,” Drew Harrison, a nearly 10-year veteran of the PlayStation studio, posted in the evening after Kirk was shot and killed during a speaking event at Utah Valley University. A few hours later, the post was screen-grabbed and shared by anti-woke crusader Mark “Grummz” Kern.</p> <p>“Suckerpunch Senior Dev celebrates Charlie Kirk’s death,” he wrote. “<em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is dead to me now.” A streamer who goes by Madamsavvy responded, “No more. Cowards keep quiet. The studio deserves to go under.” Kern replied, “No mercy.”</p>

 <p>Harrison subsequently shared on social media that people had been contacting her employer angrily trying to get her fired, and posted a screenshot of a barrage of missed calls from anonymous numbers as evidence of an ongoing harassment campaign. Less than 24 hours later, she was fired.</p> <p>“If standing up against fascism is what cost me my dream job I held for 10 years, I would do it again 100x stronger,” she wrote.</p> <p>Sony confirmed her departure in an email to <em>Kotaku</em> but declined to comment further. “Drew Harrison is no longer an employee of Sucker Punch Productions,” a spokesperson from Sony Interactive Entertainment wrote.</p>

The big PS5 exclusive has been in anti-woke activists’ firing line ever since <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> revealed the open-world samurai series’ latest entry would star a woman named Atsu, played by Erika Ishii.</p> <p>Fed by an algorithmically juiced YouTube rage factory, certain online culture content creators latched onto one of Ishii’s past comments about abolishing the police as a way to attack the game. Videos with titles like “<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> DOOMED? Radical Activist Erika Ishii Brings Woke Chaos!” later changed to things like “<em>Ghost Of Yotei</em> New Trailer Sparks BACKLASH, Hiring Activists Backfires For Sony &amp; Sucker Punch” as YouTubers combed LinkedIn for evidence proving that people with opinions they disagreed with were ruining games.</p>

 <p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is far from the only high-profile blockbuster game to be dragged into this culture war quicksand. Kern and others attacked Ubisoft’s <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> as well for featuring an African samurai as one of its two main characters. Developers on the game were <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-antiwoke-ubisoft-rpg-1851770511">reportedly told not to comment</a> on the harassment campaign when the game launched earlier this year.</p> <p>While Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot condemned attacks targeting employees, he also said at the time the company was working on “tackling the dynamics behind the polarized comments around Ubisoft so as to protect the Group’s reputation and maximize our game’s sales potential.”</p> <p>Members of the harassment campaign to get Harrison fired from Sucker Punch are already targeting individuals at other game studios and publishers over their social media comments. “Every single studio is compromised,” one of them wrote. “And it’s all American leftists doing this.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-devs-explain-the-game%E2%80%99s-most-controversial-setting.1296735/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In August, the <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta was a massive success and one of the most played games of the year. But there was a <a href="https://kotaku.com/oh-thank-god-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-back-2000617797#:~:text=While%20some%20players,in%20the%20game.">controversial “quick turn” setting</a> included in the beta that caused some debate online. And when I asked the devs why it was added, they said: Balance and customization.</p> <p>Earlier this week, <em>Kotaku</em> sat down with two <em>Battlefield 6</em> devs to discuss the game’s console ports, and I had to ask about the <a href="https://x.com/TheTacticalBrit/status/1953513296042053713">quick turn feature</a>. People online suggested it looked like cheating and was too OP. Others claimed it helped balance <em>BF6</em> by giving controller players a chance to turn around quickly. According to&nbsp;Matthew Nickerson, senior console combat designer on <em>Battlefield 6,</em> balancing the game was indeed one reason it was added.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is a must have setting in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Battlefield6</a> Flick Look allows you to achieve an instant quick 180 in combat! <a href="https://t.co/ElMW1yvrhh">pic.twitter.com/ElMW1yvrhh</a></p> <p>— TacticalBrit (@TheTacticalBrit) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheTacticalBrit/status/1953513296042053713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“The inherent issue of including aim assist on controller,” Nickerson told <em>Kotaku</em>,&nbsp; “[is that] you constantly are doing a big sweeping motion [while looking around], you’re constantly going full speed, and then you hit the bubbles of aim assist, and it automatically slows down. So you’re kind of constantly fighting these systems that are preventing you from quickly 180 turning.”</span></p>

 <p>Adding a quick flip option was a “huge win” that solved a “lot of issues” that exist when playing on a controller against mouse and keyboard players.</p> <p><span>“You know, you get shot in the back [and] it’s frustrating to be a controller player those days,” added Nickerson.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>According to him, making sure crossplay was balanced, fair, and fun was a huge goal for the entire team working on <em>Battlefield 6</em>. So the quick turn option, officially known as “Flick Stick,” was one more way to keep crossplay competitive for all.</p>

 <p>The other reason for adding it? Well, because it’s cool and gives players one more way to customize their controls and gameplay. And combined with the PS5’s gyro controls, Flick Stick can do some “really cool stuff.” Plus, Nickerson told <em>Kotaku</em> it helps give console players more ways to interact with the game despite gamepads having far fewer buttons than a keyboard.</p> <p><span>“If you want to reload [or turn around], maybe you just flick on your controller upright, and it activates the gyro, so it’s like</span><span> another new layer of customizability,” said Nickerson.&nbsp;</span></p> <p>I’m not sure I’ll be using gyro controls in <em>Battlefield 6</em> when it launches on October 10 on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC. But you’d better believe I’ll have a button set for turning around instantly so I can at least I can see the person killing me from behind.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolution-timeline-hurts-houndoom-scizor-1850870401"><span>Mega Evolutions</span></a><span> are coming back in </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. These powerful, temporary transformations are one of the most popular battle gimmicks in the RPG series, and not only is </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> giving Pokémon the chance to Mega Evolve into their old forms again, it’s also giving some new Mega forms to Pokémon who didn’t get them the first time around.</span></p> <p><span>These forms typically exaggerate traits possessed by the original Pokémon, but some are definitely more compelling than others. Whether we compare design, lore implications, or competitive ability, not all Mega Evolutions are created equal. Some are iconic, having become synonymous with their respective monsters’ designs. Others are not good and have been kind of forgotten, unless they’re brought up in the context of dunking on how lame they were. There are over 50 of them so far, and we’re here to rank all of them. We’ll update this ranking as more are revealed leading up to&nbsp;<em>Legends: Z-A</em>.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000625461" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625461"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625461">© The <span>Pokémon Company</span></figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Latios and Latias</b></h2> <p><span>It pains me to put my girl Latias at the bottom of this list, and it pains me even more to have to lump her into one entry with her brother Latios because Game Freak made the two jet plane dragons identical in their Mega forms. The pair’s blue and red color schemes merge into a uniform purple, and the only real difference between the two is their eye color. A real missed opportunity to diverge them more rather than making them the same.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Mewtwo X</b></h2> <p><span>It’s a good thing Mewtwo got two Mega forms, and one is pretty good, because Mega Mewtwo X’s bulkier frame looks extremely off on the typically sleek psychic-type legendary.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Pinsir</b></h2> <p><span>Mega Pinsir looks like the kind of unidentifiable bug I would have seen flying around the woods while living in the Georgia boonies, and for that, I think it should be squished.</span></p> <h2><b>Sharpedo</b></h2> <p><span>Sharpedo’s the first on this list of Mega Evolutions that just looks like a pre-teen’s notebook redesign doodle. More stripes and more pointy things. That’s all.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000625462" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625462"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625462">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Tyranitar</b></h2> <p><span>See, this is what I’m talking about. Half of the Mega Evolutions don’t even seem to have a real concept beyond cranking the visual elements up.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Garchomp</b></h2> <p><span>How is Mega Garchomp going to hold a plate of spaghetti with those scythe hands?&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Venusaur</b></h2> <p><span>They gave Venusaur a hat.</span></p> <h2><b>Gardevoir</b></h2> <p><span>It says a lot about this design that I had to stare at it for several seconds to realize what was different from the original.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Gengar</b></h2> <p><span>Gengar’s third eye opened, and it saw the infinitely superior Gigantamax form it would get in Galar.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000625463" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625463"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625463">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Lopunny</b></h2> <p><span>Game “Freak” is right.</span></p> <h2><b>Manectric</b></h2> <p><span>They made my guy carry the literal weight of electricity on his back.</span></p> <h2><b>Pidgeot</b></h2> <p><span>I really like the additional blue in the color scheme, but overall, Mega Pidgeot just kinda looks like another regular bird.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Charizard Y</b></h2> <p><span>Like Mewtwo, Charizard also has two Mega Evolutions, and one is far superior to the other. Mega Charizard Y looks almost like an early concept for a Mega that didn’t quite go all the way. At a glance, it looks pretty close to the original, and even its defining trait of a third horn on its head isn’t that noticeable if you’re not viewing it from the right angle.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000625465" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625465"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625465">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Raichu Y</b></h2> <p><span>He’s cute, but I’m not a fan of Game Freak making a Raichu form look more like Pikachu.</span></p> <h2><b>Greninja</b></h2> <p><span>Putting Greninja upside down and hanging off a giant shuriken is a cool concept, but it doesn’t do much with the actual new design.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Medicham</b></h2> <p><span>Motherfucker said “domain expansion.”</span></p> <h2><b>Absol</b></h2> <p><span>“It’s not a phase, Mom! This is who I am!”</span></p> <h2><b>Abomasnow</b></h2> <p><span>The Pokémon world’s abominable snowman monster becomes more abominable.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Aggron</b></h2> <p><span>A tanky boi becomes an armored tank. I’d trust him to bulldoze over any foe.</span></p> <h2><b>Aerodactyl</b></h2> <p><span>I was ready to drop Aerodactyl lower until I saw that, apparently, its Mega form is meant to be what the pterodactyl looked like before it was fossilized, and that’s pretty cool.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000625466" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625466"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625466">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Blaziken and Lucario</b></h2> <p><span>I’m lumping Blaziken and Lucario into the same entry because they’re basically the same design. They get these cool frilly things that look like martial arts bands. They lean into both Pokémon’s fighting typing to let them aura farm at the top of a tall mountain with the moon in the background, probably.</span></p> <h2><b>Scizor</b></h2> <p><span>Mega Scizor is a pretty natural exaggeration of the armor-plated bug’s original form, but it’s apparently now so full of energy that it’s actually melting as it holds this form. That’s metal.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Camerupt&nbsp;</b></h2> <p><span>Mega Camerupt is one of the Mega Evolutions that kinda seems like it should have just been a standard evolution because it builds so well off the original’s concept. The camel Pokémon’s mountain-like humps turn into an active volcano, and he becomes an angry, explosive dude. It’s giving Anger from</span><i><span> Inside Out</span></i><span>.</span></p> <h2><b>Mawile</b></h2> <p><span>Mawile’s Mega form is very similar in aesthetic to Blaziken’s and Lucario’s, but the weird little guy grows a second mouth on the back of its head, and if you don’t think that’s the tightest shit, I don’t know what to tell you.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Metagross</b></h2> <p><span>Metagross now has four arms, which means twice as many hugs.</span></p> <h2><b>Heracross</b></h2> <p><span>Oh, the smells you will smell with that nose, my guy.</span></p> <h2><b>Steelix</b></h2> <p><span>The crystalized segments of its extended body are dope, but it’s also cool as shit that it has its own gravitational pull, with an almost asteroid-belt-like structure floating around its neck.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000625468" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625468"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625468">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Rayquaza</b></h2> <p><span>Mega Rayquaza nearly approaches the “overdesigned” threshold by nudging an already pretty elaborate Pokémon into something that kinda looks like someone was just slapping decorations on the dragon and seeing what would stick. But Mega Rayquaza’s lore as a sort of god believed to have been born out of humanity’s wish for salvation makes him one of the more grandiose and mysterious Mega Evolutions in the series, and I am too much of a Pokémon world-building sicko to not give it a bump for that.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Kangaskhan</b></h2> <p><span>Mega Kangaskhan is funny because the Mega Evolution mostly applies to the little baby the mother carries in her pouch. It turns into a battle-ready child, and according to the Pokedex, the mother is concerned about its future because it only knows how to fight, and it worries about the day that it is old enough to leave her pouch for good. We love a parental existential crisis in our Mega Evolution.</span></p> <h2><b>Gyarados</b></h2> <p><span>Mega Gyarados is a bulkier and more destructive version of one of the most terrifying creatures in the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> world. The addition of the dark typing makes it intimidating and comes through in its black-and-red design.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000625469" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625469"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625469">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Houndoom</b></h2> <p><span>My guy is wearing what looks like a mammoth skull around his neck. I love him, your honor.</span></p> <h2><b>Glalie</b></h2> <p><span>Mega Glalie is one of those really horrifying Mega Evolutions that you almost can’t believe is in a Pokémon game. Its jaw has become unhinged and it can no longer close it, so it goes hungry because it can’t eat. Hardcore.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Blastoise</b></h2> <p><span>Blastoise definitely fares a bit better than Venusaur and Charizard Y in the Mega Evolution department. Brother’s carrying some heavy artillery on his back now, as well as arm cannons to replace the shoulder ones of its base form. Blastoise becomes a walking arsenal.</span></p> <h2><b>Diancie</b></h2> <p><span>Diancie goes from a pretty but kinda forgettable mythical Pokemon to a full-blown magical girl after it mega evolves. Slay.</span></p> <h2><b>Swampert</b></h2> <p><span>Swole boy.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000625470" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625470"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625470">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Raichu X</b></h2> <p><span>Thank you, Game Freak, for putting respect on Raichu’s name. Raichu X is a bit overdesigned, but beggars can’t be choosers. That’s my boy and shaped like an X. I live.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Chesnaught</b></h2> <p><span>Chesnaught hate is so forced, and its Mega Evolution has a kickass mace, so watch your mouth.</span></p> <h2><b>Gallade</b></h2> <p><span>My guy gets knighted. Look at his sick cape. Mega Gallade is on his way to the Met Gala. I wish my fit went that hard.</span></p> <h2><b>Banette</b></h2> <p><span>Banette mega evolving and letting all its vindictive life force flow out of its doll-like body goes hard.</span></p> <h2><b>Hawlucha</b></h2> <p><span>Mega Hawlucha becomes a decorated luchador, and I must give it its flowers.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000625471" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625471"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625471">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Dragonite</b></h2> <p><span>Mega Dragonite is a divisive form, but I think the way it sports those goofy head wings as a representation of its previous evolution’s traits is almost a funny meta joke toward those who complain that it doesn’t look enough like Dragonair. He’s goofy, but I trust him.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Sableye</b></h2> <p><span>Mega Sableye is every introvert’s fantasy of having something to hide behind at all times.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Malamar</b></h2> <p><span>I am immune to hypnosis, so Mega Malamar was not able to brainwash me into putting it at the top of this list, but this Megamind-ass skinny legend is still serving.</span></p> <h2><b>Altaria</b></h2> <p><span>Altaria is already one of the most beautiful Pokémon in the Pokedex, and giving it an even bigger bougie-ass cloud to carry on its back and a whole puffy white wig on its head has Mega Altaria ready for its Ruveal.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Mewtwo Y</b></h2> <p><span>Finally, Mega Mewtwo Y lets Mewtwo become the weird little alien freak he was always meant to be.</span></p> <h2><b>Audino</b></h2> <p><span>Audino is based on a nurse in its base form, so getting a “promotion” into a full-blown doctor with a lab coat as a Mega Evolution is a really cute concept, though I think I might have liked it more as a separate evolved form.</span></p> <h2><b>Beedrill</b></h2> <p><span>Beedrill goes from an unassuming stinger bee to what looks like a vicious hornet. That motherfucker is mean-mugging you at the outdoor lunch function and is about to start flying over your dish.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000625472" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625472"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625472">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Victreebel</b></h2> <p><span>Another win for the goofy guys. Victreebel wraps vines around its throat to keep all its toxic fluid inside its engorged belly, and as a result, it looks like a smiley doofus. That shit rules, actually.</span></p> <h2><b>Salamence</b></h2> <p><span>Salamence dreamed of flying as a wee little Bagon, and once it Mega Evolves, it becomes a crescent-moon-shaped, jet-like dragon. It is Icarus flying too close to the sun, achieving the flight it always dreamed of, but has become misshapen in the process. Now it’s just a violent, flying killing machine. Impeccable concept.</span></p> <h2><b>Alakazam</b></h2> <p><span>“Experience tranquility”</span></p> <h2><b>Delphox</b></h2> <p><span>They gave her a witch’s broom to ride on. She’s the supreme witch now.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Sceptile</b></h2> <p><span>You know how some reptiles can regrow their tails if they’re severed in some way? What if that tail was also a missile?</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000625473" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625473"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625473">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Slowbro</b></h2> <p><span>We’ve got one more goofy guy near the top of this list. Mega Slowbro expands on the “Shellder latching onto its body” concept by increasing the shell-like creature’s hold on Slowbro. Now, instead of hanging out on its tail, it engulfs the whole body, with Slowbro more or less being along for the ride. It bounces on its tail, which pokes out of the bottom of the Shellder, but while all this makes it sound like Mega Evolution is a bad time for the Slowbro, it does benefit from impenetrable armor encasing its body, and it’s mostly comfortable with the arrangement.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000625474" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625474"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625474">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Charizard X</b></h2> <p><span>The most iconic “dragon” in Pokémon finally gets to be a dragon type. The blue and black color scheme harkens to its base shiny form, but the blue flames pouring from its mouth at all times imply a growing fiery power that its original form can’t quite reach. Mega Charizard X is the dragon unshackled.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000625475" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625475"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625475">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Ampharos</b></h2> <p><span>What if Mega Evolution not only stimulated hair growth, bringing back Ampharos’ pre-evolution white wool, but also awakened dormant dragon’s blood in the sheep-like line? That’s fucking sick. Ampharos is the best example of a Mega Evolution not just expanding upon a base concept, but considering what else is possible.</span></p>
