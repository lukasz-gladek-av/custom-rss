              <p><span>This week has been jam-packed with game anniversaries: </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-marriage-candidates-new-update-1-7-qi-2000674093"><i><span>Stardew Valley </span></i><span>turned 10</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-day-30-anniversary-go-anime-cosplay-stream-2000672824"><span>Pokémon turned 30</span></a><span>, and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> turned 40 — though nobody would blame you if you missed that last one. Zelda’s anniversary earlier this week was met with little fanfare; no new games or remakes were announced, nor any news on the upcoming live-action movie. All we got were some </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-mostly-ignored-the-legend-of-zeldas-40th-anniversary-but-heres-some-toy-versions-of-classic-weapons"><span>miniature weapon replicas</span></a><span>, and even those are only available in select stores in Japan.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Since Nintendo is apparently too busy </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-30-anniversary-stream-recap-winds-waves-2000674383"><span>celebrating Pokémon</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-zelda-turns-40-voice-actress-patricia-summersett-reveals-hopes-for-the-future-and-clarifies-her-thoughts-on-link-and-zeldas-gorgeous-relationship"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span> has taken up the mantle of honoring the legendary Zelda franchise through an interview with Zelda’s voice actress, Patricia Summersett.</span></p> <p><span>Summersett is a lifelong fan of the Zelda series and has been the voice of Princess Zelda for a decade. She starred in both </span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Tears of the Kingdom</span></i><span>, plus the spinoffs </span><i><span>Age of Calamity</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Age of Imprisonment</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>Inside the Casting for Princess Zelda</h2> <p><span>When asked about the auditioning process, Summersett says that she had no idea she was going for the role of Princess Zelda: “The best way to describe it was as a bleached script, which is when you have a certain amount of information about what the archetypes of the character are, the general world — for example, that it looks like an RPG fantasy — but you have no idea what the actual roles are going to be or what the game is. And there would’ve been no way of predicting that it was Zelda because she didn’t have a voice before. I just would never have assumed that was the game that I was auditioning for.”</span></p> <p><span>Summersett also explains that Zelda’s British accent wasn’t a note from Nintendo, but a choice inspired by Summersett’s schooling in London and Zelda’s royalty status. “It’s a little more comfortable to say this is a Hylian accent versus just a particular version of a UK accent,” she says.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>Thoughts on the Live-Action Movie</h2> <p><span>About the upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-live-action-movie-link-bragason-ainsworth-leak-2000644816"><span>live-action Zelda adaptation</span></a><span>, Summersett says, “Obviously Bo Bragason is going to kill it, she’s going to be amazing. I’m happy to have contributed in any way, without knowing where it’s all headed, other than the fact that it’s now been 10 years. I’m just floored by the fact I’ve been involved in this franchise for a quarter of it.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Obviously [the movie] is going to be a large collaboration between people who are new to the series and those deeply schooled in the series. [I think] you’re going to see a strong Zelda. I’m sure you’re going to see a powerful lead character in Zelda. And Link I have no idea, is he going to speak? They certainly haven’t alluded to the fact that he does, yet.”</span></p> <h2>So, Are Link and Zelda Officially Dating? (No)</h2> <p><span>Previously, Summersett shared her personal thoughts on the nature of Link and Zelda’s relationship, which were then </span><a href="https://x.com/Summersett_/status/1660658772824530944"><span>misconstrued</span></a><span> in a popular article. “I have all sorts of personal theories about what [their relationship] might be, but I think there’s something beautiful in the way that it’s left ambiguous, it’s left in a kind of — if there are romantic undertones, it’s left in an unrequited state. There’s obviously a deep friendship and a protectorship between the two of them. It’s a gorgeous relationship and it continues to evolve and be left open in so many iterations of this.</span></p>

 <p><span>“And what that means for me, as somebody who represents the character at things like conventions, is that anybody can come up to me with their version of what they think Link and Zelda are. And a lot of it comes in the form of coupleship — people proposing to each other and getting engaged with Zelda as a theme, or they feel like it’s something that they want to just celebrate with family or friends. It can mean kind of anything, and I love that it lives in that space.”</span></p> <h2>Summersett is a Bigger <em>Legend of Zelda</em> Fan than You</h2> <p><span>When asked about her favorite Zelda games, she says, “I am partial to </span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span>, but </span><i><span>Ocarina of Time</span></i><span> is really the ground zero of what the series means for me. And then maybe I’d say the original, though I was a child watching other people play that. And then I really liked </span><i><span>Twilight Princess</span></i><span> as well, just the art style of that one. So those are probably the top three.”</span></p> <p><span>“I see a lot of cosplay from</span><i><span> Twilight Princess</span></i><span> at conventions, and I also write in </span><i><span>Twilight Princess</span></i><span> Hylian, so I feel a little more connected to that game when I’m writing that in notes to people.”</span></p>

 <p><span>You read that right — Summersett can write in </span><i><span>Twilight Princess</span></i><span> Hylian! “It’s something I did early on when I was recording [</span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span>] and I was just starting to look through [series companion book] </span><i><span>Hyrule Historia</span></i><span> at the different versions of the languages from all the previous games. Obviously, </span><i><span>Breath of the Wild</span></i><span> wasn’t out yet, so I didn’t know what would be in that game. But I saw </span><i><span>Twilight Princess</span></i><span> Hylian and it’s so beautiful. I thought I could probably learn those characters, which is essentially just the alphabet, and started practicing that over coffee. So now I can kind of write fluently and use it all the time.”</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/how-sega-and-police-raids-interrupted-a-video-game-preservation-auction-2000674752</link>
            <guid>1449562</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>In 2025, London Police raided the home of Darius Khan. The junk dealer claims he was about to sell a set of SEGA dev kits, cartridges and prototypes to the Video Game Preservation Museum. After the items were confiscated and an eight hour interrogation, Khan says he was not formally charged but threatened with everything from theft to money laundering. When </span><i><span>Gamers Nexus</span></i><span>’ Steve Burke began to pick at the matter, a contractor hired to dispose of SEGA’s hardware mistakenly sent the wrong email, suggesting that it was corporate negligence, not criminal intent, that led to the misplaced bounty.</span></p>

 <p><span>Burke and his investigative team visited Khan in London to get a clearer sequence of events. Khan flips trash for cash, visiting scrap yards in search of material he can sell elsewhere. The waste is there to be processed before being hauled off to Africa. Most of Khan’s finds net modest sums, but one day he seemed to hit the jackpot with a cache of hardware seemingly pulled from a SEGA office. He made a deal with an on-site manager and put the e-waste up for auction. To his surprise, it was a hot ticket item. The London-based non-profit </span><a href="https://www.vgpm.org/"><span>Video Game Preservation Museum</span></a><span> raised over £60,000 to secure the winning bid when Khan put the lot on eBay.</span></p> <p><span>This is where things get a little cloak and dagger. According to the </span><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-15588369/collector-rare-games-consoles-sonic-hedgehog-sega.html"><i><span>Daily Mail</span></i></a><span>, Khan was soon reached out to by ‘Paul’ over Facebook Marketplace. Posing as the father to an autistic video game enthusiast, the man was in reality a private investigator, working for the firm FUSION 85, Nintendo’s go-to on matters of IP infringement and ROM sites. Not long after, at least ten police raided Khan’s home at 7AM, arresting him and two associates involved with the deal.</span></p> <p><span>“They were like worker bees,” Khan tells Burke, “taking this, this and they start putting it into evidence bags.”</span></p>

  <p><span>The Video Game Preservation Museum, having already put in a down-payment, were concerned by the radio silence before Khan had to break the weird, bad news. Dramatic enough as it was, things took another strange turn after </span><i><span>Gamers Nexus</span></i><span> reached out to Waste to Wonder. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Waste to Wonder is an office-clearing contractor hired by SEGA to dispose of sensitive hardware during an office relocation. When reached for comment, the company accidentally sent </span><i><span>Gamers Nexus</span></i><span> private correspondence between themselves and SEGA, implicating a sub-contractor, despite Khan taking all the heat.</span></p>

 <h2>From corporate gaming e-waste to private preservation auctions</h2> <p><span>When businesses, tech or otherwise, are cleared, it is common to hire contractors to dispose of all the junk that could prove compromising in the wrong hands. Papers shredded or incinerated. Hard drives are properly destroyed. With dev kits and prototypes, this could mean something as crude as having holes drilled into them or bashed with a hammer before being taken to another facility. Effective, but sloppy work could mean holes or hammer strikes to the wrong part of the hardware, leaving enough of the internal memory in-tact for a collector or trader to restore. Prototypes and dev kits can be holy grails to collectors and preservationists, with auction pages getting a lot of intrigue. Perhaps the most infamous </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-play-station-sells-at-auction-for-360-000-1842154345"><span>remains the ‘Nintendo Play Station,’</span></a><span> which sold to an anonymous buyer for $369,000.</span></p> <p><span>According to the emails accidentally sent to </span><i><span>Gamers Nexus</span></i><span>, SEGA instructed Waste to Wonder to clear mountains of e-waste left in their office (and from the looks of photos secured by </span><i><span>Gamers Nexus</span></i><span>, Sonic the Hedgehog’s head and shoes). Waste to Wonder then passed along the job to a subcontractor, who were instructed to take everything to a disposal site. In reality SEGA had assigned another firm, ITR Secure, to handle the more sensitive items, which never came to be.</span></p>

 <p><span>The items in question largely date from the mid-to-late 2000s, including dev kits and prototypes for the Nintendo Wii and DS. In </span><i><span>Gamers Nexus</span></i><span>’ video, a prototype of BioWare’s </span><i><span>Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood</span></i><span>, can be seen. Khan is under investigation, but if the email sent to </span><i><span>Gamers Nexus</span></i><span> is accurate he’s not guilty of any crime. He purchased the hardware in good faith and did not breach any IP by reproducing them. The Video Game Preservation Museum sought the hardware for private copies, which is also legal. What occurred is a clear case of corporate negligence, but the deployment of a private investigator, coordinating with police officials, suggests an attempt to obfuscate these mistakes.</span></p> <p><span>“If that is not an example of state power of intrusion being delegated to two private companies I don’t know what is,” Khan tells Burke.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/openai-says-hell-yea-to-to-helping-government-with-fully-autonomous-weapons-as-trump-bombs-more-countries-2000674755</link>
            <guid>1449529</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Last Thursday, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthropic-claude-ai-department-of-war-military-murder-2000674386"><span>Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei made a surprise statement</span></a><span> regarding the company’s decision to bail on negotiations with the Department of War. While the Pentagon had already made extensive use of their generative AI model, they began requesting that Anthropic ease restrictions on their terms of use. In a first for the tech industry, the major AI company took an unexpectedly pro-human-existence stance, with Amodei citing mass surveillance and “fully autonomous weapons” as lines he wouldn’t cross. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, however, is a-okay with these terms, with Altman recently taking to social media to boast about its new venture in arms dealing with the U.S. government.&nbsp;</span><span><br> </span></p>

 <p><span>“In all of our interactions, the DoW displayed a deep respect for safety and a desire to partner to achieve the best possible outcome,” </span><a href="https://x.com/sama/status/2027578580159631610"><span>Altman posted Friday night</span></a><span>. “We remain committed to serve all of humanity as best we can. The world is a complicated, messy, and sometimes dangerous place.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ok, what kind of American Ai company are you? <a href="https://t.co/7IJFMnpdrb">pic.twitter.com/7IJFMnpdrb</a></p> <p>— Skely (@123skely) <a href="https://twitter.com/123skely/status/2027588056686203228?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 28, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Though light on the details, Altman also said OpenAI had principles regarding surveillance and the training of killing machines, but said that their terms match the Department of War’s enough to shake on it. “We are asking the DoW to offer these same terms to all AI companies,” wrote Altman, “which in our opinion we think everyone should be willing to accept. We have expressed our strong desire to see things de-escalate away from legal and governmental actions and towards reasonable agreements.”</span></p> <p><span>Altman’s commitment to existence on Earth doesn’t breed a lot of confidence. The week prior, </span><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2026/02/21/sam-altman-would-like-remind-you-that-humans-use-a-lot-of-energy-too/"><span>Altman made a very bizarre defense of AI’s infamous energy usage</span></a><span>, saying that as gnarly as OpenAI’s water consumption is, training a human to reach the same stage of development requires “20 years of life and all of the food you eat during that time before you get smart.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>On the other end, whatever spooked Anthropic in the Pentagon was enough to rankle the rest of the administration. Secretary of War Pete Hegseth threatened to label Anthropic </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn48jj3y8ezo"><span>a security risk or to enforce new laws in retaliation</span></a><span>. It even </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn48jj3y8ezo"><span>riled up President Donald Trump’s usual brand of ire</span></a><span>.</span></p>   <p><span>The people Altman just handed over the OpenAI keys to are the same ones currently waging illegal wars from Latin America to the Middle East. Mere hours after Altman celebrated his new deal with the Department of War, the U.S. military initiated an unprovoked bombing campaign against Iran in partnership with Israel. It’s reportedly been planned for months without any authorization from Congress.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“The lives of courageous American heroes may be lost and we may have casualties,” Trump said in a video message earlier today. “That often happens in war.” </span><a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2026/2/28/live-israel-launches-attacks-on-iran-multiple-explosions-heard-in-tehran?update=4345839"><span>According to newswires like </span><i><span>Al Jazeera</span></i></a><span>, one of the bombs hit an all-girls elementary school, with at least 50 civilian casualties and counting. Whatever Altman’s new conditions are regarding AI’s usage on self-automated death machines, we may learn sooner than later.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Is Reportedly Pulling Back From PC When It Comes To Single-Player Blockbusters Like Wolverine]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/wolverine-pc-steam-ps5-exclusivity-sony-2000674746</link>
            <guid>1449517</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There was a moment back in 2024 when it seemed like a switch had flipped on console exclusivity. Microsoft was bringing some of its biggest games to Switch and PS5 and Sony was <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-xbox-exclusivity-helldivers-spiderman-switch-2-1851787122">supporting PC ports more than ever</a>. A fully multiplatform future felt almost inevitable. But things have shifted since then and Sony is reportedly pulling back from platforms like Steam to double down on the PlayStation 5 ecosystem, at least when it comes to single-player games like<em> Wolverine</em>.</p>

 <p>We reported on rumors of this upcoming shift <a href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-gpu-prices-eurogamer-layoffs-wolfenstein-3-casting-2000674011">earlier this week</a>. “I get the feeling that under the current leadership, that PC has become less important.” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnZsurPI5EY&amp;t=1413s"><em>Digital Foundry</em>‘s John Linneman</a> said on a recent podcast. <em>Bloomberg</em>‘s Jason Schreier coincidently shared a <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/why-phil-spencer-retired-and-whats-next-for-xbox/id1507834679?i=1000751690666">similar inkling on <em>Triple Click</em></a>, adding that he wouldn’t be surprised if <em>Wolverine</em> just never came to PC at all.</p> <p>To make clear that this wasn’t just idle speculation, Schreier followed up on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/jason-schreier-the-sense-i%E2%80%99m-getting-is-that-sony-is-backing-away-from-putting-their-exclusive-console-traditional-single-player-stuff-on-pc.1447141/page-6#post-151851202">gaming forum ResetEra</a> to clarify. “It’s not speculation, but sometimes topics come up on the show before I’m quite ready to publish a story about them,” he wrote. “More to come soon I’m sure.”</p> <p>Since then, insider NateTheHate has come out with an even more clear-cut pronouncement. “They are shifting their PC release strategy,” he tweeted <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2027438633997734231">on February 27</a>. “You’ll be seeing fewer single player games arrive on PC. The decision to shift away from supporting PC was made last year. Naturally, some may still release (pending how far along the ports were) but it no longer appears to be a priority for Sony moving forward.”</p>

 <p>That’s an awful lot of smoke for no fire, and in fact the flames have been building for a few months now. &nbsp;“It does seem like the games that PlayStation released on PC didn’t move the needle for them at all,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/EZkatWINAYE?t=10034s"><em>WindowsCentral</em>‘s Jez Cordon</a> said on a podcast last November based on what he’d heard from a source. “Partially because they were launched so late, but maybe they’ve used that as evidence that they shouldn’t go any further, and that they should remain more Nintendo in their approach and keep things more exclusive.”</p> <h2>PC ports made sense for Sony</h2> <div data-testid="cellInnerDiv"> <article tabindex="0" role="article" aria-labelledby="id__tfgnkwds43 id__3etdtbapts id__gkxm2zlkei5 id__yqgonprm9do id__95brirup5o5 id__rdsbu47lxs id__hpo3dl7sdw9 id__2xq9ja27s33 id__fh019t7ap2s id__u92w1vn3toc id__3xqb51w38fy id__9i7o8q9wt2c id__y8nxgtzxrol id__fape6cbjv87 id__hsg9hgs038p id__vz3me5ss3gk id__k8roej4k9p id__54j0po2ixwj id__90gwquh60vk id__oqfqs22kv1" data-testid="tweet"> <div id="id__oqfqs22kv1" role="group" aria-label="9 replies, 11 reposts, 224 likes, 10 bookmarks, 10301 views"> <p>Sony pulling back on PC outside of live-service games like <em>Marathon</em> and <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering</em> would fly in the face of recent conventional wisdom, which states that as development budgets balloon, publishers need to sell their games wherever they can in order to claw back as much sales revenue as possible. While ditching exclusives altogether might be lethal to a very lucrative PS5 console business, a hybrid approach like delayed ports coming to PC seemed like a smart way for the company to have its cake and eat it too.</p> <p>Has the strategy been successful though? Sony’s latest <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/110045/sony-has-made-at-least-dollars2-3-billion-selling-first-party-games-on-pc-and-xbox/index.html">earnings report</a> pointed to $2.37 billion in sales revenue from games on PC and Xbox. While that number is dominated by the success of live-service franchises like <em>Helldivers 2</em> and <em>MLB The Show</em>, it also includes over a million unit sales across recent ports like<em> Spider-Man 2</em> and <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>. How much added revenue is enough to offset the costs of porting the games and any potential PS5 momentum that gets sacrificed from PC players who just wait instead of buying a console (and don’t forget Valve’s 30 percent cut of Steam sales)?</p> <p>Here’s what PlayStation Studios boss Hermen Hulst told investors last year. “It’s important to realize that we’re really thoughtful about bringing our franchises off console to reach new audiences and that we’re taking a very measured, very deliberate approach in doing that,” he said. “Particularly on the single-player side, our tentpole titles, they’re such a point of differentiation for the PlayStation console.”</p> <h2>The case for not bringing<em> Wolverine</em> to Steam</h2> <p>Perhaps the last few years of data suggests the trade-off isn’t as worth it as Sony once hoped it would be. It could also be that the cinematic, story-driven blockbusters PlayStation Studios have become synonymous with just aren’t the types of games may PC players are very interested in, especially a year after launch hype has died down and with very little marketing.</p> <p>The genres that routinely blow up on Steam, from roguelikes with complex systems to hardcore soulslikes with unforgiving mechanics, are not the ones Sony is known for. Maybe that explains why <a href="https://alineaanalytics.com/blog/stellar_blade/"><em>Stellar Blade</em> sold a million copies</a> on Steam in just three days where games like<em> God of War Ragnarök</em> have struggled (the occasional <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-steam-framerate-network-login-1851654888">busted port doesn’t help either</a>).</p> <p>Better to get those PC players who actually want to play Naughty Dog’s <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em> to just go out and buy a PS5 (or a PS6) instead. If the current console generation has proven anything for Sony, it’s that it’s easier to make money off of existing diehard fans than try to rope in new ones.</p> </div> </article> </div>

              <p>Do you like <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers 2</em>,</a> but wish its gameplay loop of dropping into a hostile environment solo or with buddies, completing some side objectives, a main mission, and then escaping by holding back waves of enemies and extracting via vehicle was a bit more chill? Maybe a bit more cowboy-themed, too? Well, one of the most popular demos out now as part of <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-next-fest-best-demos-free-seth-mythmatch-2000673268">Steam’s Next Fest</a>, for a game called <em>Far Far West,</em> makes it seem like exactly the game you’ve been wanting.</p>

 <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3819240/Far_Far_West_Demo/"><em>Far Far West</em> is from the indie devs at Evil Raptor,</a> the same small team behind the excellent <a href="https://kotaku.com/pumpkin-jack-is-colorful-halloween-action-game-1845056040"><em>Pumpkin Jack</em></a> and the good-if-a-bit-flawed <em>Akimbot</em>. Unlike those single-player action platformers, however, the studio’s next game is a co-op (or solo) mission-based first-person <em>Helldivers</em>-like robot cowboy adventure. And folks, it’s a blast to play even in this unfinished demo stage.</p>  <p>The basic gameplay loop of <em>Far Far Wes</em>t has you and up to three other players hopping into a large western-themed map to complete small side objectives and open-world activities before deciding to take on the map’s boss in a big final fight. Each run rewards you with a few different currenices and XP, letting you upgrade your rifles, pistols, and magic spells (robot magic!), and equip joker cards that offer bonus abilities and special traits. I found one card that let me do extra damage when I was low on health. Useful! Another card would sometimes make headshots spit out confetti. Useless, but very funny!</p> <p>Like <em>Helldivers</em>, you can explore the entire map and complete everything, or just go straight to the big finale mission and then (hopefully) escape alive via a hover train.</p>

 <p>This is a very rewarding loop, but that alone doesn’t make<em> Far, Far West</em> worth playing. The actual reason I enjoyed the demo so much was how well it plays. Guns feel both snappy and hefty in a way that makes blasting away skeleton armies a blast. I also really loved how movement feels in <em>Far, Far West</em>, with its air dashes and big jumps. You also have a horse you can ride whenever you want, which makes it easy to get across empty sections of the world.</p>

 <p>The magic spells, while a bit odd in this cowboy sci-fi world, add an extra layer of depth to the combat. The acid spell doesn’t just spit out damage-dealing green goo; you (or your buddies) can shoot a fireball at the puddles and blow it all up, and any enemies nearby along with it.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000674577" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674577"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674577">© Evil Raptor / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Between missions, you return to a little Wild West-themed town, complete with a saloon, sheriff’s office, and a few different vendors and shops that let you upgrade your gear, guns, and abilities using the resources you collect from missions. There’s also a shooting range where you can try out new guns or upgrades, something I’d love to see in <em>Helldivers 2</em>, actually.</p>

 <p>The vibes in town, like in the missions, are a bit more laid back, at least on lower difficulties, compared to those in <em>Helldivers 2</em>. You don’t die as fast. Enemies don’t hit as hard. It’s a bit easier to stick around and fight, even if you make mistakes. But be warned: If you crank up the challenge, <em>Far Far West</em> will slap you down quickly and teach you a lesson.</p> <p>I’m excited to play the full game when it launches sometime later this year in early access. I also hope it gets a console port, as I know my friend group that plays primarily on console would sink hours and hours into <em>Far Far West.</em></p>

              <p><span>Leon Kennedy has become known for many things over the course of the </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>series, including his stylish fighting style, good looks, and the fact that he cannot shut the fuck up in even the most dire of circumstances.</span></p> <p><span>The Raccoon City cop turned anti-bioterrorism agent loves to crack wise even when a zombie’s got its teeth at his neck, and my guy does not let up on that in </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span>.
