              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175"><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em></a> is singlehandedly saving August 2025 from being a sleeper month for Game Pass. The stealth blockbuster arrives alongside some smaller games in a surprisingly good month for the Xbox subscription service’s cheaper tier. If you’ve only been subscribed to Game Pass Standard, some of the year’s best games are about to fall into your lap.</p> <p>Here’s the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/05/xbox-game-pass-august-2025-wave-1/">full schedule</a> for Game Pass games arriving in the first half of August 2025:</p> <blockquote><p><em><strong>Rain World</strong></em>&nbsp;(Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, Game Pass Standard) – August 5<br> <em><strong>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</strong></em> (Game Pass Standard) – August 6<br> <em><strong>Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders</strong></em> (Game Pass Standard)&nbsp;– August 6<br> <em><strong>MechWarrior 5: Clans</strong></em> (Game Pass Standard)&nbsp;– August 6<br> <em><strong>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap</strong></em>&nbsp;(Game Pass Standard) – August 6<br> <em><strong>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</strong></em>&nbsp;(Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass) – August 7<br> <em><strong>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</strong></em>&nbsp;(Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass) – August 12<br> <em><strong>9 Kings</strong></em>&nbsp;(Game Preview, PC-only) (Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass) – August 14</p></blockquote> <p><em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em> is a decent return to more old-school stealthing with a bit less of the modern-day RPG bloat that’s come to define the recent open-world entries in the series like <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>. Meanwhile, <em>9 Kings</em> is a neat, top-down strategy roguelike that came to Steam Early Access back in May. Then there’s <em>Aliens: Fireteam Elite</em>, a good-enough co-op shooter that arrives back on Game Pass after leaving the service years ago.</p>

 <p>The real winners this month, however, are Game Pass Standard subscribers. <em>MechWarrior 5: Clans</em> is one of 2024’s more overlooked gems, nailing the in-universe mood and storytelling and backing it up with solid action and mech customization. <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em> and <em>Lonely Mountains: Snow Riders</em>, both out earlier this year, are strong GOTY runnerups. Folks on the cheaper Game Pass tier should be eating well for a bit, even as August is a quieter month overall for paying Ultimate customers on console. The arrival of <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> later in the month should offset the current doldrums for them, though.</p> <p>Sadly, August 15 is also when <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> finally leaves Game Pass. Good luck finishing it by then if you haven’t already!</p>
