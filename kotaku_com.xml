            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What is DeAndre “SouljaBoy” Cortez up to these days? I’m not sure anyone’s asking that in the Year of our Lord 2025, but if they were the answer would probably surprise them. According to his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DQlFjCpgLDq/">latest post on Instagram</a>, the rapper behind the 2007 hit “Crank That (Soulja Boy)” is once again trying to hawk someone else’s retro handhelds under his own own made-up brand.</p> <p>SouljaGame Flip appears to just be a Retroid Pocket Flip 2, except that it costs more than double ($435 vs $210) and will be shipped to you from some other warehouse. “Not a single gamer buying this. Especially at that price,” one person earnestly responded on Instagram. “Play some games on it. Where’s the gameplay? Is it an emulator??? Rather get a Steam Deck for less that does more.”</p>

 <p>The Instagram post promoting the scalper performance art was spotted by<em> Retro Dodo</em> <a href="https://retrododo.com/souljaboy-reveals-new-handhelds-exact-clones-of-retroids/">which proceeded</a> to ask the company that makes Retroid about it. “I didn’t know about this,” a representative told the site. “This is not any kind of official licensing deal. He does not have permission to rebrand our products and sell them as his own. The Retroid Pocket Flip 2 is patented in the U.S by ourselves.”</p>   <p>This is far from the first time that Soulja Boy has pulled this stunt. In 2018 he started flipping other <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/soulja-boy-new-console-appears-to-have-stolen-games/">Chinese-made retro emulation devices</a>, only for some of them to come installed with ROMs for Nintendo games. The infamously litigious Mario maker did not take it well. He claimed Nintendo wouldn’t sue. “I had to boss up, I didn’t have a choice,” he <a href="https://x.com/souljaboy/status/1079141002198347782">posted on X</a> after being threatened.</p>

 <p>But that hasn’t stopped him from returning every couple of years with a new fake Soulja Boy handheld. In 2022, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUEntvOmk70&amp;t=293s">he was pushing</a> another stolen Game Boy knockoff. The retro handheld market has only gotten bigger in the years since. That makes getting in on the action more lucrative than ever, but also more likely to get called out.</p> <p>“[Soulja Boy] has been rebranding consoles before Xbox did with the ROG Ally X,” wrote one person on Instagram.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-loot-hack-cheat-embark-studios-2000640831</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Few things are worse in <i>Arc Raiders</i> than a crushing defeat that sees you lose some of your best gear. Losing it fair and square is all part of the compelling, sometimes heartbreaking push-and-pull of the genre, but some players in <i>Arc Raiders </i>have lost their hard-earned gear due to encounters with cheaters. Fortunately, developer Embark Studios is keeping an eye on <i>how</i> you died in a match and, if it’s determined it was the result of cheating, you’ll get your stuff back.</p> <p>As folks are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1olbx4i/i_didnt_know_we_get_refunded_is_someone_cheats_o/">sharing on Reddit</a> (<a href="https://gamerant.com/arc-raiders-cheaters-unfair-play-items-stolen-refund/">h/t <i>The Gamer</i></a>), <i>Arc Raiders</i> is happy to step in and return your loot if the game detects any cheating was at work. “Your items were lost due to unfair play, but we managed to get them back for you!” reads an example of the prompt rewarding players with their ill-received losses. “We’re committed to building an environment where gameplay is about skill, teamwork, and fun, not unfair advantages.”</p>

   <p>Preventing cheaters has been a complex struggle in online games, especially on PC, where many developers are choosing to implement aggressive anti-cheat features that demand excessive control over your machine. As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1olbx4i/comment/nmgy4l6/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one Redditor put it</a>, “fighting cheaters will unfortunately always be an uphill and reactionary battle, unless the game goes full invasive mode and acts like a computer virus having more access than it should and we all know no one wants that.”</p>

 <p>That said, cheating doesn’t appear to be a rampant problem in <i>Arc Raiders</i> right now. As more and more folks chime in on the thread documenting <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ item refund policy, few of them mention having actually encountered cheating in-game themselves. I myself have invested just under 50 hours in the game so far and haven’t seen too many shenanigans.</p> <p>Now, Embark, if you’re willing to refund me that really nice Vulcano I lost because of a pair of aggressive Hornets, that’d be real swell. I hope whoever found that gun is enjoying themselves. So happy for you.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-data-confirms-smallest-maps-franchise-ea-fps-bf1-2000640803</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-data-reveals-how-small-its-maps-are-compared-to-past-games.1342312/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Since <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s beta, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-season-one-small-map-battle-royale-reactions-negative-review-ea-2000639948">fans have complained</a> that EA’s online FPS has smaller maps than those found in previous entries. And when the game finally launched last month, these complaints only grew as it became clear that <em>BF6</em> still lacked truly giant battlegrounds. Now, a fan has crunched the numbers and done the hard work to accurately compare the maps here to past maps from the main series and confirmed that, yeah, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379">Battlefield 6′</a>s</em> collection of maps is the smallest.</p> <p>On November 2, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1omver9/updated_battlefield_maps_from_bf3_bf4_bfhl_bfmaps-in-the-series/">Reddit user ClaratheRed posted an image</a> showing a visual size comparison of some of the many maps from <em>Battlefield 3, 4, BF1, Hardline, 2042</em>, and the recently released <em>BF6</em>. (<a href="https://imgur.com/bV0bq9m">Higher res version here</a>.) And a quick glance confirms what many fans have complained about since launch: <em>Battlefield’s</em> largest maps are pretty small when compared to some of the truly giant warzones found in past games.</p>

   <p>In fact, according to ClaratheRed’s data, <em>BF6</em>‘s largest map is Operation Firestorm, which is ironically a remake of a <em>Battlefield 3</em> map. And even <em>BF6</em>‘s largest map doesn’t crack the top 30 biggest maps in <em>Battlefield</em> history. Meanwhile, most of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-new-map-is-very-bad-2000639647"><em>BF6</em>‘s other maps</a> are actually some of the smallest according to ClaratheRed’s data. Keep in mind, though, that this comparison post doesn’t seem to include games released before <em>BF3</em>, and doesn’t include <em>BFV</em>, so, it’s not a perfect, all-encompassing data set. Still, even with that caveat, ClaratheRed’s data is interesting and revealing. (They also showed their work, which leads me to believe this data is, if not 100 percent accurate, close enough.)</p> <p>The reality is that, yeah, <em>Battlefield 6′</em>s maps are, generally speaking, some of the smallest maps in the game’s history.<a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1985317825490153604"> One of <em>BF6</em>‘s maps, Saints’ Quarters, is actually the second-smallest map according to this data</a>. So if you wanted proof that <em>BF6</em>‘s maps are small, here you go. You can share this link and the Reddit post with friends to settle debates or win some internet arguments. And while the game’s smaller maps aren’t stopping me from enjoying it, I do miss the truly giant locations found in past games and hope they return in a future season.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Ever since </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>players found out the rare, alternate-colored monsters known as “shiny” Pokémon </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shiny-hunting-despawn-sound-effect-2000636142"><span>don’t despawn in this game</span></a><span>, the shiny hunting meta has been rapidly evolving to take advantage of this new change. Some players devised ways early on to farm these rare spawns </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-shiny-despawn-afk-exploit-wild-zone-2000636610"><span>without touching their controller</span></a><span>, and now that many players have reached the post-game, some have concocted a method to hunt not only shiny Pokémon, but also the large, powerful, aggressive Alpha Pokémon that are also rare spawns in the game’s world.</span></p> <p><span>This method seems so busted, I wouldn’t be surprised if Game Freak patched it out in a future update, but for the moment, players have a really elaborate way of hunting up to six shiny Alpha Pokémon at a time if they’ve seen the credits (the real credits, not </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-credits-npc-dialogue-school-kid-2000638839"><span>the fake ones</span></a><span>). YouTuber Austin John Plays demonstrates the elaborate but effective strategy, which requires you to mess around with and essentially break the Alpha Pokemon in Wild Zone 20’s spawn area so you can trick the game into bringing out more monsters in the area than it’s supposed to. The full method requires you to aggro the Alphas in Wild Zone 20 until they’re near the edge of the fenced-off area. By leaving the zone while these Pokémon are near the edge of it, you’ll make their spawn area essentially reset to the position they were in when you left, meaning the game will trigger </span><i><span>new </span></i><span>Alpha spawns in the center of the zone. If you do this successfully enough times without dying, you can get several Alphas spawning in the zone, and because shiny Pokémon won’t despawn, you can enter, exit, or reset the area by resting on a bench until all six spawned Alphas are shiny.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The whole thing is pretty complicated and requires some precise positioning and saving, but it seems to work. Check out Austin John Plays’ tutorial below:</span></p>  <p><span>I’m always amazed by the commitment shiny hunters bring to breaking the game to find these guys. So far, I’ve stumbled upon two shinies during my playthrough without looking for them, which is more than I typically find in these games. Both the </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> games have made spotting shinies easier by adding a visual and audio indicator when one is in the overworld, so I’ve gotten two in both </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Arceus</span></i><span> without even trying.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/a-surprise-departure-shows-the-problem-with-the-game-pass-backlog-2000640806</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-surprise-departure-shows-the-problem-with-the-game-pass-%E2%80%98backlog%E2%80%99.1342267/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are two major knocks against Game Pass these days. The first is the new $30 price point for access to day-one releases. The second is the fact that you’re basically just renting and don’t actually own any of the games you play. The surprise departure of <a href="https://kotaku.com/stalker-2-review-buggy-janky-impressions-xbox-pc-fps-1851705232"><em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em></a> in November really drives that home.</p> <p>Subscribers noticed a new notification this month that the post-apocalyptic immersive sim will be part of the batch of games leaving the Netflix-like service in the weeks ahead. The others include <em>Football Manager 2024</em>, <em>Blacksmith Master</em>, and <em>Frostpunk</em>. What caught some players by surprise is just how brief <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em>‘s tour on Game Pass has been. The game only released a year ago and has still been receiving <a href="https://support.stalker2.com/hc/en-us/articles/39316885098257-Update-1-6-Night-of-the-Hunter-is-live">substantial updates</a> to improve performance and fix bugs. Some people no doubt expected they had more time to go back and finish the grueling but rewarding shooter.</p>

 <p>“I think it’s a really bad precedent that a game stays shorter in Game Pass than we had to wait for it to launch, beyond waiting MONTHS to become properly playable patch after patch,” one player wrote in <a href="https://x.com/ZakkenKloot/status/1984925333204689052">a thread on X</a> that gained traction over the weekend. “The game hits PS5 before it even leaves Game Pass.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">STALKER 2 got announced in 2020 at the Xbox Showcase in August.</p> <p>STALKER 2 took 4 years to develop beyond announcement and officially dropped in November 2024.</p> <p>STALKER 2 will leave Xbox Game Pass in November 2025.</p> <p>I think it’s a really bad precedent that a game stays shorter in… <a href="https://t.co/TZg486uoeg">https://t.co/TZg486uoeg</a></p> <p>— Kloot (@ZakkenKloot) <a href="https://twitter.com/ZakkenKloot/status/1984925333204689052?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The sentiment was echoed on the Game Pass subreddit. “It’s really frustrating seeing Stalker 2 leave Gamepass,” a player there <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XboxGamePass/comments/1omcjg9/stalker_2_leaving_game_pass/">wrote</a>. “Game is still a buggy mess, so for those who were waiting on this game to be patched, I guess we’re screwed. lol.” Others argued that no one is “screwed” because you can still go and buy the game at any time, but it does cut against some of the perceived value of Game Pass.</p>

 <p><em>Payday 3</em> was a more <a href="https://kotaku.com/payday-3-starbreeze-flop-ceo-removed-fired-low-sales-1851329780">egregious example of this day-one issue</a>. The launch was a mess, lots of things were broken, and lots of fans went back to playing <em>Payday 2</em> until the sequel improved. But the day-one Game Pass release only stayed on the service for a year. Anyone who bounced off during that early window only to come back closer to its departure might have felt like they were getting a raw deal.</p>

 <p>This is the double-edged sword of the value proposition at the center of Game Pass. One the one hand it’s a massive buffet where power-users can super-sample tons of great games to their heart’s content, from blockbusters like <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> to small indie games like <em>Minami Lane</em>. If you spend a lot of time playing lots of different games each week, you can actually get&nbsp;<em>more</em> than your money’s worth out of Game Pass.</p>

 <h2>Game Pass’ airline economy problem</h2> <p>But if you actually want to finish a lot of games, or play certain ones more deeply, it doesn’t always make a lot of sense. <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em> is a good example. It can take 40 hours just to beat, or around 70 hours if you finish all of the side content. There’s a lot of trial and error and un-directed exploration. It’s great for getting lost in, but not for trying to breeze through on your way to other parts of the Game Pass library. It’s a perfect candidate for that backlog game you forget about until it’s not longer on Game Pass. If you’re only playing a couple of games a month, you’re better off buying them outright than renting them for a limited time.</p>

 <p>NYU business professor Joost van Dreunen recently called this Game Pass’ “<a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/p/game-pass-or-fail">airline economics in reverse</a>” problem. “On Game Pass, every user effectively flies business class while paying economy prices, creating an inherently margin-thin model in which heavy users consume disproportionate resources without proportional revenue,” he wrote. Basically, anyone who&nbsp;<em>did</em> spend months finishing <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2&nbsp;</em>via Game Pass is just subsidizing the cost of the service for everyone who samples dozens of new games each year. The recent price hike is one way of rebalancing that math, Dreuen argues.</p> <p>Put another way, Game Pass gets way too many <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1ljaff3/day_one_gamepass_additions_for_2025/">day-one releases every year</a> for any regular person to actually finish most of them. It’s a service for people who like to graze and keep trying new things, not people actually intent on clearing stuff from their backlogs. Anyone who leans closer to the completionist camp should be buying their games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Surely by now you’ve heard it all: <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-alarmo-nintendo-alarm-clock-hack-modder-usb-id-pc-1851690005"><i>Doom</i> running on an alarm clock</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-running-inside-fortnite-uefn-how-epic-twitter-fps-1851585177">inside <i>Fortnite</i></a>, on <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-running-on-pdf-weird-port-id-software-fps-pc-mod-1851739634">a simple PDF</a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/it-runs-doom-cells-bacteria-1851212417">even on human bacteria</a>. It seems like <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-weirdest-ports-keyboard-atm-calculator-tractor-pc-1850726374"><i>Doom</i> can run on anything</a>. But what about running <i>Doom</i> on a satellite orbiting the planet while also using images of the Earth taken by the very satellite running the game for the game’s backdrops? Well, some very clever folks managed to pull off that very thing.</p> <p>Ubuntu Summit is a yearly gathering of Linux professionals and enthusiasts where folks show off cool stuff they’re doing with one of the most popular Linux desktop distributions out there. This year, programmer Ólafur Waage dove into how a bunch of clever folks not only got <i>Doom</i> running on an orbital satellite last year, but also how they were able to replace the game’s background image of the terrain and skies of Hell with photos of Earth taken by the satellite (<a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/doom-can-run-just-about-anywhere-including-space-hacker-recounts-tale-of-running-the-game-on-an-orbiting-satellite">h/t <i>Tom’s Hardware</i></a>). It was no easy feat, but it resulted in a new frontier for <i>Doom</i> ports. Check out Waage’s presentation of <i>Doom</i> in space during the summit <a href="https://youtu.be/bEEamxJ60aI?t=2746">here (starting at 46:00 or so)</a>.</p>

  <p>While he was working on a project to get <i>Doom</i> running in C++ as opposed to its original programming language, C, Waage was contacted by Georges Labrèche, a spacecraft operations engineer at the European Space Agency, about the prospect of running <i>Doom</i> on the ESA’s OP-SAT satellite.</p>

 <p>OP-SAT presented an excellent opportunity for the ESA, as an experimental platform for unique tests on a device orbiting the Earth made out of (mostly) off-the-shelf computer parts and housed in a device not much larger than a suitcase.</p> <p>After getting <i>Doom</i> to run without graphical output, as proof it could be done, the team was not only able to get actual graphics running with the game in software rendering mode, but it was also able to swap out <i>Doom</i>’s fictional skybox with real images of the Earth, processed by a machine learning algorithm to adapt to <i>Doom</i>’s strict palette limit of 256 colors. The team had to tweak the color palette a bit to allow for more than <i>Doom</i> usually does, but the results worked. Not only did <i>Doom</i> run in space, but it ran in space while using a skybox featuring images taken by the very satellite it was running on.</p> <p>So yes, <i>Doom</i> has run on everything and everywhere, including a satellite in space.</p>
