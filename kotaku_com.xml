              <p>I know what you were thinking: You were tentatively looking forward to April 3’s <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>, but you just weren’t convinced it was going to feature your all-time favorite character, R.O.B. the Robot. Well break out the ticket purchases, because as Nintendo attempts to throw every last scrap of shit at the wall, ol’ Robby’s going to be in there too. A fact that has been leaked by his teensy appearance in a forthcoming tie-in toy set.</p> <p>A whole bunch of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> merch has been announced just recently, due to go on sale in the first week of April. There’s a six-inch <a href="https://nerdist.com/article/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-hatchin-yoshi-toy-exclusive-reveal/">Yoshi egg complete with chatty Yoshi inside</a>, already <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/toys/fashion-and-dolls/interactive-pets/nintendo-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-hatchin-yoshi-interactive-toy-egg/p/254238">up for pre-order in the UK</a> at an eye-watering £60 ($81), alongside <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/toys/action-figures-and-playsets/mario-figures-and-playsets/nintendo-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-deluxe-bowser-castle-playset/p/252460">a Bowser Castle Playset</a> and <a href="https://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/toys/action-figures-and-playsets/mario-figures-and-playsets/nintendo-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-mario-with-star-launcher-set/p/254896001">star-shaped launchers</a> that kwa-ping characters into your eye.</p>

  <p>But hidden among all these reveals (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/animation-movies/after-old-spice-and-pillsbury-cookie-leaks-a-deep-cut-super-mario-galaxy-movie-cameo-has-been-revealed-by-toy-packaging/"><em>Total Film</em></a>) appears one certain robot. We found an even clearer image in a YouTube review of the Super Mario Galaxy Movie Jakks Gateway Galaxy Playset:</p>  <p>R.O.B. (Robotic Operating Buddy) originally appeared as a peripheral toy for the NES in 1985. The character then sporadically popped up as a deep dive in various games, first showing his metal face in&nbsp;<em>Super Mario RPG: Legend of the Seven Stars</em> in 1996, popping up in various&nbsp;<em>WarioWare</em> games, and most notably being a playable character in&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart DS </em>and <em>Super Smash Bros. </em>titles. However, somewhat pertinently, he didn’t make an appearance in <em>Super Mario Galaxy.</em></p>

 <p>R.O.B.’s inclusion does rather lean in to the notion that this&nbsp;<em>Mario Galaxy</em> movie is going to be less an epic tale told in the specific video games’ universe, and more another attempt to just cram in as many&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> references as possible for the nostalgic nerds and hope the bright colors keep the kiddies happy. The trailers so far have failed to suggest any form of cogent plot, but rather just bombarding us with nods to familiar aspects of the franchise, with a lot of focus on <em>Super Mario Odyssey.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[One Switch Emulation Dev Is Fighting Back Against Nintendo’s New Takedowns: ‘We Want To Keep Continuing The Work In The Preservation Of Video Games’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-emulator-eden-nintendo-legal-takedown-2000669430</link>
            <guid>1437331</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Nintendo’s fired off a new volley of legal notices against the <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-piracy-brick-threat-homebrew-1851779895">Switch emulation scene</a>. Close to a dozen GitHub pages were hit with DMCA takedown requests over the weekend. However, while several of the Nintendo Switch GitHub pages have given in to Nintendo’s demands, the development team behind the Eden emulator has boldly refused. Instead, they proceed with publishing a new v0.2.0 build of the Eden Switch emulator on GitHub just days later.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>You may remember that, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-android-zelda-totk-piracy-1851662440"><span>back in 2024</span></a><span>, Yuzu and Ryujinx, the two most well-known Switch emulators, were subject to legal takedown notices from Nintendo <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-lawsuit-settled-1851306441">following a massive million dollar settlement</a>. Nintendo’s crackdown on the Switch emulation scene scattered homebrew efforts to various, less easily accessed corners of the internet. But the cat and mouse game has continued over the years, and Nintendo is once again trying to prune back grassroots efforts to reverse-engineer <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-earnings-switch-2-sales-nintendo-metroid-prime-4-2000665326">its most popular console ever</a>.</span></p>

 <p><span>You could argue that, technically, the majority of these emulators aren’t exactly new, as almost all of them are forks (an offshoot of the existing codebase) of either Yuzu or Ryujinx. In the case of Eden, this is true, as the Nintendo Switch emulator is a fork of Yuzu. In spite of this, Eden’s development team seems relatively un-phased by Nintendo’s latest wave of DMCA notices. The project’s founder isn’t being shy about the team plan to fight back against the company’s latest legal offensive.</span></p>   <p><span>In a statement to </span><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-once-again-brings-dmca-hammer-down-switch-emulators/"><i><span>Wccftech</span></i></a><span>, Eden founder Camille LaVey revealed that they believe the emulator’s GitHub page isn’t breaking any of the website’s hosting policies: “Effectively, as founder of Eden, I can say that we want to keep continuing the work in the preservation of videogames, allowing game owners to benefit from this beyond their original hardware. Since this is a community-driven project, we always look to provide the best result possible for all; yet, we’re never sure of what the future can bring, so we’re always trying to ask the community to help us in any way they can, so Eden can still be alive for the years to come.”</span></p>

 <p><span>As of writing, Eden’s GitHub page is still up, even though GitHub clearly states that pages issued with DMCA notices have roughly “1 business day to make requested changes” before being removed. Tied with LaVey’s statement to </span><i><span>Wccftech</span></i><span>, this likely means that the Eden team has issued a counter notice against Nintendo.</span></p>

 <p>Even if Eden’s stand is short-lived, emulation enthusiasts are adamant that Nintendo’s crusade will never be able to completely eradicate Switch emulation from the internet. “If they kill one, 10 more will pop up,” wrote one commenter on the Android emulation subreddit. “Kill 10, 100 more will pop up. They can never kill emulation.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The ROG Xbox Ally X Price Shoots Up Nearly $200 In Japan]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-price-japan-pc-handheld-2000669424</link>
            <guid>1437289</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The ROG Xbox Ally X is one of the premier PC gaming handhelds currently on the market. Despite some half-baked UI tweaks and finnicky Windows holdovers, it’s an <a href="https://kotaku.com/rog-xbox-ally-x-review-performance-issues-steam-deck-switch-2-2000635652">excellent way to play PC games on the go</a>, for existing Xbox and Game Pass users. The only problem when it launched last fall was the $1,000 price tag. And in Japan at least, that’s just gone up even higher.</p> <p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/newsjp/rog-xbox-ally-x-20260216-421609/"><em>Automaton</em> reports</a> that Asus has raised the price of the ROG Xbox Ally X in Japan from 139,800 yen tax included ($911)&nbsp; to 169,800 yen tax included ($1,107). That’s a jump of 30,000 yen or almost $200 at the current exchange rate. Notably, the price hasn’t been chanced on Microsoft’s website in Japan, though its listing for the ROG Xbox Ally X then sends users to the Asus page with the new price.</p>

 <p>Interestingly, the base ROG Xbox Ally price has remained the same. That price is still listed at 89,800 yen, or roughly $585. One obvious reason for the discrepancy is that the regular Xbox Ally has 16GB of LPDDR5-6400 memory compared to 24GB of LPDDR5X-8000 in the Xbox Ally X. As RAM prices spike amid the ongoing shortage, the Ally X is going to be much more susceptible to the pricing volatility.</p> <p>Asus <a href="https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448">was one of the first PC gaming manufacturers</a> to tell its partners at the start of 2026 that some prices would be going up as AI “hyperscaler” companies race to acquire available memory supply to build out data centers. At the time, nothing was mentioned specifically about the Xbox Ally X handhelds. While it’s unclear just how many Asus has sold, it promised consumers late last year that it <a href="https://www.asus.com/event/Investor/Content/attachment_en/2025Q3%20IR.pdf">was ramping up production</a> to meet higher demand than originally expected.</p>

 <p>A similar issue is facing every other hardware manufacturer in the gaming space. Valve already delayed announcing the price of the Steam Machine as it evaluates the rapidly changing economic conditions, and its existing Steam Deck, a much cheaper competitor to the Xbox Ally X, has quickly become impossible to buy. Sony is reportedly considering delaying the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-delay-memory-price-ai-switch-2-2000669410">launch of the PS6</a>, Nintendo is looking at having to hike the <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-tariff-ai-ram-stock-price-2000661382">price of the Switch 2</a>, and god help you if your PC is at the end of its life and you need to <a href="https://kotaku.com/pc-gamers-are-dumpster-diving-for-ram-because-prices-keep-skyrocketing-2000667727">buy or build a new one</a>.</p>

              <p>When McDonald’s PR tipped me off that there would be an announcement today regarding the fast food chain and a trading card game, I assumed we were being prepared for the announcement of 2026’s annual <em>Pokémon</em> tie-in, when the entire planet <a href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-pokemon-tcg-happy-meal-chaos-2000616843">loses its collective mind</a> buying Happy Meals just to get the packs of cards. But no, these are literally McDonald’s trading cards, with a set of 24 to collect including the “beloved” Ronald McDonald.</p> <p>It’s set to launch in the UK on March 17, and we’ve chased up to find out when the equivalent is happening in the U.S. <strong>Update: We’ve just found out it won’t be coming to the U.S.!</strong> The cards feature all your favorite McDonald’s characters, like Grimace, and wait what, a sentient stool called “Cheeseburger Chair,” and, oh god, Fry Girl, who appears to be a <em>ball</em> of fries with legs and eyes. This is truly cursed stuff. She’s wearing shoes. Why is she wearing shoes? Apparently this is something to do with a 1972 campaign called Fry Kids, who were originally collectively known as “French Fry Gobblins” and seem to have popped up here and there throughout the decades.</p>

 <p>Other cards glimpsed in photos from this weekend’s London Card Show show the non-sentient Multimixer, which appears to be a milkshake dispenser, and an iconic Milkshape Dip, showing a french fry being dunked into a milkshake. And respect for that. Thankfully neither has eyes or any sense of self-awareness ahead of their being consumed, but good lord, find me the person who’s going to be excited about pulling a card showing a drink distribution system.</p> <p>An enigmatic “trailer” <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reels/DUtKkY_AYfm/">on Instagram</a> shows a teasing hint of what looks to be a foil reverse of a card featuring the M logo and absolutely nothing else. It declares this to be “A new game from The M Universe,” which is not a reality I’d previously been aware of. We’re also promised that one card will feature Pennywise’s more sinister cousin, Ronald McDonald, which we’re told will “stand out.” This is described as “the return of Ronald McDonald,” and I’ll confess I didn’t know he’d been away. Although perhaps this is some sort of day-release scheme? I imagine the card would cut off before it showed any tags on his ankles.</p>

 <p>I know the wait is going to be unbearable, but the information concludes that “the brand is keeping a few cards close to its chest, with plenty more to come. So, keep your eyes peeled…” I’m not sure why, but that really reads like a threat.</p>

 <p>The reality is, if McDonald’s has any sense and has this be a complete one-off, these cards are going to <a href="https://kotaku.com/logan-paul-illustrator-pikachu-psa10-auction-pokemon-card-2000669385">be worth a billion-kerjillion bucks</a> in 20 years. Quite how the game aspect of them works is yet to be outlined, but I did read the words “Take it or Flip it game,” and that’s their capitalization. The UK gets to find out next month, and we’ll let you know when Americans can get in on the McD’s TCG action.</p> <p><strong>Updated: 02/16/2026, 10:22 a.m. ET:</strong> Updated the post to add the information that this is to be a UK-only promotion.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The PS6 Launch Could Be Delayed Multiple Years By AI Hyperscalers]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ps6-delay-memory-price-ai-switch-2-2000669410</link>
            <guid>1437199</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Companies across tech are freaking out about the worsening memory chip shortage. It’s already delayed pre-orders for <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-release-date-preorder-ai-valve-2000665802">Valve’s Steam machine</a> and could torch Sony’s planned rollout for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-chip-release-date-backwards-compatibility-ps5-1851648868">upcoming PlayStation 6</a>. The unannounced console was rumored to be arriving in late 2027, but a new report suggests Sony is considering delaying its next hardware generation until 2028 or even 2029.</p> <p>That’s according to <em>Bloomberg</em>, whose latest report on the AI-fueled memory crisis includes two sources familiar with Sony’s “thinking” who claim the console manufacturer is already “considering” pushing its PS6 launch plans back by a year or two. The report claims the delay would have big consequences for the company’s “carefully orchestrated strategy” to transition <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-sales-switch-2-earnings-ghost-yotei-memory-shortage-2000665998">users from PS5 to the upcoming hardware</a>.</p>

 <p>Alleged specs for the PS6 began <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-leak-specs-sony-handheld-price-release-date-2000614206">leaking last summer</a> and suggested Sony was prioritizing trying to keep its hardware affordable even as it ramps up power in a solo console arms race with ever diminishing returns. Speculation was that more moderate spec improvements could keep the PS6 priced at around <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-leak-specs-sony-handheld-price-release-date-2000614206">$400-to-$600 instead of $700-to-$1,000</a>. Sony is also believed to be currently working on a handheld that would be able to play PS5 and some cross-gen PS6 games, potentially scaling down performance to keep up with higher-end blockbusters.</p> <p>Why would a single component price shock delay an entire console generation? In the past, Sony might have released a much more expensive machine to compensate. But in recent years as the total footprint of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-sales-inflation-economy-2000654196">console gaming market has plateaued</a>, companies have faced pressure to be more aggressive on price to compete with free-to-play ecosystems that are still thriving on old hardware and weaker devices like smartphones. Sony actually ended up winning the recent holiday sales quarter against the newly released Switch 2 in part by slashing the price of PS5 with big Black Friday discounts.</p>

 <p>Speaking of the Switch 2, whether Nintendo will be forced to raise the price of its new console is another big question posed by the memory shortage. The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-tariff-ai-ram-stock-price-2000661382">has previously told investors</a> it has inventory and contracts to help it weather volatility in the first half of 2026, but if conditions persist it will have to re-evaluate its pricing strategy with an eye toward balancing profitability with maximizing install base. Bloomberg’s report reiterated that Nintendo is already “contemplating raising the price” of the Switch 2 this year.</p>
