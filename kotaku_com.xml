              <p>Having all your games in one place is not as impossible as it might seem. But with modern games pushing 100GB or more, the built-in storage on the Xbox Series X or S just doesn’t go far. The easiest way to boost your storage capacity is by getting your hands on a dedicated expansion card like this one from Seagate.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4557/">The massive 4TB version is now 24% off on Amazon, bringing the price down to $380</a>. It’s the largest officially licensed Xbox expansion card available on the market, but the deal might not be around for too long. We recommend acting fast to grab yourself one while it’s still live.</p>

<h2>Enough Capacity for All Your Favorite Titles</h2>
<p>This expansion card is built in partnership with Xbox, so you can expect it to match the performance of your console’s internal SSD. Xbox Velocity Architecture support makes for fast load times and sharp graphics without any slowdowns. You can also play the games directly from the card without needing to transfer files back and forth. Simply insert it into the expansion slot on the back of your Xbox Series X or S, and it’s ready to go – literally within minutes.</p>
<p>The 4TB storage capacity is enough to house all your treasured titles across four generations of Xbox consoles. So, whether you’re after the latest releases or still can’t part ways with your Xbox 360 favorites, this card has enough room to keep everything in one place. Quick Resume support lets you jump between several games without losing your progress, both from the internal SSD and the expansion card. The switch is quick and will be especially appreciated by players who rotate between different games. You could be playing as a single player one minute, and then jumping into action with your friends the next!</p>



<p>Next-gen features are also taken care of. Plus, you’re getting a 3-year limited warranty with your purchase for some extra peace of mind. Should there be any issues down the line, you’re covered.</p>
<p>Altogether, this card does not just offer extra storage for your games. It also keeps up with the performance of your console. It’s designed around the Xbox Velocity Architecture, so speeds and output is going to be the same as what you get from your internal SSD. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4557/">It’s now down to $380, which is a $120 discount on the retail price of $500. If 4TB is too much space for you, consider going for the 1TB or 2TB version.</a></p>
