Part of the problem seems to be a lack of experience, leading to a situation where Riot Games had to pay two famous directors $5 million to <em>not </em>make a<em> League of Legends</em> movie. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195369" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Netflix's One Piece Live-Action Trailer Has A Treasure Trove Of Anime Easter Eggs" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="195369,193144,193799" data-current="195369"><div><p>Netflix's One Piece Live-Action Trailer Has A Treasure Trove Of Anime Easter Eggs</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195369/195369_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195369/195369_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195369/195369_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195369/195369_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20838.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/riot-games-arcane-hollywood-netflix-most-expensive-animated-series-ever-1236196655/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/biz/news/riot-games-arcane-hollywood-netflix-most-expensive-animated-series-ever-1236196655/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a new report from <em>Variety </em>about Riot Games</a></span> and its attempts to make <em>League of Legends</em> into the next major Hollywood franchise, it’s revealed that a few years back, the video game studio was working with Anthony and Joe Russo on a <em>League of Legends </em>movie. The Russo brothers are famous for helping guide Marvel’s incredibly successful <em>Avengers </em>sequels, <em>Infinity War</em> and <em>Endgame</em>. </p><p><em>Variety </em>reports that at some point Riot “reconsidered” the creative approach the company was taking with the Russos and it ended up costing the studio a lot of money. Reportedly, the Russo brothers got paid $5 million to walk away from the project due to a badly negotiated contract with the directors.  </p><p>Representatives for the Russos and Riot declined to provide <em>Variety </em>with a comment about the failed movie project. </p><p>Riot co-founder and chief product officer Marc Merril told <em>Variety </em>that the company was still committed to producing TV and movies, but admitted that it was still learning how to do that. </p><p>“Our ambitions in entertainment haven’t changed,” Merrill told <em>Variety</em>. “We were never intending to operate like a traditional studio with traditional timelines. What <em>did</em> change as we learned more was our expectations of ourselves: We realized that getting it right takes a lot more time than we’d originally expected, and so we recalibrated our development, output goals, and teams with that in mind.”</p><p>When <em>Variety</em> asked about the $250 million budget for <em>Arcane</em>’s<em> </em>first two seasons, Merril didn’t confirm the price but added: “We’re more than comfortable with the spend it took to deliver a show that was worthy of our players’ time.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/arcane-season-1-recap-netflix-league-of-legends-1851689099&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/arcane-season-1-recap-netflix-league-of-legends-1851689099">With <em>Arcane</em>’s second season arriving on November 9</a></span>, and it being the end of the show, we’ll have to wait and see if Riot has learned how to keep making TV and movies or if it will be years before the next big project. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The latest is called <em>Bloodborne Top Down Arena</em>, and it’s exactly what it sounds like: a <em>Diablo</em>-style reimagining of the 2015 PlayStation game. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196599,196742" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p> “I haven’t touched <em>Bloodborne Remake</em> for a year for 50 reasons (too big, too risky to finally be C&amp;D),” announced solo developer Maxime Foulquier on Tuesday. “But last week I decided to start a new project from scratch, <em>Bloodborne Top Down Arena</em><strong>.”</strong> A short clip demonstrated the project in action, complete with dodge roll invincibility and gory finishers. </p><p>The fan game doesn’t appear to be playable anywhere yet, though Foulquier said he is looking for volunteer play testers. It’s also not clear if the plan is to recreate the entire map of <em>Bloodborne</em> or just a smaller combat arena that shows off the concept in a more limited form. It certainly sounds more like the latter. </p><p>One thing Foulquier will definitely want to look into doing is changing the name. Another <em>Bloodborne</em> fan project called <em>Bloodborne Kart</em> came to Steam last year but was forced by Sony, which published <em>Bloodborne</em>, to remove the name from its title. As a result <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-nightmare-kart-pc-release-date-sony-1851382182?_gl=1*1lt5ues*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMDkyODM0NC4yOS4xLjE3MzA5Mjk0MjcuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-nightmare-kart-pc-release-date-sony-1851382182?_gl=1*1lt5ues*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMDkyODM0NC4yOS4xLjE3MzA5Mjk0MjcuNjAuMC4w">it’s now called <em>Nightmare Kart</em></a></span>. Presumably, the same will work for <em>Bloodborne Top Down Arena</em>. Maybe it can just be called <em>Hunter Arena</em>. </p><p>While <em>Dark Souls</em>, <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>, and <em>Elden Ring</em> are all widely-acclaimed and very popular, <em>Bloodborne</em> fans are built different and the game retains a special place in PlayStation players’ imagination. It’s never been ported to PC (officially, at least) or even PS5, and it doesn’t sound like a remaster, remake, or sequel is anywhere in the current pipeline at FromSoftware. At least projects like <em>Bloodborne Top Down Arena </em>are continuing to keep the hype alive in the meantime. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
