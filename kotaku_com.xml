              <p>There’s no argument really: offline storage remains far more reliable and personal than spending month after month on cloud subscriptions. With cloud services such as Google Drive at around $10 a month for 2TB each and every month, the expense adds up quickly.</p>
<p>An external hard drive like this Seagate 4TB HDD does away with that problem at one stroke: Right now,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3869/"> it’s an all-time low price on Amazon for $99 instead of its normal $124, so you’re paying just $0.02 per gigabyte for storage for life</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3869/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Drive Is a Smart Buy</h2>
<p>The Seagate hard drive is simple to describe but does all the right things. Behind the scenes, it <strong>relies on a USB 3.0 port which offers fast transfer speeds, and it’s plug‑and‑play</strong> compatible with Windows laptops and desktops as well as Macs. You don’t have to deal with any time-consuming setup or format processes and it allows you to start dragging and dropping files in mere minutes. Beyond computers, it gets along with gaming consoles like Xbox and PlayStation which gives you an easy way of expanding game storage without needing to replace main drives.</p>



<p>With 4TB capacity, you can store years of photos, home videos, your entire music collection and still have plenty to spare for work documents or even entire game collections. For console players, that might translate to over 100 modern games in a single device without having to erase older games constantly as the new ones are added.</p>
<p><strong>And then consider the long-term cost advantage</strong>: Paying around $10 per month for 2TB of online cloud storage (<a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-cloud-storage">check out a guide here</a>) means within twelve months you’ve paid more than this 4TB Seagate drive costs. <strong>With the physical drive, you’re only paying for it once</strong>. And on top of that, you retain full ownership of your files, with no worry about renewal subscriptions, cost hikes, or company closures.</p>
<p>Saving documents offline on a hard drive keeps sensitive data away from online threats: Your private photos, finances, or personal archives aren’t floating around in a cloud storage facility that you don’t fully control with the Seagate hard drive. And if the drive does fail, Seagate offers a one‑year Rescue Data Recovery Service, so you’ve got another safeguard against mishaps or unexpected failure.</p>
<p>Currently selling for $99, this Seagate 4TB external hard drive is one of those deals the more you consider it. If you’re tired of having to keep free plans restricted or raising the cost of subscriptions, paying only $0.02 per GB for lifetime storage is a great opportunity.</p>

              <p>Microsoft is perhaps best known for its Surface <em>Pro</em> tablets which compete directly with the iPad Pro but its Surface laptop line has been the best way to experience Windows at its finest. If what you need is a thin, light notebook with full Windows 11, current AI-capable Copilot capabilities and good performance, this is an extremely tempting option. The most affordable model with Qualcomm’s Snapdragon X Plus processor and 256GB storage has now hit an all-time low cost on Amazon: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4298/">It costs $859, a discount from its initial price of $999</a>, which is fantastic considering it was launched less than a year ago.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4298/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Laptop for the AI Era</h2>
<p>The Surface laptop was designed by Microsoft as part of their <strong>new Copilot+ PC series infused with AI functionality</strong> that brings real-world benefits to routine computing. This model currently on sale at Amazon comes with the Snapdragon X Plus 10-core processor at its core, paired with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. This provides it with a speed where productivity applications and creative burdens are easy, and yet still hold up in terms of power efficiency.</p>



<p>One of the real benefits here is in how the Copilot feature affects everyday life: Recall lets you simply locate documents, e-mails or web pages by backtracking through an activity timeline. With video calls or meetings, Windows Studio Effects powered by Copilot help you declutter your room through noise suppression, better lighting, and a blurred background, which is a lifesaver if meetings extend throughout the day. You <strong>can even read real-time subtitles in 44 languages</strong> while streaming or on a call which makes international communication a seamless process.</p>
<p>Battery life is also a department where this Microsoft laptop takes the lead: With <strong>a 20-hour charge time</strong>, it’s designed to last you all day and more without needing to be plugged in. That’s convenient enough to take with you to work or even on a trip without constantly needing to find plugs to recharge. The paper-thin measurements and 13.8-inch touchscreen screen cap it off, giving you a slim and modern design that still gives you plenty of screen space to do your multitasking. Bright HDR technology ensures clarity whether you’re watching shows.</p>
<p>What also makes this deal noteworthy is how early it comes: The Snapdragon X Plus-based Surface Laptop only entered the market in late 2024, yet we’re already seeing its price dip far below the $1,000 mark.</p>
