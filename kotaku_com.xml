              <p>This year’s Winter Olympics have been some of the coolest to watch, thanks to some talented drone operators providing viewers at home and online with awesome shots of some of the Games’ fastest events.</p> <p>Drones with cameras have been used to record sporting events for over a decade now. <a href="https://youtu.be/wYFdh1w_n6M">But due to a dangerous near-miss incident in 2015</a>, drones have basically been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/24/sports/skiing/drones-banned-at-world-cup-races-after-one-nearly-hits-marcel-hirscher.html">banned from most skiing and snowboarding events for years</a>. However, the tech has come a long way since that moment, and drones are smaller, more reliable, and safer than ever before. So the tech is a big feature of this year’s Winter Olympics presentation on NBC and other affiliated networks. The end results are <a href="https://x.com/nascarcasm/status/2020269499879158039">truly stunning</a> to look at.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The greatest new use of tech for the Olympics is this drone view behind the women’s downhill skiers. The intensity and speed, can’t be grasped from any of the other cameras we’re used to. Excellent.</p> <p>Now give me that in Apple Vision Pro. <a href="https://t.co/EtqgTkeYFq">pic.twitter.com/EtqgTkeYFq</a></p> <p>— Lee Parayno (@leeparayno) <a href="https://twitter.com/leeparayno/status/2020713318475071563?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 9, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>You don’t really understand how fast these athletes are going when you see them from a static camera angle as they rush down a mountain or skate across ice. But when a drone is flying right behind them, keeping up, it provides an incredible new look at these turbo-charged winter sports. Like, look at how fast this snowboarder is flying down the mountain!</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Drone Winter Olympics 🙌 <a href="https://t.co/qTjwMpiNIq">pic.twitter.com/qTjwMpiNIq</a> <a href="https://t.co/aniABheDmR">https://t.co/aniABheDmR</a></p> <p>— Eric Njiru ⚽️ (@EricNjiiru) <a href="https://twitter.com/EricNjiiru/status/2020462950935351803?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Or look at how quickly these speed skaters zip around the ice.</p>   <p>I’ll admit that I was nervous that the drones might cause problems for the athletes, but according to many, they don’t notice the buzzing noise, and as long as they stay safely away, they don’t cause any issues. These drones are also operated by skilled pilots who work alongside a dedicated technician and director to ensure the athletes’ safety while capturing these jaw-dropping views.</p> <p>“When a camera is chasing the athlete down the hill — right in front of them or right behind them — you truly get the sense of how fast they’re going,” <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/olympics/2026/02/09/drones-winter-olympics/">said Michael Sheehan, the coordinating director for NBC’s Olympic coverage</a>. “That’s virtually impossible to capture with a wide shot shooting from the side. The drone coverage takes us to a place we’ve traditionally never been.”</p>

 <p>All I can think about while looking at these clips of drones speeding behind athletes is: I want sports games that look like this, please!</p>

              <p>The trick to most roguelites is your mastery of a particular deck or build. Whether it’s your cast of characters, deck of cards, or collection of spells, progress is gained as much from incremental additions as it is from your increased skill at playing that build. Chances are you’ve dedicated a huge amount of time to one specific build in <em>Slay the Spire</em>, or a preferred range of Jokers in&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, such that next time you head out you’re both better equipped and better acquainted to cope with the familiar path of enemies, challenges and incidents. <em>Mewgenics</em>, the latest game from Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel, responds to this format by saying, “What if we screwed that all up and threw it in the trash?” Oh, and added, “And threw in as much toilet humor as we possibly can?” The result, I’m delighted to report, is really rather impressive.</p> <p><em>Mewgenics</em> (out February 10 on Steam) is a <em>Slay the Spire</em>-style roguelite but with turn-based RPG-like battles played out on a small grid. For each run you take a group of four kitty-cats, each with their own roll of skill numbers, who are then assigned a class before the run begins. You then make your way through an ever-longer series of maps, each with battles, mystery situations, random treasures and boss fights, using your crew of cats and their somewhat randomly assigned sets of abilities, until you’ve figured out how to combine them as an incredibly effective team. Win the fights, defeat the most distant boss, and you’ll return to your home to, oh no, have all four of them (if they lived) retire. They’ll never fight again. All those skills you learned, the ways you figured out how to allow them to buff one another, a particular one-two combo you found to be especially effective? That’s gone now. Time to start over.</p>

 <p>That sounds rough, but the point is, you managed all those things, gained all that ability, on that single run. You can do it again, with four different cats with different skills, and perhaps different classes (you assign cats with specific class-granting collars before you begin, picking from, say, Mage, Thief, Fighter and Hunter, with more collars becoming available the more you play), and find a whole new way for a new crew to come together. Once. Of course, at the same time that you’re still gaining all the knowledge, you’re still getting better at the game, just not perhaps in the way that’s quite so familiar.</p>   <p>You get more cats, by the way, through the magic of nature. After picking two cats from a mad scientist, leaving them alone together overnight can cause—well look, when a mummy cat and daddy cat love each other very much, they fuck and make a baby. And your retired vets (they hate that term) will breed, passing on their genetics to a new generation of battle-cats. So long as you have enough food to feed all the feline inhabitants of your home, you can keep on breeding as many as you wish, then pick four to take with you on your next adventure.</p>

 <p>Cats that are no longer useful to you are, um, given away. Via sewer pipes, to a range of unsavory types who want the cats for…look, it’s best not to ask questions. But give each of these unsavory types enough and they’ll bestow you with useful advantages: a bigger home, more food storage,</p>

 <p>And so it goes on. Play more, reach further, unlock more, play more, reach further, unlock more, in that idyllic cycle that marks the best of this genre. I have no doubt that&nbsp;<em>Mewgenics</em> is going to prove a massive hit, given it delivers in all those incredibly hooky ways while having a fresh approach with its constant new teams. This is made even more impressive by the sheer amount of variety on each run, with different mini-bosses appearing, new enemy types showing up, unique events, completely new sets of spells and skills getting assigned, and indeed brand new songs being performed in the midst of your encounters. Oh yes, it’s kinda a musical too.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000666941" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666941"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666941">© Edmund McMillen, Tyler Glaiel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>However, I do take issue with some of the design. It’s possible to get phenomenally unlucky in ways that seem to undermine the ethos of the game. Random events like the Sandstorm are absolutely ruinous to a run, where every battle sees swirling sand deliver one damage to every character in the battle every round. That sounds innocuous enough, until you’re in a position where your kitties are very low on health, and reviving any who have been knocked out likely only brings them up to one health. That’s an infuriating cycle to be stuck in, and it’s a persistent effect that ruins your whole run. Not least because replacement cats tend to be pretty much useless, at which point it all stops being fun.</p>

 <p>Combine a situation like that with a mini-boss that has a 50-percent chance of avoiding hits and a run of bad luck with that, and it feels so hopeless you want to give up. But this means wiping out your whole team, losing all the coins, food and artifacts they’ve gathered, and means having to breed more cats to set out again. When all of this happened to me, I was also low on food, and then for some godforsaken reason I had three nights in a row when the cats refused to breed. So, um, it’s time to head off with the four random strays and hope. You can’t actually <em>lose</em>, because at a certain point it just forces you to have four cats and the opportunity to go on a run, but eurgh.</p> <p>I encountered so much bad luck that I began to get too frustrated. There’s an attack that’s supposed to hit 30 percent of the time. I’ve seen it hit <em>once</em> out of maybe 590 billion uses. In my direst straits I ended up with a strain of genetics in my kitties that saw them born as “pacifists” and thus unable to kill enemies—that’s a problem. Coincidences, terrible strings of coin-flips, and enemies deciding to take seven turns in a row start racking up to the point where I was just the helpless victim of the game’s RNG, in a game where the odds are already deliberately stacked against you. I started resenting <em>Mewgenics</em> instead of enjoying it.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000666943" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666943"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666943">© Edmund McMillen, Tyler Glaiel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Like I say, this isn’t a condemnation of the game—it’s very obviously an extremely good one, and it delivers on its goals in vast bucketfuls. It’s wonderfully drawn, incredibly silly, and amazingly inventive. And it has so many completely fabulous songs. And look at the top: this isn’t a review! It’s up to someone willing to dedicate the hundred or more hours this game seems to need to write that. Me, I just got a bit fed up of its brutality after a bit, and while I’m still afflicted by a desire for “just one more go,” I’m also a bit cross with it too.</p>

 <p>I’m so interested to see how its toilet humor lands. It’s&nbsp;<em>so</em> childish in all the best ways, with incessant poop and pee gags, splendidly unpleasant depictions of cats rutting, giving birth, and eating one another, and even songs to go with such moments (I don’t know if it’s called “Cannibal Kitty” but that’s my favorite). It also has scenarios in which your cats can choose to eat human fetuses, spiders that crawl inside enemies and eat them from the inside out, all sorts of delightfully gross-out stuff. Although, I should add, this is far more tempered than in previous McMillen games: it’s practically a work of maturity compared to <em>The Binding of Isaac</em>‘s sensibilities. Tyler Glaiel (<em>The End Is Nigh</em>, <em>Bombernauts</em>) must be a good influence on him.&nbsp;I’m fascinated to learn how the traditional audience for a game like <em>Monster Train</em>,&nbsp;<em>Darkest Dungeon</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dicey Dungeons</em>,&nbsp;<em>Into the Breach</em>, and so on will react to the crassness.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000666944" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666944"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666944">© Edmund McMillen, Tyler Glaiel / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I also think I would have a&nbsp;<em>lot</em> more time for&nbsp;<em>Mewgenics</em> if it were on Android and iOS. This feels like the perfect game to play on my Pixel tablet, where I’d far more comfortably while away time with a run here and a run there, rather than sitting at my PC. (Obviously the Steam Deck is an option, but not the same.) It seems a mighty odd choice to limit this to PC on release.</p>

 <p><em>Mewgenics</em> reveals a colossal amount of work that has gone into making it so incredibly variable, and it’s very rewarding with all the decorative extras that surround the core loop. Its humor will <em>definitely</em> be a miss for many, but I suspect its depth and difficulty will give many cause to rise above it and play anyway. I just need some time to calm down before I go back.</p>

              <p><span>From </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-secret-lair-baldurs-gate-3-shadowheart-gale-2000665414"><i><span>Magic</span></i></a><span> to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/even-trumps-pentagon-is-selling-rare-pokemon-cards-now-2000661388"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a><span>, trading card games are having a moment right now. Yeah, the popularity comes with some drawbacks like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-store-poke-court-nyc-manhattan-robbery-donation-2000662652"><span>scalpers</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-magic-gathering-secret-lair-card-pre-order-drop-1851786245"><span>awful online queues</span></a><span>, but it’s clear that there’s a market to jump into if you’re putting popular characters and good art on pieces of cardboard. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/suspended-hearthstone-player-blitzchung-doesnt-regret-s-1841191499"><i><span>Hearthstone</span></i></a><span>, Blizzard’s </span><i><span>Warcraft</span></i><span> card game, has existed as a digital game for over a decade. Is Blizzard planning on jumping into this booming business? Not yet, at least.</span></p> <p><span>In a roundtable interview on Blizzard’s Irvine campus that </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>was present for, executive producer Nathan Lyons-Smith and game director Tyler Bielman were asked if Blizzard had been considering bringing </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>to physical card shops. According to Bielman, a lot of what makes the game special comes from qualities its digital platform enables that can’t be replicated with real cards, and the team is wary of losing some of those elements in translation.</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><span>I’ll start with, we have nothing to announce today. The team [has many] big physical TCG players. I came from physical TCGs; our friends at Riot and </span><i><span>Riftbound </span></i><span>are having a moment. It’s great for them. From the very beginning, our “founding fathers” of </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>asked the question of, “What if you could remove all the pain points from physical play?” and, at that point, kind of looking at </span><i><span>Magic</span></i><span> as the foundational element, ‘[if you could] remove pain points around </span><i><span>Magic</span></i><span>, too?’ And they asked all these questions, and then they put this game together in a way that is [an] incredible digital [experience]. The things that we do, mechanically, that you can’t do on a tabletop, when we go to look at expansions and new mechanics, we value those really highly. It gets a little extra oomph from us if it’s something that is unique to the digital format. If you were to translate </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>into a physical format, you would be sacrificing a lot of things that make it special. Now that said, the core of what makes </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>a great game is pretty universal and very accessible, and that’s why we believe it’s been around for 12 years, but I think that we would lose so much in that translation, we would have to be really careful about defining for ourselves what makes </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>great in the minds of all the players and then how much of that could we recapture if we take it to a different platform at all.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Lyons-Smith added that Blizzard wants </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>to be positioned as the “best digital card game,” and that is the team’s focus, but also said that the company has been around for 35 years and a lot has changed in that time, so the company has a “long horizon” of research and development that it’s exploring. So while it has “nothing to announce” and “nothing actually even in development,” the team is happy to see the card game genre growing.</span></p> <p><span>Today, Blizzard held its </span><i><span>Hearthstone </span></i><span>Spotlight presentation that laid out the game’s incoming updates, including an update based on </span><i><span>World of Warcraft</span></i><span>’s </span><i><span>Cataclysm </span></i><span>expansion, which you can watch below:</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been months since Epic Games <a href="https://kotaku.com/horses-creepy-horror-game-steam-banned-before-launch-santa-ragione-2000647324">removed <em>Horses</em> from its PC storefront</a> and the two sides are still feuding about what exactly took place. Developer Santa Ragione claims it was ghosted by Epic while the </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>maker claims it’s been transparent throughout the process. Now Santa Ragione’s co-founder and studio director, Pietro Righi Riva, has responded to the response to the response, claiming Epic Games’ “vague and semi-automated statements” provided little in the way of meaningful feedback about why</span><i><span> Horses </span></i><span>was removed from the storefront.</span></p> <p><span>This latest chapter in the ongoing censorship fight began with </span><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/epic-has-many-plans-for-its-game?open=false#%C2%A7a-note-about-horses"><i><span>Game File’s</span></i></a><span> February 5 interview with Epic Games, in which it asked VP Steve Allison why the game was taken down. “My understanding is the trust and safety team thought </span><i><span>[Horses</span></i><span>] was worth taking a fresh look, and they determined that it indeed was against our policies on a couple fronts,” Allison said. “And so, the call came late—and we love that studio; we did their previous game as a short exclusive—but because that [trust and safety] team, that’s their job and that is, if you do the letter of the law on our policies, it is what it is.”</span></p>

 <p><span>For context, Epic Games’ content ratings </span><a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-games-store/requirements-guidelines/content-ratings/content-guidelines"><span>guidelines</span></a><span> state that games “with Adults Only (AO) ratings cannot be distributed on the Epic Games Store.” They do make an exception for games that only carry AO ratings “because they use blockchain, NFT, or cryptocurrency technology.” </span><i><span>Horses </span></i><span>is also not available through Steam for similar reasoning, but can be purchased on GoG and itch.io.&nbsp;</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:5w4wqifosubfhezsqepobxtn/app.bsky.feed.post/3mebdquhjts2k" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreieobrr7wsfjrlwzargszax3mipgo43vus3xdgurceeb4qayvzrpxq"> <p lang="en">Epic made provably incorrect statements about the game’s content, refused to provide details supporting their claims, and has not shared their claimed AO IARC certificate, which normally includes a link for the developer to appeal. They do not ‘love that studio’, they have effectively ghosted us</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:5w4wqifosubfhezsqepobxtn?ref_src=embed">Santa Ragione (@santaragione.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:5w4wqifosubfhezsqepobxtn/post/3mebdquhjts2k?ref_src=embed">2026-02-07T11:44:28.467Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><span>On February 7, Santa Ragione rejected Allison’s claim in a post </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/santaragione.com/post/3mebdquhjts2k"><span>on Bluesky</span></a><span>. “Epic made provably incorrect statements about the game’s content, refused to provide details supporting their claims, and has not shared their claimed AO IARC certificate, which normally includes a link for the developer to appeal. They do not ‘love that studio’, they have effectively ghosted us,” stated Santa Ragione.</span></p>

 <p><span>Today, Epic Games followed up on Santa Ragione’s post in a statement to several publications, including </span><i><span>IGN </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i><span>. “Our team played the game and found it violated the Epic Games Store’s Content Guidelines, specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies,” communications manager Brian Sharon said.</span></p>

 <p><span>“We did a secondary check by filling out the ratings questionnaire for the game ourselves and the content got an Adults Only (AO) rating – which we do not allow on the Store. Because this wasn’t an official submission, we do not have a certificate to share with the team. We did give the developers context around the policies they violated. When they appealed, we reviewed the content again, and let them know the decision was appropriately applied and will remain in place.”</span></p> <h2>A cloud of confusion still hangs over <em>Horses</em>‘ last-minute rejection</h2> <p><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>reached out to Santa Ragione for clarification regarding the “incorrect statements” they alluded to in their initial Bluesky post. “On Dec 1, 24 hours before release, Epic sent us what looked like an automated notice saying that they were unable to distribute </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span> on the Epic Games Store because their review found violations of the Epic Games Store Content Guidelines, specifically the ‘Inappropriate Content’ and ‘Hateful or Abusive Content’ policies,” replied Pietro Righi Riva. “They went on to specify that their policies prohibit content which ‘contains explicit or frequent depictions of sexual behavior or not appropriately labeled, rated, or age-gated,’ and content that promotes abuse and animal abuse.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Riva further explained that they responded to Epic Games’ first notice to appeal within “28 minutes,” on the basis that “all nudity in the game is completely censored via pixelation” and that “the content presented does not in any way promote abuse and animal abuse.” After Epic Games’ second review of </span><i><span>Horses</span></i><span>, Riva told us that “No additional information or context was ever provided. We emailed them twice since to plead for a resubmission and find a solution but never received a reply.”</span></p> <p><span>“I do not think that those two vague and semi-automated statements would qualify as ‘contacting us twice.’ Their initial message suggested there was a path to ‘make updates to our product to ensure compliance’ but never explained what that would entail or what specifically needed change in the first place,” Riva concluded.</span></p> <p><span><em>Horses</em> has received </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/horses-review-steam-epic-games-ban-horror-ride-race-2000651442"><span>a range of reviews</span></a><span> since it launched, but one thing many critics seems to agree on is that there is nothing in the game nearly as scandalous as Epic and Valve banning it would imply. Adding to the confusion and skepticism is that PC gaming storefronts have been under extra pressure recently from payment processers at the behest of pro-censorship activists to crackdown on NSFW content. For all the controversy, Epic and other storefronts still haven’t made it clear precisely what they found so objectionable about the content in</span><i><span> Horses</span></i><span>.&nbsp; </span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-lego-sets-release-date-price-pikachu-charizard-2000658895"><i><span>Pokémon’s</span></i><span> first Lego sets</span></a><span> are launching later this month for the series’ 30th anniversary, but some reviewers and creators have gotten early access to the sets and are building them for coverage. These models are made up of hundreds or thousands of pieces, and sometimes, Lego sneaks an easter egg or two into the build. This is the case with the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-year-of-eevee-prismatic-evolutions-plush-1851732914"><span>Eevee</span></a><span> model, which has a hidden reference to the Pokémon’s various evolutions.</span></p> <p><span>Eevee’s whole schtick is that it’s able to evolve into one of several evolutions depending on certain conditions, including the time of day, the use of a certain evolution stone, or whether or not it knows a Fairy-type move. Each form is pretty distinct, with each carrying a different color scheme, elemental theme, and shape. While Eevee’s eight evolutions aren’t getting their own Lego sets (yet), the Eevee model’s innards are a nod to each of them.</span></p>

   <p><span>As TikToker and Lego creator Bricks By Mind demonstrates, the inside of the Eevee model includes colored bricks that correspond to each of its evolutions. Parts of it are made up of yellow, orange, and blue bricks that resemble the colors of the electric Jolteon, flaming Flareon, and water-wielding Vaporeon, respectively. Meanwhile, the inside of the head has a brick for each of the other evolutions stacked next to one another behind its eyes. This includes the aforementioned three, but also blocks for the Ice-type Glaceon, Grass-type Leafeon, Psychic-type Espeon, Dark-type Umbreon, and Fairy-type Sylveon. It’s a neat touch.</span></p> <p><span>Thankfully, the Eevee model is the cheapest of the </span><i><span>Pokemon </span></i><span>Lego sets, and will only run you $59.99 compared to the $200 Pikachu one, or the staggering $649.99 you’ll have to pay for the Charizard, Venusaur, and Blastoise one, when they all launch on February 27.</span></p>
