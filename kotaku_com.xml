Fingers crossed for Baldur’s Village.” </p><p>Larian Studios decided to move on to other projects instead of making <em>Baldur’s Gate 4</em>, and an executive at Hasbro, which owns Wizards of the Coast, recently told fans the company is taking its time with the project but will have details to begin sharing soon. “We’re going to take a very measured approach,” VP of digital games Dan Ayoub <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/well-hear-more-about-baldurs-gates-future-in-pretty-short-order-hasbro-svp-of-games-says" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>IGN</em></a></span> earlier this month. “We’ve got a lot of plans, a lot of different ways to go about it. We’re starting to think about, okay, yeah, we’re ready to start dipping toes a little bit and talking about a few things. And I think, in really short order, like I said, again, not to over-tease that point, we’re going to have some other things to talk about around that.”</p><p>Apparently someone at Hasbro or Wizards thinks a fan mashup of <em>BG3</em> and one of the most popular games of all time in a non-competing genre might get in the way of whatever it’s doing with the franchise. Vincke wasn’t impressed with the move. “Free quality fan mods highlighting your characters in other game genres are proof your work resonates and a unique form of word of mouth,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1906765058270540219&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/1906765058270540219" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> on Monday. “Imho they shouldn’t be treated like commercial ventures that infringe on your property.”<br></p><p>He continued, “Protecting your IP can be tricky but I do hope this gets settled. There are good ways of dealing with this.”<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

On <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/app/3164500/charts/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/app/3164500/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 3o, during peak weekend play time, SteamDB showed that<em> Schedule I</em></a></span> had an astounding 414,000+ concurrent players on Steam. That’s better than games like <em>Starfield, Grand Theft Auto V, </em>and <em>Destiny 2. </em></p><p>So what is <em>Schedule I</em>? Well, it’s a drug-dealing sim. That’s not a joke or me being silly, that’s straight up what the game is.

At the moment I’m just trying to stay focused and get patches out ASAP. Also looking forward to getting started on content updates as soon as all major bugs are patched.” </p><p>When asked about porting the game to consoles, Tyler seemed interested but wasn’t sure if Microsoft and Sony would allow the game on their digital stores. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164500/Schedule_I/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reviews for <em>Schedule I</em></a></span> are extremely positive and most players seem happy with the content available at launch and are excited for the game to expand via promised updates that will arrive over the next few weeks and months. </p><p>In a time when massive games developed by hundreds of people and costing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566?_gl=1*1ssvoho*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzQ0MDQ0NC4yNzguMS4xNzQzNDU1NDA0LjE2LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566?_gl=1*1ssvoho*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzQ0MDQ0NC4yNzguMS4xNzQzNDU1NDA0LjE2LjAuMA..">tens of millions of dollars (or more) are flopping</a></span>, its nice to see something succeeding and proving that you don’t need hyper-realistic graphics or live-service features to succeed. Instead, you can just make a game that offers players a unique or enticing experience and sell it at a fair price.  And if you get lucky and people like it, you might end up with one of the biggest games of 2025 and beat AAA studios and publishers. <br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The only thing I really desperately want and need at the launch of Switch 2 is a shiny new 3D <em>Mario </em>game. Give me a new <em>Mario </em>game as big and awesome as <em>Odyssey</em>, and I’ll buy a Switch 2 on day one. Considering the last big 3D <em>Mario </em>game was <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, released in 2017, it seems like we are due for a new one.</p><p><strong>John Walker: </strong>It’d be weird if there weren’t a new <em>Super Mario</em>, right? My wish is for something that realizes the amazing promise of <em>Bowser’s Fury</em>, an open-world-ish 3D <em>Mario</em> game with all the imaginative innovations Nintendo could do with all that space. It’d be <em>crazy</em> if there weren’t <em>Wind Waker</em> and <em>Twilight Princess</em> remakes, but then it’s been <em>crazy</em> that those haven’t happened for every year of the original Switch, too. Can we all agree to collectively boo if there’s word of a <em>Pikmin 5</em>?</p><p><strong>Kenneth Shepard:</strong> <em>Breath of the Wild 3 </em>and a <em>Pokemon MMO</em>.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> <em>Donkey Kong Country 6</em>, some first-party gimmick party game called, like, <em>Mouse Attack</em> or something, and a port of <em>Sea of Thieves</em>. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8997bcdff410a320304a57d189ed8068" data-recommend-id="image://8997bcdff410a320304a57d189ed8068" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Switch 2 displays a patent for the Joy-Con mouse functionality.

Paying extra for this will also be the only way to utilize voice chat. The Virtual Console will return to the eShop, but NES games will be $10 each, with $10 added on for each subsequent console generation. There will be no built-in social media sharing. You’ll be able to share save files with the people on your friends list. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="32488bccf783587f8bc453b49bc2c2e0" data-recommend-id="image://32488bccf783587f8bc453b49bc2c2e0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1785" data-height="1003" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Switch 2 screenshot shows the C button.

That would be a really boring answer. Another option is that C stands for connect and this will be the button you use to sync stuff or maybe even connect to an OG Switch? The wildest idea I’ve come up with: The C button stands for camera. In this scenario, you’ll be able to hit it, and the Switch 2 controller will become a virtual in-game camera controlled via motion in games that support photo modes. The truth is that I don’t know what the C button will do, but hopefully it’s not something annoying that makes me hate using the Switch 2.</p><p>  <strong>John Walker:</strong> I’m at my most pessimistic here. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-joy-con-nintendo-new-features-1851735307&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-joy-con-nintendo-new-features-1851735307">I’ve bemoaned previously</a></span>, I think this is just going to be a better Switch, and as such lack that Nintendo weirdness you’d usually expect in a follow-up console. I really hope I’m wrong, and that mysterious button causes games to climb out of the screen or something. </p><p><strong>Kenneth Shepard: </strong>C stands for “Car horn,” so the Switch 2 honks if you press it.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach: </strong>The C button stands for ChatGPT integration and will summon a Shigeru Miyamoto MiiBot that gives you tips for playing games. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7bbe6298886a467edc1476828a1292f9" data-recommend-id="image://7bbe6298886a467edc1476828a1292f9" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Switch 2 sits in a dock.

Interestingly, I wonder if the Steam Deck’s success in recent years has helped devs get better at optimizing settings for a portable, smaller device with a limited battery. If so, that could be very helpful for Switch 2 ports.</p><p><strong>Kenneth Shepard:</strong> It will be powerful enough to run old Switch games like they should have run on the last one, god willing.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> People are going to be asking for a Switch 2 Pro by Christmas. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="25d90edbff26f6fa55f946ab4205712b" data-recommend-id="image://25d90edbff26f6fa55f946ab4205712b" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A cartridge is shown being inserted into a Switch 2.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Zack Zwiezen: </strong>Yuuuuuuuuuuup. I expect that for the following 20 months or so, getting your hands on a Switch 2 will involve scanning Discord servers, religiously following Wario64 on Twitter for stock updates, and being ready to drop everything at a moment’s notice to snag one before a thousand resellers show up with bots to vacuum up any units that arrive in warehouses or stores. Or you might be able to pay triple the price to get a Switch 2 via eBay. But don’t do that. Don’t reward the resellers.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> Absolutely not. I think pre-orders might be touch-and-go, especially if there’s little to no scalper protection and resellers are inflating demand. But I also think Nintendo delayed this console by a full year to make sure it had enough stock so that you could walk into a Target or Best Buy once school is out and upgrade to a Switch 2. The alternative is Nintendo risks a small but not insignificant group of Switch owners upgrading to a PS5 or Steam Deck instead. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="477cfa797b2be5fdf0b5ff67d0836cea" data-recommend-id="image://477cfa797b2be5fdf0b5ff67d0836cea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Master Chief Collection appears on Switch 2.

Rockstar brought the <em>GTA Trilogy</em> to Switch, as well as some other games. But <em>GTA V </em>remains unavailable on Nintendo hardware. That’s a huge market that could be buying Shark Cards in <em>GTA Online</em>. And with <em>GTA 6</em> unlikely to arrive on Switch 2, <em>GTA V </em>might be the next best thing. And hey, maybe a <em>GTA IV </em>port, too. I also wouldn’t be shocked if some more Xbox games arrived on Switch 2.<em> Forza Horizon 5 </em>on a Switch 2 sounds splendid. </p><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> I expect Microsoft to load up the Switch 2 with former Xbox console exclusives including <em>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</em>, the rumored <em>Gears of War </em>anthology, <em>Diablo 4</em>, and a bunch of other games. <em>Elden Ring</em> is a riskier but more exciting bet. But I’ll go big and say <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> comes to Switch 2 before the end of 2025!</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
