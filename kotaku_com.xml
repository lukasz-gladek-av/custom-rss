              <p>On February 10, filmmaker Ruairí Robinson made a <a href="https://x.com/RuairiRobinson/status/2021394940757209134">bold claim on X</a>. “This was a 2 line prompt in seedance 2. If the hollywood is cooked guys are right maybe the hollywood is cooked guys are cooked too idk,” he wrote. The post was accompanied by a video of Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt performing a fight scene together. The clip gained attention for its apparent sophistication; it appeared well-choreographed, competently shot, and appropriately lit, which are all elements that other AI video tools have struggled to convincingly replicate. If Robinson’s claim was true, this was a significant leap forward in AI video technology. The kind of thing AI hype-men have been shilling for years and which has—until, if Robinson is to be believed, right now—turned out to be nothing more than <a href="https://www.shokunin.studio/blog/2024/2/15/openai-releases-text-to-video-tool-sora-and-instantly-generates-a-wave-of-social-media-spam">snake oil</a>. There’s just one problem: It’s probably still snake oil.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This was a 2 line prompt in seedance 2. If the hollywood is cooked guys are right maybe the hollywood is cooked guys are cooked too idk. <a href="https://t.co/dNTyLUIwAV">pic.twitter.com/dNTyLUIwAV</a></p> <p>— Ruairi Robinson (@RuairiRobinson) <a href="https://twitter.com/RuairiRobinson/status/2021394940757209134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Aron Peterson, a writer and software developer who has also worked in film production, post-production, and visual effects, posted a blog on his website, <a href="https://www.shokunin.studio/blog/2026/2/18/is-it-all-over-for-filmmakers">Shokunin Studio</a>, questioning Robinson’s story. “The claims being made immediately rubbed me up the wrong way,” Peterson wrote. “Other demos of the Seedance model had the usual errors we have come to expect from AI video generators [but this one didn’t].” In particular, Peterson explained, “AI video generators are really bad at simulating realistic camera moves, especially handheld shaky cam,” but in the Cruise/Pitt video, “we can see the camera movement.”</p>

 <p>So Peterson started researching <a href="https://kotaku.com/arcane-league-of-legends-ai-trailer-vi-jinx-ekko-warwick-2000666921">Seedance 2.0</a>, the new AI tool from TikTok developer ByteDance that’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg1dl410q9o">already doing large-scale copyright infringement</a>, which Robinson used to create the video. Peterson “hopped over to Seedance’s website and it only took 10 seconds to find green screen footage of two stuntmen performing the same fight choreography we see in the Cruise vs Pitt scene,” he said. He also posted a comparison of the two videos on YouTube.</p>   <p>“Was the input really just a 2 line prompt or was it actually 2 lines, green screen video footage, and face references too?” Peterson asked. “The evidence appears to show that stuntmen were filmed from several angles, that a clip had to be generated for every angle, and then finally all clips were stitched together for marketing.” Peterson’s evidence implies that the Cruise/Pitt fight scene wasn’t entirely AI generated; instead, it was probably just face replacement and background creation laid on top of footage that already existed. As TV writer David Slack put it on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/slack2thefuture.bsky.social">Bluesky</a>, “In other words, like most AI hype — it was a con.”</p>

              <p>Next month, season three goes live in EA’s free-to-play reboot of <em>Skate</em>. The big new addition in the upcoming season is Grom, an island that players can visit and skate around on. However, the island, which is a slightly updated version of the tutorial island, is essentially locked behind a paywall, which goes against a promise EA made before launch.</p> <p>On February 19, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/dev-update-s3-skatepass-grom-and-the-future">EA and Full Circle posted a blog</a> talking about some of the changes coming in <em>Skate’s</em> third season, which goes live on March 10. In the post, EA revealed that a new island will be available to skaters in the next season. But accessing this island won’t be as simple or free as fast traveling to it once the update is live.</p>

 <p>During the first month of season three, skate.Pass Premium holders will be able to visit Grom as much as they want, whenever they want. For those who haven’t paid for <em>Skate’s</em> battle pass, they’ll be locked out until April. That’s when a “very special multi-week event” will happen, and all players will be invited to Grom’s “grand opening.” After that wraps up, free access to Grom will be restricted once more to Premium pass owners. Non-paying players will be able to spend 500 rip chips, an in-game currency you earn by playing, to buy a day pass to the island.</p> <figure><figcaption>An overhead comparison of Grom during the game’s tutorial and Grom during the event provided by EA.&nbsp; (EA/Kotaku)</figcaption></figure> <p>Did you get all that? A bit confusing, but somewhat understandable for a free-to-play game. However, there’s a problem. Before the launch of <em>Skate</em> in September last year, EA made some promises about the game. <a href="https://youtu.be/FAMgtFyrQLk?t=453">In a video posted in July 2022</a>, the devs said that when they started exploring the free-to-play model, they had to set some “hard ground rules to follow.” One of those rules included “No map areas locked behind paywalls.” Whoops! It also doesn’t help that the new island is just a slightly expanded version of the game’s tutorial island, something that is very clear to see in EA’s own comparison image in the blog.</p>

 <h2>The backlash to <em>Skate</em> paywalling an island</h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1r9a7oh/so_devs/">As you might expect</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1r98r3g/ea_did_it_again/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><em>Skate</em> players weren’t happy</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1r98r3g/ea_did_it_again/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">about all of this</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1r9akiw/what_is_this_full_circle/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">and started flooding social media</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1r997il/isle_of_grom/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">and Reddit</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SkateEA/comments/1r98un6/huh_whats_that/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">with posts</a> <a href="https://x.com/nkocharm/status/2024534025692430345">pointing out the promise EA had broken</a>. This eventually led to the official <em>Skate</em> account on <a href="https://x.com/skate/status/2024539083259654345">X posting a statement about Grom</a>.</p>

 <p>“We launched <em>Skate</em> in Early Access so we could build it with players, not behind closed doors,” EA wrote. “Since September, we’ve been updating the world, tweaking characters, and adding features our players have been asking for, and there is lots more coming. Yes, sometimes plans have to change. That’s part of the deal when you’re building in public. We’re here, we’re listening, and we’re going to keep shaping <em>Skate</em> together.”</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to EA for more information.</p> <p>While it is true that game development is messy, going back on this promise has opened up a can of worms. EA also promised that <em>Skate</em> would not contain paid loot boxes or pay-to-win elements. Why should players trust EA to stick to those promises if it is willing to deviate on this issue and toss an island behind a paywall, even one that can be avoided by grinding for currency?</p>

 <p>Regardless, I’m not shocked EA has decided to renege. The company is likely under pressure to make more money across all of its games after announcing its upcoming deal to sell itself to <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">Saudi Arabia and private equity goons for $55 billion</a>.</p>
