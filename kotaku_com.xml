              <p><span>Blizzard finally </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-persona-5-skins-crossover-mercy-genji-joker-2000625739"><span>unveiled the five </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>collaboration skins</span></a><span> it‚Äôs bringing to </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> yesterday, and as </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>fans tend to do, they had a pretty wide spread of reactions. When you have 44 heroes, it‚Äôs impossible to spread love across them equally, and it can get pretty irritating if your favorite never seems to get any love in the form of skins and other cosmetics. It‚Äôs especially grating when </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>seems to favor a specific handful of characters with each event or collaboration. While support hero Kiriko, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-kiriko-mercy-venture-reaper-season-12-skins-1851626893"><span>the face of this issue</span></a><span>, wasn‚Äôt included in the </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>skins, the collaboration still hasn‚Äôt gone over well with some fans who feel that heroes like Genji and Mercy are getting preferential treatment, or are disappointed that some seemingly obvious crossovers didn‚Äôt manifest.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">drew junkrat skull and dva oracle earlier cause I'm hyped for the collab hehe ‚ö°<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/OverwatchFanart?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#OverwatchFanart</a>‚Äã <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Persona5?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Persona5</a>‚Äã <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Overwatch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Overwatch2</a> <a href="https://t.co/6XOAOfgPgl">pic.twitter.com/6XOAOfgPgl</a></p> <p>‚Äî Souda (@lemonsoudaa) <a href="https://twitter.com/lemonsoudaa/status/1967625308129112547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Surprisingly, the most contentious skin in the </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>event seems to be Genji as Ryuji. Genji makes a lot of sense for the collaboration, given that he‚Äôs one of </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>‚Äôs Japanese heroes, and his katana would make him a pretty natural fit for someone like Yusuke, who also uses a sword in the RPGs. Ryuji, however, is a bit of an odd pick. The track star is the tank of </span><i><span>Persona 5</span></i><span>‚Äôs team, and uses blunt melee weapons in fights, such as bats and pipes. When Genji wears the skin based on the Phantom Thief, his katana is replaced by Ryuji‚Äôs base lead pipe, which, yeah, I mean, that‚Äôs a melee weapon, I guess, but you don‚Äôt slash people with a pipe the same way Genji does when he uses his katana in his ultimate attack.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The choice is even more questionable considering that some fans feel Junkrat, the grenade-launching DPS hero and often forgotten member of the original roster, would have made a better fit, and had been speculating and hoping that he would get the Ryuji treatment. He has Ryuji‚Äôs blonde hair, the two have both suffered leg injuries that leave them with a distinct limp, and Ryuji is often a goofy comic relief character whose mannerisms would have worked well in a Junkrat highlight intro.</span></p>

D.Va, the mech-piloting tank, got a skin based on the student council president Makoto. It has some cool details, like her mech being based on Johanna, Makoto‚Äôs motorcycle-shaped Persona, but </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>also has a character who would have fit D.Va‚Äôs gamer theme: Futaba. The support character in </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>is a bit of a recluse. She‚Äôs extremely online and has to be dragged out of her bedroom to be social half the time, but she is always dropping gamer jokes and memes into casual conversation. D.Va pilots a mech because she was a pro gamer who uses her transferable skills to defend South Korea, so the comparisons are pretty apparent, especially because Futaba also pilots her own Persona like a mech. Still, some fans argue that adapting Johanna‚Äôs design for D.Va‚Äôs mech was an interesting creative choice.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">yeah makoto! you remember the character in persona 5 who spoke in gamer lingo and spent most of her time in mementos in a mech like persona and had  heavy ties to technology in most of the phantom thieves? right? <a href="https://t.co/tPb2pIZfgF">https://t.co/tPb2pIZfgF</a></p> <p>‚Äî * (@star_piIot) <a href="https://twitter.com/star_piIot/status/1967634520720675158?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">blizzard if they used more than 5 percent of their brain  and actually played persona 5 <a href="https://t.co/En7AyTA9bL">https://t.co/En7AyTA9bL</a> <a href="https://t.co/2OJdKvSzKy">pic.twitter.com/2OJdKvSzKy</a></p> <p>‚Äî Jonathan (@JonathanFess) <a href="https://twitter.com/JonathanFess/status/1967756280862499250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">this is a good choice when you look at the mecha</p> <p>yall just dont have imagination <a href="https://t.co/HUExUNV2yz">https://t.co/HUExUNV2yz</a></p> <p>‚Äî AUZZIE ‚úàÔ∏è NYCC (@auzziejlee) <a href="https://twitter.com/auzziejlee/status/1967638175226138773?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The blizzard dev scrolling past your post <a href="https://t.co/NwVHVKmuAK">https://t.co/NwVHVKmuAK</a> <a href="https://t.co/kzjiCO716i">pic.twitter.com/kzjiCO716i</a></p> <p>‚Äî Frankiep423 (@frankiep423) <a href="https://twitter.com/frankiep423/status/1967745502306586881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>If you go looking, you‚Äôll find a lot of ideas fans had for the collaboration before Blizzard revealed the skins.

Ultimately, when Blizzard teases something weeks before revealing it, fans just have more time to imagine the perfect collaboration in their heads and be disappointed in whatever follows, and that disappointment is only exacerbated when there are already perceptions of favoritism. R.I.P. Ryuji Junkrat, though. A real missed opportunity, that one.</span></p>

              <p>Pok√©mon cards. If it ain‚Äôt a story about <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/14/target-removes-trading-cards-from-stores-after-violent-incident-with-gun.html">sudden acts of intimidation and threats of violence</a> over them, then it‚Äôs probably one about scalpers and reselling. Thankfully, no one got hurt (physically) this time as the Mega Evolution Phantasmal Flames Elite Trainer Box (ETB), Booster Display Box, and Booster Bundle all sold out during their pre-order sale yesterday, with significant amounts of them going to folks who have no interest in actually using them to play the game. And they went <i>fast</i>. Some fans were lucky enough to still get through and lay claim to sets of their own, but the sting of seeing exorbitant listings on reselling sites still sucks.</p> <p>Expected to arrive on November 14, 2025, pre-orders for the latest <i>Pok√©mon </i>card game expansion went up <a href="https://x.com/PokemonRestocks/status/1967620548051218478">yesterday, September 15, 2025</a>, and, predictably, were sold out within 15 minutes (<a href="https://www.thegamer.com/pokemon-tcg-phantasmal-flames-etbs-ebay-for-extortionate-prices/">h/t <i>The Gamer</i></a>). And no, these very pretty-looking cards will not be finding homes with eager fans hoping to add them to their collections. Sadly, scalpers have filled eBay with pre-order listings for the new cards. Some are set at around normal prices, but a significant number of these listings are selling the cards for five times the retail price, hovering around $300, if not more in some cases.</p> <p>Scalpers didn‚Äôt soak up all the fun, however. On social media, many are <a href="https://x.com/ReyGambino_/status/1967626696045269047">celebrating a win</a> with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/camyoin.bsky.social/post/3lyven5lodk2x">screenshots of successful pre-orders</a> of the new cards. That said, others ran into queue issues, getting bounced after only waiting for a short time, or in some cases, <a href="https://x.com/texasboy1060569/status/1967620858714992652">making it to checkout</a>, only to be bounced back in line. Others who made it to checkout were <a href="https://x.com/ChrisMulea96895/status/1967622801319424323">greeted by a mysterious ‚ÄúError 17‚Äù</a> that then sent them back into the queue. Others hopelessly suffered as <a href="https://x.com/josejmurillo/status/1967624598754939237">they got bounced around in line</a> after multiple captcha checks to validate whether they were human or not.</p> <p>Adorned with a healthy splash of color, clearly the new Mega Charizard X ex is one of the main appeals of the new cards, along with Mega Gengar. I‚Äôm also really digging the moody, dark card sleeves. Shame that so few people will be buying them at normal prices any time soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> hasn‚Äôt been <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-hollow-knight-team-cherry-seth-goldman-2000625769">out for even two weeks yet</a> and it‚Äôs already getting its second patch. But for anyone still struggling in some of the game‚Äôs more brutal boss fights and platforming sections: don‚Äôt expect any more relief just yet. The Metroidvania Soulslike‚Äôs new update mostly takes aim at some of the smaller bugs fans are facing.</p> <p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre getting close to finalizing the second post-release patch for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>,‚Äù Team Cherry <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/546746634645557243/">announced</a> on Steam on Tuesday. ‚ÄúWhere the first patch dealt mainly with critical issues, this next one focuses on a few still remaining, while also cleaning up some bugs around specific tools.‚Äù</p> <p>While not live in the game on PC or console yet, players can test the fixes in the public beta branch on Valve‚Äôs storefront while the developers work on adding a few more fixes and improvements. Here‚Äôs the full patch notes so far for <em>Silksong</em> update 2:</p>

 <blockquote><p>‚Äì Added Dithering effect option in Advanced video settings. Reduces colour banding but can slightly soften the appearance of foreground assets. Defaults to ‚ÄòOff‚Äô.<br> ‚Äì Updated Herald‚Äôs Wish achievement description to clarify that players must both complete the wish and finish the game.<br> ‚Äì Fixed Savage Beastfly in Far Fields sometimes remaining below the lava.<br> ‚Äì Fixed rare cases of Shrine Guardian Seth getting out of bounds during battle.<br> ‚Äì Added catch to prevent Lugoli sometimes flying off screen and not returning during battle.<br> ‚Äì Further reduced chance of Silk Snippers getting stuck out of bounds in Chapel of the Reaper battle.<br> ‚Äì Fixed various instances of dying to bosses while killing them causing death sequences to play messily or out of sync.<br> ‚Äì Fixed Shaman Binding into a bottom transition causing a softlock.<br> ‚Äì Cocoon positions in some locations updated to prevent it spawning in inaccessible areas.<br> ‚Äì Fixed Liquid Lacquer courier delivery not being accessible in Steel Soul mode.<br> ‚Äì Fixed some NPCs not correctly playing cursed hint dialogues in certain instances.<br> ‚Äì Fixed Pondcatcher Reed not being able to fly away after singing.<br> ‚Äì Fixed Verdania memory orbs sometimes replaying layered screen-edge burst effects.<br> ‚Äì Fixed the break counter not working for certain multihitter tools eg Conchcutter.<br> ‚Äì Fixed Volt Filament damage multiplier not applying for certain Silk Skills.<br> ‚Äì Fixed Cogflies and Wisps inappropriately targeting Skullwings.<br> ‚Äì Fixed Cogflies incorrectly resetting their HP to full on scene change.<br> ‚Äì Fixed Curveclaw always breaking on the first hit after being deflected.<br> ‚Äì Fixed Plasmium Phial and Flea Brew sometimes not restoring as intended at benches.<br> ‚Äì Various other smaller tweaks and fixes.</p></blockquote> <p>This patch will arrive as players continue to debate <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-difficulty-hard-damage-criticism-2000624031"><em>Silksong</em>‚Äòs difficulty</a> and whether some of the more challenging sections are hard for a reason or just annoying for no reason. <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-notes-moorwing-2000624424">The game‚Äôs first patch</a> took aim at some of these complaints, including making the dreaded Moorwing boss fight easier to survive. There‚Äôs also been some debate over whether<em> Silksong</em> is too stingy with Rosary Beads, its main currency for purchasing equipment, unlocking benches (save spots), and other important resources for the adventure.</p> <p>Even some super fans of the original <em>Hollow Knight</em> claim to have bounced off the sequel due to the more punishing gameplay. Team Cherry hasn‚Äôt signaled yet if it plans to eventually make deeper changes to<em> Silksong</em> to address some of these concerns, or add difficulty settings to help struggling players <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-difficulty-hollow-knight-easy-mode-2000624441">experience more of its excellent world and story</a>.</p>

              <p>In 2005, a very inevitable-feeling game was released. In fact, it‚Äôs remarkable it was as late as that year that we first saw a video game based on the massive television hospital drama <em>ER.</em> The 1994 show that launched George Clooney‚Äôs career (if you don‚Äôt count <em>Roseanne</em>) had already lost the actor to Hollywood, and by 2005 was very much waning (down from a peak of 36 million viewers to 17.5m), albeit still four years from its eventual demise. Yet, honestly, there was no point in the show‚Äôs lifetime when&nbsp;<em>ER: The Game</em> would have made a lick of sense. It remains one of the weirdest video games ever made. Let‚Äôs celebrate that.</p> <p>(To get this out of the way, when I say ‚Äú20 years since,‚Äù this isn‚Äôt an exact measure. The game came out in the U.S. in May of 2005, but here in the UK it didn‚Äôt appear until September.)</p> <p><em>ER</em>, the TV show, certainly had a sense of humor, but it‚Äôs fair to say that it was very firmly a drama. These doctors were dealing with life and death, as well as lots of kissing, and there was that time Quentin Tarantino directed an episode. If you wanted silliness, you needed to change channels and watch the extraordinarily weird rival hospital drama <em>Chicago Hope.&nbsp;</em>So it remains a massive mystery how the video game incarnation of the series played like a spiritual sequel to Bullfrog‚Äôs&nbsp;<em>Theme Hospital</em>. This was a game in which you had to deal with an invasion of ninjas, and perform an operation while fairies danced around you and a football player kept appearing and disappearing at the foot of the bed.</p>

 <p>OK, let‚Äôs give this a bit of context. In 2004, EA‚Äôs&nbsp;<em>The Sims 2</em> had released, and controlling characters from an isometric view was big business.&nbsp;<em>ER: The Game</em> very much mimicked the look of the&nbsp;<em>Sims</em> sequel, with its cut-off view of walled rooms and NPC characters roaming around the corridors. And like in <em>The Sims</em>, you had to control your character to perform a series of tasks within strict time limits while maintaining their hygiene, health, and relationships. It‚Äôs just, you had to do all this while being an intern in the Chicago hospital, surrounded by the characters from the show. And I really do mean the characters from the show. Completely improbably, frankly inexplicably, this game almost no one heard of, let alone played, starred proper members of the TV show‚Äôs cast as voice actors. Noah Wyle, Sherry Stringfield, Mekhi Phifer, and Yvette Freeman all showed up, despite surely having nothing in their contracts that would have made them do so, voicing the doctors and nurses with whom you needed to get along. Sadly Maura Tierney and Goran Visnjic were no-shows, and obviously Anthony Edwards and George Clooney were long gone, but still.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000626003" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626003"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626003">¬© Mindscape / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I‚Äôm not an expert in how real hospitals are run, but I‚Äôm reasonably sure that it‚Äôs not entirely a gift-based economy. Yet this is how <em>ER: The Game</em> pitched things, with your relationship statuses with your colleagues often decided by the presents you‚Äôd buy for them and receive from them. Even the patients would give you a present if they were happy with your performance. Along the way, you gained new skills and talents, each boosted by being in the positive company of more talented co-workers, as you treated patients for their broken bones, neurological issues, and toxicology-based troubles. It was the latter that led to the most memorable moments.</p>

 <p>It has been 20 years since I played this game, and tragically it‚Äôs no longer available to buy. (This is definitely one GOG needs to rescue.) I am delighted to say that I do, however, still have the DVD on which it was released. The only issue is I don‚Äôt own a DVD drive, and as such can only show it to my PC, which just stares nostalgically at the shiny plastic. Fortunately, I do have my memories, and a copy of the review I wrote for it back in a 2005 print edition of <em>PC Gamer</em>. Let me quote from it:</p> <blockquote><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs certainly the best rubbish game I‚Äôve played in as long as I can remember.‚Äù</p></blockquote> <figure id="attachment_2000626004" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626004"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626004">¬© Mindscape / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It‚Äôs remarkable how far the incompetently-made game‚Äôs utter weirdness carried it, the sheer charm of its absurdity making it a compelling play. And never more so than in that scene when my character started seeing fairies. It was a great level! Everyone was being so nice to me, and my medical skills were hugely improved. Even Dr. Pratt (Phifer) has stopped being a complete dick‚Äîthe dude had taken a real disliking to me, and wouldn‚Äôt even talk about the weather when I tried to chat. The fairies dancing around the room did make the situation somewhat suspect, and like I said, there was that footballer in his full kit who would appear and disappear. That didn‚Äôt seem <em>quite</em> right. But it was still a disappointment when I woke up in a bed with Dr. Carter (Wyle) shouting at me. At this point, back in reality, the hospital had been invaded by a ninja and I was needed to help find him on the security cameras. One shift later I was kissing Dr. Carter.</p>

 <p>It‚Äôs a shame it was so badly made. The controls were a shambles, various systems made little to no sense, and the act of having a conversation with a janitor was technically more complicated than performing surgery on a child. But 20 years later, that shit only makes me like it even more. And it certainly helped that as busted as it might have been, the game was so bonkers that literally anything could happen, including a sudden mad rush of patients in cosplay after a disaster occurred at a sci-fi convention.</p> <p>Thank goodness for YouTubers, because you can still see the first 15 minutes of the game, complete with its utter lack of NPC pathfinding:</p>

  <p>It‚Äôs sad that as an industry we appear to be long past crappy TV tie-in games. Who can forget (no matter how hard they try) Telltale‚Äôs abysmal&nbsp;<em>CSI</em> games? Or&nbsp;<em>Deadliest Catch: Alaskan Storm</em>? Let alone&nbsp;<em>Prison Break: The Conspiracy</em>. And no, Netflix churning out mobile games for each new commission doesn‚Äôt count. We need more terrible games based on big-name franchises, or what‚Äôs even the point?</p> <p>Meanwhile, I‚Äôm beginning my campaign for GOG to rescue&nbsp;<em>ER</em> from obscurity, so I don‚Äôt have to be the only person who even remembers it.</p>
