              <p>The Asus ProArt LC 360 AIO is a liquid-cooling solution that combines a 360 mm radiator with 3 Matte Black Fans and a ProArt aesthetic for systems that require style and thermal management. It’s designed as a fully-integrated liquid-cooling system for use with either an Intel LGA 1700, 1200, or 115X socketed system, or an AMD AM4 or AM5 socketed system, giving you the flexibility to easily move the cooling system from one socketed system to another. On the pump housing is an illuminated Status Meter that provides a quick view of the current system load, temperature, and fan speed.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6804/">You can purchase the Asus ProArt LC 360 AIO CPU Liquid Cooling System for $230 at Amazon, saving $60 and 21% off its regular retail price of $290.</a></p>

<h2>An efficient and aesthetically pleasing way to cool your PC</h2>
<p>With the 360mm radiator on the Asus ProArt LC 360 AIO CPU Liquid Cooling System, you have a much larger heat-dissipation area under high-load conditions. The radiator is approximately 15.5″ long and has a narrow profile to accommodate many mid-tower and larger cases that can accept a triple-fan radiator. In addition to the radiator, the overall design of the cooler is intended to provide a clean build experience, with the hardware taking center stage and not overwhelming the build with light effects.</p>
<p>The included AlphaCool Apex Stealth Metal Power fans are matte-black, capable of both airflow and pressure, which is important for pushing air through densely packed radiator fins. These fans can operate up to 3000 RPM, and your motherboard may control the fan speed to optimize performance versus noise level to meet your needs. The fans are daisy-chained together to simplify cable routing, allowing you to connect multiple fans and run a single set of cables to them; this can help declutter the interior of your case after everything is wired.</p>



<p>The pump uses a 3-phase electric motor that delivers adequate coolant flow while operating more quietly than simpler designs. When combined with the 450mm of tubing provided, you can route the tubes to the top or front of supported cases without stressing the fittings. The tubes themselves utilize a braided mesh sleeve to improve durability and create a more finished appearance. Together, these features aim to provide smooth coolant flow to your processor, even during heavy workloads.</p>
<p>The primary goal of the ProArt LC 360 AIO is to provide a balanced build experience, pairing a subtle ProArt aesthetic with higher-end cooling hardware. In addition to the 360mm radiator, the system includes metal-bodied fans, an illuminated status meter, and supports a wide array of socket types. If you’re building a PC that requires a clean build, quiet operation, and no flashing lights, the Asus ProArt LC 360 AIO CPU Liquid Cooling System could be an excellent choice. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6804/">At $230 on sale, down from its typical $290, you receive premium-quality components at a lower cost than you would if you invested in a more elaborate custom loop.</a></p>

              <p>JBL Tune 770NC Headphones are wireless over-the-ear headphones featuring adaptive noise cancellation, smart ambient features, and a lightweight foldable design ideal for watching video, making phone calls, and listening to music. They provide an over-the-ear fit that encloses your ears, Bluetooth 5.3 for a steady wireless connection, and JBL Pure Bass sound that delivers much more bass to your music. Plus, with up to 70 hours of battery life, you can listen to music all day (or longer) without needing to find a power source.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6803/">Go to Amazon to purchase the JBL Tune 770NC Headphones for only $80, down from their retail price of $150. That’s a savings of $70 or 47% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6803/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Headphones that add a new dimension to your favorite music</h2>
<p>The JBL Tune 770NC Headphones feature an Adaptive Noise-Cancelling system that helps eliminate background noise and distractions in crowded areas, so your music or podcast is always at the forefront. The Smart Ambient system on the headphones lets you bring outside sounds back into the headphones without removing either ear cup, and the Ambient Aware and Talk Thru systems let you quickly receive information such as traffic updates and airport announcements, or engage in brief conversations. Both modes can be changed using the JBL Headphones App, and volume, skipping songs, etc., can be controlled with buttons on each ear cup.</p>
<p>When it comes to sound, the JBL Tune 770NC Headphones deliver JBL Pure Bass Sound with solid low-end response while maintaining clarity in both vocals and instruments. Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio enables seamless, consistent wireless audio streaming to any compatible device. Using the JBL Headphones App, you can select the Audio Mode to get richer music or Video Mode for better lip sync, and you can also choose one of several pre-set EQ options or create your own custom curve if you prefer to customize the sound.</p>



<p>A major benefit of the JBL Tune 770NC Headphones is their battery performance. They offer up to 70 hours of playtime per charge. In addition, a 5-minute charge via USB-C can add approximately 3 hours of listening time if you need to recharge quickly. Additionally, a full recharge typically takes approximately 2 hours. That combination of long battery life and rapid charging makes the JBL Tune 770NC Headphones reliable for extended listening.</p>
<p>The JBL Tune 770NC Headphones feature a lightweight, over-the-ear band-style design that fits securely and comfortably on your head. The headphones fold to minimize their size when not in use and can be easily stored in a drawer or backpack. The headphones also support multi-point Bluetooth pairing so that you can connect to two devices simultaneously, and the VoiceAware feature lets you adjust how much of your own voice you hear during phone calls. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6803/">The combination of comfort, foldability, and flexible connections makes the JBL Tune 770NC a good value for a pair of over-the-ear headphones, especially since they can be purchased today for $80</a>, $70 less than their typical retail price of $150.</p>

With support for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, Windows PC, Android, and iOS, one controller can accompany you from the couch to your computer desk, or even to your mobile device.</p>

<h2>The perfect controller for hardcore Xbox players</h2>
<p>The Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Controller contains adjustable-tension thumbsticks. These allow you to adjust the tension to either loose or tight, based on what feels best for you. Shorter hair-trigger locks allow less travel, reducing the time it takes for actions to register. The wraparound rubberized grip covers the back and sides of the controller, providing additional grip during longer gaming sessions.</p>
<p>You can create up to three custom profiles and switch between them with a single button. Button remapping in the Xbox Accessories app lets you place actions wherever it makes sense for your gaming experience and save each profile for future use.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include connecting to Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One consoles via Xbox Wireless, Bluetooth, or the included USB-C cable. Once connected to one of these console types, you can pair your controller with their Windows PC, Android smartphone, or iOS device to enable gameplay and/or other compatible services. You can also use the included 3.5mm stereo headset jack to connect a wired headset to the controller instead of using an available headset port on their system.</p>



<p>When you buy the controller, you’ll get all the necessary accessories to get started using the upgraded controls right away. Included with the controller are the USB-C cable, a D-pad, two standard thumbsticks, and a thumbstick adjustment tool used to adjust the tension system of the thumbsticks. Additional optional parts to further customize the controller are also available for purchase.</p>
<p>The Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Controller combines improved comfort, additional control options, and greater flexibility in how many devices it can connect to, offering users an upgrade. You can expect up to 40 hours of battery life from the controller, reducing the need to recharge it during extended gaming sessions. When taking into account the adjustable hardware, custom profiles, compatibility with multiple devices, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6519/">and the sale price of $110 versus the regular retail price of $150, the Xbox Elite Series 2 Core Controller is a great way to enhance your gaming experience while continuing to utilize the same systems you have been using.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jbl-boombox-4-drops-below-black-friday-prices-as-the-latest-portable-speaker-hits-a-new-low-2000661377</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="585">A dependable portable Bluetooth speaker is one of those essentials you don’t realize you need until the moment music is missing. Whether you’re hosting friends in your living room, hanging out in the backyard, spending a day at the beach, or heading off on a weekend camping trip, good sound can completely define the mood. Phone speakers sitting in red cups simply don’t cut it, and that’s where a powerful option like the JBL Boombox 4 earns its place. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6802/">Right now, it’s even more appealing thanks to its first big price drop that brings it down to $450 — an 18% discount and its lowest prices to date.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6802/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="734" data-end="777">Big, Powerful Sound That Fills Any Space</h2>
<p data-start="587" data-end="1128">The JBL Boombox 4 is built to make a statement, both visually and sonically. Weighing in at about 13 pounds and stretching nearly 20 inches wide, it’s unapologetically large. That size translates directly into sound performance. This speaker delivers room-filling volume with deep, punchy bass that small portable speakers simply can’t match. From blasting music outdoors to filling a large indoor space at a house party, the JBL&nbsp; Boombox 4 creates an immersive, high-energy atmosphere.</p>
<p data-start="1130" data-end="1626">Despite its size, JBL designed the Boombox 4 with portability in mind. A sturdy integrated handle makes it easy to carry from place to place, so moving the party from indoors to outdoors is effortless. It’s also built to handle the elements. With an IP68 waterproof and dustproof rating, the speaker can survive splashes, rain, sand, and poolside accidents without skipping a beat. Durability like that means you can just sit back and enjoy the music instead of worrying about protecting your gear.</p>


<h2 data-start="1805" data-end="1850">All-Day Listening</h2>
<p data-start="1628" data-end="2130">Battery life is another standout. On a full charge, the JBL Boombox 4 can deliver up to 28 hours of continuous playback. That’s more than enough to last through an all-day event and well into the night. If you need even more time, JBL’s Playtime Boost mode can extend listening by up to an additional six hours, bringing it to a maximum of 34 hours of playtime. There’s also a built-in power bank, allowing you to charge your phone or other devices directly from the speaker—super useful when outlets are nowhere to be found.</p>
<p data-start="2132" data-end="2576" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Bluetooth connectivity keeps things simple, letting you stream music from phones, tablets, laptops, or TVs. With Auracast support, you can even link multiple compatible speakers together for synchronized audio throughout a larger space.</p>
<p data-start="2132" data-end="2576" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6802/">The JBL Boombox 4 comes in your choice of three colors.</a> There’s the standard black, a stylish blue, and “Squad” which is a camo pattern. All three options are on sale for the same discounted price of just $450.</p>
