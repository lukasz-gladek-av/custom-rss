It looks sort of, kinda, maybe like an emaciated Cillian Murphy, the star of the first movie. It turns out that is not an emaciated Cillian Murphy, however. Instead, it’s an art dealer who sometimes models and happens to be very, very thin. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,196452,197298" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/11/emaciated-zombie-in-28-years-later-is-not-cillian-murphy-sources-confirm&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2024/dec/11/emaciated-zombie-in-28-years-later-is-not-cillian-murphy-sources-confirm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Guardian</em> reported</a></span> this corrective earlier today, dashing a frenzy of excited fan speculation after the <em>28 Years Later</em> trailer dropped earlier this week. The “Emaciated Infected” is actually played by Angus Neill, who director Danny Boyle had previously met and remembered for his extremely gaunt physique, rather than the star of last year’s summer blockbuster <em>Oppenheimer</em>. </p><p>“Danny told me he’d always had me in mind for the role,” Neill, who specializes in Old Masters paintings, told<em> The Guardian</em>. “So we met up, hit it off, and I agreed to take part. He continued, “On set he has an extraordinary ability to hypnotize you, and working with him on the film was a very, very intense experience.”</p><p>Murphy’s character, meanwhile, survived the original <em>28 Days Later</em> but was completely MIA from the sequel <em>28 Weeks Later</em>, which was made by a different director and writing team entirely. With Boyle and script writer Alex Garland teaming back up for the third movie, Murphy is believed to be involved in the project but hasn’t yet been confirmed in the current cast, which includes Jodie Comer, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, and Ralph Fiennes.</p><p>It’s possible Murphy’s role in the film is a secret to be revealed later, or maybe his character, a random bystander in the first movie, just wouldn’t make any sense showing up in the latest rage virus-fueled apocalypse. For now, fans will have to find something else in the movie’s unsettling trailer to debate. <em>28 Years Later</em> releases on June 20, 2025. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Venture is dressed up as Toph, an earthbender who manipulates stone. This is one of the best fits in the collaboration, since Venture’s kit is all about digging to get around the map. Other skins include Zenyatta as Aang, the titular avatar, Mei as Katar, Orisa as Appa, Genji as Zuko, and Kiriko as Suki.</p><p>We still haven’t seen them in motion in the game itself, but Blizzard did release an animated trailer that emulates the visual style of <em>Avatar </em>and its sequel series <em>The Legend of Korra</em>.

In his quest to seek revenge on his father, he protects his half-brother Dmitri Smerdyakov (Fred Hechinger) and asserts himself as an alpha predator in a world full of prey.

Why does the CGI look like it’s from before the iPhone came out? Who’s telling Russell Crowe his Russian accent is good?
