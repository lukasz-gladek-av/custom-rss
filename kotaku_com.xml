              <p>How much champagne do you charge to the company credit card when <em>GTA 6</em> mercifully shifts out of your release window? Which celebrity will star in <em>Cyberpunk 2</em>? And what game are <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s devs working on next? Welcome to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>People are buzzing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1757300/Jump_Space/">about <em>Jump Space</em></a>, the sci-fi co-op adventure about blowing up spaceships with friends. It comes to Early Access next week and already has an impressive <a href="https://x.com/KeepsakeGames/status/1965398533546160523">post-launch roadmap</a> of updates lined up. How many more cool ship games will we get before<em> Starfield</em>‘s <a href="https://nitter.poast.org/StarfieldGame/status/1963980745728229522#m">next expansion arrives</a>?</p> <h2>It was a good day in the Sucker Punch offices when <em>GTA 6</em> delayed</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sony-ps5-state-of-play-1851786081"><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></a> is one of the biggest game releases of the fall, at least now that <em>GTA 6</em> has been delayed to May 2026. Creative director Nate Fox was asked about that moment in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffOTS1CkZVg">new rapid-fire interview with <em>MinnMax </em></a>(via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/that-was-a-great-day-ghost-of-yotei-studio-screative%20director%20Nate%20Fox"><em>VGC</em></a>). “When<em> GTA 6</em> was delayed, did the entire studio pop some champagne?” host Ben Hanson asked. “We’re all still hungover. Multi-month hangover,” Fox responded. “That was a great day.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-release-date-gta-6-collector-edition-1851777437"><em>Yotei</em>‘s October 2 release date</a> was announced before Rockstar revealed its delay, locking in its fate one way or the other. Fortune favors the bold. Now lots of games that were waiting to come out until 2026 to escape <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-aaaaa-silksong-next-gen-pc-devolver-digital-2000623190">the<em> GTA 6</em> gravity</a> well are faced with a new conundrum: get out ahead of it or come out later in the year and risk stumbling into a second <em>GTA 6</em> delay?</p> <h2 data-cy="article-headline"><em>Helldivers</em>&nbsp;studio’s next game will have a <em>Destiny</em>-style social hub</h2> <p>But what is it, exactly? Arrowhead CEO Shams Jorjani seemed to be speaking off the cuff when he responded to a fan in the game’s Discord who requested a place where <em>Helldivers 2</em> players can hang out in between drops. “It’s on the feature list for the next one,” Jorjani teased. What next one? <em>Helldivers</em> 3? Nope.</p>

 <p>“This was about our next game. Not <em>HD3</em>,” he added <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1nbmucr/comment/nd46h3l/">on Reddit</a>. Some fans are wondering if it’s a nod to the studio’s isometric fantasy multiplayer series <em>Magicka</em>. The studio has already confirmed that its next project, whatever it ends up being, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/05/15/helldivers-2-studios-next-game-will-be-free-from-playstation-partnership/">won’t be published by Sony</a>.</p> <h2>Fans think <em>GTA 6</em> parody website names have leaked</h2> <p>The open-world blockbuster is still over six months away, but in the meantime players may have some fresh teases to parse. What seem like in-game website names <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1002286-gta-vi-general-speculation-discussion-vice-city-baby/page/51/#comment-1072587065">appear to have been registered</a> as real internet domains by Take-Two back in May. They include what-up.app, rydeme.app, and wipeoutcornskin.com. I don’t know if we’re ready for <em>GTA 6</em> in the post-internet, algorithmic slop phase of lampooning pop culture.</p>

 <h2>Will Johnny Silverhand return in <em>Cyberpunk 2</em>?</h2> <p>Because Keanu Reeves would be happy to do it if CD Projekt Red wants him back. “Absolutely,” he <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/johnny-silverhand-actor-keanu-reeves-says-he-absolutely-wants-to-be-in-cyberpunk-2">told<em> IGN</em></a> when asked about reprising the role. “I’d love to play Johnny Silverhand again.” Effectively a virtual ghost in the first game, there’s no reason Silverhand would need to come back in a sequel, but also nothing precluding it either. <em>Cyberpunk 2</em> is set to return to Night City but <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-orion-night-new-city-chicago-cdpr-1851781566">also take players to a new location</a> likened to “Chicago gone wrong.”</p> <h2>Satoru Iwata laughed when he heard about trying to sell <em>Animal Crossing</em> in America</h2> <p>Veteran Nintendo localizer Leslie Swan <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-we-did-try-to-keep-forest-in-the-name-how-mario-64s-princess-peach-helped-bring-animal-crossing-to-the-west">told <em>Time Extension</em></a> that’s how the former president of the company reacted when she told him they were translating the cozy sim. “He just laughed and said, ‘I don’t know how you’re going to do this.’ And it’s true, just everything in that game was so specific to Japan,” she said.</p> <p>Long-time producer Takashi Tezuka was not confident either. “[Tezuka] basically said to me, ‘We’d like to have you localize it’ and I said, ‘Sure.’ But then he said, ‘No, Leslie, I’m not sure you understand, it’s going to be difficult.'” Swan recalled. “And I kept having to assure him that we would make it happen.” Decades later, the franchise is now one of the best selling in the world.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-difficulty-hard-damage-criticism-2000624031"><em>Silksong</em> is harder than <em>Hollow Knigh</em>t, but is that a problem?</a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/black-mirror-memecoin-crypto-web3-2000624006">Tech is beyond parody: even <em>Black Mirror</em> is getting a meme coin</a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-digifarm-hands-on-preview-2000624093"><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em> might be the best JRPG of the fall</a></p> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <title><![CDATA[Lenovo Clears Out Its 4.8-Star Copilot AI Laptop (40GB RAM, 1TB SSD) at 73% Off, You Could Buy Several for the Price of One]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-clears-out-its-4-8-star-copilot-ai-laptop-40gb-ram-1tb-ssd-at-73-off-you-could-buy-several-for-the-price-of-one-2000624145</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo-clears-out-its-4-8-star-copilot-ai-laptop-40gb-ram-1tb-ssd-at-73-off-you-could-buy-several-for-the-price-of-one.1292736/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re out there looking for a solid laptop that can handle basic, everyday tasks, then Lenovo is a manufacturer worth consideration. Maybe you’re a college student in need of something to build out documents and slideshow presentations for your classes. Maybe you’re a small business owner in need of something to, err, build out documents and slideshow presentations for your clients. Web browsing, email drafting, YouTube video watching. You know, computer stuff! Well, take a look at the Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3987/">Right now, Amazon has it on sale for 73% off. It’s listed at $2,999 but after the discount, the price comes to just $800. That’s a savings of $2,200.</a></p>
<p>Okay, but let’s hold our horses for just a moment. A $2,200 discount on a $2,299 laptop? Sounds too good to be true. So yeah, if we take a look at this items price history, we’ll see this listing has only existed on Amazon since the beginning of August. After about two weeks it dropped to the price it’s at now. It briefly went back up when September hit, but now it’s back down to $800.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3987/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>When we take a look at the specs on offer here, you can tell this is not a three thousand dollar machine. Lenovo’s own website has various builds of the IdeaPad Slim 3 in this $600 to $800 range. This listing is trying to trick you into thinking you’re saving a lot more than you are. And that’s a shame because these specs at this price point is a pretty good deal in its own right.</p>
<h2>Deep Dive</h2>
<p>What we have here is a 15.3-inch laptop capable of displaying in 1920 by 1200 HD. The anti-glare non-touch display has 300nits of brightness and a refresh rate of 60Hz. With DisplayPort 1.2 and HDMI 1.4, you can display on two additional monitors (three displays total including the laptop screen).</p>



<p>It’s got a built-in webcam that can record in 720p HD with a shutter so you can maintain privacy when not in use. For added connectivity, you have two USB-A ports and one USB-C port to transfer data or charge your other devices. Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 are also supported.</p>
<p>The real story is its RAM and storage. <strong>It’s working with 40GB of memory and an SSD containing a full 1TB of storage space</strong>. Great for backing up photos and working with large file types like 4K video.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3987/">All and all, this Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 is a worthwhile laptop. At $2,999? Heck no. But at $800? Not bad.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-video-game-rhythm-mod-idea-concept-2000624444</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kpop-demon-hunters-fan-reimagines-the-movie-as-a-video-game-and-i-need-it.1292679/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There was a time when a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>tie-in video game would have been a given. Netflix would have partnered with a studio to create a probably terrible game based on the K-pop group Huntr/x’s music-powered demon-slaying adventures that kids could rent at their local Blockbuster for the weekend after they saw and became obsessed with the movie. Nowadays, movie studios are much more precious about quality control, so we don’t get waves of tie-in video games haphazardly dropping on the eShop or PlayStation Store. And yeah, it’s probably a good thing we don’t have a </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>video game months after the musical blew up on Netflix, but I wouldn’t be surprised if someone at the streaming company has been considering throwing some money around to get one made. What such a game might look like down the line is anyone’s guess, but fans are already creating mock-ups of a </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>game, and I hope one day a studio gets to make one a reality.</span></p> <p><span>JHN Studios is a YouTube channel that creates 8-bit versions of K-pop songs, and while most of their videos are reimaginings of tunes by real-world groups, they are now working their way through the </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>soundtrack. Each of these arrangements is accompanied by retro-style animated videos of a hypothetical </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>rhythm game that recreates the songs’ respective scenes from the movie. I’m obsessed with the excellent sprite work. I want the Rumi as a keychain or pin.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>The actual rhythm gameplay of these mock-ups isn’t that complex, but it does make for a good proof of concept. A rhythm game seems like the obvious choice for a </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>game, and the movie’s incredible tunes have already started worming their way into the mod scene for games like </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thatboygro/video/7529646402599718175"><i><span>Beat Saber</span></i></a><span>, </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@vifalleniv/video/7543302663614598455"><i><span>Friday Night Funkin</span></i><span>’</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@sleepiegoat/video/7528110760031997215"><i><span>Dead as Disco</span></i></a><span>. That being said, I also think the movie would be a natural fit for a retro-style beat-em-up like the projects coming out of Tribute Games, such as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/scott-pilgrim-ex-netflix-tribute-games-anamanaguchi-1851783893"><i><span>Scott Pilgrim EX</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-preview-beat-em-up-tribute-games-1851784757"><i><span>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</span></i></a><span>. Give me a three-player co-op brawler that lets me and two friends smack around some demons while JHN Studios’ chip-tune arrangements play in the background.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>While a game is probably still a pie-in-the-sky dream for the moment, it does sound like Netflix fully intends to capitalize on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ success</span></a><span> with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-theories-questions-netflix-2000620717"><span>a sequel</span></a><span>. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Too many things in our life need to get plugged in. Our phones, watches, headphones — damn near everything that isn’t attached to us needs to be charged at the end of the day. And now that it’s gotten even more complicated that everything is moving away from USB-A to USB-C. Sure, USB-C is a better standard and can do a lot more, but now I’ve got a bunch of USB-A charging blocks that are worthless to me. It’s time for a singular solution. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3985/">Anker has its Prime Charger with a clock LCD display one sale for 35% off. Normally, it goes for $170, but for a limited time the price has shot down to just $110.</a> That’s a savings of $60.</p>
<p>Avoid having a ton of clutter and cables running everywhere at your desk or on your nightstand. The Anker Prime Charger has four USB-C ports and two USB-A ports so you can keep all your devices together and nearby when it’s time to charge them. USB-C i universally compatible so use the hub to charge your laptops whether they are Apple or PC, your phone whether its an iPhone, Galaxy, or something else. Charge your earbuds, tablets, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3985/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Anker Prime Charger is capable of a maximum output of 250W between its six different ports. Three of the four USB-C ports each support 100W individually. The first one is special, capable of an output of 140W. Over that one, you can charge your stuff super quickly. A 16-inch MacBook Pro can go from zero to 50% in just 25 minutes. It will be fully charge in just over an hour and a half.</p>
<h2>Tailor Your Charging With Smart Power Control</h2>
<p>The dial on the side of the hub can be used to adjust the charging priority for your various devices plugged in. You can choose between port priority mode, dual laptop mode, or low current mode. Or just select AI power mode to have it automatically adjust to what is optimal.</p>



<p>The front of the USB hub is equipped with a large 2.26-inch display which can showcase the time and date. This makes it a lovely addition to your nightstand or your desktop while working. When you devices are plugged into any of the front USB-C ports, the display will visualize its charging status with dynamic animation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3985/">For a limited time, the Anker Prime Charger for USB-C and USB-A charging has dropped in price by $60.</a> Get it now for just $110 before it goes back up.</p>
