              <p>On Sunday, Vince Zampella, executive vice president at EA, head of Respawn, and one of the devs who helped create <em>Call of Duty</em>, was killed in a car crash in Southern California.</p> <p>On Monday, <a href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/video-game-developer-vince-zampella-crash-call-of-duty/3819576/"><em>NBC4</em> reported that Zampella</a> was killed in a single-car crash involving a 2026 Ferrari 296 GTS that happened on December 21 at 12:45 pm local time on a road north of Los Angeles in the San Gabriel Mountains. California Highway Patrol told the outlet that the car veered off the road and collided with a concrete barrier. The car’s passenger was ejected from the vehicle. The driver was reportedly trapped in the ensuing car fire and died at the scene. The passenger reportedly died later at a nearby hospital.</p> <p>No details have been released as to why the car crashed, nor did <em>NBC</em> specify if Zampella was the one driving. <em>Kotaku</em> has contacted EA.</p> <p>“It’s hard to process this right now. He was such a force in the industry and for him to be just gone I still can’t believe,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/witdarkstar.bsky.social/post/3mam2erg6bk2s">shared</a> Respawn developer Patrick Wren on social media.</p>

 <p>“I was fortunate enough to work with Vince a few times, and it was always a pleasure. This sucks,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thevowel.bsky.social/post/3mam2borh622r">posted</a> former Xbox operations manager Eric Neustadter.</p> <p>The 55-year-old game developer was one of the key people behind the creation of <em>Call of Duty.</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/when-call-of-dutys-creators-left-they-took-a-lot-of-pe-5817329">He later left that franchise</a> and helped co-found Respawn in 2010 with fellow <em>CoD</em> developer Jason West. The studio’s first game was the critically acclaimed Xbox-only, EA-published <em>Titanfall</em>. It would later produce a sequel, a popular battle royale spin-off, and two highly successful <em>Star Wars</em> action games, <em>Jedi: Fallen Order</em> and <em>Jedi: Survivor.</em> In 2017, Respawn was acquired by EA and became a key part of the publisher’s roster of studios. In 2021, Zampella was put in charge of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-modern-day-specialists-classes-release-da-1851649399"><em>Battlefield</em> and helped the series rebound</a> with this year’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-sales-black-ops-7-charts-2000645794">massively successful <em>Battlefield 6</em>,</a> which is one of 2025’s biggest games. Meanwhile, the franchise he helped create, <em>Call of Duty</em>, continues to be one of the biggest game franchises in the world.</p>

              <p>Goodness gracious, 2025 has been a fantastic year for video games, and most excitingly, for games of all scales and budgets. Big-name releases have hit the spot, while indies have sprung from nowhere to become breakthrough hits, such that wrestling them all down to a top 10 with which I’m happy has been an ordeal. But I got there, and I’m happy with it. I’ve also rather shocked myself by putting two big-name games in the top two spots, thus losing my cool indie credentials. Thankfully the rest of the list makes up for it.</p> <p>My technique for putting these lists together is to read every other site’s top charts, getting angry with the generic crap that’s getting overly lauded, and then scroll through the <a href="https://kotaku.com/its-horrifying-just-how-little-time-steam-users-spend-playing-new-games-2000654158">183 new games</a> I played this year on PC alone. Then I pick the 10 which are objectively the best ones, and rank them in a scientifically proven and unquestionable order of goodnessosity, for an irrefutable list on which history is established.</p>

 <hr> <h2><strong>10) Eclipsium</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655149" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655149"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655149">© Housefire</figcaption></figure> <p>I installed&nbsp;<em>Eclipsium</em> on the basis of the screenshots, and <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2025/10/eclipsium/">am so glad I did</a>. I’m so pleased to see the game got some attention from others too, with the extraordinary art in this walking-sim horror game astonishing everyone who saw it. This is a peculiar and striking game, combining truly beautiful vistas and horrendous body horror, and it’s so damned interesting. Every surface ripples with pixels, such that the world is only truly tangible when you’re moving, giving everything an organic feeling of <em>breathing</em>. It’s a 3D game that’s then re-rendered onto a 320×180 canvas, with a 12FPS human hand added as your means of interaction with the world. The effect is extraordinary, ensuring an already intriguing and surreal experience is all the more compelling.</p>

 <hr> <h2><strong>9) The Drifter</strong></h2> <p><span>© Powerhoof / Kotaku</span></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-drifter-point-and-click-adventure-powerhoof-review-1851786671"><em>The Drifter</em></a> starts out looking like a traditional point-and-click adventure, before revealing two super-important things: Firstly, an immediately fascinating story that <em>might be</em> about some peculiar secret forces causing the disappearance of homeless people, and secondly, a control scheme for old-school adventures that makes so much sense in the modern world. Its innovative design for controllers needs to be copied by absolutely everyone else out there, forever.</p>

 <p>The game then divides itself into distinct chapters, with a limited number of locations available in each, to keep the developing story moving along nicely. I’m not a big fan of the ending, but what makes&nbsp;<em>The Drifter</em> stand out is that this doesn’t feel like it matters as much as it normally might in a narrative game. It’s still great fun, and everything that comes before the conclusion is so thrilling. Plus there’s fabulous voice acting, gorgeous art, and some really neat puzzles.</p>

 <hr> <h2><strong>8) MotionRec</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655153" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655153"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655153">© Hansum / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Here’s the conceit of 2D platform-puzzler <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2025/11/motionrec/"><em>MotionRec</em></a>: You can record your movement for a short while, and then “replay” that motion elsewhere in a level irrespective of the platforms available. So let’s say you need to get to a distant point at the top right, and there’s just a void before you. Record yourself climbing a flight of steps from bottom left to top right elsewhere, then replay it here. The further you go, the more superbly elaborate this all becomes, until you’re solving puzzles that would have absolutely flummoxed you near the start.</p>

 <p>The game pretends to be 15 levels long, but the truth is it’s 30, and that’s good to know before you play. There’s something psychologically unsettling about thinking you’re winding down to an end, only to learn you’re only halfway through, and it’s far more pleasant to work through with the knowledge. Also, that second half is wildly more difficult than the first, meaning it’ll take you an awful lot longer to figure out. The game is so clever, and the sparing pixel art amazingly well used, making&nbsp;<em>MotionRec</em> my favorite in a very strong field of puzzle games in 2025.</p>

 <hr> <h2>7) Escape from Duckov</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655160" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655160"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655160">© Team Soda</figcaption></figure> <p>I was pretty sure&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov</em> was a goof. You know how Steam’s charts get clogged up with those god-awful achievement farms, “games” like&nbsp;<em>Banana</em> suddenly seeing hundreds of thousands of simultaneous players, despite being borderline nothingness? I thought, from the name and its sudden popularity, that this was one of those. Nope! So is it a simple spoof? An <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> knock-off but with duck skins? No, it’s that either! It turns out this single-player extraction shooter from a team of five <a href="https://kotaku.com/blue-prince-ps5-save-bug-crash-patch-update-1851781990">is a superb game in its own right</a>, a compelling loop of outside runs of derring-do, and base-building with the loot you gathered. It’s a twin-stick isometric shooter at heart, with vast locations to explore and quests that encourage you to venture ever-further away from safety, always carrying the grim risk of losing everything. So, an extraction shooter. But with ducks. And no other stinky, horrible players to ruin your day. I ended up spending far longer with this game than I ever thought I would, and just writing about it now is making me itch to switch back from <em>Arc Raiders</em> for my adrenaline fix.</p> <hr> <h2><strong>6) Old Skies</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655168" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655168"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655168">© Wadjet Eye / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It took me a little longer to warm up to&nbsp;<em>Old Skies</em> than I did to Wadjet Eye’s previous stunning adventure, <em>Unavowed</em>. But warm up I did, until I was <a href="https://kotaku.com/old-skies-wadjet-eye-adventure-pc-steam-unavowed-1851777432">singing from the rooftops</a> about this wonderful point-and-click tale of time travel tourism. You play as Fia Quinn, a “time agent” who accompanies the rich on their travels back to moments in the past to ensure they don’t attempt to change anything important in history. Told in chapters, Quinn’s tale eventually begins to weave an over-arching narrative as various events begin to interconnect.</p> <p>Something I particularly loved about&nbsp;<em>Old Skies</em>, apart from its fantastic writing, acting and art, is that it&nbsp;<em>isn’t</em> obsessed with the butterfly effect, or an obsessive preservation of history. Instead, this is a future where events are <em>constantly</em> being altered by the actions of those visiting the past, with only certain key events preserved as unchangeable. And one of those is 9/11, allowing long-time New Yorker Dave Gilbert to revisit his own experiences of that day in a way that’s effective and affecting, without ever being intrusive or ghoulish. It’s a time travel story like you’ve never heard before, and a splendid adventure game to boot.</p>

 <hr> <h2><strong>5) Strange Antiquities</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655169" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655169"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655169">© Bad Viking / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I completely missed&nbsp;<em>Strange Horticulture</em> in 2022. An odd aspect of my job is that if an indie game is already getting lots of mainstream attention, it becomes a far lower priority for me to play so I can focus on the completely unknown and try to get more eyes their way instead. And what a shame, because what a game! However, when commissioned to write an interview with the developers of the sequel, I quickly put that right and played the original before this year’s second game. And what a treat that was!</p> <p>Both games have you working in a small shop, selling plants in the original, obscure items here, to a range of customers, but nothing in your store is labelled and you must identify them through interacting with a huge range of clues. And wow, what a far greater range there is in <em>Antiquities </em>than its predecessor, with its wonderful spread of ways to interact with items, the piles of pamphlets and letters, its multiple maps with locations to explore (in text adventure format), and secret compartments to discover. It’s a breathtakingly smart game, endlessly delightful in the ingenuity of the challenges, and it comes with a hint system that goes well out of its way to get you past a block without spoiling anything.</p>

 <hr> <h2><strong>4) Donkey Kong Bananza</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655174" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655174"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655174">© Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>I’ve gotta admit, I was a bit deflated after I bought my Switch 2.&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em> felt like such an anticlimax to me, a game that didn’t seem significantly more interesting than previous entries, and with an open-world I was so excited to explore, and so disappointed to experience. It was, oddly enough, replaying&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> on the device that won me over—the doors finally opened the moment you shot them! And then along came&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza.</em></p> <p>Look, you can hate me as much as you want, but I never really got on with the old <em>Donkey Kong Country </em>games. I KNOW. I’m wrong. I’m not denying it. But it rather flattened my excitement for the <em>other</em> Switch 2 game of 2025. So what a happy boy I was once I started playing! Oh my goodness, this is what I like to pretend represents Nintendo, rather than the <a href="https://kotaku.com/bowser-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-10-million-in-hacking-la-1848172917">spiteful, lawyer-forward</a> corporation it too often reveals itself to be: a giant box of joyful fun. It’s a game that just wants to be played, to be thoroughly enjoyed as much as is humanly possible, uninterested in pushing you away or restricting your options for distractions. I deliberately played&nbsp;<em>Bananza</em> as slowly as I could, going back and seeking out every last banana on every level once I realized I was getting close to the end, because I didn’t want it to be over. It’s rare that games are this much pure fun.</p> <hr> <h2><strong>3) The Beekeeper’s Picnic</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655192" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655192"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655192">© Afoot Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Did I really enjoy&nbsp;<a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2025/04/the-beekeepers-picnic/"><em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em></a> more than&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>? Well, the question itself reveals the complete stupidity of ranking such lists at all. This is, really, ten games I really enjoyed in 2025, and I’ve ranked them based on incoherent vibes. It’s almost as silly to compare a manic 3D action game about smashing rocks to a genteel 2D story about an elderly Sherlock Holmes as it is to compare it to a favorite fruit or particularly enjoyable train ride. They are utterly dissimilar, and both completely wonderful.</p>

 <p><em>The Beekeeper’s Picnic</em> is a love letter. It’s a love letter to the entire canon of Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes stories, a love letter to classic point-and-click adventures,&nbsp;<em>and</em> a love letter in and of itself. This is a game about a post-Great War Sherlock Holmes re-retiring to Sussex and confronting himself over his lifelong treatment of his closest friend, John Watson. As Watson returns from the front lines, where the old man returned to the army as a medic, Holmes delightedly welcomes him into his new countryside cottage, and wants to show his affection for the doctor by putting together a picnic. That’s the setup, and it’s gorgeous.</p> <p>Even better, creator Helen Greetham is a devoted fan of the Holmes stories, and understands them in a way that almost every recent Sherlock-based media has not. It begins with a scene set toward the end of&nbsp;<em>The Adventure of the Three Garridebs</em>, to establish Doyle’s own representation of the love between these two men, before moving to 1918 to tell a new story set after any in the official series. To present a softened Holmes, a man finally able to be reflective and introspective instead of simply an objective detective, is so brave, and could so easily have come across as disingenuous. But Greetham’s deep knowledge and respect for the character ensures it always feels utterly valid. I adored it. I find myself thinking about it. I have <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-beekeepers-picnic-sherlock-holmes-game-review-1851776762">so much more to say about it</a> than I do most other games I played this year. Yeah, you know what, I think I&nbsp;<em>did</em> enjoy it more than&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>.</p> <hr> <h2><strong>2) Arc Raiders</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655179" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655179"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655179">© Embark Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I was not expecting to like&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>. I was, in fact, not the least bit interested in playing <em>Arc Raiders</em>. Online games in which I have to interact with other players are my kryptonite, and on learning that there was no PvE mode, I didn’t even want to bother. But then I kept reading <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198">Claire’s</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-solo-night-raid-quest-pvp-pve-2000641437">articles</a> on <em>Kotaku</em> about how much fun she was having, and I dunno…she convinced me to try. I’m so glad.</p> <p>Even after this, it didn’t seem likely I’d stick with it. I messaged a friend to say, “I’m going to try playing&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders.</em>” His reply: “I can’t think you’ll enjoy it.” A month later, I’m hooked.</p>

 <p>As I’ve previously documented, <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-extraction-shooter-constantly-dying-2000649095">I’m pretty dreadful at the game</a>, although I am improving. I haven’t died for so long now that the next failure is going to hurt like&nbsp;<em>hell</em>, genuinely to the point where I find myself a little reluctant to try sometimes. Then I see a quest I’m sure I can do, moderate what I’m willing to take with me, and get out there. Although I&nbsp;<em>have</em> given up playing on Xbox until I next die, since I’m significantly more comfortable with a mouse and keyboard.</p> <p>I’m not sure I’d ever have found my way into this if I’d not played&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov</em> first, but now I’m totally all in on solo-able extraction shooters. (Never, ever going to play in a team, ever, not never.) I love the world Embark has built. I love the stunning graphics, especially the game’s <em>air</em>, which is a mad thing to be excited about but it keeps taking me aback. I love the utter terror of creeping around buildings, of spamming, “Don’t shoot!” if I see another player, or delightedly responding with an “OK!” if someone else says it first. I love&nbsp;<em>just</em> making it into an elevator with nothing to spare. God <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-sliding-steps-embark-studios-2000650065">I love sliding down the stairs</a>. I still haven’t found enough fucking lemons to upgrade my chicken, and I love that this is a sentence I’m typing.</p>

 <p>I’m having so much fun playing a game I thought was absolutely not for me, in a genre I didn’t think I’d ever care about, and that’s a truly spectacular thing. Now, all they need to do is <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gen-ai-nexon-eurogamer-voices-2000643436">replace the sodding AI voices</a> and I can stop feeling guilty about it, too.</p> <hr> <h2><strong>1) Avowed</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655186" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655186"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655186">© Obsidian / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>January and February games do have a habit of slipping out of end of year lists, so it’s testament to Obsidian’s <em>Avowed</em> that it hasn’t left my mind since I finished it. What a big, beautiful RPG, unquestionably the best of 2025, with companions that feel like old friends, characters I find myself wondering about, and massive world-changing choices of significant consequence.&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em> is up there with my all-time favorites,&nbsp;<em>Knights of the Old Republic</em>,&nbsp;<em>Neverwinter Nights 2</em>, <em>Mass Effect</em> and&nbsp;<em>Planescape Torment</em>, a game I cannot wait to return to when it’s been long enough that I’ve forgotten the finer details.</p>

 <p>Oh, and it’s a third game in the world of <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, one of the finest RPG series gaming has to offer.&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em>‘s use of the setting offers huge amounts to faithful fans, while remaining completely accessible to anyone visiting for the first time. That’s thanks to the Living Lands being a unique setting in the realm of Eora, such that it sits distinct from the <em>Pillars</em> tales of untrustworthy gods, while still in a world reeling from their revelations.</p> <p>Kai is an all-time great RPG companion, and it bewilders me that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avowed">Wikipedia page for&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em></a> still lists that there’s no companion romance in the game. It’s not just that it’s the same voice actor as Garrus; I love him like I love Garrus, and I feel like I miss him since we stopped hanging around.</p> <p>The setting is an all-time great RPG land, with its disparate biomes keeping things fresh, and the parkour-ish climbing and jumping adds a verticality that RPGs rarely see. But, of course, more than anything else it’s about experiencing a story in the company of brilliant characters, which no one else does quite like Obsidian. (No, not even Larian, although I have no shade for the incredible&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>.)</p> <p>Thinking back on&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em> doesn’t feel like remembering a video game I played this year, but more like reflecting on a place I inhabited, the people I knew there, and the adventures we had. That’s truly special, and it’s why&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em> is very definitely my game of 2025.</p>

 <hr> <h2>Honorable Mentions</h2> <p>I have&nbsp;<em>so</em> many other games I loved this year, and I’m going to have forgotten to mention loads of them, and perhaps even one I’d have put in the top 10 if I remembered. But those I&nbsp;<em>can</em> remember to call out are:</p> <ul> <li><em>Dawnfolk</em></li> <li><em>Slender Threads</em></li> <li><em>Wizordum</em></li> <li><em>Crashlands 2</em></li> <li><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></li> <li><em>Ooo</em></li> <li><em>Project Warlock II</em></li> <li><em>The Supper: New Blood</em></li> <li><em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em></li> <li><em>Strange Jigsaws</em></li> <li><em>Time Flies</em></li> <li><em>Gigasword</em></li> <li><em>The Crazy Hyper Dungeon Chronicles</em></li> </ul>

              <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="12 minutes, 13 seconds Yeah. any artist amongst athletes,">Timothée Chalamet is one of the biggest actors around right now after starring in hit movies like <em>Dune</em> and <em>Wonka</em>. But before that, he was just a teenager on YouTube trying to get big by modding and painting Xbox 360 controllers. And the director behind his upcoming film, <em>Marty Supreme,</em> wanted the 29-year-old actor to tap into that part of his life while filming.</p> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="12 minutes, 13 seconds Yeah. any artist amongst athletes,">Arriving in theaters nationwide on Christmas, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9gSuKaKcqM"><em>Marty Supreme</em></a> stars Chalamet as Marty Mauser, a young and scrappy wannabe table tennis pro who works hard, deals with plenty of naysayers, and pushes through various obstacles on his mission to turn his passion into a career. To help Chalamet properly portray Mauser, who is loosely based on a real table tennis pro,<em> Marty Supreme</em> director and co-writer Josh Safdie told the young actor to remember his days making YouTube videos about gamepads.</p>

 <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="12 minutes, 13 seconds Yeah. any artist amongst athletes,">“[Director] Josh [Safdie] wanted me to tap into, you know, he was always talking about, like, I modded controllers on YouTube growing up,” <a href="https://youtu.be/NhMqMdu6Wlc?t=757">Chalamet told the <em>BBC</em> in a recent interview.</a> “He’s like that part of you. He’s like the hustler part of you. The swaggerful part of you.”</p>

 <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="12 minutes, 13 seconds Yeah. any artist amongst athletes,">And yeah, in case this is news to you: <a href="https://kotaku.com/dune-s-timothee-chalamet-was-once-an-xbox-youtuber-1847946368">Chalamet used to have a small YouTube channel back in 2010</a> where he uploaded a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/3ab835/is-this-timothee-chalamets-xbox-modding-youtube-channel-an-investigation?utm_source=VICE_Twitter&amp;utm_medium=social+">few short videos of himself showing off modded and customized Xbox 360 controllers</a>. The channel was aptly titled ModdedController360, and in 2021, Chalamet admitted to running the channel, which has since sadly been removed from YouTube. Thankfully, people have saved some of the videos, like this one of Chalamet, who never reveals his face, showing off a “sexy” red tiger paint job.</p>

  <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="12 minutes, 13 seconds Yeah. any artist amongst athletes,">Here’s what Chalamet had to say about the channel <a href="https://youtu.be/Xv5l-hisFuA?t=486">back in 2021</a>, when he revealed he was the one behind it: “I had a YouTube channel people found. It’s YouTube dot com back-slash ‘ModdedController360.’ And I used to paint-mod controllers, I did three, and I spray-painted them and…opened them up, and I would charge people $10.”</p>

 <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="12 minutes, 13 seconds Yeah. any artist amongst athletes,">According to the actor, it didn’t take off, though he made $30 off three clients.&nbsp;If you own one of those controllers, I bet it’s worth a lot more than $10 in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> Chapter 7 introduced a Kim Kardashian skin into the battle royale’s shop as part of its Icon series, and though the media mogul and long-time law student wouldn’t be my first choice, she’s apparently everyone else’s (</span><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fortnite-kim-k-most-popular-skin-landslide/"><span>h/t TheGamer</span></a><span>). According to recent stats from the independently operated site </span><a href="http://fortnite.gg/"><span>Fortnite.GG</span></a><span>, which scrapes publicly available information from the game and presents it in easy-to-read graphs, the “Iconic Kim Kardashian” skin, which first hit </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>’s shop on December 13, is the most popular skin of the season, with around 5 percent of players using it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For reference, the second-most used skin in Chapter 7 is Backlash, a sought-after, in-universe cosmetic that some players believe offers an in-game advantage because it can somewhat camouflage itself in certain areas on the map. Then there’s Cat Holloway, another in-universe character, followed by Chani, Zendaya’s character from the </span><i><span>Dune</span></i><span> series. There are only four other skins in the top 15 that aren’t original </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> creations: Catwoman, rapper Playboi Carti, Lara Croft, and The Bride from </span><i><span>Kill Bill</span></i><span>. According to Fortnite GG, Kim Kardashian ranks 70th in all-time </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> cosmetic usage, and she’s only been available for a week and a half.</span></p>

 <p><span>The Kim Kardashian bundle, which is available in-store until December 28, is currently on sale for 3,000 V-Bucks (which is around $19). The bundle includes the Iconic Kim Kardashian skin (a black, latex-style catsuit reminiscent of one of her SKIMS styles); a regular Kim Kardashian skin (a removable fur coat, crop-top, and pants), two backpacks, two pickaxes, two emotes, and a glider.</span></p>

 <p><span>Though I find some of her items to be painfully boring, this is one of the better </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> skins I’ve seen for a major celebrity in terms of its recreation of Kardashian’s likeness (likely because she is particularly precious with her image) and its variety, which we’ll get to in a sec.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">2025 was a big year for Dill Bits. <a href="https://t.co/JqZ3LWna8S">pic.twitter.com/JqZ3LWna8S</a></p> <p>— Fortnite (@Fortnite) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite/status/2002725861011947999?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>A </span><a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/2002725861011947999/photo/1"><span>December 21 post on the official </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> X account</span></a><span> showing some 2025 highlights suggests these numbers are fairly accurate: the graphic shows that there were 37.5 million games played with Kim Kardashian (and 6.7 million games played with full squads of Sabrina Carpenters).&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Kim Kardashian has a massive reach in the world of pop culture—her TV show, </span><i><span>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</span></i><span>, regularly pulls in millions of viewers, and she has over 350 million followers on Instagram, putting her in the top ten most-followed accounts on the social media app (she’s got more than </span><span>Beyoncé</span><span>).&nbsp; But I think her popularity as a </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> skin isn’t </span><i><span>just</span></i><span> because she’s a shrewd businesswoman who has cleverly tied her pop culture image into several successful brands.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>First, the Kim Kardashian Icon skin is incredibly customizable, more so than most skins in the game. Like Kardashian herself, many of the items in her bundle are basic. The crop top outfit is pedestrian, the makeup brush pick axe is expected (and she doesn’t even have a makeup brand anymore), and the private jet glider is whatever. But her Iconic catsuit skin has </span><i><span>so</span></i><span> many variations that you’re getting a ton of value for the cost. It can be a tank top, a mock neck, a turtle neck, or strapless. You can choose from seven different colors, some of which look more metallic or latex-y than others. You can put gloves on her or remove them. She can wear sunglasses or not. And her hair can be up in a messy bun, or down and either blonde or brunette.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s this customization, coupled with </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>’s vibrant community of girls and gays, that makes Kardashian’s skin so popular. Now the crew can drop in as a whole squad of varied Kims and mine the skin for its rich meme potential. I’ve seen dozens of clips of Kim K players </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@royaljkr/video/7583534305326959894"><span>hunting down a Chun-Li,</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@fasher_off/video/7583810227443666198"><span>dancing in a circle with Peely</span></a><span>, or using the pocketbook pickaxe to</span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@user1235787271/video/7583773343791336759"><span> recreate an iconic </span><i><span>Keeping Up with the Kardashians</span></i><span> clip.</span></a><span> Sabrina Carpenter’s skin was popular for similar reasons: it had several style options and, when coupled with her TikTok-friendly music and emotes, offered a steady stream of clip fodder.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>And of course, there’s the gooner element. </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> players used to love the aforementioned Chun-Li skin because of her ample ass, and now they’ve got Kim Kardashian’s behind to ogle while playing.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If you want to get </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>’s Kim Kardashian skin, it’s available until December 28.&nbsp;</span></p>
