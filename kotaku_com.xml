You can feel the devs really cared about <em>RoboCop</em> and his world when crafting the FPS, which includes RPG elements and multiple endings. And now, less than two years later, the same team behind <em>Rogue City</em> are ready to release a standalone follow-up, and I’m very excited. </p><p>On March 6, publisher Nacon announced <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527760/RoboCop_Rogue_City__Unfinished_Business/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527760/RoboCop_Rogue_City__Unfinished_Business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished</em></a></span> <em>Business</em>, which the developers describe as a “new standalone adventure” set after the events of <em>Rogue City.</em> It’s arriving later this year on consoles and PC. And once again, players will hop into the metal boots of RoboCop as he takes on crime, corruption, robots, and a lot of dudes with guns. </p><p>This time around, RoboCop is sent into OmniTower, a massive apartment complex designed to help the most needy in Old Detroit. However, a group of mercs armed with “cutting-edge weapons” has taken over the entire building and turned it into a fortress. Robo has to kick ass and clear the place out. </p><p>Thankfully, RoboCop has some new weapons, including an ice cannon that can literally “freeze” enemies, and will also have access to new finishing moves involving different parts of the environment. </p><p>Perhaps the most intriguing addition to <em>Unfinished Business</em> are a series of missions where players will take on the role of Alex Murphy before he became RoboCop. The devs promise these missions will tie into the larger storyline of the sequel, while also revealing a new side of the famous police officer. But you’ll have to be careful as during these missions you are just a regular dude with neither superpowers nor a robot body. I’m very intrigued to see how these missions play, as they could be a great way to shake up the experience.</p><p>If you haven’t played <em>RoboCop: Rogue City </em>yet, well, now is a great time to check it out. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1681430/RoboCop_Rogue_City/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1681430/RoboCop_Rogue_City/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The original game is currently on sale on Steam for just $10 which is a steal.</a></span></p><p>As for the recently announced follow up, it doesn’t have a specific release date yet. Instead, Nacon says to expect<em> RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business </em>on Xbox, PS5, and PC sometime in Q3 2025. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The first thing I thought after typing on it was: this feels amazing and I don’t want to stop using it. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The L5 HE 8K is pitched as a hyper-precise, cutting-edge gaming keyboard. It’s called that because it has a polling rate of 8,000. That’s how many times a second it’s sending inputs to your gaming rig, giving you every miniscule time advantage possible when firing off an ultimate in <em>Overwatch</em> 2 or toggling items in <em>Dota 2</em>. This is, in my experience, complete overkill, but the rest of the mechanical keyboard is so good it doesn’t really matter. </p><p>I’ve been typing and gaming on the “Dark Master” L5 HE 8K test model Lemokey sent me for review (it’s black with a red escape key) and I still get a little dopamine hit every time my fingers punch the keys. They’re firm but plucky. The strokes are surprisingly smooth yet satisfyingly responsive. They sound like fat raindrops hitting a metal warehouse roof and feel like running your hand through a barrel of rich, darkly roasted coffee beans. Not bad for a $200 gaming keyboard that boasts top-shelf build quality and some impressive bells and whistles. </p><figure id="" data-id="482d61862c1fc837496b730d197c3988" data-recommend-id="image://482d61862c1fc837496b730d197c3988" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1505" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A keyboard is held up over a desk.

The final versions will be more expensive when they join the rest of Lemokey’s lineup, the gaming brand from mechanical keyboard maker Keychron. It’s a pricey package that has the specs and looks to back it up. In addition to the 8K polling rate and 32K Hz scan rate, the key selling point is magnetic Hall Effect switches and 0.01mm actuation sensitivity. Lemokey’s browser software (online only) can be used to then customize the precise distance each key needs to travel to register input, as well as assign hotkey combinations and other shortcuts.</p><p>The result is effectively a keyboard limited only by the speed of your own fingers and the grey matter controlling them. The other way of putting this is: it won’t matter for most people. Did I play better on the L5 HE 8K? Score more goals in <em>Rocket League</em>? Get more kills in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>? Not really. But I certainly enjoyed doing all of those things more than on my current default, the no-frills Ducky Zero 6108. And the ultra-sensitive snappiness of actuation points calibrated just so does add a new layer of control. </p><p>The 75 percent formfactor means there’s no number pad and keys like Print Screen have also been jettisoned. It’s a compact layout that’s just shy of feeling cramped, though I wouldn’t have minded more room. A small, gumdrop-sized dial at the top right doesn’t feel as good as the rest of the keyboard, but gets the job done. The L5 HE 8K is wired only, and the RGB backlighting is great but can’t be adjusted on a key-by-key basis. A strip of light running across the back of the keyboard is a nice <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMT8tRrEMC4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMT8tRrEMC4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tron</em>-like</a></span> accent.</p><figure id="" data-id="45e71013669903cfb0f05f50783b847c" data-recommend-id="image://45e71013669903cfb0f05f50783b847c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="2656" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A keyboard sits on a desk.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A more obvious potential drawback is the lack of adjustable feet. There’s no adjusting the angle of the keyboard, which could be a deal breaker for those with palms that don’t perfectly align. Mine adjusted just fine, even if I could feel the longer sessions building up tension in my knuckles. The double-shot PBT keycaps do feel rich and durable and are hot-swappable (and were surprisingly hard to get off the switches when I pulled them off).</p><p>One silver lining to the  L5 HE 8K’s lack of wireless portability is that it sits on my desk like a long black paper weight in the best way possible. The 4.2 lbs. CNC metal case offers complete stability, like you’re typing into a mini-gravity well. It’s sleek and minimalist looking, but conveys the same premium pleasure of pulling out a heavy metal credit card at the hotel bar (and without the terrible compounding interest rates). Gasket mounting helps cushion the metal too, with the option to top mount instead. </p><p>The luxurious button feel, cool design sense, and overall quality of the package are the L5 HE 8K’s main selling points, in my opinion. The rapid input, zero-latency gaming and precise actuation customization are just the cherries on top. There are lots of magnetic Hall Effect switch options out there, including Keychron’s own Q3 Max, but the L5 HE 8K holds its own in terms of both performance, customization, and more intangibles like the underlying build-feel. The off-white option with cream keys looks especially nice. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s like we’ve lost all sense of how to experience a story if it doesn’t constantly give us theory-crafting fodder.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In a way, this is a prison of <em>Severance</em>’s own making. The best mystery box shows are regimented and intentional, leading viewers by the hand through a dark hallway, illuminating only a few steps at a time before finally bringing us out the other side. <em>Severance</em>, not beholden to the 20+ episode season syndication deals that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-explained-dan-erickson-1851743150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-season-2-explained-dan-erickson-1851743150">undermined the pacing of shows like <em>Lost</em></a></span>, feels especially methodical, showing fans exactly what it wants them to see and letting them extrapolate over the next week about what it all means. Whereas a network show may be beholden to the whims of executives who decide to keep the story and its mysteries going beyond what its creators intended, the creators of <em>Severance </em>have the creative freedom to focus on a core mystery without worrying about such external pressures.</p><p>Series director Ben Stiller has been up front about how deliberately the <em>Severance </em>team has been developing the show. In an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://collider.com/severance-season-3-plans-explained/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://collider.com/severance-season-3-plans-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Collider</em></a></span>, he explained that the team doesn’t want <em>Severance </em>to become a show that drags on forever just because it’s become successful, and that’s a key part of why its mystery works.</p><p>“You have a responsibility to the audience that you’re going somewhere with it,” Stiller told <em>Collider</em>. “That’s always been a part of it for us, really understanding where it’s heading to, and Apple’s been really supportive of that and been sensitive to what the story is and not saying, ‘Okay, this is something that has to keep going as long as it’s successful.’ It should go as long as the story goes, and that’s something we have an idea of, and we’re working towards as we’re starting up our Season 3 work.”</p><p>That intentionality is what makes the accusations that “Sweet Vitriol” is mere “filler” feel like missing the forest for the trees. At just 37 minutes, it’s the shortest episode in the show’s history, and it abandons the disconcerting severed floor at Lumon Industries entirely to focus on the exemplary Patricia Arquette’s Harmony Cobel. After fleeing Lumon following attempts by the company to remove her from her original position managing the MDR crew (or perhaps Lumon had something more permanent in mind), Cobel drives to a small, out-of-the-way factory town built by Lumon that’s practically deserted. It’s a haunting, dying reminder that a corporation will build up people and places just to abandon them the second they’re no longer useful. I’m sure the ex-manager found it clarifying to see the town where she was raised by Lumon as a child laborer desecrated and left to rot, even as its former citizens still praise Lumon founder Kier Eagan like a god.</p><p>But the rot runs deeper than a town left to die by its corporate overlords. Despite all the claims by fans that the episode is “filler” and offers nothing meaningful to the broader <em>Severance </em>mystery, it actually drops one of the biggest bombshells yet on the Lumon legacy, one that was worth an entire episode’s 37-minute runtime to lead into it. Cobel returns to her childhood home, which is on the outskirts of Lumon’s town and full of its own mysteries just like the Lumon Industries office. The difference is that most of those mysteries were explained by the end of an episode, rather than spread across a season and designed with theory-crafting in mind. Cobel’s aunt Sissy, a devout Lumon follower, is still here, still praising a corporate founder who left her and everyone else in this town for dead while chastising her niece for her apparent desertion of Lumon. Cobel takes a moment to grieve her lost mother, who she didn’t get to see in her final days because she was away devoting her life and labor to the company that raised her as their work dog.</p><p>All of this culminates in the revelation that it was Cobel herself who created the Severance chip, not the Eagans who have historically taken credit for the technology at the center of the show’s entire mystery. She gave up her mind, body, and soul to this company, and all it led to was her becoming a pariah erased from its history books. As Cobel claims her old schematics and leaves her childhood home once more, she essentially receives a phone call from the A plot as the main characters ask her to betray Lumon and help them dig deeper into its mysteries. After everything Cobel’s been through, how could she possibly say no?</p><p>If someone says “Sweet Vitriol” didn’t move the plot forward, I’d say, “My brother in Christ, this <em>is</em> the plot of <em>Severance</em>.” It’s as if some viewers only understand the concept of unraveling a mystery if it’s in the form of new facts that can be made into weekly theory-crafting TikToks in which they can guess what’s coming next. In a series like <em>Severance</em>,<em> </em>whose entire lore is built upon the fraught relationships people have to things like labor, corporate exploitation, and of course trying to find ways to avoid the unpleasant things in life by bisecting your brain, worldbuilding is done on the backs of characters, not the other way around. “Sweet Vitriol” is a character piece, revealing nearly everything there is to know about one of the most enigmatic figures in a series full of them, and these insights into her aren’t just some intrusive side story detracting from what <em>Severance </em>is “really” about. If your starting point when watching an episode of <em>Severance </em>is “What is Lumon doing?” you should also be asking “What has Lumon done?” and you’re not going to find answers to that by hanging out with people whose lives, most days, are only eight hours long. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
