Jordan) return to their hometown in the Mississippi Delta with dreams of building a juke joint for all the sweaty late-night dancing, and revenue, that comes with it. Before a vampiric threat descends upon the tale, the early parts of the film show the brothers using their charm, guile, and gun-toting intimidation tactics to assemble a team to help build and run  the juke joint for one night. While the original film gives glimpses into its creation as Delta Slim (Delroy Lindo) extols the magic of the Blues, the deleted scene presents a streamlined, uninterrupted look at the juke joint’s construction.</p><p>Watching the joy on everyone’s faces as they toil away to build a utopia of their own in the middle of the racist South is bittersweet since that very juke joint is where most of them  lose their lives at the hands (and teeth) of the undead later that night. Just spending a little more time with these characters frying catfish, marveling at the possibilities of the gigantic structure, and helping one another makes you want to stay in that world a bit longer. It also makes you want a sequel that will likely never happen.</p><p>When a film is as big a cultural and box office success as <em>Sinners</em>, you expect fans and film studios to clamor for more.

This one is actually a bit more active than most passive abilities and is different from a normal guard. By holding the guard button, tilting the left stick on the controller, and tapping the dodge button Guardian will plant his feet into the ground for a sturdier block, in exchange for your capabilities to dodge and run.</p><p>While his stamina will slowly drain in this stance, any attacks blocked while in Steel Guard will deplete much less stamina than usual. Attacks that would usually break his guard can now be more easily reflected back with Guard Counters. Steel Guard is particularly helpful against aggressive bosses as it makes them vulnerable to counter attacks from you and your teammates.</p><h2 id="h19040"><a id="2"></a>Ability: Whirlwind</h2><p>Guardian’s Character Skill is Whirlwind, where he whips up a giant storm to sweep enemies off their feet. This skill is amazing at crowd control, as smaller enemies within range will be thrust into the air, helpless as your teammates finish them off. Additionally, any physical projectiles like arrows will be deflected.</p><figure id="" data-id="352fc069527acd5a6b59222f9dafcf6d" data-recommend-id="image://352fc069527acd5a6b59222f9dafcf6d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1083" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Guardian spins around to attack enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Guardian spins around to attack enemies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="352fc069527acd5a6b59222f9dafcf6d" data-recommend-id="image://352fc069527acd5a6b59222f9dafcf6d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1083" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Guardian spins around to attack enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You can charge Whirlwind to make its blast radius bigger, which is well worth it since it’s a very safe move.</p><p>Unfortunately, it does little against large enemies like bosses, although it can sometimes stagger them. Large enemies that move around a lot or fly will be able to avoid Whirlwind pretty easily.</p><h2 id="h19041"><a id="3"></a>Ultimate Art: Wings of Salvation</h2><p>Guardian’s Ultimate Art is Wings of Salvation, where it flies up into the air before diving down to strike the ground. It’s considered one of the best Ultimate Arts in the game due to its defensive capabilities.</p><figure id="" data-id="d40d2f82959948a0d60be1a8f7ec49d7" data-recommend-id="image://d40d2f82959948a0d60be1a8f7ec49d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1087" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Guardian leaps into the air to attack enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Guardian leaps into the air to attack enemies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d40d2f82959948a0d60be1a8f7ec49d7" data-recommend-id="image://d40d2f82959948a0d60be1a8f7ec49d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1087" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Guardian leaps into the air to attack enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s great for crowd control as its range is gigantic. Smaller enemies will be eviscerated and you can influence the direction of the attack before Guardian dives down. While Guardian charges this attack, he will remain mobile for a few seconds afterwards and generate an aura that grants invulnerability. Wings of Salvation is also one of the best revival tools in the game. Its large blast radius can revive both downed teammates if they’re close enough.</p><h2 id="h19042"><a id="4"></a>A look at Guardian’s attributes</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>HP</strong>: S</li><li><strong>FP</strong>: C</li><li><strong>Stamina</strong>: A</li><li><strong>Strength</strong>: B</li><li><strong>Dexterity</strong>: C</li><li><strong>Intelligence</strong>: D</li><li><strong>Faith</strong>: C</li><li><strong>Arcane</strong>: C</li></ul><p><strong>Guardian is the only character in the game with a S-rank in HP</strong>, which fits his tank profile.

However, it’s still handy for Guardian to carry items like Sacred Seals that let him cast protection and healing spells, improving his survivability. Every bit counts.</p><p>While you’re on your expedition runs, pick up any bonuses that increase his max stamina or recovery rate, and you’ll have a Guardian that’s very hard to kill. There are also certain relics that can buff Wings of Salvation, giving in extra effects such as gradually restoring the HP of teammates.</p><hr><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That also explains why SpongeBob is using Sonic’s icon, and some of the missing audio and performance issues.  How Insider got their hands on it is unknown.</p><p>Of course, until Sega officially announces any of this, this could all still fall apart, or some of this content might not ever see the light of day. Still, the leaks seem to indicate that Sega is heavily invested in developing this crossover content.

With the exception of two preview events, the highly anticipated console is going out into the world fresh for everyone.

After years of stuttering on the old console, it actually seems to run smoothly (for now):</p><h2 id="h14878"><a id=""></a><em>Mario Kart World</em> 1.1.0 update makes more characters playable at the start</h2><p>A day-one patch is also live for the open-world racing sequel launch title. <em>Mario Kart World</em> 1.1.0 adds support for Camera Play, online multiplayer, and the ability to upload and download time trial ghosts. More importantly, it looks like Nintendo made some last-minute tuning adjustments as well. “We’ve increased the number of characters that can be selected from the start,” reads one of the patch notes. “The time limit for deciding on a course has been removed when playing Locally or LAN,” reads another. </p><p>One big question on players’ minds: will blue shells actually be easier to dodge this time around than in past games?</p><h2 id="h14879"><a id=""></a>Here’s what the inside of a Switch 2 looks like</h2><p>For those interested in what’s actually going on inside the Switch 2, someone’s already uploaded a complete teardown of the new hardware. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@pro-modding&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@pro-modding" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ProModding</a></span>’s surgery on the console has already raised some important questions, like why is Nintendo hiding so many screws underneath hard-to-replace stickers on the side of the console?</p><p>For anyone who doesn’t already have the console, Switch 2's launch day could be a lot rockier. While many secured pre-orders months ago, some stores in the U.S. have promised limited day-one inventory for people who show up at the midnight launch. The Switch 2 is expected to sell out at launch, but there’s a big question around just how hard it will be to get and for how long. Walmart has already <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-pre-order-canceled-order-target-walmart-june-5-1851783357&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-pre-order-canceled-order-target-walmart-june-5-1851783357">begun cancelling some</a></span> fans’ early pre-orders, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-out-of-stock-pre-orders-launch-1851783435&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-out-of-stock-pre-orders-launch-1851783435">“out of stock” signs</a></span> have  been sent out to many stores. </p><h2 id="h14880"><a id=""></a>Switch 2 launch day stock is available at some stores but not for long</h2><p>Another big question is when all of those online pre-orders will finally get delivered. My bundle from Target currently isn’t slated to arrive until June 11, so I’m heading to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-in-stock-target-best-buy-gamestop-preorder-1851781532&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-in-stock-target-best-buy-gamestop-preorder-1851781532">GameStop today to join the masses to try to score a launch-day unit</a></span>. My local store said they’d have about 10 for people showing up without pre-orders. For now though, backroom inventory is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l35g2m/best_buy_is_ready/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l35g2m/best_buy_is_ready/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at long last going out on store shelves</a></span>. Hopefully, there aren’t too many horror stories of people failing to get theirs.</p><p>Plus we’ll have to see how Nintendo’s servers hold up once the console is out across the globe and millions of players are trying to download games and day-one updates simultaneously. It’ll certainly put the Switch 2's allegedly improved Wi-Fi speeds to the test. </p><h2 id="h14881"><a id=""></a>Switch 2 can store more than double the number of screenshots </h2><p><strong>Update 6/4/2025 11:02 a.m. ET:</strong> The original Switch limited players to 10,000 screenshots no matter how much extra room on an SD expansion card they had (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://nintendosoup.com/nintendo-switch-2-allows-you-to-save-up-to-30000-screenshots/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://nintendosoup.com/nintendo-switch-2-allows-you-to-save-up-to-30000-screenshots/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>NintendoSoup</em></a></span>). The Switch 2 not only increases that limit to 15,000 for the console itself, it also lets you store another 15,000 screenshots on the auxiliary microSD Express card. It might be enough to document every square inch of Mario Kart World. At the very least, no more sorting through what screenshots to delete in the short term anyway. </p><p><em>We’ll be updating this story throughout the day so check back for more news on what players are finding as Nintendo’s most anticipated console launch ever finally gets underway.</em> </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
