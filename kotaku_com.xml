              <p>Nintendo Switch Online, the Switch subscription service with the deeply irritating name, is rearranging the furniture to try to make things make a bit more sense. For one, various libraries of emulated games from older Nintendo systems are now being designated as “Nintendo Classics,” while the Game Boy Advance section receives a couple of significant improvements.</p> <p>First and foremost, on Switch 2 your GBA games—dating from 2001 to 2010—will now apparently run in a far shinier 1080p even when playing in handheld mode. Now, clearly this sets up quite the battle lines between those who believe emulated games should be played at the scale and resolution that was originally intended, ideally on the cloudy-screened technology of its era, and those who like it when things look pretty. Of course, the app also gives you the option to both run the games in a teeny window, and to “reproduce classic feel” by adding a bunch of effects to make it look like it used to. Saying all this, I’ve updated my Switch 2 and I absolutely cannot get the games to run in 1080p, nor find an option for it, so that’s odd.</p> <p>However, what I can confirm as working is control remapping, which is a very welcome inclusion. The option was recently added to the SNES games, and with an exemplary level of precision. For instance, if you’re adjusting controls for <em>Mario Kart Super Circuit</em>, there are options to reassign controls as specific as “Throw Bananas Ahead of You” and “Shoot Shells Behind You,” letting, you move them wherever is most comfortable for you. (Except, of course, to the rear triggers, because annoyingly those are forcibly reserved for reaching the emulator menu.)</p>

 <p>All of the previous consoles’ games are now in their own section on the Nintendo Switch Online app, under Nintendo Classics with the same branding, which makes a lot more sense. NES, SNES, Game Boy, GBA, N64, and GameCube are in a neat row. Of course, rather irritatingly this <em>doesn’t</em> include any games certificated M, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-online-forsaken-64-mature-2000622653">today’s addition of&nbsp;<em>Forsaken 64</em></a>, for which you need a separate app—the catchily titled <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Nintendo-64-Nintendo-Classics-Mature-2592474.html?srsltid=AfmBOoo6In-dwQyKw2KJlbPqUOKk6izShDf_yoce7GWRsGTtNp86uikR">Nintendo 64 – Nintendo Classics: Mature</a>.</p> <p>Let me know if you get 1080p working. Perhaps I’m missing something embarrassingly obvious.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/help-silksong-is-finally-out-and-everyone%E2%80%99s-having-trouble-downloading-it.1288776/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After eight long years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-demo-hands-on-price-hollow-knight-pax-west-2000621695"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> has finally arrived</a>. There’s just one small problem: the biggest game release of 2025 is causing all sorts of issues for the Nintendo Switch 2 eShop and Steam store pages. Fans racing to download the highly-anticipated Metroidvania sequel are stuck looking at error screens instead.</p> <p>The PlayStation and Xbox stores are getting hammered too. Here’s what players are seeing:</p>           <p>I’ve been trying to download the game on my Switch 2 and I keep getting kicked out of the eShop. On my most recent attempt I was finally able to load the actual <em>Silksong</em> store listing and hear the music from the auto-playing trailer, but nothing else on the page actually populated. After about 20 seconds the store crashed on me again and kicked me back out to the main Switch 2 menu.</p>

 <p>There’s no word yet on whether this is just a momentary issue caused by the sudden surge in traffic or if something else is going on with <em>Silksong</em>‘s launch that could delay it further from <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-when-release-live-price-hollow-knight-steam-2000621785">its originally planned 10:00 a.m. ET debut</a>. Some players do appear to be having success getting the game downloaded, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/botherer.bsky.social/post/3lxzdiekdmk2m">at least on Steam</a>. It’s also available through Game Pass for free for paying members.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">silksong has crashed the entirety of steam and most twitch streamers are having a bad time <a href="https://t.co/IqKxctPA1G">pic.twitter.com/IqKxctPA1G</a></p> <p>— Hayden Schiff (ᵔᴥᵔ) (@HaydenSchiff) <a href="https://twitter.com/HaydenSchiff/status/1963605152163659893?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The game’s arrival has been unique among modern releases, with no advanced code provided to reviewers and everyone getting the chance to jump into the game and play it at the same time. Or at least whenever the eShop, Steam, and other store pages start working again!</p>

 <p><strong>Update 9/4/2025 10:38 a.m. ET:</strong> More and more people are reporting being able to get through the error cycle on their platform of choice and actually download <em>Silksong</em>. According to SteamDB, over 100,000 people are already playing through Valve’s storefront, though I suspect that number is lagging way behind the actual figures.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000623153" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000623153"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000623153">SteamDB / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Can it hit 1 million by lunchtime? The all-time peaks are currently held by <em>PUBG</em> (3,257,248 concurrents) and <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>(2,415,714 concurrents).</p> <p><em>Update 9/4/2025 10:23 a.m. ET: Added more information.</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-pro-plus-1tb-microsd-memory-card-with-adapter-is-now-15-cheaper-than-black-friday-pricing-2000622760</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-pro-plus-1tb-microsd-memory-card-with-adapter-is-now-15-cheaper-than-black-friday-pricing.1288731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If there is one thing that anybody with one or several tech devices will never say no to, it’s more storage. Think about it: Everything from your smartphone and tablet to your laptop, digital camera, handheld gaming console — even your drone if you’re an enthusiast (like us) — they’re all just as good as their amount of memory allows them to be. That’s why this limited-time deal at Amazon is so universally appealing: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/">Save 35% off the price of the Samsung PRO Plus microSD 1TB memory card and adapter and boost your storage for just $75.</a></p>
<p>Samsung’s title as the World’s #1 Flash Memory Brand has been going strong for 22 years now, going all the way back to when 8GB thumb drives were&nbsp;<em>the</em> giant-capacity devices to have. This Samsung PRO Plus microSD card is 125 times bigger than that in capacity, and comes in a much smaller package. Times have changed for sure, but Samsung’s reign as the top flash memory brand is still in effect, which makes this Amazon deal even sweeter.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Blazing Speed</h2>
<p>Throw it back to 2003 again for just a moment and recall what it was like to move huge files onto a portable storage device. You’d drag and drop, and then go make yourself something to eat while periodically checking in on that bar graph window to see how much longer you had to wait. The Samsung PRO Plus microSD card reads data at 180 MB/s and sequentially writes it at 130 MB/s, so make that sandwich to go, because you won’t be waiting long.</p>
<p>As for storage size, just how big is a terabyte? Enough for 47 hours of 4K video, or nearly 160 hours of full-HD video, or 437,298 4K photos, or 654,480 HD photos. Chances are, you may never actually fill this $75 storage beast, but if you do, those read-write speeds will come in incredibly handy. And you can fill, empty, and refill the PRO Plus microSD card over and over again, because despite it’s amazingly minuscule size, it’s built to last. Samsung made it to withstand water, extreme temperatures, magnets, x-rays, and drops, which is why so many photo and video pros swear by them for live outdoor shoots.</p>



<h2>Universal Appeal</h2>
<p>You can take the Samsung PRO Plus microSD out into the wild in a digital camera, GoPro or other action camera, or drone, but it’s certainly just as much at home in your home. Smartphones and tablets, laptops, home security systems, and handheld gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch (not the Switch 2) all benefit from the extra storage of the 1TB microSD card. The format is nearly universal.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve established how far an extra terabyte of memory in a near-universal format goes and in how many devices, this Amazon limited-time deal taking 35% off the price of the 1TB model of the Samsung PRO Plus microSD card looks even better. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/">The Samsung 1TB PRO Plus microSD card is just $75 right now at Amazon, down from its regular price of $115.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mindseye-hitman-io-interactive-roadmap-update-metacritic-2000623129</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hitman-maker-distances-itself-from-disastrous-mindseye-launch.1288728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>MindsEye</em> is one of the worst-reviewed games of the year, and IO Interactive published it. In fact, it was the <em>Hitman</em> maker’s first outside publishing deal ever. How did things go so wrong? The studio’s CEO was finally asked to weigh in on the topic and he makes it sound like he doesn’t know either.</p> <p>“The initial talks we had with those guys were to support them,” Hakan Abrak, who’s been in charge of IO for nearly a decade, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch">told <em>IGN</em></a> recently. “We thought they had some great ideas and a great world in the background that they were building, and hopefully they’ll get the opportunity to show more of that in the future. And we just wanted to help them distribute the game.”</p> <p><em>MindsEye</em> had a sound pitch. Developer Build A Rocket Boy, led by ex-<em>Grand Theft Auto</em> producer Leslie Benzies, was making a user-generated-content-based metaverse called Everything, but pivoted to getting a smaller, single-player shooter out the door first. Following an ex-black ops guy with a brain implant that’s turning his world upside down, <em>MindsEye</em> sounded like an old-school action-adventure campaign with some modern AAA gloss.</p>

 <p>What it ended up being instead <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-review-bad-ps5-update-boring-open-world-pc-gta-1851785108">was a confusing and boring mess</a>. It’s one of the lowest-rated games of 2025 on Metacritic and has only 2,000 user reviews on Steam, around 70 percent of which are negative. As far as first-time publishing experiences go, it probably couldn’t have been any worse.</p> <p>“Well, that was definitely tough, right?” Abrak told I<em>GN</em>. “It was a tough reception. It wasn’t what they hoped for, and also what we didn’t hope for at IOI Partners. They’re working hard on turning that around to regain the trust of the gamers out there, and they have tons of potential and content they’re working on. So hopefully they’ll succeed with that in the future.”</p>

 <p>While Build A Rocket Boy has made promises, it’s also been <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-layoffs-refunds-steam-reviews-gta-everywhere-1851784902">undergoing post-launch layoffs</a> and playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/leslie-benzies-ex-gta-producer-mindseye-fail-saboteurs-1851785617">weird blame games</a>. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-devs-uk-workforce-of-around-300-receive-at-risk-emails-as-former-gta-lead-leslie-benzies-finally-addresses-staff"><em>IGN</em> reported</a> that Benzies took the opportunity on a rare video call with staff in July to accuse internal and outside actors of trying to sabotage <em>MindsEye</em>. The studio announced an updated roadmap later that month that includes more fixes to the game and its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1m8ykoy/july_update_from_the_studio/">upcoming <em>Hitman</em> crossover mission</a>.</p> <p>Worth noting is that at no point does Abrak talk about the partnership like it’s still ongoing. He talks about “we” at IO Interactive and “those guys” and “them” at Build A Rocket Boy. Even with the upcoming content you get the distinct feeling the <em>Hitman</em> team is ready to wash its hands of the entire thing and focus exclusively on its <a href="http://i/">upcoming 007 <em>James Bond</em> game</a> moving forward.</p> <p>Does IO plan to publish any other outside games after this? Abrak said, “That remains to be seen.”</p>
