If you haven’t heard of him before now, it’s probably because his social media accounts were small, and his reach was very, very limited.

So far, there are <em>twelve</em>, and it’s absolutely bewildering.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="192873" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Pocket Monsters And Simulated Goats" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="133" data-playlist="192873,196165,195752" data-current="192873"><div><p>The Week In Games: Pocket Monsters And Simulated Goats</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18337.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Free-to-play games having multiple currencies is, again, nothing new, and it’s all by design, all a part of the psychological systems to have you desperate to top things up, keep things ticking, and if you can <em>just</em> get three more of these, then a whole other thing unlocks! And, again, the big issue here is that this is <em>Pokémon</em> doing it to an audience with a huge proportion of children, and indeed delivering it in the most byzantine way imaginable.</p><p>To discover just how bonkers this all is, on the game’s main page, there’s a button on the bottom-right with three lines. Tap that, and there’s an option below “Shop” called “Items.” Click on this innocuous little word, and the lunacy is revealed.</p><p>Let’s lay it all out:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Poké gold (non-paid)</li><li>Poké gold (paid)</li><li>Shinedust</li><li>Shop ticket</li><li>Special shop ticket</li><li>Premium ticket</li><li>Pack Hourglass</li><li>Wonder Hourglass</li><li>Event Hourglass</li><li>Advance Ticket</li><li>Event Shop Ticket (Meowth)</li><li>Emblem Ticket (Genetic Apex)</li><li>Rewind Watch</li></ul><p>Now, we’re being generous here, including the two types of gold as one to get to that total of 12. And if your list doesn’t have that many, that’s because you currently don’t own any of them. It’s a list that just keeps expanding, and given the specificity of the Event Shop Ticket and Emblem Ticket, we must assume that there are other types of these to come.</p><p>You might expect me here to go through explaining what each type does, but you know what? Not even The Pokémon Company seems willing to share that. That Advance Ticket’s entry reads, “This ticket cannot be used yet. Wait and see what it’s for!”</p><p>Um, no? Just tell me? It’s already annoying enough as it is.</p><figure id="" data-id="048e105d6c3449b0bf3cf18b9820490c" data-recommend-id="image://048e105d6c3449b0bf3cf18b9820490c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Items page in Pocket, on a blurry background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Items page in Pocket, on a blurry background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="048e105d6c3449b0bf3cf18b9820490c" data-recommend-id="image://048e105d6c3449b0bf3cf18b9820490c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Items page in Pocket, on a blurry background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Most of these currencies are used to buy items from specific pages of the game’s shop, which itself is laid out as if it got caught in one of those Doctor Strange spells where all the buildings and train tracks start spinning and weaving inside one another. To spend the Event Shop Ticket (Meowth), you need to go to the “Limited Time / Events” section of the shop, and then to the Event page within that, as distinct from the Premium page, Poké gold page, and the mysterious and always-empty “Other.” There’s another Other in the “Main” section of the shop, which is also empty! Is it empty of the same things? No one knows!</p><p>Special Shop Tickets are gained when you sacrifice multiple versions of full-art or better cards, which the game never explains at any point, and require you to have somehow gathered three or more of the same incredibly rare art. We’re talking about cards with a 0.3 percent (or worse, getting as low as 0.013 percent) chance of coming out of a pack here. You get <em>one</em> of those per card (I know, because infuriatingly I’ve somehow pulled three of the gorgeous Snorlax full-art card), and the cheapest item in this shop costs <em>seven</em> Special Shop Tickets. That’s for the presentation backgrounds, rather than the fancy black-and-silver sleeves, playmat or coin you might want—they cost 12 tickets each!</p><p>Oh wait! Hang on! It <em>is</em> thirteen currencies, because I completely forgot to include Pack Points! Yeah, there’s yet another system that it doesn’t even bother to remember when listing what you own. These are the points you can use to exchange for cards you might want in your deck, gained by opening packs, and only appearing—not when you’re building packs or on any of the card screens—but when you’re on the page to select a new sealed pack to open...</p><p>WHO LET ANY OF THIS HAPPEN?!</p><p>I have to stop writing now, in case I discover a fourteenth currency I’d not seen before now and have an aneurysm.</p><p>And why is it like this? To deliberately confuse you. To make sure you’re never certain which currency is one you should be holding onto and which is one that has no other purpose than to be spent there and then. And to constantly dangle numbers in front of you that could get higher if only you bought just a teensy bit of gold. Some directly, like hourglasses, where shortages can be made up by subbing in gold you own; others indirectly by only arriving if you buy the (abysmal) Premium Pass, or won by continuing playing that Event where you just ran out of hourglasses...</p><p>Next time, the <em>eight</em> different pages of Missions!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That film, which I love, tells the story of a blue, pudgy alien criminal who crashes in Hawaii and befriends a little girl as he pretends to be her puppy to avoid being captured by authorities. As with all of Disney’s popular animated movies these days, <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> is getting remade as a live-action film. And our first real look at the character has me nervous. </p><p>On November 8, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DisneyStudios/status/1854968360397640011&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DisneyStudios/status/1854968360397640011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the official Disney Twitter account posted</a></span> an image of Stitch as he will appear in the May 2025 live-action adaptation of the animated movie.

My first complaint is simple: He’s not blue enough! </p><p>My second complaint is that Stitch doesn’t look pudgy and round enough. One of the best parts of<em> Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> is how characters in the movie have this round and oblong appearance<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://characterdesignreferences.com/art-of-animation-5/art-of-lilo-stitch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://characterdesignreferences.com/art-of-animation-5/art-of-lilo-stitch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">. It was very different from the usual house style</a></span> seen in most Disney animated flicks back in the day, and as a kid, I adored that visual. Stitch was cute and very funny, too, which also helped me fall in love with the film.</p><p>This new Stitch is giving me live-action Sonic vibes, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-movie-first-trailer-ugly-design-delay-redesign-1851446390&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-movie-first-trailer-ugly-design-delay-redesign-1851446390">but before he was fixed and made less ugly and horrible looking.</a></span> That’s not a good thing! </p><p>Now, let me just say that I’m not angry about Stitch’s new look. I’m not going to send threatening messages to people who worked on the film or start some online campaign to harass people or create videos complaining that Disney is “ruining” Stitch. </p><p>At the end of the day, this is a movie designed for kids. It ain’t for me. And if I really, really don’t like the new Stich, I can just watch the OG film and not worry about the remake. See, this is how adults handle this kind of stuff. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-minecraft-movie-trailer-jack-black-kids-1851640395&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-minecraft-movie-trailer-jack-black-kids-1851640395">You don’t need to get angry or toxic</a></span>. Just point out that something is either not for you or objectively bad and move on. </p><p><em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> arrives in theaters on May 23, 2025. I hope he looks more blue in the actual movie. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
