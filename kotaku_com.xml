              <p>We can’t blame you if you were planning on keeping your wallet stashed away until Amazon’s Fall Prime Day hits on Oct. 7-8, but the run-up to the big event is often where you can find sneaky-good deals as Amazon looks to clear out the shelves. We found this one today — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/">24% off the price of the Samsung Galaxy Buds3 Pro, which brings their price down to just $190.</a> That’s right in line with Apple’s AirPods 4 and a big drop from the closer-comparison AirPods Pro3.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Buds3 Pro got a full redesign from Samsung before dropping this past July, with an emphasis on comfort for long listening sessions. The sound is, of course, the amazing quality that Samsung’s famous for. And these buds are bolstered by Galaxy AI to enhance the noise cancellation, equalization, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Theater of the Mind</h2>
<p>Whether you’re listening to your own playlist or connecting to your tablet or TV via Bluetooth, the surround sound from the Galaxy Buds3 Pro is so good and so immersive it’s like being in the theater, but the sound is all for you. Dual amplifiers and a 2-way speaker in each bud creates a 360-degree effect, and Galaxy AI powers an adaptive equalizer that optimizes the sound specifically for you.</p>
<p>You can disappear into the listening experience of the Galaxy Buds3 Pro regardless of where you are, because the Adaptive Active Noise Cancellation feature, also powered by Galaxy AI, intelligently adjusts the level of noise cancellation based on your surroundings, and changes is as the conditions around you change. You won’t want to put them down, and thanks to the comfort-enhancing redesign and long battery life, you won’t have to.</p>



<h2>Futuristic Features</h2>
<p>One of the most jawdropping features of the Galaxy Buds3 Pro is the real-time interpreter. When your Buds3 Pro are paired with a compatible Galaxy device, your can carry on a conversation with someone speaking a foreign language and hear the translation on your earbuds in real time. All you need is a Samsung account, from which you can download languages for free. (English and Spanish are pre-installed.)</p>
<p>Will there be incredible tech deals dropping during the two-day Fall Prime Day event? Of course. But consider the several days leading into the event a golden opportunity to find those under-the-radar bargains Amazon likes to drop as they get their inventory set for the big rush. This is most definitely one of them — a $60-off deal on Samsung’s newest and best wireless earbuds. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/">Get the Galaxy Buds3 Pro for just $190 and beat the Prime Day rush.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-ghazban-ogress-mark-rosewater-2000629186</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/head-magic-the-gathering-designer-apologizes-for-misogynistic-card-from-27-years-ago.1309887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> has finally come clean about one of the bigger stains on its legacy. Veteran head designer Mark Rosewater recently apologized for the misogynistic treatment of a low-level pro player in the ’90s that he immortalized as a printed card called Ghazbán Ogress. “I have had a hand in creating thousands of Magic cards over the years, and Ghazban Ogress is the one I most regret making,” he <a href="https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/795689646039367680/there-was-a-video-posted-yesterday-about-the-card">wrote</a> in a new blog post.</p> <p><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ugl/60/ghazb%C3%A1n-ogress">Ghazbán Ogress</a> was a parody of an existing card called <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/arn/49/ghazb%C3%A1n-ogre">Ghazbán Ogre</a>, but its real inspiration was a woman named Catherine Nicoloff, an aspiring pro player who also dated several different top players in the ’90s <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> competitive scene. Part of the 1998 Unglued side-expansion, which was designed entirely by Rosewater, the card’s description read, “When Ghazban Ogress comes into play, the player who has won the most <em>Magic</em> games that day gains control of it.” It essentially took slut shaming that was happening in private and immortalized it in print.</p> <p>This darker chapter in the card game’s history was explored in a recent video on the <a spellcheck="false" href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheTranquilDomainMTG">The Tranquil Domain</a> YouTube channel in which Nicoloff was interviewed about it for the first time. “I just wanted to be one of the guys at the time,” she said. “That was the biggest compliment you could get is if you were one of the guys and man, when people say guys don’t gossip, boy are they lying. So, the attention was mixed, but you were always being watched. I could not go anywhere without being watched. If I went to lunch with a friend, there would be a rumor the next day that I was seen with so-and-so and I was dating him, even if I wasn’t, even if it was nothing more than a lunch where we were talking about decks or cards or draft strategy or whatever.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I laughed at and shared that joke at the time, when I was a teenager, and it certainly can’t have made women feel welcome in the community. I think one of the worst habits that Magic embedded in me was choosing my social circle based largely on peoples’ perceived skill.</p> <p>— Brian Kibler (@bmkibler) <a href="https://twitter.com/bmkibler/status/1395410046394060802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2021</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Nicoloff said Rosewater took her aside during one event to give her a heads-up that the Ghazbán Ogress card would be coming out. “Mark Rosewater wielded enormous power over the game and continues to do so,” she said. “I was just, you know, a a small-time wannabe pro player. So, at that moment, it this is going to sound melodramatic, but it just kind of broke me a little because I had thought Mark was a friend. I thought he was trying to be humorous, but [that] he had the best interests of the players at heart. And now I’d been handed this tiger by the tail, and I had to either ride it or get eaten by it. That was what Mark gave to me.”</p>

 <p>She ended up signing some other people’s copies of the card while also trying to collect as many of them as possible to keep it from spreading. Nicoloff reckons she has two binder pages full of Ghazbán Ogress now. It wasn’t until a viral post about the incident four years ago by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/nh5pep/comment/hf1dq1n/?context=3"><em>Magic</em> player Brian Kibler</a> that she wanted to correct the record about what a gross thing it was. “I admit I still felt just a little bit angry and a little bit hurt by the whole thing because this was like an elephant in the room and nobody had ever apologized to me.”</p>

 <p>That changed after the video went live and people started asking Rosewater about it. In a post over on his blog he unequivocally apologized for it. “Let me start by stating unequivocally that it was a mistake to have ever printed the card. It is 100% my doing,” he <a href="https://markrosewater.tumblr.com/post/795689646039367680/there-was-a-video-posted-yesterday-about-the-card">wrote</a>. “I designed it and put it into the set. I take full responsibility for the card’s existence. It’s important to own up to one’s mistakes and not try to justify them.”</p> <p>Rosewater has since called Nicoloff to apologize 27 years later, an apology which he said she accepted. “This apology should have come decades earlier though, and for that I am also sorry,” he wrote. “Magic cards should be something that bring people together and help foster growth and connection,” he added. “It should never be used to tear people down.”</p>

              <p>Following the non-appearance of a new mainline <em>Pokémon</em> game this year, the <em>Pokémon TCG</em> was left with a bit of a predicament at the end of its three years of&nbsp;<em>Scarlet &amp; Violet</em> sets. So, rather than drag it on, the trading card game has opted to return to Mega Evolutions, perfectly in time with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380">giant monsters’ resurgence in the forthcoming <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a>. The first new set, out today in the U.S., is aptly and simply called Mega Evolution, and based on opening a few dozen packs, I’m delighted to report that a newfound generosity seems to have arrived.</p> <p>Now, while The Pokémon Company has chosen to save the really big guns for November’s next set, Mega Evolution: Phantasmal Flames, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-charizard-x-ex-secret-rare-card-inferno-2000628025">a Charizard card that is likely to cause riots in the streets</a>, that doesn’t mean there aren’t some big hitters in this first outing for the new era. Sure to see high demand and higher prices are Special Illustration Rares for fan favorites Mega Venusaur ex, Mega Lucario ex and Mega Latias ex, as well as one very special card: the return of Mega Gardevoir ex. I can’t hold it in any longer. I pulled it! I pulled the Gardevoir!</p> <p>OK, I’m not going to let this color my assessment of the set, but I will say I when I opened it last night I ran upstairs and woke up my son to show him in quite the display of excellent parenting. Oh, and the centering on the reverse is <em>awful</em>, so there’s no hope of a nice PSA rating. Right, moving on.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000629190" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629190"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629190">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>Another New Beginning</h2> <p>While the ex cards continue to appear, although only in Mega Evolved form here, Mega Evolution does represent something of a resetting of recent trends in the TCG. For instance, the completely out-of-control reverse holos with either Poké Balls or Master Balls on them are all gone, and in fact the reverse holo has no pattern&nbsp;<em>at all</em>. There are no holo Energy cards, no Ace Spec-likes—just a very basic set of a very normal size (188 cards). As such, in this sense, it feels like an appropriate wiping clean of the slate for a new era. In another sense, other than the Mega Evolved Pokémon, it’s an incredibly&nbsp;<em>ordinary</em> set, too. The art on a large number of the Basic cards is weirdly generic, images that look so plain that you’d swear you’ve seen them before.</p>

 <p>This makes for an odd set in some ways. With no new Pokémon arriving, and the indistinct art, most of the cards feel like they could come from any era in any of the last ten years. However, when you pull something more special, they feel&nbsp;<em>very</em> special, and I’m delighted to report that in our smallish sample, that happened a lot more often than I was expecting.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000629195" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629195"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629195">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>So <em>Pokémon TCG</em> sets in recent years have been built of your regular cards with the small window of art, Double Rares that are either the older basic Vs or the more recent basic ex cards, Ultra Rares which tend to be more elaborate V/ex arts or full-art Trainer cards, then the desirable Illustration Rares (IR) which are full-art cards depicting Pokémon in their environment, followed by Special Illustration Rares (SIR) which also full-art, but mostly far more elaborately detailed. Then you get your gold cards which used to be the most prized, but more recently lost all their allure—this time out there are just two of them, with a lot more detail etched into the gold foil, and the hilarious new classification of Mega Hyper Rare. Mega Evolution sticks to this formula but with a boost, giving those Illustration Rares a big upgrade: the artworks in this set are <i data-stringify-type="italic">astonishing</i>.</p>

 <p>Each time I pulled an IR I was convinced it had to be an SIR, so gorgeous and elaborate was the art. Cards like the Clawitzer, Bulbasaur, and Ivysaur IRs would previously have easily been given an SIR rating. And yes, that means the 10 SIR cards have stepped up too, all of them (but for the Mega Absol ex, I would argue) looking like they could have been the ultimate chase card in any set on their own. Mega Latias ex is just extraordinary, while the Mega Lucario ex seems to be deliberately evoking the classic Mewtwo vs Charizard cards of the <em>Sword &amp; Shield</em> era, as the Lucario soars over a city, wheeling back to punch an attacking Venusaur. And talking of it, the Mega Venusaur ex card completes a triptych set with Bulbasaur and Ivysaur in gobsmacking artwork by very new Pokémon artist mashu. And then, yes, there’s that Mega Gardevoir ex, with a degree of intricacy not seen since <a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/crownzenith/H69.shtml">Akira Egawa’s Giratina VSTAR in Crown Zenith</a>. (Egawa designed the Mega Latias in this set.) What’s more extraordinary is that the Gardevoir card was designed by an artist brand new to the TCG, Raita Kazama, who has previously designed incredible packaging and sleeves for the franchise, but never a card.</p>

 <h2>Pull Rates</h2> <p>Pull rates over&nbsp;<em>Scarlet &amp; Violet</em> felt like they were crawling by the end, settling on a pretty desultory 1 in 5 chance of a pack having something you’d care about, even including a basic ex. Mega Evolution (and again, I stress my sample size is non-scientific) blew this out of the water for me. Of the first 40 packs, I pulled 12 cards Ultra Rare or higher! If you include the basic ex cards (which look great, by the way) that goes up to 21 pulls from 40 packs. 1 in 2?! And better than 1 in 4 for real pulls. That’s so much more appealing, and a far better use of someone’s allowance.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000629192" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629192"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629192">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>What’s The Meta?</h2> <p>As for how all this will affect the game itself, I’d say it’ll be pretty big stuff. The Mega cards are as powerful as you’d hope, and are going to absolutely flip the meta. Mega Gardevoir ex, for instance, has a one-Energy ability called Overflowing Wishes that lets you add an Energy card to <em>every</em> benched Psychic Pokémon you have at once, and a second called Mega Symphonia that’ll deliver 50 damage for every Psychic Energy attached. It’s a Stage 2, so you’re not going to be playing it out your deck, but at the same time that gives you a lot of time to build up its Energy stock while you evolve it. Meanwhile, Mega Abomasnow ex could possibly deliver the highest damage I’ve ever heard of. Hammer-lanche has you discard the top six cards from your deck, doing 100 damage for every Energy card that’s there. Load your deck with Energy and you could hit for 600! Albeit at a hefty cost for your reserves of cards, of course.</p> <p>Mega Camerupt ex can deliver a ludicrous 240 damage for&nbsp;<em>one</em> Energy if the opponent is Burned, while my favorite, Mega Mawile, can take a Huge Bite of 260 damage if an opponent is unharmed (and only 30 if it isn’t!), but also Gobble Down for 80 per prize card you’ve taken. What a finisher that would be, your opponent finally playing their stacked Mega Gardevoir with five prize cards gone, and you clobber it in one turn for 380.</p>

 <p>There are also nice twists like Wally’s Companion, a Trainer card featuring good ol’ Wally that will heal&nbsp;<em>all</em> damage from an ex Pokémon at the cost of returning Energy attached to it back to your hand. Yup, it’s not discarded!</p> <figure id="attachment_2000629193" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629193"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629193">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This is to be a very brief set, given the arrival of Phantasmal Flames as soon as November 14. It’s an even shorter time if you live outside the U.S., where Mega Evolution has been delayed by a full two weeks due to manufacturing issues—barely a month long. But it’s a lovely way to begin the new era, unless I was just ridiculously lucky!</p>

              <p>City apartments don’t offer a ton of living space. So if you find yourself in either a one bedroom or studio, you’re going to have to make some tough decisions surrounding how every square inch gets used. This is especially true when it comes to your desk setup. It may not be worth it for you to dedicate a tone of surface area to a huge PC tower. Go with a mini instead. T<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4332/">he Geekom Mini PC AX8 Max is currently on sale for 29% off. It’s normally priced at $749 but has come down to just $529.</a> That saves you a staggering $220.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4332/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>AAA Gaming on a Mini PC</h2>
<p>This compact case measuring in at only 5.4 by 5.1 by 1.7 inches contains <strong>a full-on PC powered by an AMD Ryzen 7 CPU and AMD Radeon 780M graphics card.</strong> As far as mobile integrated GPUs go, this one is pretty darn good. You might actually be able to play some of the more demanding games out there like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> so long as you keep it in minimum graphics settings. And then lots of smaller indie titles should play pretty smoothly. You can actually even connect the AX8 Max to an AMD discrete graphics card over one of the USB-C ports to improve your graphics further. The mini PC has also got a fair amount of memory with its <strong>32GB of RAM plus a full 1TB of storage</strong> on its PCle SSD.</p>
<p>Mini PCs are pretty perfect for your “everyday” computer tasks. By that I mean the day-to-day stuff like browsing the web, sending out emails, queuing up a YouTube video, or doing anything you need in Microsoft Office apps like PowerPoint, Excel, or Word.</p>



<p>With the two USB-C ports and the two HDMI ports, you can actually connect to up to four displays at once without the help of a dedicated docking station. Over USB-C, you can achieve an 8K resolution at 30Hz while the HDMI 2.0 ports can get you 4K resolution&nbsp; at 60Hz. And since the PC is so small, you can just mount the whole thing to the back of one of your monitors, taking up no surface area on your desk at all.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4332/">The Geekom AX8 Max can be set to three different modes, based on your needs in the moments</a>. First up is the default mode. Not much to say there. Next we have quiet mode which can reduce power consumption and noise. Great for some light office work or while studying and needing to focus. Then we have performance mode which is optimized for AAA gaming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Remember last month when Game Freak revealed that Hawlucha would get a mega form in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>with an </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-hawlucha-machamp-trailer-2000620960"><span>animated sports drama</span></a><span> starring the luchador bird and a Machamp? Well, Nintendo partnered with real luchadors to bring this fight to life. Last night, </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>took over a Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre event in Mexico City that had several luchadors dressed in </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>-themed costumes, including two who referenced the rivalry between Hawlucha and Machamp.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> and Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre collaboration was a two-hour event full of drama, mayhem, and references to different Pokémon in both costuming and in the set dressing. The ring in which the bouts took place included </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>branding (or </span><i><span>Leyendas Pokémon Z-A</span></i><span>, as it’s called in Spanish). Attendees were given paper hats of Hawlucha and Machamp to wear in the stands, and Pikachu and Eevee mascots were hanging out the whole time. If you want to watch the whole thing, it’s on </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>Latam’s YouTube channel, but do keep in mind this was a Spanish event. I don’t speak a word of the language, and the vibes are still pretty great.</span></p>  <p><span>Those who attended the event were gifted a </span><i><span>Pokémon Home</span></i><span> medal featuring art of Hawlucha and Machamp squaring up.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As much as we all like to joke that “the PS5 has no games,” that’s simply not true. Mine has plenty of PS4 games on it! Ba-dum-tiss. Anyway, there are some awesome PlayStation 5 exclusives. The amazing and cute platformer <em>Astro Bot </em>won Game of the Year last year. <em>Ghost of Yōtei </em>is dropping in under a week. Plus people are still sleeping on 2021’s incredible third-person shooter roguelike <em>Returnal</em>. And then yes of course there really are a bunch of good PS4 games to check if you missed them last generation. A lot of them have great-looking updates too like everything going on with <em>The Last of Us </em>remakes and remasters. Point is there are lots of good games to play, but do you have enough storage space for all of them?</p>
<p>Expand you PS5 storage with the help of Seagate’s officially-licensed game drive for PlayStation consoles. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4328/">This external hard drive connect to your system over USB 3.2 and will&nbsp; let you boost your capacity to store games by a full 2TB</a>. Right now, Amazon has the drive discounted down from $90 to just $80. A $10 savings may not sound like much, but that’s already halfway to getting you <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4328/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The PS5 base model only comes with 800GB of internal space (1TB on the Slim), and some of that isn’t even usable to you as it’s got all the system stuff on it that makes the console work. Really you’re working with roughly. The base model really has about 667GB while the Slim has a bout 842.2GB for you to work with, saving your games. This Seagate drive will more than triple your ability to store your game data. nor more deleting and redownloading.</p>



<h2>One Small Caveat</h2>
<p>There is a catch though. You can’t actually&nbsp;<em>play</em> you games off this external drive. The PS5 requires much faster read/write speeds than this supports. You might be thinking, “Okay, then what the heck is the point?” Well, this drive is still helpful because you can move you games from it to your internal drive when you want to play them. This is a much, much faster process than redownloading a game over the internet. Think of it like the digital version of taking your disc off the shelf and popping it into your console. The good news is you can play your PS4 games directly off of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4328/">Unlike the internal SSDs available to expand your PS5 storage, this drive requires no tools to install as it just connects over USB.</a> That makes it totally portable so you can bring it over to a friend’s house and fire it up on their PS5 if you wish. Have your whole gaming library on the go.</p>

              <p>Will<em> Resident Evil 9</em> struggle on Switch 2? Is the new <em>Borderlands 4</em> patch really broken or do players just need to be better at compiling their shaders? And where the hell is the next <em>Metal Gear Solid Master Collection</em>? Welcome to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. While all the big gaming showcases have wrapped up, there are still a few more days of Tokyo Game Show proper until the last big gaming festival of the year wraps up. Then it’s on to the fall’s next batch of big game releases. Yes, I’m talking about you <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>.</p> <h2>PlayStation boss touts PS5 as Sony’s most lucrative gaming box yet</h2> <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hideaki Nishino was the keynote speaker at Tokyo Game Show 2025 and his topic was the PlayStation Store. Covering its evolution and current financial dominance, he flashed a chart showing how revenues have kept climbing with each new console. What’s interesting is that this is happening despite PS5 sales tracking only slightly ahead of the PS4. So where is the growth coming from? In part its the explosion in microtransactions in free-to-play games like <em>Fortnite</em>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nishino-san says PlayStation 5 is the most successful generation in PlayStation history. <a href="https://t.co/E5feupYHGr">pic.twitter.com/E5feupYHGr</a></p> <p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1971034274536272100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s also the expansion of subscription services like PS Plus. And then there’s the fact that people are still playing on PS4, so even though the install bases are similar, the overall footprint of active PlayStation players spending money is seemingly larger. Plus the consoles keep getting more expensive. With graphs like this, did Sony really need to raise the price of the PS5 another $50 nearly five years after it launched? Either way, it’s an interesting data point amid debates about console makers going platform-agnostic. Will PS6 just be a PC with a PlayStation logo on it, or is Sony, like Nintendo, married to the hardware business long-term?</p>

 <h2><em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> dev’s next 2D action game is out in November</h2>  <p><em>Possessor(s)</em> is Heart Machine’s first stab at the Metroidvania formula and arrives the same year its loot shooter, <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>, entered Early Access. There’s a new trailer showing off more of the game about a high school student who forms a pact with a demon to uncover the mystery behind a catastrophe that’s befallen Sanzu city. It’s out on PS5 and PC on November 11.</p>

 <h2>One of the last significant updates for <em>The Witcher 3</em> has been delayed</h2> <p>CD Projekt Red’s fantasy RPG was supposed to get cross-platform mod support across PC and consoles before the end of the year. The update will <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thewitcher.com/post/3lzochplzqc2h">now arrive in 2026</a>, but with no clear window for when players can expect it. Once it finally arrives, PS5 and Xbox Series X players will finally get to experience all of the extra fan-made content modders created for the PC version.</p>

 <h2>Gearbox has some advice if <em>Borderlands 4</em> is running poorly for you <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-fov-slider-consoles-ps5-update-pc-crashing-patch-performance-2000628823">after the latest patch</a></h2> <p>The studio <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1971285941194195311">blames some initial reports</a> of even worse performance following the new update on shader compilation. Basically, the game has to recompile all of the shaders again, which can mess things up while running in the background. “Stuttering issues should resolve over time as the shaders continue to compile in the background while playing,” the studio wrote on X. “If you’re still experiencing issues after 15 minutes of continuous play, you can also clear your shader cache via your video card manufacturer’s approved method.”</p>

 <p>One fan offered <a href="https://x.com/Ki11ersix/status/1971286391964434615">their own tip</a>: “quit the game once after launching and relaunch it. Now travel into a zone and back out (Idolator Sol’s or a Vault will work) this should compile a BUNCH of shaders and start improving the smoothness.” Big-budget gaming in 2025 folks!</p>

 <h2><em>Resident Evil 9</em> looks pretty decent in first Switch 2 hands-ons</h2>  <p><em>Requiem</em> is the first game in the survival horror series to come day-and-date to a Nintendo platform. Early impressions seem to be that while the game looks and runs best on PC and high-end consoles, the Switch 2 version still performs admirably, especially in hand-held mode. So far both <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> have both been better than expected on Nintendo’s new console. Hopefully other third-party ports can continue the trend.</p> <h2>A <em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em> remaster will arrive eventually</h2> <p>Fans waiting for news on the status of the <em>Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 2</em> got an update via a panel at Tokyo Game Show. According to <a href="https://x.com/Kuwabara357/status/1971126048017322123">a translation by X user Kuwabara357</a><span>, it will still take a little longer for the next batch of games to get ported. “The project is moving forward properly, and we believe it’s shaping up to be something enjoyable really,” Konami producer Noriaki Okamura reportedly said. “So please wait just a bit more, more information is coming.”</span></p> <h2><em>Payday 2</em> dev apologizes for price-gouging fans</h2> <p>The<em> Payday 2</em> Infamous Collection bundle, which contains every piece of DLC the multiplayer heist shooter has ever received, recently jumped in price from $118 to $170. Starbreeze also announced a new $5-a-month subscription option for players to access all of it. Fans obviously thought the timing of this was a bit cynical.</p> <p>“The community has been pretty clear about how it looks next to the subscription launch—and they’re not wrong, it’s terrible timing,” Starbreeze’s Gustav Nisser <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/starbreeze-says-sorry-reverses-price-increase-on-payday-2-dlc-bundle-we-definitely-didnt-handle-this-right/">told <em>PC Gamer</em></a>. “We definitely didn’t handle this right, and we’ll be apologizing to the community. Hopefully there will be at least some acceptance that this was an honest mistake.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/bowser-leaves-nintendo-of-america-2000628868">Nintendo is shaking things up at Nintendo of America with the retirement of Bowser</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-israel-palestine-gaza-phone-calls-xbox-cloud-2000628764">Microsoft has taken the first step toward addressing the Xbox BDS boycott over Israel</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-biggest-map-japan-open-world-size-comparison-2026-ps5-xbox-2000628855"><em>Forza Horizon 6</em>‘s open world take on Japan will be the game’s biggest map yet</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>
