Since then, the franchise has remained a bright spot in Nintendo’s RPG lineup, with new titles and remakes of previous ones showing up throughout the years to the delight of fans. The newest outing for the duo comes by way of <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>, promising to take us on an exciting journey with our two favorite plumbers once again.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195273" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Releasing Beyond Pikmin 4" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="92" data-playlist="195273,196805,195905" data-current="195273"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Releasing Beyond Pikmin 4</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195273/195273_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195273/195273_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195273/195273_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195273/195273_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20737.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>If you’re considering picking up <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> and have a few lingering questions about what to expect, here’s what you need to know about this role-playing adventure.</p><h2 id="h361285"><a id="sequel"></a>Is <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> a direct sequel?</h2><p>The <em>Mario &amp; Luigi</em> franchise often features returning themes and characters, but you don’t need to have played the previous entries to understand the newest. </p><figure id="" data-id="7348a6e62367c450ac7838e8ecaec72a" data-recommend-id="image://7348a6e62367c450ac7838e8ecaec72a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1517" data-height="842" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario and Luigi explore a colorful fantasy world." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mario and Luigi explore a colorful fantasy world." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7348a6e62367c450ac7838e8ecaec72a" data-recommend-id="image://7348a6e62367c450ac7838e8ecaec72a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1517" data-height="842" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario and Luigi explore a colorful fantasy world." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The altest games takes players to a brand-new world called Concordia, which is located far from the Mushroom Kingdom the brothers are used to saving. Here, they meet an entirely new cast of characters, such as their new flying pig-like companion Snoutlet, and set off on an adventure across multiple islands to restore the shattered world of Concordia.</p><p>You spend your time sailing across Concordia on Shipshape Island—an island that functions as, well, a ship. This acts as your main hub, where you’ll send the brothers out to explore other islands in the sea by firing them out of cannons. It’s a unique system that helps the game feel much more expansive than previous titles in the series.</p><h2 id="h361286"><a id="genre"></a>What kind of game is <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>?</h2><p>As with all of the other games in the Mario &amp; Luigi series, <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> is a role-playing game that features turn-based combat akin to games like <em>Final Fantasy</em> or <em>Dragon Quest</em>—albeit a bit more family-friendly and accessible. The game’s battle system allows you to assign specific attacks to Mario and Luigi separately, such as hammer smashes and jumps, as well as combine the brothers for attack combos that can deal devastating damage.</p><figure id="" data-id="0f25537ed91d13b40dc1d85ce26368e5" data-recommend-id="image://0f25537ed91d13b40dc1d85ce26368e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1178" data-height="664" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario and Luigi face off against hostile creatures." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mario and Luigi face off against hostile creatures." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f25537ed91d13b40dc1d85ce26368e5" data-recommend-id="image://0f25537ed91d13b40dc1d85ce26368e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1178" data-height="664" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario and Luigi face off against hostile creatures." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When you’re not in battle, you explore Concordia’s various islands where you engage with NPCs to expand upon the world-building and complete side quests. This entry in the series even includes Bros. Moves, which helps you solve environmental puzzles you encounter by letting the brothers use fire and ice spells or even roll into a ball.</p><h2 id="h361287"><a id="long"></a>How long is <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>?</h2><p><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> is the longest game in the <em>Mario &amp; Luigi </em>series, spanning around <strong>30 hours for an average playthrough</strong>. This would include pushing through the main campaign while casually dabbling in a bit of the optional content on offer.</p><p>Those looking to see everything in <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>, however, can easily squeeze another 10-20 hours out of the RPG doing all of its side quests and supplementary mini-games for a total of <strong>50 or more hours of total playtime</strong>.</p><h2 id="h361288"><a id="reviews"></a>What do the reviews say about <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>?</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-luigi-brothership-nintendo-switch-review-roundup-1851688609&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-luigi-brothership-nintendo-switch-review-roundup-1851688609"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> has received mixed reviews</a></span>. Most reviewers have praised its enjoyable combat and generally likable cast of characters. However, many have bemoaned the overabundance of dialogue, endlessly repetitive jokes, and excessive hand-holding. Perhaps most importantly, some critics say the game feels much more geared toward a younger audience than previous titles in the series. As such, Nintendo may have overcorrected toward that demographic just a bit too much.</p><figure id="" data-id="094d00218cc1f7f8494aa6fff23bcdac" data-recommend-id="image://094d00218cc1f7f8494aa6fff23bcdac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1517" data-height="833" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Bowser and other villains fly through the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bowser and other villains fly through the sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="094d00218cc1f7f8494aa6fff23bcdac" data-recommend-id="image://094d00218cc1f7f8494aa6fff23bcdac" data-format="jpg" data-width="1517" data-height="833" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Bowser and other villains fly through the sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Given <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em>’s somewhat polarizing reception, I’d recommend watching or reading a variety of reviews to weigh how these various pros and cons might affect your enjoyment of the game before you spend your hard-earned money on it. Everyone’s different, of course, and what bothers some folks might not bother you at all.</p><h2 id="h361289"><a id="coop"></a>Is <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> co-op?</h2><p>Though <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> teases the idea of co-op by name alone,<strong> you may be disappointed to hear that this role-playing outing provides no multiplayer functionality whatsoever</strong>. This is an entirely solo experience wherein you control the two plumber brothers with a single controller.</p><p><br>If you’re looking for a <em>Mario </em>title with some multiplayer fun, though, you can always hop into the new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-party-jamboree-switch-reviews-metacritic-1851673386&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-party-jamboree-switch-reviews-metacritic-1851673386">Mario Party Jamboree</a></span> with some pals.

Multiple characters including Henry Czerny as Eugene Kittridge, the IMF director who memorably antagonized Hunt in the original 1996 movie, narrate the new trailer to set up the stakes and quickly summarize decades of Tom Cruise’s hero always narrowly saving the day at ever-increasing levels of international risk. </p><p>The trailer shows Hunt’s hacker accomplices Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) and Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) back at his side along with new recruit Grace (Hayley Atwell), who was first introduced in<em> Dead Reckoning</em> as a thief who later turned IMF agent. With both pieces of the key to the submarine housing the rogue AI, the crew attempt to get onboard and disable the all-predicting, ephemeral nemesis while everyone and everything that could possible get in their way seems to do exactly that. </p><p>Unlike its predecessor, <em>Final Reckoning</em> wasn’t filmed during the pandemic and will hopefully showcase more of the franchise’s charismatic ensemble cast actually acting together at the same locations and sets. <em>Mission Impossible 8</em> also clearly carries on Cruise’s recent penchant for spectacular stunts. The new trailer shows him hanging off the side of a small airplane shortly after takeoff as he fights with the pilot inside. </p><p>And while the title and trailer certainly make it seem like this could be Ethan Hunt’s last rodeo, Cruise himself doesn’t seem to have any plans of stepping away from the character in the near-future.

In eight award-worthy episodes of <em>The Penguin, </em>Cobb has dismantled the Maroni crime family, inspired mutinies in all of the rival gangs, and is figuratively and literally on top of Gotham. Although Gotham produces a new villain every day, for now, Oz is the king. And he’s already shown how he can influence the media and politics, making him even more formidable.</p><p>The biggest confirmation of Oz being Batman’s next nemesis is in the last scene of <em>The Penguin </em>when Eve Karlo (Carmen Ejogo), creepily cosplaying as Cobb’s mother, tells him there’s nothing in his way of Gotham being his, just before someone gets the bright idea to send the bat signal into the sky.

While Batman was solving riddles and doing the most brooding version of flirting with Selina Kyle (Zoe Kravitz), Sofia Gigante was being drugged, electrocuted, and assaulted in Arkham Asylum thanks to Cobb. Now that she’s back in Arkham Asylum because of the same person, Batman may have gained an ally he doesn’t know he has yet.</p><p>In the comics, Gigante is secretly the serial killer The Hangman, an identity she denies is hers in the show, and runs into issues with Batman. Even if she isn’t The Hangman in <em>The Penguin</em>, she’s shown she’s a ruthless tactician willing to bomb an already decimated community like Crown Point if it means blowing up Cobb’s operation in the process. It would be safe to assume the only joy Gigante feels is the recurring thought of how she will enact revenge on Penguin. Why not let your half-sister’s love interest help do the job for you?</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fc224887797ec573910b55417d44e769" data-recommend-id="image://fc224887797ec573910b55417d44e769" data-format="jpg" data-width="1140" data-height="570" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An illustration of The Court of Owls from a Batman comic book panel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An illustration of The Court of Owls from a Batman comic book panel." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->DC Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fc224887797ec573910b55417d44e769" data-recommend-id="image://fc224887797ec573910b55417d44e769" data-format="jpg" data-width="1140" data-height="570" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An illustration of The Court of Owls from a Batman comic book panel." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Corruption in Gotham is like sand in the desert. In episode six of <em>The Penguin</em>, Cobb spoke about politicians diverting resources like electricity and infrastructure repair to richer communities instead of to the poorer communities like Crown Point that are living in rubble and FEMA tents. In<em> Batman </em>lore, this type of nefarious prejudice is usually the work of one shadowy cabal, The Court of Owls. </p><p>This is a secret society comprised of the wealthiest and most influential people who control every part of Gotham, yet only exist to most of the citizens as an urban legend. The classist divide in the city was a main motivator for The Riddler, who grew up as a poor orphan, targeting corrupt wealthy individuals who he felt abandoned those with similar upbringings. That insidious elitism, along with Gotham’s criminal hierarchy being in flux thanks to Cobb and Gigante’s turf war, might be enough for the true rulers of Gotham to come out of the shadows in <em>The Batman Part II</em>.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fad4fc1fb65a858a99a418a623c26986" data-recommend-id="image://fad4fc1fb65a858a99a418a623c26986" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in the penultimate episode of The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in the penultimate episode of The Penguin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Macall Polay/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fad4fc1fb65a858a99a418a623c26986" data-recommend-id="image://fad4fc1fb65a858a99a418a623c26986" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Colin Farrell as Oswald Cobb in the penultimate episode of The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In two episodes, the Maroni crime family succession tree was dismantled after Cobb set fire to matriarch Nadia Maroni (Shohreh Aghdashloo) and heir to the throne Taj Maroni (Aria Shahghasemi), before fighting head of the family Salvatore Maroni (Clancy Brown) to the point of a heart attack. </p><p>The Maroni family is no joke and played a pivotal role in <em>The Batman</em>, as Salvatore tried blackmailing Batman’s father Thomas Wayne while he was running for mayor by threatening to release information about his wife Martha Wayne’s struggles with mental illness. This led to a domino effect where Thomas inadvertently got the journalist killed by Carmine Falcone after asking the crime boss to only threaten them into silence, and then got himself killed when he tried to turn Falcone in. In a not-so-roundabout way, the Maroni family is responsible for Batman losing his parents. </p><p>Now, that the heads of the family are gone, is there a long lost familial successor looking to take on the mantle and, as a result, the ire of Batman?</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="807584c861b1ffb7f41dfbe5c8ad8244" data-recommend-id="image://807584c861b1ffb7f41dfbe5c8ad8244" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in episode 4 of The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in episode 4 of The Penguin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Macall Polay/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="807584c861b1ffb7f41dfbe5c8ad8244" data-recommend-id="image://807584c861b1ffb7f41dfbe5c8ad8244" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1280" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in episode 4 of The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One of the biggest missteps the movie made that was fixed in the show was the relatively little time fans got to spend in the playground of nightmares that is Arkham Asylum.

Given the fact she’s back in her old, deranged stomping grounds, and the best <em>Batman</em> villains are in Arkham, <em>The Batman Part II </em>would be foolish to treat it like a side quest after <em>The Penguin</em> made us want to live in that world for longer.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ced66dfdea4c224c4539136f1dba03f8" data-recommend-id="image://ced66dfdea4c224c4539136f1dba03f8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="699" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Chinese mob boss in The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Chinese mob boss in The Penguin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Macall Polay/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ced66dfdea4c224c4539136f1dba03f8" data-recommend-id="image://ced66dfdea4c224c4539136f1dba03f8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="699" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Chinese mob boss in The Penguin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Gotham is fun, but it’s just one city. Both the movie and the show keep all of the action inside the murderous metropolis. But, in <em>The Penguin</em>, Cobb mentioned a few times how partnering with the Chinese crime syndicate The Triads could take his operation international. Now that they not only agreed to join his alliance with the other rival gangs of Gotham, but also had internal mutinies that helped Cobb ascend to the top of Gotham’s crime world, it looks like it’s only a matter of time before we see the true scope of Gotham’s influence beyond the city limits. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="87bf4d6c84d3388222df0d88fb813686" data-recommend-id="image://87bf4d6c84d3388222df0d88fb813686" data-format="jpg" data-width="1140" data-height="641" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A split image of Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in The Penguin and Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman in The Batman" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A split image of Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in The Penguin and Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman in The Batman" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros/Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="87bf4d6c84d3388222df0d88fb813686" data-recommend-id="image://87bf4d6c84d3388222df0d88fb813686" data-format="jpg" data-width="1140" data-height="641" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A split image of Cristin Milioti as Sofia Falcone in The Penguin and Zoe Kravitz as Selina Kyle/Catwoman in The Batman" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Carmine Falcone spread his seed far and wide, and somehow produced two of the most badass women to ever hit Gotham. Kyle may have despondently left the city after deeming it beyond saving at the end of <em>The Batman</em>, but we all know the woman who eventually becomes Catwoman always crawls back to the city that made her. And her letter to her imprisoned half-sister at the end of <em>The Penguin</em>’s season finale is her first step back home.</p><p>Kyle’s letter not only woke Gigante out of her catatonic gaze, but brought a smile to her face. This is arguably the most compelling wrinkle that <em>The Penguin </em>adds to <em>The Batman Part II</em>’s storyline. What could she have possibly written that would make a woman, who could be facing death in prison, feel joy? Did she congratulate her on wiping out multiple crime families, including the one they were both born to and victimized by? Did she let her know that she thinks she’s innocent (she isn’t) and she was framed (she wasn’t)? Or, maybe she told her a plan she has to get her sister out so they can enact her revenge alongside her lover boy Batman?</p><p>Whatever she wrote, <em>The Batman Part II </em>needs to find a way to make that a catalyst for the sisterly meet-up we all want. Plus, I’m sure if you have undeniable talent like Kravitz and Milioti in your cinematic universe, you’re legally obligated to make them share the screen. Or, you should be. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="431fb194b40af3cc114a60d591783cf1" data-recommend-id="image://431fb194b40af3cc114a60d591783cf1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1077" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Batman" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Batman" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="431fb194b40af3cc114a60d591783cf1" data-recommend-id="image://431fb194b40af3cc114a60d591783cf1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1077" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Robert Pattinson as Bruce Wayne/Batman in The Batman" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>The Batman</em> director <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a62282321/why-batman-is-not-in-the-penguin/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/tv/a62282321/why-batman-is-not-in-the-penguin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matt Reeves told us</a></span> from the start that Batman wouldn’t been swooping in to save the day in <em>The Penguin </em>because the show was meant to focus solely on telling the story of Gotham’s underworld, not how Batman fights their crimes. That’s all well and good, but we’re going to need to know what this man was doing while another bomb was set off in Crown Point and the entire Falcone family’s murder was plastered all over the news only weeks after he couldn’t stop The Riddler from blowing up the sea wall and flooding the city. How much prep time does this man need?! </p><p>It’s going to ultimately be amazing when Batman returns into this expanded underworld in <em>The Batman Part II, </em>but it would really insult our intelligence if there aren’t parts of the movie where Batman at least acknowledges he was aware of the events that transpired in <em>The Penguin </em>and let’s us in on what the world’s greatest detective was doing with his time. It wouldn’t just satiate fans, it would further solidify <em>The Batman</em> universe being built in front of our eyes.</p><p>Now that the bat signal has been shined in the sky, it’s time to go to work. We, and our questions, will be waiting.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This look at the back end, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855420102985802149&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855420102985802149" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently shared</a></span> by <em>Pokémon</em> community account CentroLeaks, outlines a suspected upcoming schedule of the card game from new events to new booster packs, with the card set after Genetic Apex <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://note.com/safe_abelia5761/n/n2e641cc42282&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://note.com/safe_abelia5761/n/n2e641cc42282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seemingly arriving around January 29</a></span>.</p><p>That deduction was based on the apparent naming convention in the code which tags current in-game events as part of A1, while after January they move to A2. But that doesn’t mean players will have to wait several months before the game’s first new cards appear. There’s also an A1a booster pack event starting around December 17 which seems like it could be part of a smaller, mid-season mini-expansion. That’s a good thing if it turns out to be accurate, as anyone playing daily up to that point will have likely filled out much of <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s existing Pokédex outside of the rarest cards. </p><p>Other significant milestones in the datamind findings <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-in-game-currency-gold-rewards-1851693684">point to a new store update</a></span> on December 1, as well as something Bulbasuar-themed appearing in the weeks after that. In the meantime, November appears to have a part 2 to the current Meowth event waiting in the wings, as well as a potential Black Friday event and something called “Mass Outbreak.” </p><p>If you ask me, the updates can’t come soon enough. I’m starting to tire ever so slightly of the existing battle meta, and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lapras-drop-event-gacha-1851689506&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-lapras-drop-event-gacha-1851689506">Lapras event</a></span> is truly a grind. Fortunately, <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> still excels at the thing I need it for most: 5 minutes of peace staring at beautiful <em>Pokémon </em>cards while I drink my morning coffee. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
