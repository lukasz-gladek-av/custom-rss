This issue is being written by <em>Spider-Man</em> writer Zeb Wells while Greg Capullo handles the art and cover. Issue 2, <em>Batman/Deadpool</em>, is being written by critically acclaimed comics writer Grant Morrison with art by Dan Mora. The second issue of this special crossover will land in November and be published by DC.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/marvel-dc-crossover-2025-deadpool-batman-first-look-exclusive-11741707&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/marvel-dc-crossover-2025-deadpool-batman-first-look-exclusive-11741707" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to <em>EW</em></a></span>, both issues will feature some extra stories and more DC/Marvel crossovers, but those are being left a secret for now. The outlet also confirmed that DC and Marvel plan on doing another one-shot crossover in 2026. </p><p>“A lot of things have to align,” Dan Buckley, the president of Marvel Entertainment, told EW. “Mostly, we plan our editorial schedule pretty far out. DC does their schedule pretty far out. You want to have the right talent involved because with this type of thing, you want to elevate it as much as you can to get people excited.”</p><p>“It happens kind of once every generation of readers. I’ll leave you to draw your own conclusions as to why. The timing has to be right in that you don’t want to do these too often. You want them to feel special. It is sort of finding that right moment for both companies to come together because it is complex. There’s a lot more coordination, collaboration, approvals that have to be done. And, obviously, from the business side, you’re sharing revenue, but it’s going to be a big deal. So you want the story, creatively, to warrant the hype of it all.”</p><figure id="" data-id="613af2be8366d42aa71b4ea6df278552" data-recommend-id="image://613af2be8366d42aa71b4ea6df278552" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->DC / Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="613af2be8366d42aa71b4ea6df278552" data-recommend-id="image://613af2be8366d42aa71b4ea6df278552" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Wells told the outlet that after writing 60 issues of <em>Spider-Man </em>he wanted a break, but Marvel offered him this chance to work on a Batman crossover and he decided that he “no longer needed a break” and hopped on board the project. </p><p> “In Batman, we’ve found someone who has even less time for Deadpool’s antics than Wolverine, but a city-wide threat from the Joker makes strange bedfellows (literally, if Deadpool had his way),” said Wells. “It’s been a blast letting Deadpool loose in Gotham City and watching what happens.” </p><p>Buckey added that the main reason DC and Marvel chose Batman and Deadpool for a crossover was that it was “a fun combo.”</p><p>“It was nothing more complicated than that,” said Buckley. “Like, Deadpool hanging out with Batman. There’s a lot of levity to be had in there, a lot of fun. And it would also be a little bit uber violent at the same time.... Our big thing is we want to do something that is a lot of fun, showcase comics, generate excitement, and bring new readers or lapsed readers back into the industry.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to an update from Nintendo, most big games and all first-party titles (with one tiny exception) will work on Switch 2, though you might need an update or an old Joy-Con. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-backwards-compatibility-list-start-up-issues-1851774297&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-backwards-compatibility-list-start-up-issues-1851774297">Back in April</a></span>, Nintendo revealed that over 120 Switch games would have compatibility issues on the upcoming Switch 2 console. At the time, it wasn’t clear what Nintendo meant when it listed some games as having start-up issues and other titles as having in-game compatibility problems. It seemed like Nintendo was saying that a small portion of the console’s massive library wouldn’t work very well, or at all, on the new machine. Now, we have some more clarity, and some good news for people wanting to play<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-eternal-the-kotaku-review-1842471145&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-eternal-the-kotaku-review-1842471145"><em>Doom Eternal</em></a></span> on their Switch 2 next month. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On May 27, Nintendo posted new Switch 2 backward compatibility lists</a></span> alongside some more in-depth information about what will and won’t work on the new console. The good news: Only one first-party Nintendo game, <em>Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 04: VR Kit, </em>is completely unplayable on Switch 2. The console maker says this comes down to the fact that Switch 2 is too big and can’t be “inserted into the Toy-Con VR Goggles.”</p><p>All other first-party Switch games, including the other Labo titles, will work on Switch 2. However, some titles, like <em>1-2 Switch</em> and <em>Ring Fit Adventure,</em> will only work on Switch 2 if you connect an OG Switch Joy-Con to the new console.  It should also be noted that<em> Fitness Boxing,</em> also published by Nintendo, will need an update to work on Switch 2.</p><p>As for third-party titles, Nintendo has tested more titles and worked with publishers to create new lists. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-compatibility_issues_EN_05272025.pdf?_gl=1*wsyydv*_gcl_au*MTgyMDM4MDcxMy4xNzQ3MzM5Mjcz*_ga*OTY3MzU2MjczLjE3MjI0NDc4Mzg.*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*czE3NDgzNzMwNDEkbzQ5JGcxJHQxNzQ4MzczMDc5JGowJGwwJGg4Njg0MTY5ODc.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-compatibility_issues_EN_05272025.pdf?_gl=1*wsyydv*_gcl_au*MTgyMDM4MDcxMy4xNzQ3MzM5Mjcz*_ga*OTY3MzU2MjczLjE3MjI0NDc4Mzg.*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*czE3NDgzNzMwNDEkbzQ5JGcxJHQxNzQ4MzczMDc5JGowJGwwJGg4Njg0MTY5ODc." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">118 games are still listed as having</a></span> “start-up issues” on Switch 2. Meanwhile, 50 games  “start up on Nintendo Switch 2 but include some in-game compatibility issues,” and 54 games have in-game problems, but a patch is planned to fix these issues at launch or soon after. In April, the list of games with “start-up issues” was 130. Looking at the lists, over 20 of these games are now set to be updated and should work better on Switch 2, including <em>Doom Eternal </em>and <em>Pizza Tower. </em></p><p>Interestingly, some software like Hulu and Crunchyroll won’t be compatible on Switch 2 at all. It remains to be seen if that’s because there are new versions of those apps coming to Switch 2 in the future or because the companies behind those streaming apps just don’t see a point in supporting the new hardware. </p><p>Regardless, it’s great to see nearly the entire Switch library will be playable on Switch 2, even if I’ll have to dig out an old Joy-Con to play games like <em>Nintendo Switch Sports. </em></p><p><em> .</em><br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
