            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I waited over a decade for Raichu to get a Mega Evolution, so I sympathize with anyone who has a beloved Pokémon they’re hoping might get one in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> upcoming </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC. Now that my favorite electric rat has not just one, but </span><i><span>two </span></i><span>Mega Evolutions, the title for “most oppressed Pokémon fan waiting for a Mega Evolution” now goes to the Flygon stans, and they’re really going through it.</span></p> <p><span>Flygon was first introduced in </span><i><span>Pokémon Ruby </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Sapphire</span></i><span>, and the dragon/ground-type beast has been a fan favorite ever since. It’s easy to see why. The insectoid dragon oozes cool while also being kinda cute in that uniquely </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> kind of way. He is very </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qJk3wrvL6To"><span>“friend-shaped”</span></a><span> and also a powerhouse in battle, giving him all the makings of a generation of fans’ favorite critter.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Flygon was famously one of the Pokémon originally slated to get a Mega Evolution in the 3DS era when the mechanic was introduced, only for the idea to later get </span><a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2015/04/mega-flygon-excluded-from-xyoras-because-of-artists-block"><span>scrapped because Game Freak couldn’t nail down the design</span></a><span>. With </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>bringing back Mega Evolution and introducing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-lucario-z-2000649602"><span>new forms for old monsters</span></a><span>, Flygon fans have been crossing all their fingers hoping that the long-lost Mega might finally make its grand debut.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But every time Game Freak announces a new Mega Evolution that isn’t for Flygon, the light continues to dwindle from their eyes.</span></p>     <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="pt" dir="ltr">Flygon vendo Lucario ganhar a segunda mega: <a href="https://t.co/I6Emz5f7hw">pic.twitter.com/I6Emz5f7hw</a></p> <p>— Vida de Treinador (@VidaDeTreinador) <a href="https://twitter.com/VidaDeTreinador/status/1995871382920724580?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="pt" dir="ltr">Mega flygon está oficialmente MORTO<br>Não vai ter nem na DLC <a href="https://t.co/ENLLqkB9km">pic.twitter.com/ENLLqkB9km</a></p> <p>— rayquaza, pokemon até namorar #Chronoverso (@azarco91) <a href="https://twitter.com/azarco91/status/1977865459157356882?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>What makes this even more painful is that there was a brief flicker of hope in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><span>first trailer for the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span>, which showed a portal filled with Mega Stones, one of which appeared to have Flygon’s color scheme, but thus far, no Mega has materialized in the DLC’s promotion.</span></p>   <p><span>Unfortunately, with each new reveal seemingly confirming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-evolutions-2000641670"><span>previous leaks</span></a><span> that don’t include Mega Flygon, it seems like the dream is well and truly dead. Unless Game Freak brings back Mega Evolutions in another decade? Maybe the third time will be the charm. I don’t know if Flygon fans can handle another big setback</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Toshiba 50″ Smart Fire TV Goes Into Clearance Mode at 51% Off, Amazon’s Deeper Post–Black Friday Discount Move]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/toshiba-50-smart-fire-tv-51-off-clearance-black-friday-2000649749</link>
            <guid>1371805</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Entertainment upgrades don’t have to blow your budget; if you know where to look. The biggest shopping events of the year – aka Cyber Monday and Black Friday – are officially behind us, but not all deals have expired. We’re still spotting plenty of great discounts across a range of categories, so whether you missed grabbing a new TV or a tech gadget, there’s still a chance to save.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3815/">Right now, Amazon is offering an unbelievable 51% discount on the 50-inch Toshiba Class C350 Series LED 4K smart Fire TV</a>. It typically sits at $350, but this discount brings its price down to just $170. The offer is open to all shoppers, meaning both Prime and non-Prime members can snap it up. Even better, there are no delivery charges to worry about, so you’re saving a bit on that front, too. There’s a catch, though. The discount is selling out fast, so there’s not a lot of time left to save. Lingering deals such as this one are hardly around for a couple of days before getting back to their original price. If you’ve been looking to bag a smart screen for less, now is the time to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3815/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Brilliant Visuals</h2>
<p>The 50-inch size isn’t massive, but also not too small. It’s ideal for bedrooms, smaller living areas, and anyone who is not a fan of screens taking up an entire wall. Toshiba packs it with its revolutionary REGZA Engine ZR, which uses precise analyzing technology. The Super Contrast Booster maximizes the depth of picture color, keeping it as accurate as possible. This is paired with the brand’s exceptional AI upscaling technology, which, instead of replicating every pixel, detects the colors of neighboring pixels. It then considers the detailed texture of the real sight to decide a color for each pixel. Translation? You’ll enjoy every moment on the screen with the clarity of 4K quality.</p>
<p>Blur is actively reduced during fast-paced sequences with Ultimate Motion. There’s also a Game mode, which supports a whole bunch of gaming features, such as ALLM (Auto Low Latency Mode), VRR (Variable Refresh Rate), and eARC. Combine this mode with Ultimate Motion, and you’ll be able to play your favorite titles in a much smoother manner; great for those upcoming holiday game nights. Visuals are only part of the experience, though. Sound matters just as much, and for that, the TV supports Dolby Atmos for a realistic, room-filling audio. You won’t just get to see your favorite scenes coming to life; you’ll experience them in a realistic way.</p>



<p>Fire TV support brings all your favorite content and streaming platforms to a single place, so you’re never going to be out of stuff to watch. Think Netflix, Prime Video, Hulu, Disney, Peacock, and more. Most of these require subscriptions, but if you’re not a fan of that, you can always access plenty of free, ad-supported platforms through it just as well.</p>
<p><span>To wrap it up, if you’ve been looking to grab a brand new display without shelling out big bucks, now is a good time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3815/">This deal takes a whopping $180 off its retail price, bringing it down to a much more affordable range.</a> Just make sure to grab yours fast, as discounts such as this one don’t last too long.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[SanDisk 2TB Creator Pro SSD Falls to $0.12 Per GB and Comes With a Free Month of Adobe Creative Cloud Even After Black Friday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/sandisk-2tb-ssd-012gb-adobe-cloud-deal-2000649680</link>
            <guid>1371763</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="878">If you work in photo or video editing, you already know that every extra bit of storage you can get your hands on feels like a lifesaver. Instead of deleting files you might eventually need, it’s almost always smarter to expand your storage capacity. That’s why compact external drives are so valuable. Stash away more data without taking up much space. And even though Black Friday has come and gone, that doesn’t mean you’ve missed your chance to snag a great deal on an external SSD. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6192/">Right now, the SanDisk 2TB Creator Pro Portable SSD is discounted on Amazon well after the next big shopping rush</a>. Usually listed at $294, this rugged yet tiny SSD is currently available for just $240, which is a solid 18% off. If 2TB isn’t quite the amount you’re after—too large or not quite enough—both the 1TB (6% off) and 4TB (7% off) models are marked down as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6192/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="878">Fast Save and Load Times</h2>
<p data-start="880" data-end="1572">This small but powerful external SSD delivers remarkable performance considering its ultra-compact form factor. The “Creator Pro” branding is very intentional, signaling that it’s designed with professional creators in mind—those who rely on high-speed transfers to maintain their workflow. The SSD reaches impressive read speeds of 2,000 MB/s and write speeds of 2,000 MB/s, all while being only 2.5 inches in size. Small enough to fit in your pocket.</p>
<p data-start="1592" data-end="1907">The SSD also features a built-in carabiner loop. You can literally clip up to that’s 4,000GB of storage right onto your keychain. Attach it to your backpack, your belt loop, or anything else it can hook onto, and your files can travel anywhere with you while staying safely protected.</p>
<p data-start="1909" data-end="2332">Of course, having your data be this mobile might also raise concerns about losing it. Misplacing your bag at a café could mean someone suddenly has access to a massive chunk of your personal or professional files. Thankfully, you don’t have to worry. The drive includes password protection with 256-bit AES hardware encryption, ensuring that your information stays completely locked down. Only you can access what’s inside.</p>


<p data-start="2334" data-end="2604" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6192/">Right now, you can save up to 18% on SanDisk’s portable SSD lineup for creators.</a> The 4TB version is discounted by 7% to $400, the 2TB version is 18% off at $240, and the 1TB model is 6% off at just $160. Come grab yours now before someone at SanDisk realizes Black Friday is over.</p>
<p data-start="2334" data-end="2604" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">For a limited time, you also receive a month free subscription to Adobe Creative Cloud. With this, you get access to Photoshop, Premiere, After Effects, Lightroom, and so many more applications that creators rely on.</p>
<p data-start="2334" data-end="2604" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Be sure to check out the other offerings in the SanDisk Creator Pro lineup. Also available are a USB-C flash drive, an SSD desk drive, a microSD card, a phone drive, and a standard SD card. Not all are currently on sale, but they are all available in the same, stylish sky blue—so that’s something.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! Winter has hit my area of the country hard, and so I write this with cold fingers in a chilly basement office. Will I finally break down and turn on the heat? Stay tuned to find out. Anyway, my frozen digits and I welcome you to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of video game news and other stuff you might care about. Today we’ve got more layoffs, bad news for some<em> Battlefield 6</em> players, creepy horror game <em>Horses</em> getting banned from another store, and more.</p> <h2><em>MLB The Show</em> is getting a mobile port</h2> <p>PlayStation’s long-running baseball sim series,<em> MLB The Show</em>, is arriving on a new platform: your mobile phone. Well, assuming you live in the Philippines, <a href="https://theshowmobile.com/">where the mobile port</a> is soft launching for a regional test.&nbsp; Meanwhile, PC players longing for a great baseball simulator watch on and shake their heads. Maybe one day, Sony and the MLB will remember to port <em>The Show</em> to computers.</p>

  <h2>Testing shows a <em>BF6</em> tank skin makes you take more damage</h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1pc1q3u/psa_do_not_use_the_mastery_50_ifv_or_mbt_skin_you/">A <em>Battlefield 6</em> player on Reddit posted a video that went viral</a> on the <em>BF6</em> subreddit. It shows that some tank and armored vehicle skins awarded to players who grind for hours are actually broken. Apparently, if you have these “Mastery” skins equipped, your vehicle will take more damage from RPGs and other explosives, making it much easier to destroy your tank. Yikes.</p>

 <p>A lot of players in the comments shared their own first-hand experiences using these skins and were happy to see this video seemingly proving that, no, they weren’t going mad, and in fact, their tanks were being blown up faster. Some players speculated that other vehicle skins in BF6 might have similar bugs and warned players from using any cosmetics on tanks until EA patches things up.</p>

 <h2>Eidos Montreal lays off staff for the second time in 2025</h2> <p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-lets-go-staff-more-layoffs-planned/">As first reported by <em>Insider Gaming</em></a> on December 2, a number of developers shared on LinkedIn that they had been fired in what appears to be a new round of layoffs at the studio behind <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> and <em>Deus Ex Human Revolution.&nbsp;</em> According to sources who spoke to the outlet, most of the studio’s internal projects have been canned, and what remains is now focused on supporting Xbox-published games like the upcoming <em>Fable</em> and recently released <em>Grounded 2</em>. This is the second round of layoffs this year to hit the Embracer-owned studio. In April, 75 employees were laid off at Edios Montreal.</p>

 <h2>A game studio fighting AI allegedly requires artists to draw during interviews</h2> <p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/mid-size-game-company-in-japan-asks-potential-recruits-to-draw-in-front-of-them-to-avoid-generative-ai-fraud/">As spotted by <em>Automaton</em>,</a> an anonymous graphic designer at a mid-sized game studio in Japan told a local outlet that after hiring artists who had used AI to get the job and discovering they lacked the skills the team needed, they are now allegedly testing artists during the hiring process. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-japanese-game-studio-now-asks-art-applicants-to-draw-a-picture-during-the-interview-to-prove-they-dont-just-use-genai/">As translated by <em>VGC</em></a>, here’s what the dev said:</p>

 <p>“There are many people who claim that artwork generated by AI is their own creation. We’ve actually ended up hiring such people, only to find they weren’t productive, which led to several problems. Because of that, we’ve changed our hiring process and it now requires candidates to draw something in person during the interview to verify their skills. As a recruiter, it’s a huge hassle, and it feels like we’re going backwards in time, but I’ve heard that several other companies are doing the same thing.”</p> <h2><em>Horses</em> has now been banned from another storefront</h2> <p>On December 3, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-the-upsetting-horror-game-previously-banned-on-steam-gets-last-minute-ban-from-epic-games-store-too"><em>IGN</em> reported</a> that Horses is now banned from being sold on Humble. This is the third storefront to ban the controversial horror game, following Steam and Epic’s refusal to allow it to be sold on either platform. Horses is out now on GOG, for now at least.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-ownership-trump-jared-kushner-2000649726">Saudi Arabia is going to own almost all of EA after the deal closes</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-season-2-update-skin-tone-changes-tired-stoners-character-changes-2000649710"><em>Skate 4</em> update makes everybody look more tired and stoned</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-ai-generated-english-dub-banana-fish-reaction-2000649707">Amazon has removed that terrible AI-generated anime dub</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <title><![CDATA[No Many’s Sky Dev Jokes About Once Human Allegedly Stealing Their Assets]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-hello-games-once-human-teleporter-2000650107</link>
            <guid>1371721</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this week, a post on the official <i>No Man’s Sky</i> subreddit highlighted what clearly looks like some digital theft. Some premium cosmetics sold via a loot box in the free-to-play survival game <i>Once Human</i> look virtually identical to teleporters in space exploration game <i>No Man’s Sky</i>.</p> <p>While a circular object that can teleport someone has been a staple of science fiction since at least the film <i>Stargate</i>, the more you look at these two 3D assets, the more similarities you’ll spot; they’re virtually indistinguishable save for a different color theme. Managing director for <i>NMS </i>dev Hello Games, Sean Murray, was one of the many internet denizens who took note (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/no-mans-sky-lead-responds-to-reports-of-stolen-assets-in-fellow-open-world-survival-game-once-human-says-the-jokes-on-them-because-theyre-actually-unfinished/">h/t <i>GamesRadar</i></a>). Though instead of expressing outrage, he’s taken a more playful approach, pointing out an oversight in the original design.</p>

 <p>“Jokes on them” <a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1995953990958547164?s=20">Murray wrote on X</a>, “we forgot to LOD those rivets 😅”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">jokes on them – we forgot to LOD those rivets 😅 <a href="https://t.co/XYvgdFXLas">https://t.co/XYvgdFXLas</a> <a href="https://t.co/KXRD3F5X1i">pic.twitter.com/KXRD3F5X1i</a></p> <p>— Sean Murray (@NoMansSky) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1995953990958547164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>So if the assets are indeed ripped from <i>No Man’s Sky</i>, it will come with some very unoptimized geometry for <i>Once Human</i> to wrestle with.</p>

 <h2>The heck is a LOD?</h2> <p>“LOD” stands for “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_detail_(computer_graphics)">level of detail</a>.” Various objects in any given 3D game will have different LODs depending on how far away from the object a viewer is. The further you are, the less detail there is on the object. This aids in rendering and stress on the machine producing the geometry. There’s no sense in having a fully detailed 3D object if you’re many miles away. Here’s <a href="https://youtu.be/w0bKkGqV5JQ">a video demonstrating the technique</a> in <i>Breath of the Wild</i>:</p>

  <p>So next time you’re playing a massive open-world game, now you know why objects look a little funny from a vast distance—especially if you’re playing <i>Once Human</i> and looking at some allegedly stolen assets.</p>

 <p><b><i>Updated; 12/3/2025, 11:20 a.m. ET:</i></b></p> <h2><em>Once Human</em> devs removing the asset, conducting a ‘thorough review’</h2> <p>In <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/once-human/no-mans-sky-asset-accusation">a statement to <i>PCGamesN</i></a>, <i>Once Human</i>’s devs stated they are taking the allegations “very seriously and want everyone to feel confident in the creative work that goes into the game.” They continued:</p> <blockquote><p>With this in mind, we will replace the asset in question. We are undertaking a thorough review and will be using this moment to strengthen our internal art and design policies. We genuinely appreciate the community members who brought this to our attention. This feedback helps us improve.</p></blockquote> <p>As <i>PCGamesN</i> notes, <i>Once Human</i> has been accused of using assets based on other games before, such as Caveira’s symbol from <i>Rainbow Six Siege</i>. Maybe they’ve finally learned their lesson now?</p>
