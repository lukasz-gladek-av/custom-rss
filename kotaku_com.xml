              <p>What do you expect from a sequel? That’s a question I’ve been asking myself ever since <a href="https://kotaku.com/powerwash-sim-2-trailer-release-campaign-splitscreen-1851769691">the first trailer</a> for the follow-up to 2022’s glorious&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>, which showed off a lot more of what has come before, but with slightly prettier graphics. Now that I’ve spent a good six hours playing the released version of <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>, and having a thoroughly good time doing so, I’m still pondering the same question. Because while I’m delighted to have a whole load of new dirty buildings and vehicles to spray, I really don’t feel like I’m playing a whole new game.</p> <p>To describe 2022’s original is to describe 2025’s&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>. It’s a game about jet-washing enormous structures that are covered in dirt and mud, with a growing variety of jets, nozzles and sprays. Your job is to remove every last speck of dirt, at which point you get paid, can buy more gear, and then move on to the next project. It should be the dumbest thing, and yet it proves outstandingly soothing, even cathartic, as you methodically make a gross thing get shiny and clean. And while I’m delighted to report <em>PW2</em> improves on the original in a bunch of different ways, what this amounts to is tweaks, streamlining the more fussy and less enjoyable aspects, and fixing the weirdness of how the first game handled soap. All very welcome, but none of it revolutionary. This is a refinement, not a step forward, and that leaves me in the peculiar position of being very happy playing the game, while still fundamentally disappointed to not have something <em>new</em>.</p>

  <p>Given that I don’t have any big new concepts to introduce, let’s get right on to talking about those improvements. First up, while the menus are still ludicrously convoluted, the very worst aspect of the first game’s store is gone: soap. In <em>PowerWash Simulator</em>, you needed to buy refills for all manner of different types of detergent for different dirty surfaces—costly refills that lasted literally seconds, and I still suspect made little to no difference at all. You could sort of convince yourself it made a brick wall clean a bit faster, but it could just as easily have been a placebo effect. Now that’s all gone, and soap is just a thing you always have. In fact, it’s a single button press to swap between your washer and your soap-sprayer, with suds collecting on dirty surfaces in a very satisfying way. It’s something that the first game should have done.</p>

 <p>Oh, and it now makes a difference. You’ll occasionally find bits of stubborn dirt, especially on glass, that won’t just spray off with water. So click, soap, click, spray, and now it’ll go. It adds a tiny extra element, and its unfussy and rewarding to do. It’s something the first game should have done.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000638868" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638868"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638868">© FuturLab / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Next up is a more rational use of your home base. In the first game you’d occasionally wash people’s vehicles in your own garage, and the game made play of the fact that you owned this business and building, but in the end it was only scenery. While it honestly doesn’t add anything significant, your business’s offices are really nicely used in <em>PW2</em>. They’re explorable, and you can spend your money on furniture and trinkets to decorate the space—completely pointless, but with the lovely bonus of everything you buy being utterly filthy (where are you shopping?!), and needing you to powerwash them clean first. Upstairs are your offices, including shelves covered in trinkets based on each completed job that let you return to play them again outside of story mode, and then a large map of the area from which you can choose story and bonus missions. Or you can eschew this entirely and just access the jobs from the menu as before. (But if you did, you’d miss out on playing with your three pet cats.) It’s something the first game should have done.</p>

 <p>Beyond this…um. Come on, there has to be something else…Oh! You can move the ladders and frames around more easily, and while it still seems to be using the same broken tech that has them refuse to be put down in completely legitimate places but happy to be placed so they’re clipped through walls, it’s all better to use. Those huge frames with all the steps now have ladders on the outside so you can rapidly reach the top, and there are also mechanical cherry pickers for reaching far higher. It’s all stuff the first game should have done.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000638865" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638865"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638865">© FuturLab / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Of course, it’s also a prettier game. Not only is everything more detailed and better lit, but there are nice effects such as little animations of splattered dirt as you clean, and both water and soap effects that make them look as though they’re flowing. They’re not though, and that’s such a damned shame, because some actual physics was my number one wish for this sequel. It’s aesthetically pleasing, but you still have nothing like water trickling down surfaces, or mud puddling at the bottom to be washed away, or any of the seemingly obvious features to add to a sequel.</p>

 <p>That was, in fact, <a href="https://kotaku.com/powerwash-simulator-2-dlc-clean-dirt-futurlab-1851773438">one of two elements I suggested a <em>PowerWash</em> sequel would definitely have to add</a>. The other, and it’s far more damning that this hasn’t improved, is the way the game either has a still very dirty surface suddenly PING! clean before you’re done washing it, or has you hunting down the single pixel of dirt on a railing before it’ll let you move on. My theory on this in the first game was that it must be based on the percentage of dirt remaining on any section—perhaps deciding a surface is clean if you’ve cleared maybe 98 percent of the dirt. So if you have a huge flat area of wall, that remaining two percent is incredibly visible and annoying when you’re not allowed to clear it, while on a tiny feature it’s a microscopic speck that’s infuriating to find. And, maddeningly, it’s exactly the same here. I don’t know how to make video games, but I still believe that changing the math from “percentage of total surface” to “percentage of total surface relative to size” cannot be an insurmountable problem.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000638866" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638866"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638866">© FuturLab / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I’m incredibly aware of just how ridiculous I sound, picking apart these elements in a lighthearted game about washing playgrounds, with a storyline about some gems being stolen from a giant merman statue whose magic beam had been preventing a volcano from erupting. Not least considering that I’m thoroughly enjoying the game! But then, I’m still mostly at a loss as to how this isn’t just a giant DLC pack for the first game with some necessary UI improvements. Or as we used to say in the olden days, an expansion pack.</p> <p>So yes, please, if you were for some reason waiting for my blessing to spend your $25 on&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> (or to download it from Game Pass I guess), then yes, go right ahead! Heck, $25 would be a great price for an expansion pack of this enormous size! This is very much <em>PowerWash Simulator But Slightly Better</em>, and that’s a good thing to have. It’s not a sequel though, really, is it? Is it? I don’t bloody know.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>EA and Battlefield Studios have some good news. Soon, you won’t have to inject yourself over and over with magic soldier juice and kill over two dozen people to unlock a spawn beacon in the recently released online FPS <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-battlefield-6-skin-is-causing-community-meltdown-grounded-ea-2000638294">Battlefield 6</a>.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>In <em>Battlefield 6,</em> there are numerous <a href="https://battlefield.fandom.com/wiki/Battlefield_6_Assignments">in-game challenges</a> to complete that provide various rewards. Some of these aren’t much to write home about, like a camo skin or some extra XP. However, other rewards are extremely useful and offer powerful gadgets or gear. For example, to unlock the Assault’s spawn beacon, a device that lets others spawn in at that spot, you have to complete one of these in-game challenges. And some of these, like the aforementioned spawn beacon challenge, are a real pain in the ass. Thankfully, EA has confirmed that big changes are coming soon to alleviate some of these annoying grinds.</p>

 <p>On October 24, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1981707319550341305">the <em>Battlefield</em> devs published a blog post</a> announcing some minor changes that have been recently made to the game and teased some bigger tweaks coming over the course of the online shooter’s first season. Among the updates is the news that many challenges will be made easier to complete starting in season one. Here are the challenges EA specifically revealed will be tweaked in the post:</p>

 <ul data-offset-key="7itjf-0-0"> <li data-block="true" data-editor="ck3kq" data-offset-key="a1edv-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="a1edv-0-0">Class Assignment – Assault 1 – Get 30 kills while using the Adrenaline Injector – Changing to 3 kills</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="ck3kq" data-offset-key="98fhh-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="98fhh-0-0">Class Assignment – Engineer Expert 3 – Repair Vehicles for 6,000 health in a match – Changing to 1,000 health</span></p> </li> <li data-block="true" data-editor="ck3kq" data-offset-key="92rjp-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="92rjp-0-0">Weapon Assignment – Deadeye 2 – Get 150 headshot kills over 200m with Sniper Rifles – Changing to 5 kills and distance requirement will be reduced, too</span></p> </li> </ul> <p>These are just the ones EA revealed. Others are being tweaked, too. And that’s great, as some of these challenges were incredibly annoying. I recently completed the Assault challenge involving the injector, and it was like pulling teeth. The injector currently sucks in <em>Battlefield 6,</em> as it doesn’t last long and takes forever to use. But the spawn beacon is a very valuable tool, so I spent time grinding for it and hated the experience. Talking to friends who play <em>BF6</em>, they have had similar issues with the challenges sucking the fun out of the game, so I think these tweaks are smart. Also, maybe EA could make the injector actually good one day in a future update? Just a thought.</p>

 <p>Beyond the challenge tweaks, the devs are also planning some changes for player movement in an effort to make the game feel more consistent, but without changing the “pace” and “core feel” of how <em>BF6</em> plays now. “These adjustments aim to deliver a smoother and more precise aiming experience, all while preserving an immersive first-person feel,” explained the devs in the update post.</p> <p>You can also expect some more fixes for weapon bloom issues, an ongoing problem in the game, and changes to lighting and brightness, which will hopefully help players who keep being blinded by the sun when stepping outside. There are also some notes in here about <em>BF6</em>‘s battle royale mode, which doesn’t officially have a release date, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-datamine/">rumors are swirling</a> that it will <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-first-new-map-review-season-1-blackwell-fields-eastwood-update-2000638228">drop on October 28, alongside season one.</a> We’ll see if that happens. For now, I’m just happy people won’t have to grind for that damn spawn beacon when these <em>BF6</em> season one changes start rolling out across consoles and PC later this month.</p>

              <p>Halloween has reached Gearbox’s recently released looter shooter, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149">Borderlands 4</a>.</em> But the free event is being heavily criticized online because, well, it sucks.</p> <p>As we reach the end of October and get closer and closer to Halloween, many live-service and online games start to activate seasonal, limited-time, <a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-events-in-video-games-are-just-the-best-1839174541">Halloween-themed events.</a><em> Borderlands 4</em> is one of these games, and its new “Horrors of Kairos” event went live on October 23 and ends on November 6. And nobody really likes it, as the “event” is less of a big, in-game Halloween celebration and more of a small change to a pre-existing mechanic with two new weapons and some pumpkin-y skins.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:sxmjis6jypsib2k7rk6pjoau/app.bsky.feed.post/3m3uuejx3fs24" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigwrz7ycyz5c4end5542plzpzo4bzo4hvcxcyafg6fivvwufpvnea"> <p lang="en">Double, double, recoil and trouble 🎃💥</p> <p>During Horrors of Kairos, defeat World Bosses for a chance to earn two new Legendary weapons:</p> <p>💀 Legendary Order Grenade – Skully<br> 💎 Legendary Tediore Assault Rifle – Murmur</p> <p>Event ends Nov. 6.</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:sxmjis6jypsib2k7rk6pjoau?ref_src=embed">Borderlands (@borderlands.2k.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:sxmjis6jypsib2k7rk6pjoau/post/3m3uuejx3fs24?ref_src=embed">2025-10-23T17:15:38.775Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>Basically, the new Halloween event in<em> Borderlands 4</em> changes how random world boss spawns work in the looter shooter. They still happen during “Horrors of Kairos,” but now, when you enter the boss’s holo-bubble to start the fight, the sky turns orange, and when you kill the big bad, they might drop one of the two new legendary guns temporarily available during the spooky event. Then the bubble closes and the sky goes back to normal. And uh, that’s it. Oh, and there are some free Halloween skins you can get from using a Shift code. Okay, that’s it.</p> <p>This is not very exciting. And because world bosses spawn randomly in the open world, players have to just drive around waiting for a boss bubble to appear. And if you have a strong build, the fight might be over in less than a minute. Compared to <em>Borderlands 3</em> and its big Halloween event, this is extremely disappointing. In the last game, the Halloween event introduced a new character, added a new limited-time map, featured a new boss, and more.</p>

 <p><em>Borderlands</em> content creators are ripping the new event apart in YouTube videos and posts. Popular <em>Borderlands</em> YouTuber Joltzdude139 uploaded a new video on Friday that spelled it out simply and bluntly with the title: T<a href="https://youtu.be/HFfPynrUr30">he Horrors Of Kairos Halloween Event Sucks In <em>Borderlands 4</em></a><em>.</em> In the comments below, he added: “<span dir="auto" role="text">As a biiiiig <em>Borderlands</em> fan, I am absolutely disappointed in this Halloween event.” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1oev9am/gearbox_making_premium_content_for_premium_game/">And he’s not alone</a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1oerp2e/bl4s_halloween_event_is_so_bad_i_booted_up_bl3_to/">Checking Reddit,</a> Twitter, YouTube, and elsewhere, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1oeiv0v/say_what_you_will_but_mad_respect_for_moxsy/">everyone seems sad about it. </a></span></p> <p><span dir="auto" role="text">Sure, Gearbox advertised the Halloween update as a mini-event, but this feels more like a super-tiny event. I can’t wait for <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-real-fan-post-1851782855">Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford’s 700-word tweet</a> about all of this that will likely drop within the next 48 hours.&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p>Is there a disturbance in the force when it comes to <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>‘s week-one sales? Will Steam Deck compatibility help aid the Switch 2 on its road to becoming a handheld port machine? And why are <em>Sims 4</em> creators abandoning EA’s official affiliate program? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>People <a href="https://x.com/SuperSavajin/status/1981324284493443583">are once again</a> debating whether Nintendo should bring back Virtual Console instead of forcing fans to rent all of its games in perpetuity. While it’s true that people had been wanting Nintendo to do a low-cost Netflix-like retro service for a while, much of that was due to constantly needing to <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-virtual-console-switch-online-classic-retro-1851760770">re-purchase the games across non-backwards-compatible devices</a>. With the Switch 2, that’s no longer an issue. Personally, I’d prefer to just buy the original <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> again instead of pay $50 a year to play it.</p>

 <h2><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> is selling less than other recent games in the series</h2> <p>The Pokémon Company announced the latest entry sold 5.8 million copies in its first week, split roughly evenly between Switch and Switch 2. Sounds impressive, but it’s slightly behind other recent Pokémon games:</p> <ul> <li><em><strong>Pokémon Sword</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em><strong>Shield</strong></em>: 6 million copies in its first three days</li> <li><strong><em>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl</em></strong>: 6 million copies in its first week</li> <li><em><strong>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</strong>: </em>6.5 million copies in its first week</li> <li><em><strong>Pokémon Scarlet </strong></em><strong>and </strong><em><strong>Violet</strong>: </em>10 million copies in its first three days</li> </ul> <p>That’s a little surprising given the hype around a new console launch and the fact that it’s been three years since fans received a mainline Pokémon game. Are those viral videos about the bad graphics and how lifeless Lumiose City looks putting a damper on things? Are some fans aging out all these years later? Or is this just a momentary slip on the way to <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> still becoming one of the top-20 best-selling Nintendo console games ever?</p>

 <h2><em>The Simpsons</em>‘ takeover of Fortnite continues leaking</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">FORTNITE SIMPSONS SEASON (HD KEY ART) <a href="https://t.co/eL7l1skLRJ">pic.twitter.com/eL7l1skLRJ</a></p> <p>— Shiina (@ShiinaBR) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShiinaBR/status/1981479839564537972?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Now we have the key art which gives lots of clues for what to expect, including Homer with a magic TV remote that might spawn donuts, Bart in a mech suit, and Flanders flying in on a loaf of bread.</p>

 <p>“Due to the recent sale, I have asked to leave the EA Creator Network and I will not buy or make content around any future release. I think taking this stand is the right choice for me personally, but I’m not going to judge anybody on their decision,” McNamara said. “I’m in a privileged position to be able to say I’m leaving so easily.”</p>

 <p>In a separate discussion, Sims said, “This situation is a nightmare for our community. Nobody supports this sale, and it is putting creators in a very difficult position. They have built their entire career and livelihood over a game that they have no control over.”</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is secretly </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-npc-dialogue-funny-moments-lines-2000638295"><span>one of the funniest games of the year</span></a><span>, as I was reminded last night when I experienced something that was as annoying as it was hilarious.. I’ve finished the main story, and so I’ve been chipping away at all the remaining side quests, filling up my Pokedex, and trying to get everything in a place where I’m okay with putting the game down until the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span>. So I’m spending most of my time chatting up citizens, battling wild Pokémon, and checking off research assignments without a care in the world. But last night, something happened that now has me putting my guard up. I was trapped in a conversation with a child about their special interest, and it was one of the funniest scenes I’ve encountered in the game.</span></p> <p><span>In Lumiose City’s Rouge Sector, you’ll find a school called Académie Étoile. There are a few quests here, including one really cute one where you teach a group of curious kids about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>Mega Evolution</span></a><span>, but there’s one student who’s just hanging out in a corner by herself. This nameless child’s speech bubble exclaims, “I’ve memorized a bunch of people’s names!” As someone who has become terrible with names in his 30s, that’s impressive to me. If someone doesn’t have a name tag on, I </span><i><span>will</span></i><span> forget what they’re called when they tell me. That happens with anyone, and it’s nothing personal. I used to have a mind like a steel trap, and then everything started sliding right out of my skull once I got old enough to rent a car. So I talk to this kid, and she tells me she has a “super amazing memory” and can remember every name she’s ever seen, even if she only saw it once.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>She asks if I want her to show me, and I’m like, “Hell yeah, queen. Pop off!” because who wants to shoot down a child telling you about something they’re excited about? Then she asks me again if I’m sure because it’ll take her about six minutes to rattle off every Bob, Jan, and Jimbo she’s ever known. I fully expected the game to make me skip through a bunch of text boxes before we were interrupted by a teacher or parent who had been looking for this girl, but no, </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>did something even funnier: it started playing the game’s credits and would not let me skip or opt out of them.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>For six minutes, I watched the credits roll a second time, and just laughed at how good of a fucking bit this is. Anyone who’s interacted with children knows they love to talk your ear off about whatever they’re hyperfixating on. If you don’t know anything about it, you just gotta kinda smile, nod, and say “oh, wow!” now and then so they know it’s okay to be excited about things. Game Freak emulating this by making you watch the credits is such an efficient gag that I couldn’t help but giggle at the mess I’d gotten myself into. The kid told me exactly what she was going to do, and for some reason, it didn’t occur to me that she might actually deliver. Hopefully, she gets a job in comms because never forgetting a face or a name is an invaluable skill in that field.</span></p>
