I don’t think it’s appropriate.” </p><p>By some estimates, average AAA game budgets have more than doubled every console generation. The first <em>Spider-Man </em>on PlayStation 4 was around $100 million to make. <em>Spider-Man 2 </em>on PlayStation 5 was over $300 million. But the games don’t sell dramatically better and are only priced $10 higher. </p><p>Some games try to make up the difference with aggressive microtransaction shops. Karch thinks part of <em>Space Marine 2</em>'s success, and the way fans flocked to it, can be attributed to its one-and-done campaign and the fact it doesn’t “milk, nickel and dime” players like live-service games. </p><p>Insomniac Games, the studio behind <em>Spider-Man 1</em> and <em>2</em>, like many teams in the video game industry over the last few years, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-hacked-files-tell-us-about-the-studio-behind-spide-1851115233&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-hacked-files-tell-us-about-the-studio-behind-spide-1851115233">suffered layoffs just a few months after the sequel came</a></span> out despite strong sales. “I don’t know how best to put it...I think if anything has contributed more to the loss of jobs, it’s the multi-hundred million dollar budget,” Karch told <em>Game File</em>.</p><p>He pitches <em>Space Marine 2 </em>as an alternative. Last year, former id Software studio director turned Saber Interactive chief creative officer, Tim Willits, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-sequel-dlc-expansion-1851654810&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-3-sequel-dlc-expansion-1851654810">told <em>IGN</em></a></span> that<em>&nbsp;</em>the sequel to the cult-favorite Xbox 360-era shooter<em>&nbsp;</em>only cost half of what it took to make <em>Doom Eternal</em>, but looks and plays equally well. No doubt part of that is due to much cheaper development costs outside of the U.S. where most of Saber Interactive’s staff work. </p><p> “We can make games [like] <em>Space Marine,</em>” Karch told <em>Game File </em>this week. “You’re not going to tell me it doesn’t have a Triple A vibe to it. You may say, ‘Oh it’s double-A plus.’ It’s a solid game. Its budget was a quarter of what anybody else would spend.” </p><p>Whether <em>Space Marine 2</em> proves to be the exception or the new rule remains to be seen. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-shawn-layden-aa-space-marine-2-fortnite-1851675017&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-shawn-layden-aa-space-marine-2-fortnite-1851675017">Others warn</a></span> that the mid-level space it’s playing in is essentially dead for all but the biggest standouts, swallowed up by <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Call of Duty</em>, and other mega-hits that consume an increasing amount of money and time from a limited number of players. And the biggest game of 2025, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-price-video-game-industry-state-of-release-date-1851740553&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-price-video-game-industry-state-of-release-date-1851740553"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a></span>, will likely have cost way more than just $400 million to make. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Simmons) problem. After flying off from Earth following his brutal pummeling of his son and the world finding out he was a genocidal maniac looking to conquer them to continue the Viltrumite race at the end of Season 1, the show has largely been devoid of his enthralling mixture of superhero stoicism and brutal pragmatism. After the third episode of the current season, it’s clear his son Oliver (Lincoln Bodin) is ready to pick up that mantle, and Simmons is ready for it. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193781" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Top Five Anime Couples Who Never Got Together" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="223" data-playlist="193781,197298,197284" data-current="193781"><div><p>Top Five Anime Couples Who Never Got Together</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193781/193781_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193781/193781_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193781/193781_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193781/193781_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19239.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="f21e10ac63e9f4a566d32e835951aeda" data-recommend-id="image://f21e10ac63e9f4a566d32e835951aeda" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="145" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kotaku Spoiler Warning banner" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kotaku Spoiler Warning banner" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="in-house-art" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f21e10ac63e9f4a566d32e835951aeda" data-recommend-id="image://f21e10ac63e9f4a566d32e835951aeda" data-format="jpg" data-width="1315" data-height="145" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kotaku Spoiler Warning banner" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At the end of this season’s third episode, entitled “You Want A Real Costume, Right?” the Mauler Twins (Kevin Michael Richardson) launched an EMP missile to destroy Earth’s communications network to incentivize people to pay to use their shielding system. While Invincible (Steven Yeun) darted to the sky to stop the missile from impacting, his younger brother, overly excited to use his newfound powers to fight evil, does battle with the pair of villains. Earlier in the episode, the show expertly displayed Oliver as a carefree child still figuring out how to fly, pestering his big brother to hang out and train him, and strutting around in his new superhero suit. Up until his duel with the Mauler Twins, we were made to believe Oliver’s superhero inexperience was simply an excuse for lightheartedness. We forgot for a second that Viltrumite blood still burns in his veins.</p><p>In a matter of seconds, Oliver kills one of the Mauler Twins by flying through his body. Before killing the second one, the blood-soaked preteen coldly says, “That’s what happens when you’re a bad guy.” His actions become more disturbing when he seems to revert back to childlike innocence, pleading that his murders were accidents. When we spoke with Simmons, even he couldn’t believe what his fake son had done.</p><p>“We get shocked and surprised by some of these plot developments as we read them before we put them down,” the actor said. “Oliver is a really cool new character that hopefully keeps people guessing.”</p><p>When asked if Oliver’s pragmatic reasoning for killing the bad guys was inherited from his father, Simmons slyly answered, “Nothing’s ever Omni-Man’s fault. Omni-Man is always innocent of any wrongdoings.” The sarcasm in his voice and smirk on his face told us all we needed to know. The child who wanted to honor his homicidal father by donning the name Omni-Kid earlier in the episode isn’t too far removed from his exiled father. But, him reverting back to a clueless child who claims to have accidentally killed two villains we all saw him murder with clear, cold intention means either his Viltrumite killer genes are (literal) sleeper cells that activate when someone disrupts his moral compass or Oliver knows he’s a killer at heart, but must act docile in order to ingratiate himself with the Earthlings he may one day conquer. </p><p>If this is only the third episode of what is already shaping up to be the best season of <em>Invincible</em>, we’re in for a hell of a ride. Now, let’s bring Omni-Man back from space jail immediately. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
