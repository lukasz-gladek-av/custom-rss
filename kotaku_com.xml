Originally set to come out as early as 2023, development didn’t progress as quickly as the team had expected. A planned 2024 launch was eventually delayed as well. </p><p>In the cancellation announcement today, Thorson writes of a falling-out with pixel artist Pedro Medeiros, whose visual style defined the aesthetic of the upcoming project, over a dispute related to IP rights for<em> Celeste</em>, the beloved 2018 GOTY contender. “We eventually reached a resolution, but both parties also agreed in the end that we should go our separate ways,” <em>Earthblade</em>’s director wrote. “Pedro is now working on his game <em>Neverway</em>, which you should check out - we’ve played it and it’s very promising.”</p><p>Thorson went on to pull the curtain back some on the latest project’s difficult development. “<em>Celeste</em>’s success applied pressure on us to deliver something bigger and better with <em>Earthblade</em>, and that pressure is a large part of why working on it has become so exhausting,” Thorson wrote. “Pedro isn’t to blame for this-in fact the split with him has given us the clarity to see that we have lost our way, and the opportunity to admit defeat. I feel many ways about it, but one big feeling is undoubtedly relief.”</p><p>For now, Thorson and <em>Celeste </em>co-creator Noel Berry have gone back to prototyping new potential projects while the rest of the team has moved on. The dream of <em>Earthblade</em> might be dead, but the minds behind it aren’t done making games. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The card game features many famous and obscure Disney characters from movies like <em>Beauty and the Beast, Cinderella, Snow White</em>, and more. I’ve been playing since last year and have had a great time with it. But I also know that getting into <em>Lorcana </em>can seem overwhelming and confusing at first. </p><p>However, there’s actually a really simple, cheap, and easy way to get into Disney’s hit card game. All you need to do is buy the <em>Lorcana </em>Gateway kit. That’s it. </p><h2 id="h830565"><a id=""></a>Buy A <em>Lorcana </em>Gateway Kit!</h2><p>No, seriously, if you and a friend, spouse, or sibling want to start learning and playing <em>Lorcana</em>, just buy the Gateway kit. That’s all you need! This starter kit contains two decks, four booster packs, a playing mat, damage tokens, a handy rule book, and a guide that walks both players through learning <em>Lorcana</em>. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://go.skimresources.com?id=33330X1579802&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravensburger.us%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2Fgames%2Ffamily-games%2Fdisney-lorcana-tcg-gateway-11098399&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=33330X1579802&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravensburger.us%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2Fgames%2Ffamily-games%2Fdisney-lorcana-tcg-gateway-11098399" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">While the retail price of this kit is $25</a></span> or more, its regularly marked down for half that or less at places like Walmart and Best Buy.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://goto.target.com/c/379647/81938/2092?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fravensburger-disney-lorcana-gateway-trading-card-game%2F-%2FA-90178605%23lnk%3Dsametab&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://goto.target.com/c/379647/81938/2092?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fravensburger-disney-lorcana-gateway-trading-card-game%2F-%2FA-90178605%23lnk%3Dsametab" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody"> I found a copy at Target recently for $12 and that deal is available online</a></span> as of this writing. At that price, the Gateway kit is one of the best deals in card games. </p><p>Just make sure you buy a Gateway kit specifically, and not a Treasure Trove or Starter Deck box. These can sometimes cost around the same price and offer some of what’s found in the Gateway box, but they aren’t the same.</p><figure id="" data-id="363abeecb1bbb2b5c33328a5388293b8" data-recommend-id="image://363abeecb1bbb2b5c33328a5388293b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="800" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ravensburger / Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="363abeecb1bbb2b5c33328a5388293b8" data-recommend-id="image://363abeecb1bbb2b5c33328a5388293b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="800" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The <em>Lorcana</em> Gateway kit’s cover has Mickey Mouse, Elsa, Maleficent, and Stitch on the front and features a big gold sticker that says “Learn to Play!” It also says “Gateway” on the bottom of the front of the box. That’s the one you want to buy! </p><p>I’ve played a lot of card games, both physical and digital, and learning them can be a hassle. And my wife has far less experience with card games than I do. But in just a few hours, we were both playing the game without looking up rules or making mistakes. And more importantly, we were having fun.</p><h2 id="h830566"><a id=""></a>The Gateway kit is the perfect way to learn <em>Lorcana</em></h2><p>The key is that <em>Lorcana’s </em>Gateway Kit isn’t just a bunch of cards, but instead a fully developed system that slowly builds up each player’s deck and options over time. </p><p>You start with just 30 cards each containing simple, basic characters. You then play a few matches and work together to complete challenges laid out in the guidebook. These tasks are usually simple, but make you engage with the game’s mechanics. So you might have to both play five high-cost cards, or challenge and defeat seven characters, things like that. </p><p>Once you’ve completed all the challenges and feel comfortable with the rules and cards so far, you unlock new cards via reward pack boosters. In here you’ll find specific new cards that add a few more rules and options to your deck. Then you complete more challenges and repeat until you’ve unlocked all the rewards. At that point, you’ll each have a full <em>Lorcana </em>deck of over 60 cards and you’ll completely understand how the game works.</p><p>This is the best way to learn a card game in my opinion. It’s fun, cooperative, and super effective. And you can reset the Gateway kit using a guide found inside and teach other players using the same box. Nifty! </p><h2 id="h830567"><a id=""></a>What to do after you learn <em>Lorcana</em></h2><p>Okay, so after learning how to play <em>Lorcana </em>using the Gateway kit, you might want to keep playing and collect more cards. Now what? Personally, I recommend picking up a few starter decks. These contain 60 cards and a booster pack and let you quickly get your hands on a pre-built deck with some solid synergy options. </p><p>You can also start buying boosters online or in card shops. I’d avoid some retailers that sell them at full price (or more!) and instead look for places selling these 12-card packs at a discount.</p><figure id="" data-id="cdfdd19c7bd0fb857e1177d06a5d777f" data-recommend-id="image://cdfdd19c7bd0fb857e1177d06a5d777f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ravensburger / Disney / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cdfdd19c7bd0fb857e1177d06a5d777f" data-recommend-id="image://cdfdd19c7bd0fb857e1177d06a5d777f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you do start to buy booster packs and starter decks, you might also want to invest in a few deck boxes, some card sleeves, and something to hold your excess cards in when they aren’t in a deck. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://go.skimresources.com?id=33330X1579802&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravensburger.us%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2Fdisney-lorcana%2Faccessories&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=33330X1579802&amp;xs=1&amp;xcust=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ravensburger.us%2Fen-US%2Fproducts%2Fdisney-lorcana%2Faccessories" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">There are official <em>Lorcana</em>-branded products</a></span> if you want to go that route, but these tend to be a bit pricey.
