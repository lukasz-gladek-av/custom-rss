A cool new game comes out, a huge download arrives, or you suddenly have a hankering to revisit an old gem from your backlog and then immediately hit the “not enough space” error when you try to download and install it. All of a sudden it’s digital Jenga time and you have to figure out what to delete from your library. Or you could this one quick thing and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-ssd-western-digital-price-8tb-preorder-release-date-1851626940&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-ssd-western-digital-price-8tb-preorder-release-date-1851626940">quickly free up a bunch of space on your SSD</a></span>, maybe even enough to finish installing whatever’s stuck in your download queue. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,196143,196447" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The trick I’m talking about is deleting all your trophy footage in the media folder. The PS5 is over four years old now. If you’ve been playing since launch, there’s a good chance you’ve earned a bunch of achievements across all of the games you’ve played, and mementos from those milestones are clogging up your SSD. I knew my PS5 was doing this but I didn’t realize just how much space it was taking up. </p><p>Fortunately, I came across <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1hxngn2/psa_by_default_the_console_saves_a_14_second_clip/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1hxngn2/psa_by_default_the_console_saves_a_14_second_clip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this really helpful PSA by user wolfgang784</a></span> over on the PlayStation 5 subreddit today. “Just found over 2200 videos while trying to free up space and wondering why my media folder was so big,” the thread reads. Wolfgang784 points out that the PS5 records and stores a 15-second clip of your gameplay every time a trophy pops. If you aren’t vigilant, all of those clips can add up quick. Here’s how to fix that:</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>Turn on your PS5</li><li>Go to the gear icon on the far right of the home screen to access settings</li><li>Choose the storage option and open up the media folder</li><li>toggle over to the trophy category and then select all and hit delete</li></ol><figure id="" data-id="65bc17c90d7e72dadc711832aac9210f" data-recommend-id="image://65bc17c90d7e72dadc711832aac9210f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The media folder on the PS5 displays trophy clips. " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The media folder on the PS5 displays trophy clips. " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="65bc17c90d7e72dadc711832aac9210f" data-recommend-id="image://65bc17c90d7e72dadc711832aac9210f" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The media folder on the PS5 displays trophy clips. " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Like I said, it’s a very simple fix that’s easy to overlook. At least that’s what I tell myself to explain why I never noticed this until now. Usually I’m sorting through albums for various games trying to figure out what precious clips I want to delete to try and win back one precious gigabyte here and another there from my precious SSD space. In addition to everything else, the dedicated trophy section of the media folder makes it easy to quickly nuke a ton of footage without worrying.</p><p>After that, you can go and change the settings for what’s recorded when you earn a trophy. It can be just a screenshot, or you can limit captures to only gold or platinum trophies. If you’re serious about documenting all of that stuff, then by all means feel free to hang onto it or move it to an external drive before purging. I am not, and instantly got back 7GB of storage. </p><p>That’s not much when it comes to behemoth game file sizes like <em>Destiny 2 </em>and <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, but as someone who recently went through their digital collection and downloaded a ton of stuff I’ve never played, 7GB is enough to install half a dozen smaller indie games or older PlayStation classics. One of these days I’ll install a bigger SSD. Until then, thank you, wolfgang784, for the super useful tip. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That means we are now entering the 12th year of Sony’s home console. Usually, at this point in a console’s lifetime there are few if any new games being released for it. However, that’s not the case with the PS4, as there are over 20 games scheduled to arrive on the aging machine in 2025. </p><p>Here are 22 new games coming to PS4 (and other platforms) this year. Keep in mind this likely isn’t a complete list and it’s possible that more games will be announced for PS4 later in the year.</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li><strong><em>Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana</em></strong> (PS5/PS4, Switch) - January 7</li><li><strong><em>Freedom Wars Remastered</em></strong> (PC, PS4, PS5, Switch) - January 10</li><li><strong><em>Tales of Graces f Remastered</em></strong> (PS5, PS4, Switch, PC, Xbox One, XSX/S) - January 17</li><li><strong><em>Star Wars Episode I: Jedi Power Battles</em></strong> (PC, PS4/5, Switch, Xbox One, XSX/S) - January 23</li><li><strong><em>Sniper Elite: Resistance</em></strong><em> </em>(PC, PS4, PS5, XSX/S, Xbox One) - January 30</li><li><strong><em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak 2</em></strong> (PS5, PS4, PC, Switch) - February 14</li><li><strong><em>Tomb Raider IV-V-VI </em>Remastered</strong> (PC, PS4/5, Switch, Xbox One, XSX/S) - February 14</li><li><strong><em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em></strong> (PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, XSX/S ) - February 21</li><li><strong><em>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster: Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars</em></strong><em> </em>(PS4, PS5, PC, Switch, Xbox One, XSX/S) - March 6</li><li><strong><em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories and the Envisioned Land</em></strong> (PS4, PS5, Switch, PC, Xbox One, XSX/S) - March 21</li><li><strong><em>Bleach: Rebirth of Souls</em></strong> (PC, PS4, PS5, XSX/S) - March 21</li><li><strong><em>Atomfall</em></strong><em> </em>(PC, PS4/5, Xbox One, XSX/S) - March 27</li><li><strong><em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em></strong> (PC, PS4, PS5, XSX/S) - April 24</li><li><strong><em>Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</em></strong> (PS4, PS5, PC, Mobile) - June</li><li><strong><em>Double Dragon Revive</em></strong> (PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, XSX/S) - October 23</li><li><strong><em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> </strong>(PS4/5, PC, Xbox One, XSX/S) - 2025</li><li><strong><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></strong> (PC, PS4/5, XSX/S, Xbox One) - 2025</li><li><strong><em>Little Nightmares 3</em></strong> (PC, PS4/5, Switch, Xbox) - 2025</li><li><strong><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em></strong> (PC, Switch, PS4/5, XSX/S, Xbox One) - 2025</li><li><strong><em>Splitgate 2</em></strong><em> </em>(PC, PS5, PS4, XSX/S, Xbox One) - 2025</li><li><strong><em>The House of the Dead 2: Remake</em></strong> (PC, PS4, PS5, Switch, Xbox One, XSX/S) - 2025</li><li><strong><em>WWE 2K25</em></strong><em> </em>(PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, XSX/S) - 2025</li></ol><p>Now, as mentioned before with the PS2, it’s not unheard of for very popular video game consoles to keep receiving new game releases a decade after the device first hit the market. A big install base is a big install base. But usually, this far into a console’s lifespan, you might get, say, one or two new games. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-game-release-dates-of-2018-red-dead-2-smash-br/1100-6455204/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-game-release-dates-of-2018-red-dead-2-smash-br/1100-6455204/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">For example, in 2018</a></span>—12 years after the PlayStation 3 launched—we got two new PS3 games, and one was <em>FIFA 19. </em></p><p>What we’re seeing with the PS4 in its 12th year is unlike anything in modern gaming history. Nearly two dozen games, at least, are set to arrive on PS4 this year, and not all of them are sports games or old ports. Some are brand new remasters, others are smaller 2D titles, and some are big AAA games like <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> and <em>Elden Ring Nightreign.</em> </p><h2 id="h73952"><a id=""></a>Console generations aren’t the same as before</h2><p>And before someone jumps on me for suggesting PS4 games launching in 2025 is a bad thing, let me be clear: I’m not saying that. Most AAA video game studios have moved on to more powerful hardware, so I don’t think the industry is being held back by the PS4 (or the Xbox One, for that matter, which is also getting new games.)</p><p>The reality is that in 2025, the video game industry and market are very different than they once were. Back in the era of the PS2 and even PS3, tech was advancing rapidly from 2D to 3D to HD to 4K. New consoles felt more necessary every few years. That’s not the case in 2025. </p><p>The PS4 is still a fairly capable machine, especially for indie devs or people making smaller games or RPGs using pre-established tools and tech. And thanks to digital marketplaces, you don’t need to stock your game at Walmart to sell copies. It also helps that modern engines like Unreal and Unity are very scalable and flexible, so a single game can run on Switch, PS4, PS5, and even mobile devices. </p><p>Oh, and let’s not forget that some of the most popular games around right now—<em>Fortnite, Call of Duty Warzone, Genshin Impact, Overwatch 2, GTA Online, Minecraft, </em>and <em>Roblox</em>—are all on PS4, and still receive updates each month. There’s a giant group of players who don’t feel the need to move on because the big games they play every week are still active and alive on PS4, so it’s not shocking that devs are still making plenty of games for the 12-year-old console in 2025. </p><p>The real question now is whether the PS4 can last longer than the PS2. I think it can. Even if, come next year, we only see half as many PS4 games launch as we get in 2025, that’ll still be over 10. We might even be getting PS4 games up until and beyond the launch of a theoretical PS6. Wild stuff. </p><p>&nbsp; .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the podcast episode, Stiller implies they were working on <em>Severance </em>before the streamer’s existence was publicly announced, as he described the early experience as “developing this show for a platform that didn’t exist yet.” What we didn’t know at the time the series order made news is that Apple wasn’t convinced Scott should be Mark, and a year went by with no new developments on the show because they were trying to figure out how to get Apple on board with Scott starring.</p><p> “There was a long process of talking about other ideas. But, really, I was not going to do the show if [Scott] wasn’t going to do it. I kept saying that to them, and they were like, ‘Okay, maybe you’ll think of this actor. Maybe you’ll think of that actor,’” Stiller recalls. </p><p>Stiller was confused as to why the bigwigs at Apple were dragging their feet on accepting Scott, but changed their minds once they saw Scott read for the part. Taking it all in stride, Scott humbly admits his star power might not have been enough for the Apple head honchos. “I understood why they were feeling this way because, the first time I read this script, my first instinct was: ‘There’s no way I’m going to end up doing this. This is too good,’” Scott explains. “If I was Apple, I would likely be wanting a giant star to play this role.”</p><p>Since Apple came to their senses, Scott has gone on to garner an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series and a Golden Globe nomination for Beat Actor in a Television Series — Drama for his impeccable portrayal of Mark on <em>Severance. </em>Apple were saved from themselves, and we all have Stiller and his year-long persistence to thank for it. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We didn’t know much about it, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/transformers-reactivate-leak-footage-gameplay-canceled-1851736122?_gl=1*qwsnjh*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjUzMjY5My4xMzEuMS4xNzM2NTMzNTM0LjIuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/transformers-reactivate-leak-footage-gameplay-canceled-1851736122?_gl=1*qwsnjh*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjUzMjY5My4xMzEuMS4xNzM2NTMzNTM0LjIuMC4w">based on what has leaked out</a></span> and was rumored, it sounds like <em>Transformers Reactivate </em>was going to be the big, modern, AAA game the franchise deserves and hasn’t really gotten in many years. However, back in 2010, we did get just such a game. </p><p><em>Transformers: War for Cybertron </em>is a third-person action shooter that lets you play through both sides of the civil war on the robotic planet of Cybertron. One campaign is focused on the Autobots and the other tells the story of the Decepticons. And don’t expect Earth or humans in this game, as it’s all about the bloody civil war that, eventually, leads to the fall of Cybertron (good name for a sequel) and the exodus of the Transformers. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_War_for_Cybertron&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transformers:_War_for_Cybertron" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>War for Cybertron</em></a></span> and its sequel, <em>Fall of Cybertron</em>, play like most other third-person action shooters of the day, complete with the <em>Gears of War</em>-inspired “Hold this button to look at something cool happening” feature. But that’s fine, because instead of boring soldiers shooting people, you get to play as giant transforming robots with silly names who use big guns to destroy other robots, and ayou can become a car or hover tank, too. </p><p><em>War </em>and <em>Fall </em>both know that people want action and sci-fi nonsense in a <em>Transformers </em>game, make the right call in giving you plenty of that. Also, I hope you like different-colored metal corridors filled with nameless robot drones who you blast away over and over again, because that’s mostly what you do in these games. That may not sound great, but because it’s covered in <em>Transformers </em>lore, characters, and weirdness, it still ends up being a lot of fun. And unlike most other third-person corridor shooters of the era, you can transform into a car or a hover tank whenever you want. While in either form you can move faster and gain access to more powerful weapons. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/bOM1T7sWvW4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/bOM1T7sWvW4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">They truly are more than meets than eye. </a></span></p><p>What’s wild to me is that I’m not a <em>Transformers </em>fan and I still enjoyed going back and replaying <em>War for Cybertron</em> earlier this week. If you <em>are</em> a <em>Transformers</em> fan, I expect you’ll get even more out of all the characters and lore shoved into these action-packed shooters. </p><h2 id="h204025"><a id=""></a><em>War for Cybertron</em> deserves a second life</h2><p>So how do you play <em>War for Cybertron</em> and its sequel in 2025? It ain’t easy. The games were pulled from digital storefronts years ago once Activision’s licensing deals expired, so you can’t just buy them on Steam. You can find used Xbox 360 copies floating around on eBay and other sites for under $30, but you’ll need an Xbox 360 console to play them, as none of the games are backward compatible. </p><p>There are other ways to find these games and play them on PC; perhaps you might check out some large archive of content on the internet. Once you get your PC version (I’m not asking how), <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wsgf.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;t=24097&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wsgf.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?f=63&amp;t=24097" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can use this tiny tool</a></span> to unlock the framerate and play <em>War for Cybertron</em> at 120 FPS. </p><p>It’s a shame that Microsoft and Activision haven’t cut a deal with Hasbro to remaster or at the very least port these <em>Transformers </em>games to modern hardware so more people can play them. We know Hasbro wants these games made available again, so it seems like it comes down to Activision. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/transformers-war-cybertron-hasbro-activision-remaster-1850692571&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/transformers-war-cybertron-hasbro-activision-remaster-1850692571">The publisher claimed in 2023</a></span> that despite comments from Hasbro, it still had access to original code for the games. Over a year later, nothing has manifested and it’s still hard as heck to play these popular <em>Transformers </em>games. Which is a shame. </p><p>While we’ve continued to receive smaller <em>Transformers </em>games over the years, it’s been far too long since the last big-budget game based on the franchise hit store shelves. Hasbro and the other companies involved should work out a deal and get the <em>Cybertron </em>titles back on digital stores in 2025, giving <em>Transformers </em>fans who missed out a chance to play these fantastic games. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
