              <p>PlayStation fans have been waiting to hear what’s next from <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-god-of-war-took-five-years-to-make-1825653009">Sony’s <em>God of War</em> studio, Santa Monica,</a> amid rumors that the 2018 game’s director, Cory Barlog, is busy creating a new IP. The veteran developer appears to have finally provided them with their first official details, albeit in the strangest way possible: via his Facebook account.</p> <p>“I’d like to share a little bit about our new project,” Barlog <a href="https://www.facebook.com/cory.barlog.357128/posts/pfbid0JHwrN1fGFLZGN5BBa7qneq6Qcc3prpVKvHpfPnZBewgcnZ4sehaHporp97xaLq3Jl">wrote on&nbsp;Facebook</a>, as first reported by <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/18/god-of-war-developer-sony-santa-monica-is-working-on-a-new-technically-ambitious-ip">by <em>Game Informer</em></a>. “I’m incredibly proud of what the team at Santa Monica Studio has been accomplishing. It’s a technically ambitious project, something that’s not easy to achieve. This is a new IP we’ve been working on for years, and if all goes well, we’re planning to show it to you later this year. I couldn’t be more excited.”</p> <p>While many have shared doubts about the veracity of the post, the account behind it is listed as friends with<em>&nbsp;God of War</em> composer Bear McCreary and former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida, among other industry figures. Sony did not immediately respond to requests for comment.</p>

 <p>As rumors have swirled about what exactly Santa Monica is making, <em>Bloomberg</em>‘s Jason Schreier <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot46-back-to-the-beach.1172010/page-406#post-142670637">reported</a> earlier this year that, contrary to popular speculation, the studio was not making a sci-fi game. He was more cryptic on whether the current project is related to <em>God of War</em> or not. “It’s not a new IP but it might feel like one,” he wrote. “Maybe that’s why people are confused.”</p> <p>This led some fans to speculate that the upcoming game could be a <em>God of War</em> spin-off that is so different from the existing third-person action franchise, it’s being treated internally as a new IP. It’s unclear right now how many projects Santa Monica has going at the same time, with a rumored <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1leijyp/jeff_grubb_greek_god_of_war_game_internally/"><em>God of War</em> set in Greece</a> reportedly delayed and an online spin-off at fellow PlayStation studio Bluepoint <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-multiplayer-bluepoint-days-gone-2-concord-1851742012">reportedly canceled earlier this year</a>.</p> <p>One thing’s for sure: the new game’s announcement, whatever it ends up being, is something PS5 superfans have been desperate for as this console generation drags on without many first-party single-player blockbusters to point to. If Barlog’s next game does get announced this year, presumably at the Game Awards, it’ll suggest the PS5 is shaping up to have a strong last few years when it comes to Sony-made exclusives.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>A group of dataminers has reportedly shared visual evidence of some very large maps that will be available in <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> at launch or shortly after the online shooter’s October release on PC and console.</p> <p>Over the last two weekends, <a href="https://kotaku.com/oh-thank-god-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-back-2000617797"><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s open beta</a> was a <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-call-of-duty-record-2000616838">big hit with players</a>. The upcoming military sim’s ground combat, explosive destruction, and <em>Battlefield 3</em>-like vibes were well received online. I had a blast putting over 15 hours into the beta by myself and with friends. But it wasn’t a perfect beta, of course, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-bf6-rush-mcom-change-wnba-mafia-news-2000618000">EA having to tweak Rush shortly after adding it</a>, and some players complaining that the maps in the beta were too small. Well, good news for those people: We have our first reported look at some of the bigger maps that will likely be available in <em>BF6</em> later this year.</p> <p><a href="https://mp1st.com/news/battlefield-6-large-scale-map-images-leak-comparisons-alleviate-beta-concerns">As reported by <em>MP1st</em> on August 17</a>, a group of <em>Battlefield</em> dataminers known as 1BF was recently able to extract files from <em>Battlefield Lab</em>s. This is a version of <em>BF6</em> that EA uses for testing out new features, early gameplay ideas, maps, and modes. The group claims to have datamined two maps from <em>BF Labs</em>: Mirak Valley, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/features/maps">which was already confirmed by EA to be in the full game</a>, and another, known as Eastwood, that is rumored to be <em>BF6</em>‘s first post-launch map. And both of these maps are much bigger than the compact, urban warfare maps featured in the beta.&nbsp; According to the dataminers, Mirak Valley will be the largest map available in <em>Battlefield 6</em> at launch.</p> <h2>Leaked images of two big <em>Battlefield 6</em> maps</h2> <p>In renders leaked online via Imgur, which are included below, you can see various shots of Mirak Valley. Keep in mind the map won’t look like this in-game, but it does show us what looks to be a very big and open map, something <em>Battlefield</em> vets will appreciate.</p>

     <p>Meanwhile, the other large map, known as Eastwood, is reportedly set in California and will feature a golf course, fancy houses, and a new vehicle: a golf cart. <a href="https://youtu.be/X96xvDjEaVw">When EA teased a battle royale-like mode last month</a> coming to <em>BF6</em> in the future, it showed what looked like a mansion’s pool and people driving a golf cart. Perhaps Eastwood, which is likely the map’s codename and not its final title, will be the setting for this teased mode. You can see renders of Eastwood below:</p>   <p>A size comparison of Mirak Valley and Eastwood to the <em>BF6</em> beta map Siege of Cairo has also been doing the rounds based on the datamined renders, and it does show that, yes, there are seemingly much bigger maps in <em>Battlefield 6</em>. This shouldn’t be too surprising to learn, though, because <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6-dev-says-the-betas-small-maps-are-to-make-sure-we-hit-the-full-octane-version-of-battlefield-on-the-head-and-dont-worry-large-maps-exist-too/"><em>Battlefield</em> lead producer David Sirland</a> said that bigger maps would be included in the full game last week.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Datamine of previously (mostly) unseen maps from the beta files</p> <p>Mirak Valley, based on the official description, will be the largest map on release</p> <p>source: Happysufigeee <a href="https://t.co/Hrr3YDyOTX">pic.twitter.com/Hrr3YDyOTX</a></p> <p>— 1BF | Battlefield 6 (@onebattlefield) <a href="https://twitter.com/onebattlefield/status/1956751064587239657?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It should be noted that datamined content isn’t guaranteed to be included in the full game. Development is messy, plans shift, and things get delayed or canned all the time. That said, these maps look very far along, and at least one of them is listed as a launch map in <em>BF6</em>. So while there might be some changes made between the datamined renders and the final maps in the shipped game, I’m expecting both of these maps to be included at some point in<em> Battlefield 6.</em></p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> launches on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p>

              <p>There’s a new reason to revisit <em>Battlefield 2042</em>, <em>Euro Truck Simulator</em> 2 gets ported after 13 years, and I don’t need another <a href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-goty-game-awards-app-store-steam-sale-1851709617"><em>Balatro</em>-like in my life,</a> but I might make an exception for fellow dopamine drip machine <em>Raccoin</em>. Welcome to another edition of <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/morning-checkpoint">Morning Checkpoint</a>, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s round-up of gaming news and cultural discourse. Also, ongoing updates on the fate of D.C.’s most infamous sandwich slinger. A 20-person goon squad was sent to his home last Friday <a href="https://www.thedailybeast.com/trump-goons-sent-swat-team-to-bust-the-dc-hoagie-hurler/">to re-arrest the guy</a>, but murals memorializing the moment <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ianlivingston.bsky.social/post/3lwmpmzwl322h">will be harder to detain</a>.</p> <h2><em>Raccoin</em> is a coin pusher for roguelike deckbuilder freaks</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="RACCOIN: Coin Pusher Roguelike | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Yy1FcT6sfIo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Playstack’s next game is about watching coins fall off a ramp as you use special items and tricks to generate giant, super-satisfying combos. It’s certainly being presented as <em>Balatro</em> for coin-pushers, complete with a nice, quirky arcade cabinet art style. You select different characters with unique advantages and unlock special coins you can deploy to rack up bonuses. There’s a physics simulation element and lots of jingling.</p> <p>The developer is Doraccoon, and this appears to be their first game. If you’ve ever wandered by someone hunched over a coin pusher in the wild with a zombie look in their eyes and shook your head in dismay, well, hey, that could be you when<em> Raccoin</em> launches. There’s no release date yet, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3784030/RACCOIN_Coin_Pusher_Roguelike/">a free playtest on Steam is live starting August 18</a>.</p>

 <h2>Keeping <em>Anthem</em> online forever might have made it a worse game</h2> <p>Ex-BioWare producer Mark Darrah recently mused about<em> Anthem</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-bioware-dragon-age-mass-effect-1851786136">servers shutting down next year</a> in light of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/stop-killing-games-break-switch-2-cart-size-ign-layoffs-pilotwings-music-2000614692">Stop Killing Games movement</a>. Had it been designed to stay online forever, “it would have been an uglier game, probably would have had more latency issues,” he recently told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pd9OG3HmN0">YouTuber MrMattyPlays</a>. “It would have been a worse experience second-to-second in order to get something that basically wouldn’t need to ever be sunset.”</p> <p>But he also added that those tradeoffs might be worth it in the long run. “I think maybe it is that we want to be in a world where we’re willing to sacrifice some fidelity, sacrifice some things in order to get it so that games don’t just vanish one day.”</p> <h2><em>Battlefield 2042</em> gets a big surprise update called “<em>Road to&nbsp;<span>Battlefield</span> 6</em>“</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Road to Battlefield 6: Iwo Jima" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Xq0BbFJ0DU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>EA’s last beleaguered multiplayer shooter is being repurposed into a bridge to the future. A new update that goes live today adds a new free pass full of unlockable nods to the franchise’s past as well as new rewards for <em>Battlefield 6</em>. A version of the Iwo Jima map is also returning, alongside other new content. Fans are grudgingly on board. “<span dir="auto" role="text">Okay <em>2042</em>, ill bite one last time,” wrote one YouTube commenter.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><em>Euro Truck Simulator 2</em> is coming to console</h2> <p>A PlayStation store listing for the hit highway-and-chill series <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/EuroTruck2/comments/1mthopc/ets2_is_coming_to_ps5/">leaked over the weekend</a>. The PS5 version is arriving <a href="https://truck-simulator.fandom.com/wiki/Euro_Truck_Simulator_2_Version_history">over a decade</a> after the game came out, though regular updates have continued adding new vehicles and fleshing out the sprawling continental road map.</p> <h2>There’s an enhanced version of <a href="https://kotaku.com/shenmue-3-the-kotaku-review-1840175041"><em>Shenmue III</em></a> on the way</h2> <p><em>Shenmue III Enhanced</em> will have more NPCs in the streets, better graphics, menu and gameplay fixes, and a new camera mode inspired by the original two games. It also brings the game to Xbox and Switch 2, with an upgrade path for those who already own it on PC and PS4.</p>

 <h2><em>The Last Of Us</em> <em>Online</em> game director teases new multiplayer project</h2> <p>Vinit Agarwal left Naughty Dog <a href="https://kotaku.com/naughty-dog-last-us-online-vinit-agarwal-1851785806">earlier this year</a> to set up a new game studio in Japan. He recently shed more light on what fans can expect from the studio’s new project, whose team also includes fellow <em>Last of Us Online</em> lead Joe Pettinati. “A big part of what inspired me to [go independent] was seeing the potential in combining Naughty Dog’s specialty, cinematic action, with multiplayer,” he <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/08/13/155975.html">told GameSpark</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/director-of-scrapped-the-last-of-us-online-says-his-new-us-japan-studio-is-making-a-cinematic-multiplayer-title/"><em>VGC</em></a>).
