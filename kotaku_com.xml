At the same time, rewrites and reshoots have definitely hamstrung some movies in the MCU. I’m sure the <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> team would love a mulligan, though there’s no evidence that’s the case here. <br></p><p>We still have no real idea what this next phase of the MCU will revolve around, other than Disney seemingly going back to the well and trying to resurrect the franchise’s earlier magic.

One thing the Star Wars spin-off can rest assured of is that no other major video games will be releasing around it that month. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A24 announced <em>Elden Ring </em>is the latest hit game slated to get a live-action adaptation, with Ex Machina and <em>Civil War</em>’s Alex Garland signed on to direct. What exactly the result will be is anyone’s guess, and fans aren’t quite sure whether to praise the sun or get ready for a flop.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196773" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The brutal but massively acclaimed 2022 action-RPG has sold over 30 million copies, making it a straightforward choice for Hollywood to take a shot at in terms of the financial upside. But while some game movies have recently hit big at the box office, like <em>Sonic</em>, <em>Mario</em>, and <em>Minecraft</em>, others aimed at more mature audiences—like <em>Borderlands</em>—have been epic failures. </p><p>The <em>Elden Ring</em> project doesn’t have a tentative release date yet and about the only other thing we know so far is that the production team includes some combination of: Peter Rice, Andrew Macdonald, Allon Reich, Vince Gerardis, and George R. R. Martin. That last name is important not just because he’s the author behind the <em>Game of Thrones</em>, but also because he collaborated with FromSoftware on <em>Elden Ring</em>’s story and world building. </p><p>Precisely how much he was involved remains up for debate. Martin seems happy to involve himself in any creative endeavor that will delay him from finally finishing the last two books in his<em> Song of Fire and Ice</em> fantasy series, <em>The Winds of Winter </em>and <em>A Dream of Spring</em>. <em>Elden Ring</em> fans, a famously chill bunch, aren’t sure how to feel about the whole thing. </p><p>Garland has been on a writing and directing blitz. Following his acclaimed sci-fi horror <em>Ex Machina</em> and his adaptation of the <em>Annihilation</em> books, he’s recently put out the American political horror flick <em>Civil War</em>, this year’s Iraq invasion movie <em>Warfare</em>, and a bunch of <em>28 Days Later </em>spin-offs. How would his horror chops influence <em>Elden Ring </em>on the big screen? </p><p>Given it’s an A24 production, there’s a good chance Garland and company will have a lot of latitude with the mood of an <em>Elden Ring</em> movie and how it’s shot, with more artistic license than a conventional game adaptation aimed at a mass audience might be offered. And of course there’s whatever role publisher Bandai Namco will play in all of this, as well as FromSoftware itself. Director Hidetaka Miyazaki has been integral to the studio’s unique brand of storytelling, including <em>Elden Ring</em>, but has no confirmed role in the adaptation at the moment.</p><p>You should actually watch an interview <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA&amp;pp=0gcJCdgAo7VqN5tD&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA&amp;pp=0gcJCdgAo7VqN5tD" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garland did with Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann</a></span> if you want to get a good sense of how he thinks about storytelling in games and movies. I can imagine a very stoic, near wordless script that focuses an <em>Elden Ring</em> movie primarily on the mythology and horror of The Lands Between, which is in some ways comparable to zombie Camelot. </p><p> FromSoftware’s boss creature designs, extravagant and larger-than-life, seem like a challenging fit for a live-action production without a Disney-level budget for special effects. Then again, the team on <em>Godzilla Minus One</em> proved you don’t need tons of money to make an incredible-looking monster movie. I wonder if Guillermo del Toro was offered a shot at <em>Elden Ring</em> and passed. It certainly seems more up his alley than Garland’s. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Joel (Pedro Pascal) and Ellie (Bella Ramsey) are standing on a hill with the Jackson settlement they’ll call home in the distance. Ellie, unconvinced by Joel’s story about raiders massacring the Firefly revolutionaries who were looking to make a cure for the cordyceps fungus, asks the smuggler to swear that everything he said is true. Joel hesitates and then says that he swears. However, rather than keeping the now-iconic hard cut to black on Ellie’s skeptical face as she says “okay,” season two shows her walking down the hill and leaving Joel in an uncomfortable silence. This unnecessary addition to a scene that was once perfect is a pretty concise encapsulation of the season’s biggest problems. But it’s hardly the most egregious example in this episode.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Read more: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-season-2-episode-1-recap-review-s2e1-1851775994&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-season-2-episode-1-recap-review-s2e1-1851775994"><em>The Last Of Us</em> Season Two, Episode One Recap: Everybody Hates Joel</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="526b76c549bc47afd349ae47beb8810d" data-recommend-id="image://526b76c549bc47afd349ae47beb8810d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joel raises his hands while looking at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joel raises his hands while looking at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="526b76c549bc47afd349ae47beb8810d" data-recommend-id="image://526b76c549bc47afd349ae47beb8810d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joel raises his hands while looking at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Welcome back to another recap of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661?_gl=1*1u3tm7o*_ga*MTU0OTQ4NzYzMi4xNjcwODY1MjIy*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDgwMDcyNTYkbzk0JGcxJHQxNzQ4MDA3NjIxJGo1NyRsMCRoMCRkaTEwRWRDMnVEUktfZ0tnQ1QyVW5aNnFubXp0OG5sdTZDUQ..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661?_gl=1*1u3tm7o*_ga*MTU0OTQ4NzYzMi4xNjcwODY1MjIy*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDgwMDcyNTYkbzk0JGcxJHQxNzQ4MDA3NjIxJGo1NyRsMCRoMCRkaTEwRWRDMnVEUktfZ0tnQ1QyVW5aNnFubXp0OG5sdTZDUQ.."><em>The Last of Us</em> season two</a></span>.

We’re firmly in Seattle for Ellie’s revenge tour, and while she doesn’t quite get to any of her targets this week, we do get plenty of time to see her and Dina be cute and gay together, as well as an explosive intro to one of the best characters in the show, and some new details about the war between the Seraphites and the W.L.F.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Read more: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-us-season-2-episode-4-dina-ellie-isaac-seraphite-1851779062?_gl=1*nc09n5*_ga*MTU0OTQ4NzYzMi4xNjcwODY1MjIy*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDgwMDcyNTYkbzk0JGcxJHQxNzQ4MDA3ODE4JGo2MCRsMCRoMCRkaTEwRWRDMnVEUktfZ0tnQ1QyVW5aNnFubXp0OG5sdTZDUQ..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-us-season-2-episode-4-dina-ellie-isaac-seraphite-1851779062?_gl=1*nc09n5*_ga*MTU0OTQ4NzYzMi4xNjcwODY1MjIy*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDgwMDcyNTYkbzk0JGcxJHQxNzQ4MDA3ODE4JGo2MCRsMCRoMCRkaTEwRWRDMnVEUktfZ0tnQ1QyVW5aNnFubXp0OG5sdTZDUQ.."><em>The Last Of Us </em>Season Two, Episode Four Recap: U-Haul Lesbian Road Trip</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5dda7555f85a9174a4b0f17b1c86ac65" data-recommend-id="image://5dda7555f85a9174a4b0f17b1c86ac65" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dina looks at something off-screen while Ellie approaches her from behind." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dina looks at something off-screen while Ellie approaches her from behind." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5dda7555f85a9174a4b0f17b1c86ac65" data-recommend-id="image://5dda7555f85a9174a4b0f17b1c86ac65" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dina looks at something off-screen while Ellie approaches her from behind." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Ellie finally got a little bit of revenge this week.

However, I don’t think I have it in me this week. I’ve been dreading writing a recap for the sixth episode of this season because it is exactly the kind of sentimental, dramatic episode of television that often captivates audiences and gets award show buzz, but it is also one of the most nauseating adaptations of the original work the show has given us yet. This is where all of showrunner Craig Mazin’s odd creative choices collide like the gnarliest 10-car pileup you’ve ever witnessed, and the result is the absolute bastardization of the most important scene in all of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Read more: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-episode-6-recap-museum-porch-scene-1851781187&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-episode-6-recap-museum-porch-scene-1851781187"><em>The Last Of Us</em> Season Two, Episode Six Recap: Days Of You And Me</a></span></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
