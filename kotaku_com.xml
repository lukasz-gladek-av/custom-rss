              <p>Top tech, kitchen appliances, outdoor gear, and games aren’t the only things going for less during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. It’s also a great time to grab some useful subscriptions and software for less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/">StackSocial has dropped the price of Microsoft Office Professional 2021 for Windows to just $35, after a massive 84% discount.</a> It’s a lifetime license, so you won’t have to worry about paying an additional monthly or yearly fee after your purchase, ever.</p>
<p>It’s one of the many early Black Friday deals by the retailer, but it’s selling out fast. At the time of writing, over 20,000 licenses have been sold at the discounted rate. We don’t know how long it’s going to stay around, so it’s best to grab it quickly.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>Instant Access to All the Essential Programs</h2>
<p>It’s more of a one-and-done purchase. You’re going to receive access to your software license keys and download links instantly after you complete your purchase. The code needs to be redeemed within 7 days, or it’s going to expire. The licensing type will be connected with your actual device and not your Microsoft account, so you won’t exactly be able to transfer it across multiple machines.</p>
<p>There are some system requirements you need to know about. It runs on Windows 10 and 11, and doesn’t support older systems like Windows 7 or 8. The retailers recommend installing it on a device with at least 16 GB of RAM, plus having 4GB of available storage and a screen resolution of at least 1280×800. Most standard PCs already have these built in, but we still suggest peeking at your system settings before you proceed.</p>
<p>Once installed, you’ll have access to the full Microsoft Office Professional 2021 suite. This includes Microsoft Office Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Outlook. Whether you’re someone who needs to write a bunch of documents or create long, never-ending spreadsheets at work, it’s all covered. PowerPoint lets you create stunning, professional-level presentations with a whole bunch of useful tools built right in. Accessing your emails and communicating with the team will be just as easy with Outlook. You can even use it to manage your everyday calendar and stay on top of your tasks for better productivity throughout the day.</p>



<p>Support for Teams (free version) lets you take meetings on the go. Students will appreciate OneNote, a program that makes it both fun and easy to take notes, mark documents, create diagrams, and organize everything into different categories. Publisher and Access are available, too. The former can be used to develop your very own publications, while the latter is great for creating databases and automating tasks. The entire suite is great for work professionals looking to manage tasks better, students wanting to study more efficiently, creatives who need to organize their workflows, and even casual users who want to enjoy better efficiency.</p>
<p>This isn’t the latest version of Microsoft Office, but it still delivers all the basic features you can possibly need to get through your busy, demanding days. Just note that it does not work like Microsoft 365, so you won’t get access to cloud-based storage or features like real-time collaboration. It’s more suited for solo, offline use.</p>
<p>On a regular day, this Microsoft Office Professional 2021 for Windows license would set you back around $220. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/">The current deal takes $180 off and offers it for just $35, which is practically nothing for the convenience it brings.</a> You also don’t have to worry about entering any long coupon codes or following complicated checkout processes to score the drop. Just add it to your cart, receive the credentials, and follow the suggested steps to complete the process.</p>

              <p>Valve is running a big Black Friday sale for the first time in Steam’s history. Normally, around this time of year, we get a Fall sale and a Winter sale. Now Valve has decided to join in with every other online retailer and treat Black Friday as a week-long sales event. But hey, cheaper games are always nice, especially when they are new releases.</p> <p>On November 25, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/specials/?flavor=contenthub_topsellers&amp;offset=74">Valve surprised many by announcing a large Black Friday sale</a> on its hugely popular PC gaming storefront, Steam. The sale runs from now until December 1 and features a large list of games across basically every genre and sub-genre you can imagine. Better yet, a lot of the discounted games include titles, both big and small, that launched in 2025.</p>

 <p>For example, you can grab <em>Battlefield 6,</em> one of the biggest games this year, for $10 less than usual. If you are looking for something big to sink into over Thanksgiving, the remastered <em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> is just $34 this week. Or maybe you want some puzzles to solve with your family and friends? Well, good news: <em>Blue Prince</em> is discounted to just $20 during Steam’s big sale. And if you crave a fun zombie game, this year’s <em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> is excellent and even better at $45.</p>

 <p>And it’s not just games that are on sale. <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-black-friday-sale-discount-pc-gaming-2000647222">Valve has also marked down the Steam Deck, too.</a> You can get the base LCD model for $80 less than usual. It might be a bit old now, but the Steam Deck is still a damn fine way to play most indie games and smaller titles in 2025.</p> <p>Of course, with a sale this big, we here at <em>Kotaku</em> want to help you find a good deal. So our crack team of experts (me) used advanced algorithms (I spent an hour digging through deals) to assemble a handy database of big discounts worth checking out. (I made a list for you.)</p>  <ul> <li><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> – $56 ($70)</li> <li><em>Silent Hill f</em> – $56 ($70)</li> <li><em>Split Fiction</em> – $40 ($50)</li> <li><em>EA Sports FC 2026</em> – $35 ($70)</li> <li><em>Of Ash &amp; Steel</em> – $24 ($30)</li> <li><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> – $34 ($50)</li> <li><em>Blue Prince</em> – $20 ($30)</li> <li><em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> – $49 ($70)</li> <li><em>Battlefield 6</em> – $60 ($70)</li> <li><em>Moonlighter 2</em> – $25 ($30)</li> <li><em>Dying Light The Beast</em> – $45 ($60)</li> <li><em>Borderlands 4</em> – $56 ($70)</li> <li><em>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</em>– $21 ($30)</li> <li><em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> – $26 ($40)</li> <li><em>Hellclock</em> – $14 ($20)</li> <li><em>Mars First Logistics</em> – $13 ($20)</li> <li><em>Metal Eden</em> – $20 ($40)</li> <li><em>Wildgate</em> – $15 ($30)</li> <li><em>Camper Van: Make It Home</em> – $11 ($15)</li> <li><em>Chip ‘N Clawz vs. The Brainioids</em> – $21 ($30)</li> <li><em>Time Flies</em> – $12 ($15)</li> <li><em>to a T</em> – $13 ($20)</li> <li><em>Tron Catalyst</em> – $17 ($25)</li> <li><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> – $70 ($35)</li> <li><em>Jackbox Party Pack 11</em> – $24 ($30)</li> </ul>

              <p>Following the success of the Steam Deck PC gaming handheld, Valve announce an all-new lineup of gaming hardware including a Steam Controller, a VR kit called the Steam Frame, and the Steam Machine. The last of those is a retread of Valve’s attempt at having a home gaming console, but the company is in a much better position to be an Xbox killer now given current hardware capabilities along with the work put in to make the Steam OS into what it is now. That said, the big question is price. We currently have no clue what it will sell for nor when it will come out. So if you’re aching to get some gaming in right now, maybe go with a gaming laptop.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5674/">This Asus ROG Strix G16 gaming laptop is currently on sale at Amazon Black Friday, for 19% off.</a> It’s normally listed at $2,100 but the discount ends up bringing it down by a full $400. You end up only having to pay $1,700 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5674/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Diving into the specs, this 2025 premiere gaming laptop is working with the AMD Ryzen 9 9955HX processor alongside an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5070 Laptop GPU. You can expect cutting-edge performance all on a portable device. It’s packed with 32GB of DDR5-5600MHz memory and a storage capacity of 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD for your gaming library.</p>
<h2>Stunning Visuals</h2>
<p>The laptop is employing a premium ROG Nebula display, capable of ultra-fast 240Hz refresh rates with an input time of just 3ms. The screen measures across at 16 inches and has a 90% screen-to-body ratio to help maximize it’s workable area. It’s covered with an ACR film which helps to both enhance contrast as well as reduce glare when gaming in brightly lit spaces. NVIDIA G-Sync is supported, helping to eliminate screen tearing while playing fast-action games such as a first person shooter.</p>



<p>Advanced thermals work to keep your system cool and quiet during intense gameplay. The unit features three fans working in unison along with a heatsink the full width of the laptop and vents on all sides, all helping to keep the Asus ROG Strix G16 gaming laptop cool.</p>
<p>And it wouldn’t be a capital-G Gaming laptop without customizable RGB. The light bar can be set to synchronize with your keyboard and other ROG peripherals. And with the touch of a button, switch it to stealth mode to turn off the RGB lighting. Great for professional settings.</p>
