              <p>Lego has released plenty of Harry Potter sets over the years, and with Halloween just around the corner, Amazon’s kicking off the celebrations early by putting quite a few of them on sale. We’ve spotted Hagrid’s hut, Hogwarts Castle, and Aragog in the Forbidden Forest dropping in prices previously. But today, things are taking an even more magical turn – straight into the dungeons.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4895/">Amazon is being generous with a 35% discount on the Hogwarts Castle: Potions Class Building set, offering it for just $26</a>. That’s a nice $14 discount on a set that’ll fit beautifully into your current Harry Potter Lego setup, and even make a memorable gift for a fan in your family or friends. There’s no word on how long the discount will last, so it’s best to grab it sooner rather than later.</p>

<h2>Four Key Characters From the Movies</h2>
<p>This set lets you recreate Professor Severus Snape’s lessons in his dungeon classroom. It comes with 397 pieces, and includes a blackboard, potion bottles, ingredient jars, shelves, and all the other elements you’ll need to bring the setup to life. You’ll also get four minifigures; a very angry Severus Snape (not even surprised), Hermione Granger, Pansy Parkinson, and Seamus Finnigan. We would’ve loved to see a confused Ron or Malfoy up to some mischief, but this lineup works just fine too.</p>



<p>The set also includes two randomly selected collectible Hogwarts portraits. These are part of a larger collection of 14, and can be a valuable addition to your collection if you’ve got one. As with all Lego sets, you’ll get a step-by-step instruction book that walks you through the entire build. It’s pretty easy to follow, even for kids who are building for the first time, but if you need more help, we recommend installing the Lego Builder app. You’ll get 3D instructions, so you can view every step from all angles to get a better idea. There’s also a “Build Together” mode, which is great for when multiple people are working on the same set. Plus, you can keep track of your progress, and see all your Lego projects in one place.</p>
<p>All in all, this set offers a great chance to relive a classic Harry Potter moment, and bring your favorite characters home. It’s made for ages 8 and up, but you can also treat yourself to it (no judgements), or gift it to a Wizarding World fan in your life.</p>

              <p>Gamers, is there anything worse than having to delete a game just to make space for a new one? There isn’t and thankfully, you don’t have to deal with such problems. Game file sizes are growing, which calls for a storage solution that’s not just spacious, but also fast. The Seagate storage expansion card (1TB) offers all that and more, and you can now grab it without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3767/">It’s currently sitting at $130 on Amazon, which is 19% off its regular price</a>. We know it’s not a massive drop, but considering how it doesn’t go on sale that often, it’s definitely worth grabbing. The only catch is that the discount might not be around for long, so it’s best to grab it quick.</p>

<h2>Fast Load Times, No Annoying Lags</h2>
<p>This card is designed in partnership with Xbox, so you won’t run into any frustrating compatibility issues. It also uses the same Xbox Velocity Architecture, meaning every title runs exactly as it would from internal storage. Expect faster load times, smooth gameplay, and an overall immersive environment without any slowdowns. Whether you’re playing an Original Xbox game or experimenting with the latest Series X|S release, this card handles it all. Quick Resume support means you can switch between games from both the internal SSD or the expansion card in literal seconds, and pick right where you left off.</p>



<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3767/">This version gets you 1TB of storage, which is more than enough to house all your favorite titles and then some.</a> This capacity should be enough for most gamers out there, but if you need more, Seagate also offers 2TB and 4TB options. Of course, these are priced a bit higher but the good news is that both are discounted right now too, with the 2TB version at $220 and the 4TB at $430.</p>
<p>Setting things up and getting started is fairly simple. There are no complicated procedures to follow, and you should be ready to play in just a few minutes. Seagate also includes <strong>a 3-year limited warranty</strong> with your purchase, so you will have that extra peace of mind if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Altogether, if you are looking to bid annoying storage problems goodbye and play without feeling limited, this Seagate storage card can be a great investment. It’s built in partnership with Xbox, and offers plenty of space to store all your favorites. The deal might not be around for long, so grab it soon.</p>
