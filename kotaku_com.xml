              <p>Looter-shooter&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant</em> came under fire over the weekend for some TikTok ads featuring incredibly terrible AI fakes of real streamers endorsing the game. But as grimly bad as the ads might be, publisher Nexon’s excuses are somehow even worse.</p> <p><em>The First Descendant</em> is a free-to-play shooter that’s been around since June, 2024, entirely failing to set the world ablaze ever since. About as 6/10 as a game can be, it’s continued chugging along, mostly without much attention, that is until a bunch of TikTok ads appeared over the weekend that contained some excruciatingly obvious AI bullshit. Uncomfortable AI voices don’t quite match the clumsy lip-syncing of nearly human streamers, as they passionately endorse the middling looter-shooter with streams of superlatives. Worse, at least one of the videos contains the likeness of a real streamer, who clearly wasn’t choosing to endorse the game. Reddit user iHardlyTriHard compiled the ads into one video:</p>   <p>OK, so they’re laughably bad, while simultaneously chillingly close to good. It’s hard to watch these and not only think about where this tech will be in a couple of years, how all the obvious signs of fakery will likely be ironed out with the rapid improvements arriving from the competing tech companies. But given just how bad they are, the other question is: how? How on Earth did these come to be released as approved commercials for&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant</em>, and why did developer/publisher Nexon Games ever think they’d get away with it? It’s so much stupider than you could guess.</p>

 <p>“We would like to inform you of certain irregularities identified in the operation of our TikTok Creative Challenge for creators,” <a href="https://x.com/FirstDescendant/status/1957361838964006977">said Nexon on X</a> this morning, August 18. “<span data-offset-key="dpqhq-0-0">As a part of our marketing campaign for Season 3: Breakthrough, we recently ran a&nbsp;</span><a dir="ltr" role="link" href="https://ads.tiktok.com/business/creativecenter/quicktok/online/tiktok-creative-challenge-introduction/pc/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow"><span data-offset-key="dpqhq-1-0">Creative Challenge</span></a> <span data-offset-key="dpqhq-2-0">program for TikTok creators, which allows creators to voluntarily submit their content to be used as advertising materials.”</span></p> <p>It’s already amazing. The company ran a competition where the prize was you got to make a commercial for a game. That link, by the way, goes to a generic post about TikTok’s so-called “creative” challenge from 2023, seemingly nothing to do with this incident.</p> <div data-block="true" data-editor="6ksqo" data-offset-key="4pi6c-0-0"> <p><span data-offset-key="4pi6c-0-0">“All submitted videos are verified through TikTok’s system to check copyright violations before they are approved as advertising content,” the post continues, ensuring blame is already being distributed elsewhere. “</span>However, we have become aware of cases where the circumstances surrounding the production of certain submitted videos appear inappropriate. Thus, we are conducting a thorough joint investigation with TikTok to determine the facts.”</p> </div>  <p>The post concludes, “We sincerely apologize for the delay in providing this notice as the review is taking longer than expected. Once the verification is complete, we will promptly share an update through an official notice. Thank you for your patience and understanding.” These final remarks appear to be in reference to the game’s community accusing the official TikTok page for <em>TFD</em> of deleting and reuploading the AI ads once they received too much negative feedback, while surely aware of the issue.</p> <p>The statement, while obviously trying to lay some blame for the situation at TikTok’s feet by suggesting it was a failure of the app’s verification for “copyright violations” (a mystifying suggestion), doesn’t explain how such obviously AI-faked content was ever distributed as official advertising for the game. It seems to leave two possible scenarios:</p>

 <p>1) The AI ads were screened and approved by Nexon, and released as advertising materials, despite so obviously being fraudulent AI.</p> <p>2) Nexon didn’t screen the ads promoting its game at all before releasing them, leaving it all to TikTok.</p> <p>Neither is a good scenario for Nexon, at all.</p> <p>We’ve contacted the company to ask what happened, and why, and will update should we receive a response.</p>

              <p>Last week,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-1-5-changes-censorship-game-pass-steam-2000617865"><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> received a very controversial update</a> that made major changes to the Soulslike game, rendering multiple bosses impossible to kill, and formerly antagonistic characters into BFFs. The 1.5 update was seemingly a response to a negative reaction to the game’s reception in China, but this caused a whole other backlash in the rest of the world, seeing the game review-bombed on Steam. But over the weekend a fan-made mod has been released that will roll your Steam version of the game back to version 1.4.</p> <p>The whole situation of&nbsp;<em>Wuchang</em> is a peculiar one. Soulslikes are very big business in China, and games like&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> from Chinese developer Game Science celebrate Chinese mythology while gaining tacit approval from the Chinese state. However, <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, despite coming from Chinese developer Leenzee and clearly attempting a similar exploration of Chinese history, has fallen foul of public reception at home. The representation of various historical figures of the Ming dynasty, but not then including condemnation of the subsequent Qing dynasty, has been seen as inaccurate or disrespectful by some, and as such Leenzee updated the game to address these perceived issues, both changing how boss fights play out, and significantly affecting the later states of the game where far fewer characters will attack you. Thus, the enormous backlash. Well, the second backlash, after the game went through its first round of negative reviews <a href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feather-soulslike-pc-performance-patch-1851786948">due to performance issues on PC</a>.</p> <p>It’s very hard to appreciate the situation a Chinese developer will find itself, given the need for state approval to be able to sell a game, while their story stepped on controversial toes far less appreciable outside of the country. My understanding of the situation is rudimentary, but it appears analogous with the ongoing issues in the U.S. regarding how its history is represented, especially when it comes to race. With growing discontent surrounding the game in China, there would have been enormous pressure to make these changes, no matter how much the wider world might disapprove. It’s very much a rock and hard-place scenario for Leenzee.</p>

 <p>However, for those playing the game on Steam, there’s now a solution. The <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/wuchangfallenfeathers/mods/213?tab=description">“Rollback censorship patch” via&nbsp;<em>NexusMods</em></a><em>—</em>created by DarkmoonBlade<em>—</em>will undo the mandatory Steam update, taking <em>Wuchang</em> back to its 1.4 state, and as such no longer have many of the bosses become “exhausted” rather than dead. It’ll also restore the original story. You’ll also need to disable the auto-update feature for the game in Steam, or it’ll just reinstall itself immediately, and then run the game via the game’s .exe rather than through Steam.</p> <p>For all the response, there’s little evidence it’s changed anything with regards to the game’s popularity. The game’s Steam player numbers have maintained the same continuous descent they were already on before the patch, rather than showing any steep decline or widespread boycotting. While <em>Wuchang</em> peaked at a very impressive 131,000 simultaneous players in late July, that’s steadily dropped to the 16,000 or so who showed up over the weekend. Like so many Soulslikes, it seems to have had its moment, failing to cut deeper into the zeitgeist like the likes of <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>. (The August 2024 game broke records with its 2.4m players, but has settled to a steady 40,000 for months.)</p>
