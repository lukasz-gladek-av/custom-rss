One clip from it circulating around this week following Bollea’s death shows him trying to explain to a jury <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/davidbix.bsky.social/post/3lupztnlmlc2g&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidbix.bsky.social/post/3lupztnlmlc2g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">why Hulk Hogan had a 10-inch penis but Bollea himself did not</a></span>. There was the moment when the judge in the case allowed one of the jurors to ask the then-Editor-in-Chief of <em>Jezebel </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tampabay.com/news/courts/civil/ex-gawker-editor-hulk-hogan-had-limited-privacy-right-on-sex-tape/2269326/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/courts/civil/ex-gawker-editor-hulk-hogan-had-limited-privacy-right-on-sex-tape/2269326/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whether she had slept with<em> Gawker </em>owner Nick Denton</a></span> to get the job. It was unclear what bearing that would have had on the case. Also, Denton is gay. Every day in our political life is now this stupid, and with way more at stake for everyone involved.</p><p>Then there’s the bizarre trajectory the whole circus ultimately sent <em>Kotaku</em> itself on. It was sold at auction along with its non-Gawker sister sites to Univision, the Spanish-language broadcasting company that was then mounting a confused and ill-timed foray into digital media. Left mostly to its own devices, <em>Kotaku</em> briefly reached its highest headcount ever in 2018. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/univision-taps-vincent-sadusky-as-ceo-succeeding-randy-falco-1527026754&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/univision-taps-vincent-sadusky-as-ceo-succeeding-randy-falco-1527026754" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Thanks to the shifting whims of distant CEOs</a></span>, the relative honeymoon was short-lived.

The new company was called G/O Media, short for Gizmodo/The Onion. Spanfeller told us in his very first meeting that he came up with it on a napkin just before the deal was finalized.</p><p>That anecdote proved a harbinger for how carelessly the websites themselves would be treated (“<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/opinion/deadspin-sports.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/11/opinion/deadspin-sports.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stick to sports</a></span>”) over the subsequent years. I can tell you from experience that Spanfeller’s management style was an unusually disqualifying mix of ignorance, pettiness, bullying, gaslighting, and perversely ill-informed micro-management. I cannot, despite the dozens of hours I’ve wasted contemplating it, tell you what the logic behind any of it was.</p><p>What it achieved, however, was the slow, painstaking disfigurement of <em>Kotaku</em> amid an unceasing exodus of beloved colleagues, cuts to resources, and interference in its day-to-day operations (“<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-eic-resigns-over-new-editorial-edict" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stick to guides</a></span>”), which have served millions of readers year-in-and-year-out for over two decades now. Some find it is easy to blame COVID, unions, and the hollowing out of the internet by tech monopolies for all of these things. Funny how the ruler-of-your-own-destiny crowd turns to systemic explanations when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.megangreenwell.com/the-adults-in-the-room&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.megangreenwell.com/the-adults-in-the-room" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">their failures start piling up all around them</a></span>.</p><p>Who knows what exactly the future might have held if Bollea had lost the 2016 sex tape trial? But I would be willing to bet the house we would never have been sold to fucking Jim Spanfeller. Bollea’s death will mean <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/razzball.bsky.social/post/3lusblxfbss2b&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/razzball.bsky.social/post/3lusblxfbss2b" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">different things</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thenation.com/article/society/hulk-hogan-racist-liar-scab-obit/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/hulk-hogan-racist-liar-scab-obit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to different people</a></span>. To me, it will mark the end of one of the most idiotic storms <em>Kotaku</em> has ever weathered, which is saying something. July is also the month the site was sold to new owners Keleops, reuniting it with at least one of the other old Gawker sites, <em>Gizmodo</em>. I don’t like to piss on people’s graves, but I do like to toast the future, and <em>Kotaku</em>’s is finally one I’m looking forward to again. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hulk-hogan-sex-tape-gawker-lawsuit-kotaku-go-media-1851787000]]></content:encoded>
