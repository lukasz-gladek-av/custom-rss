But if there’s a second thing the series is known for, it’s the insane amount of challenges to overcome in order to achieve 100-percent completion. Musou fans have reported spending hundreds of hours on their favorite <em>Dynasty Warriors </em>games, and even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howlongtobeat.com/game/52431&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/52431" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Long To Beat</a></span> records the <em>Zelda </em>crossover <em>Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition </em>as needing 361 hours to fully complete. While I can’t yet confirm or deny whether <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> has <em>that </em>much content (I would <em>love </em>to have 300 spare hours to find out), I can say that Omega Force’s latest title almost certainly won’t leave you wanting for stuff to fight.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196884" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Rise Of The Ronin Hides A Cool Nioh Easter Egg" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="163" data-playlist="196884,196646,195207" data-current="196884"><div><p>Rise Of The Ronin Hides A Cool Nioh Easter Egg</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196884/196884_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196884/196884_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196884/196884_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196884/196884_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22438.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>My first playthrough took a little over 40 hours to complete. I played on the Hero (hard) difficulty and sought out every bond event and optional battle along the way, so theoretically you could reach the ending in less time than that. That’s already a sizable campaign, but there’s <em>a</em> <em>lot </em>to dig your teeth into after you see the credits roll too. If you’d like to know what awaits you in the postgame and beyond, here’re all the juicy details you have to look forward to.</p><p><strong>The information below will avoid specific story spoilers, but if you want to be completely surprised by <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>, only check the sections that you’re comfortable reading for yourself.</strong></p><h2 id="h38198"><a id="chapters"></a>How many chapters are in <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>?</h2><figure id="" data-id="da4266da4dddb790ea36a3f4970e5df5" data-recommend-id="image://da4266da4dddb790ea36a3f4970e5df5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

There’s technically a short prologue chapter too, but it’s only a single tutorial battle to get your feet wet with the combat. Every chapter is roughly equal in terms of length, though you may wind up spending the most time in Chapter Three for reasons I’ll explain below.</p><h2 id="h38199"><a id="story"></a><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>has three branching story paths</h2><figure id="" data-id="dba3025d082e764f69c5152f6415da67" data-recommend-id="image://dba3025d082e764f69c5152f6415da67" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

This is standard <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms </em>stuff, so that part shouldn’t come as a huge surprise. From here, you can engage with the three factions on a freelance basis like you’re someone who writes online professionally. But unlike someone who writes online professionally, one of your employers will eventually want to hire you full time. This will lock you into a unique story path for the remainder of Chapter Three, and that will persist into chapters four and five.</p><p>Several unique stages are locked behind each branching story path. Following my first playthrough, my stats indicated that I had only completed 50% of the missions in the game. In other words, there’s a healthy amount of replay value here, which brings me to my final point.</p><figure id="" data-id="eb712e464c098f6ece23c8813466b9a3" data-recommend-id="image://eb712e464c098f6ece23c8813466b9a3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

The main character is holding what appears to be a polearm as rain falls upon him.</p><h2 id="h38200"><a id="postgame"></a> What’s the postgame like in <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>?</h2><p>True to series tradition, there’s a lot of game to play after you reach the first ending. You’ll surely want to see how those other story paths play out, and <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>gives you great tools to do just that. Here’s everything you’ll unlock once you start your postgame file.</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>You’ll gain the ability to freely replay any battle in the game, including optional missions you might have seen and initially missed. Additionally, you can restart the game from the beginning of any chapter <em>and </em>before any battle that leads to a new story branch depending on how you complete it. Yes, there are branching paths in the branching paths!</li><li>Your level cap will get a permanent increase, adding extra levels to each weapon for you to gain.</li><li>An extra weapon type can be found in the postgame as well, which is so insanely strong that it’s worth the insane amount of cash it costs in the shop. I won’t reveal <em>exactly </em>what it is, but it’s a very fun piece of fan service.</li><li>On top of the new weapon type, a stronger grade of weapons enters the pool too. You can purchase these outright, or you can find them in basic story missions. </li><li>Also, you can upgrade your weapons! This should be familiar to <em>Warriors </em>fans, but you can use spare weapons to both pass on useful traits or bestow raw power upgrades to your favorite armament. This does cost money though, so make sure you don’t blow through your reserves right off the bat.</li><li>Finally, an all new difficulty level is unlocked in the postgame. This changes fundamental rules of the game to skew things in your foes’ favor, but your rewards after each battle will dramatically increase. Also, you’ll find new optional challenges in several battles on this difficulty that will grant powerful new equipment and items upon completion. Do note that this difficulty is <em>really </em>intended for high level players, to the point that you’ll be dramatically underleveled for it even after a full playthrough. You’ll likely need to level up by playing through the other story paths before you challenge the game on this difficulty.  </li></ol><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>could very well require a triple digit number of hours before you accomplish everything it has to offer. Do keep in mind that <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> games have a reputation for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dynasty-warriors-9-empires-coming-early-next-year-1845194597&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dynasty-warriors-9-empires-coming-early-next-year-1845194597">re-releases</a></span> and/or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1684147/DYNASTY_WARRIORS_9_Empires__Season_Pass/?curator_clanid=41525982&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1684147/DYNASTY_WARRIORS_9_Empires__Season_Pass/?curator_clanid=41525982" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DLC</a></span>, so take that into consideration in case that affects your decision to purchase this one. But that aside, if we’re judging solely on how long a game can divert your attention away from doing your dishes, <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> is a solid package as-is.<br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Then, in December 2023,<em> Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom</em> landed in theaters as the last movie officially released as part of the Zack Snyder era of DC.

As such, here are some tips for the opening hours of <em>Ender Magnolia</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196411" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="378" data-playlist="196411,196766,196452" data-current="196411"><div><p>A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21958.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h191584"><a id="boxes"></a>Break glowing boxes for materials</h2><figure id="" data-id="9ed4d3774ab9ff5cadbd15ee817f5a4c" data-recommend-id="image://9ed4d3774ab9ff5cadbd15ee817f5a4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist stands in front of a glowing box." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist stands in front of a glowing box." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Adglobe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9ed4d3774ab9ff5cadbd15ee817f5a4c" data-recommend-id="image://9ed4d3774ab9ff5cadbd15ee817f5a4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1081" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist stands in front of a glowing box." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Materials, <em>Ender Magnolia</em>’s primary currency, will let you buy items at the Craftery, which is accessible fairly early in your adventure. A tooltip will eventually let you know that you can break boxes around the map to earn additional Materials, but by the time it gives you this information, you may have already passed up a handful of them. </p><p>So, hey, I just figured I’d let you know to <strong>keep an eye out for boxes with a glow around them</strong> because I’m a nice guy who wants you to be able to afford to buy the first Magic Vial from the Craftery, which will net you an extra Relic slot. You’re welcome. No, really, don’t sweat it.</p><h2 id="h191585"><a id="yolvan"></a>Put Yolvan to good use</h2><figure id="" data-id="fd2e211b684edf2259ade60666005773" data-recommend-id="image://fd2e211b684edf2259ade60666005773" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A homunculi fires a projectile at an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A homunculi fires a projectile at an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Adglobe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd2e211b684edf2259ade60666005773" data-recommend-id="image://fd2e211b684edf2259ade60666005773" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A homunculi fires a projectile at an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>During the game’s opening hour or so, you’ll fight Yolvan and earn him as a Homunculi that you can equip. Since he fires projectiles, <strong>assign Yolvan to your shoulder button attack slot so that you can hold his attack down</strong> while you use melee attacks, too. This can massively improve the speed at which you deplete the Break Gauge of basic enemies, allowing you to pummel them into submission.</p><p>When the Craftery begins selling Mixed Parts (pretty early on), make sure to buy some and use them to <strong>purchase Yolvan’s Eviscerate ability</strong> to make him even more of a force to be reckoned with. Holding down the button for this ability will unleash a tornado attack that stuns several enemies at once while dishing out surprisingly good damage in the process. Since it can hit multiple enemies at once, it’s a pretty great upgrade over his basic attack in most scenarios.</p><h2 id="h191586"><a id="muninn"></a>Always keep Muninn out</h2><figure id="" data-id="348a9af92abbaf67eaa8aa59458e813f" data-recommend-id="image://348a9af92abbaf67eaa8aa59458e813f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A flying homunculi accompanies the protagonist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A flying homunculi accompanies the protagonist." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Adglobe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="348a9af92abbaf67eaa8aa59458e813f" data-recommend-id="image://348a9af92abbaf67eaa8aa59458e813f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A flying homunculi accompanies the protagonist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll get Muninn when exploring the Magicite Mine. This Homunculi can be equipped and summoned to accompany you passively. Unlike most Homunculi, this means you don’t have to press any buttons to make Muninn attack. Instead, it will fly around behind you and occasionally auto-attack foes.</p><p>While this Homunculi doesn’t deal significant damage, it does help to chip away at the Break Gauge of your enemies without you having to micromanage any cooldowns or remember to press any buttons. </p><p>And, of course, if you’d like Muninn to bug off, just hit the assigned button again to send it packing. But, like, why would you not want the help? Are you too good for a friendly owl pal? Don’t be like that.</p><h2 id="h191587"><a id="helix"></a>Don’t miss the Helix Crystal Relic</h2><figure id="" data-id="132302d0e3fdcba175087133be7055fb" data-recommend-id="image://132302d0e3fdcba175087133be7055fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the location of a relic." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the location of a relic." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Adglobe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="132302d0e3fdcba175087133be7055fb" data-recommend-id="image://132302d0e3fdcba175087133be7055fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the location of a relic." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll start the game with only a handful of replenishable healing wards, so a bit of passive healing sure would be nice, right? Luckily, you can grab the Helix Crystal early in the game, which will heal you for 3% of your total health every time you defeat an enemy. It may not sound like much, but there are a lot of enemies that are fairly easy to defeat along your path, so it certainly adds up. </p><p>When you’re ready to get it, play until you get the Lower Stratum Key a few hours in, then fast-travel back to the Abandoned Attuner Tent. Head left from the Abandoned Attuner Tent, and open the door to access the Magicite Mine. Inside, head down the slope and all the way to the left until you encounter a rather large foe. Defeat him and grab the Helix Crystal.</p><h2 id="h191588"><a id="difficulty"></a>Lower the difficulty if you’re struggling to git gud</h2><figure id="" data-id="806a571fa9f69ca79cafa616dc7c06cd" data-recommend-id="image://806a571fa9f69ca79cafa616dc7c06cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows difficulty options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows difficulty options." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Adglobe / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="806a571fa9f69ca79cafa616dc7c06cd" data-recommend-id="image://806a571fa9f69ca79cafa616dc7c06cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows difficulty options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While <em>Ender Magnolia</em> is designed to challenge you, it’s perfectly fine if you decide you’d like to reduce the degree to which it does so. Luckily, <strong>you can adjust the difficulty when resting at a Respite</strong>. You can opt to select from multiple presets, or you can manually adjust various aspects of enemy difficulty, such as health, attack frequency, and more. Do what feels right to you. I’m not here to judge.</p><hr><p><em>Ender Magnolia: Bloom in the Mist</em> is available now for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Having been bested by Sonic and friends twice in the previous films, the Egghead was going to have pivoted to talking to his adoring fans and promoting energy drinks that were probably not good for you.</p><p>There are two scenes that would have had Eggman interrupting the plot to stream to his followers. They contain some funny gags, such as Agent Stone enthusiastically spamming heart emojis on his boss’ stream because <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-movies-eggman-robotnik-agent-stone-stobotnik-gay-1851738189&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-movies-eggman-robotnik-agent-stone-stobotnik-gay-1851738189">he’s clearly in love with him</a></span>, but still, it’s easy to see why these scenes were cut. In the context of the already busy movie, they likely would have just interrupted the flow and momentum of the action, and frankly, there’s already plenty of Carrey’s antics to go around (maybe too much). But seeing them now does contextualize one line that still made it into the final movie during Carrey’s final monologue.</p><p>At the end of the film, Eggman sacrifices himself to save Earth as he helps Shadow move the self-destructing Eclipse Cannon out of the planet’s orbit. But before he does, the doctor streams a goodbye message to Agent Stone after carelessly tossing him aside earlier in the movie. When he does so, he opens the stream with “This is Dr. Ivo Robotnik dedicating my final live stream to one very special henchman: Agent Stone.”</p><p>The use of the word “final” implies that there were others which, in the finished film, seems a little odd because we hadn’t seen Eggman streaming prior to this moment. While it makes sense that these scenes were deleted, the real shame is that we didn’t get to see Agent Stone yearning and nursing Eggman back to health after the end of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em>. Stobotnik shippers are not taking it well, but at least we’re seeing it now thanks to the digital release.</p><p>These scenes are fun to see, but the most interesting behind-the-scenes content coming out of Paramount right now are the new pieces of concept art which may have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-sonic-3-concept-art-may-clear-up-that-confusing-pos-1851743775&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-sonic-3-concept-art-may-clear-up-that-confusing-pos-1851743775">answered some of the lingering questions from <em>Sonic 3</em>’s post-credits scene</a></span>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
