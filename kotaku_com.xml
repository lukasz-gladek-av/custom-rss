              <p>On Friday, the Supreme Court of the United States of America ruled against the majority of President Donald Trump’s tariffs, including those enacted using a decades-old law reserved for a national emergency. These 2025 tariffs led to a last-minute Switch 2 pre-order delay as well as increased video game console and accessory prices. It’s a major setback for the president, and it could help alleviate rising gaming costs, but it also might all be for nothing as Trump will likely move to reactivate the tariffs using different legal methods.</p> <p>In 2025, President Trump used the <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-declares-national-emergency-to-increase-our-competitive-edge-protect-our-sovereignty-and-strengthen-our-national-and-economic-security/">1977 International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA</a>) to enact tariffs against a large list of countries. No previous president had ever used the law to impose tariffs against other nations. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/supreme-court/supreme-court-strikes-trumps-tariffs-major-blow-president-rcna244827">The court was split 6-3 in its decision</a> to rule that Trump’s unprecedented use of the IEEPA was illegal, with Chief Justice John Roberts writing the majority opinion.</p>

 <p>“The president asserts the extraordinary power to unilaterally impose tariffs of unlimited amount, duration and scope,” wrote Roberts. But the Chief wrote that Congress has never said the language in the IEEPA applied to tariffs, adding: “We hold that IEEPA does not authorize the president to impose tariffs.” Roberts was joined by the three liberal justices as well as two conservatives, Neil Gorsuch and Amy Coney Barrett. It should be noted that not all of Trump’s tariffs are now gone, as not all of them were enacted using the IEEPA, but many of his so-called reciprocal taxes have now been ruled illegal.</p> <p>Last year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/president-trump-tariffs-switch-2-pre-orders-delay-us-1851774828">Trump’s reciprocal tariffs</a> and his <a href="https://kotaku.com/tariffs-trump-games-digital-consoles-price-increase-ps5-1851767919?">trade war against countries like China and Canada</a> directly led to <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorder-price-tariff-trump-nintendo-1851774764">Nintendo delaying pre-orders for the Switch 2 in April.&nbsp;</a></p>

 <p>“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start on April 9, 2025, in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged,” said the company.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-prices-pro-controllers-tariffs-amiibo-2000614471">In August</a>, the company quietly raised the prices on many Switch accessories and on various models of the original console. Other companies like Sony and Microsoft followed suit with <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881">similar price increases on hardware and accessories</a> as a result of tariffs against countries that produce many of the parts needed to manufacture gaming hardware.</p> <p>In a better, less horrible timeline, most of Trump’s trade war tariffs being deemed illegal would lead to video game hardware prices going down. But we don’t live in that timeline. President Trump has many different legal avenues for reinstating many of the now-illegal tariffs, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brianplatt.bsky.social/post/3mfcfvbtvds2m">as helpfully pointed out by <em>Bloomberg</em> in this chart.</a></p>

 <p>Even if all of these legal backup plans fail and he’s unable to get all or most of his precious tariffs made legal again, console and gaming PC prices are likely to keep going up and up and up due to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/ram">ongoing memory shortage</a> caused by AI hyperscalers racing to build massive datacenters. But at least you can take comfort in knowing that Trump is having a bad day today. That’s something, right?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Yesterday, the news broke that Bluepoint Games, the first-party PlayStation studio responsible for celebrated remakes of </span><i><span>Shadow of the Colossus</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Demon’s Souls</span></i><span>, has been shut down. According to a Sony spokesperson, the decision to shutter the developer was made “following a recent business review.” It’s terrible news however you look at it, but it’s perhaps especially painful for </span><i><span>Bloodborne </span></i><span>fans, as Bluepoint Games were the fan-favorite front-runners to helm a potential remake of FromSoftware’s 2015 PlayStation 4 game.</span></p> <p><span>The bad news doesn’t stop there, however, as Maxime Foulquier, a solo developer from France, followed up the announcement of Bluepoint Games’ closure with an unfortunately timed announcement of his own. As spotted by </span><a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Sony-shut-down-Bloodborne-remake-fan-project-before-scrutinized-Bluepoint-Games-closure.1230824.0.html"><i><span>Notebook Check</span></i></a><span>, Sony served Foulquier with a </span><a href="https://x.com/MaximFoulquier/status/2024582839295950868"><span>cease and desist letter</span></a><span> in March 2025, due to his announcement on X some months prior that he was working on a game called </span><i><span>Bloodborne Top Down Arena.</span></i><span> Several clips of the game, which was actually Foulquier’s second </span><i><span>Bloodborne </span></i><span>remake project, can still be found in separate posts on his X profile, but the video featured in </span><a href="https://x.com/MaximFoulquier/status/1629098568928600066"><span>the original announcement post</span></a><span> has since been removed “in response to a report by the copyright owner.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Although the letter is almost a year old at this point, Foulquier noted that he’s only revealing this information now due to his “immense” disappointment with Sony following their decision to shut down Bluepoint Games. “I’d rather speak about it now, as my disappointment is immense. The disappearance of Bluepoint is a tremendous loss for the industry and for the dream of a </span><i><span>Bloodborne </span></i><span>remake. Why are you making such absurd decisions, Sony?”</span></p> <p><span>Not all is lost, thankfully, as Foulquier noted that he started to “repurpose all the assets” from </span><i><span>Bloodborne Top Down Arena</span></i><span> into a currently untitled, legally distinct project of his own. He also </span><a href="https://x.com/MaximFoulquier/status/2024850777861136694?s=20"><span>shared a snippet</span></a><span> of the newly repurposed project in a follow-up post, referring to it as “a tribute to </span><i><span>Bloodborne</span></i><span>, set in a medical gothic world inspired by Paris.”</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Square Enix Teases What Fans Pray Is A New Nier Automata Game]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-3-sequel-square-enix-yoko-taro-2000671960</link>
            <guid>1441714</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been nine years since <a href="https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-the-kotaku-review-1793002839"><em>Nier: Automata</em></a> first graced the PlayStation 4 and broke through to players beyond director Yoko Taro’s usual esoteric action-RPG fandom. But there hasn’t been a new game since. Fans are desperate for that to chance. Square Enix just gave them fresh hope.</p> <p>“<em>Nier: Automata</em> to be continued.” That’s how a celebratory trailer during an anniversary livestream on Friday ended. It could mean a lot of things. Fans hope it means <em>Nier: Automata 2</em>, or a fresh RPG within the <em>Nier</em> lineage that goes wherever Taro wants to take it.</p>

 <p>The action-RPG stars an android named 2B in a post-apocalyptic world where human-made robots are at war with invading alien machines. Developed by PlatinumGames, the combat sings and thanks to Taro’s baroque storytelling process, the game must be played and <a href="https://kotaku.com/every-time-nier-automata-ends-it-gets-better-1793524744">finished multiple times</a> to reveal its true secrets.</p>  <p>Set in the same world as <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-nier-replicant-remaster-does-many-good-things-and-o-1846743596">2010’s <em>Nier</em></a>, it succeeded way beyond the cult-classic legacy of the original. A PS4 exclusive when it first launched, Nier: Automata was also a surprising bright spot in a mixed portfolio at Square Enix. The company announced the game surpassed 10 million sales in this week’s anniversary stream. The obvious questions is why <em>wouldn’t</em> the<em> Final Fantasy</em> maker greenlight a sequel?</p>

 <p>2B has been in plenty of other games as a guest character (or costume), and a mobile spin-off <a href="https://kotaku.com/nier-reincarnation-shut-down-1851206958"><em>Nier Reincarnation</em></a> launched in 2021. But there’s never been a proper console sequel. If Square’s latest tease is actually for another mobile game, manga spin-off, or some other sort of transmedia adaptation, fans will riot.</p>

 <h2>What has Yoko Taro been up to?</h2> <p>For all of the love around his games, Taro hasn’t been shy about his struggles to get a new project off the ground. “I often get told stuff like ‘Why aren’t you making a new sequel to&nbsp;<em>NieR</em>?’ or ‘Yoko Taro isn’t doing anything,’ but that’s because recently, a lot of projects I was involved in got discontinued midway through development,” he said <a href="https://kotaku.com/please-stop-cancelling-yoko-taros-games-2000644949">back in 2025</a>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">９周年記念放送おわりました！ご視聴ご来場頂いた皆様、アリガトウゴザイマシタ！！ <a href="https://t.co/BCNwYjqcIz">https://t.co/BCNwYjqcIz</a> <a href="https://t.co/rdG1KkYeYN">pic.twitter.com/rdG1KkYeYN</a></p> <p>— yokotaro (@yokotaro) <a href="https://twitter.com/yokotaro/status/2024842023375929506?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“I’ve actually been working on some stuff, it’s just that it never ended up seeing the light of day,” he continued. “I got paid for it, so I personally have no issues with that, but people seem to think that I haven’t been doing anything just because none of the work I’ve done is being released.”</p>

 <p>It’s hard to believe that the guy who only ever appears in public wearing a mask of one of the characters from the first <em>Nier</em> wouldn’t want to keep working on the franchise. He appeared in the this week’s anniversary stream and tweeted about the new sales milestone but hasn’t let any cryptic hints slip about the franchise’s future. Yet.</p> <p>But if we somehow never got a new Nier: Automata game, well, that would be sort of fitting as well. “Life is unfair,” he told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-unfair-a-q-a-with-nier-automatas-director-1795653562">back in 2017</a>.</p>
