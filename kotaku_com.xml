              <p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-september-release-date-trailer-2000619152">will arrive seven years after the first game</a>. Why? That’s what fans have been impatiently wondering for a while now. According to the developers at Team Cherry, there was no major drama or development snafus. Seven years is just how long it takes to make the Metroidvania Soulslike sequel to what some fans regard as one of the best games of the last decade.</p> <p>“I remember at some point I just had to stop sketching,” cofounder Ari Gibson <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-21/why-silksong-team-cherry-s-sequel-to-hollow-knight-took-so-long-to-make?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NTc4NjYzOSwiZXhwIjoxNzU2MzkxNDM5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMUNMTUpHUFdDUFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.oTN8q1m9pNWFv7oW-n3vzq-hRWAxrDx9B7iF80RdTzk&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">told <em>Bloomberg</em> in a new interview</a>. “Because I went, ‘Everything I’m drawing here has to end up in the game. That’s a cool idea, that’s in. That’s a cool idea, that’s in.’ You realize, ‘If I don’t stop drawing, this is going to take 15 years to finish.’”</p> <p>What began as DLC for 2017’s surprise Steam hit <em>Hollow Knight</em> eventually morphed into a full-fledged standalone game. Team Cherry officially revealed <em>Silksong</em> would become a sequel in 2019. The developers told <em>Bloomberg</em> they wanted to keep their team size small so as not to disrupt the creative flow responsible for the first game. But growing scope—bigger boss fights, multiple towns, a denser world—meant it would take even longer to finish, especially if it would exude the same level of tight controls, visual polish, and world-building mystery of the original <em>Hollow Knight</em>.</p>

 <p>When Microsoft doubled down in 2022 on the promise that <em>Silksong</em> would arrive within the year, that was apparently the actual goal. “We did genuinely believe that was the case,” cofounder William Pellen confirmed. “There was a period of two to three years when I thought it was going to come out within a year.” The team just kept biting off more than it could chew while also calmly ignoring all of the online chatter about unhinged fans.</p> <p>“I think we’re always underestimating the amount of time and effort it’ll take us to achieve things,” Gibson told <em>Bloomberg</em>. “It’s also that problem where, because we’re having fun doing it, it’s not like, ‘It’s taking longer, this is awful, we really need to get past this phase.’ It’s, ‘This is a very enjoyable space to be in. Let’s perpetuate this with some new ideas.’”</p> <p>It seems to have helped that the original <em>Hollow Knight</em> has now sold 15 million copies, Team Cherry revealed. <em>Silksong</em> is already Steam’s most-wishlisted game. If it lives up to even a fraction of the hype, the team won’t be forced to release their next game any time soon, either.</p>

              <p>Welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of video game news and other stuff you might care about. Today we have information about the future of <em>Forza</em>, news about Sony and EVO, and some fresh details about that new Lego Batman game. Also: get excited about The Gorillaz coming to <em>Fortnite</em>.</p> <h2>The Gorillaz are coming to <em>Fortnite</em></h2> <p>New leaks seem to indicate that the famous animated band The Gorillaz will be the next <em>Fortnite Festival</em> headlining act. This means the characters from the band will appear in-game as skins and some of their music will be added to <em>Festival</em>, too. The last few artists haven’t been very exciting, but bringing in the Gorillaz has my attention. Expect Epic to start teasing this next week or sooner, and then for the Gorillaz to arrive on August 26 when the current Bruno Mars season wraps up.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">GORILLAZ x FORTNITE INFO — AUGUST 26</p> <p>• 2D &amp; Noodle are most likely Item Shop<br>• Murdoc &amp; Russel are Festival Pass (Official Look) <a href="https://t.co/SnbqIstFTZ">pic.twitter.com/SnbqIstFTZ</a></p> <p>— HYPEX (@HYPEX) <a href="https://twitter.com/HYPEX/status/1958249205195251776?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>The next <em>Forza Horizon</em> game is likely set in Japan</h2> <p>There’s been a lot of rumors that the next <em>Forza Horizon</em> open-world racing game would be set in Japan and well, here’s some evidence that the speculation is probably correct. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-location-leaked-by-car-import-company-fans-believe">As reported by <em>IGN</em></a>, in a now-deleted social media post, a car importing company shared an image that claimed someone working on <em>Forza</em> came by to take scans and photos of a car made by Japanese manufacturer Kei. The post claimed this would be used in the next <em>Forza Horizon</em> game. Oops! But hey, a new <em>Forza Horizon</em> set in Japan sounds great.</p>

 <h2><em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em> is making the leap to Xbox</h2> <p>During Xbox’s Gamescom stream, it was announced that <em>Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</em> is coming to Xbox Series X|S and Game Pass on September 17. I’m a big fan of this <em>Vampire Survivors</em>-like shoot ’em up and play it all the time on my Steam Deck, so I’m excited to play it on my Xbox and earn some achievements.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor releases Sept 17th on Xbox and coming to Game Pass <a href="https://t.co/ZQgVQeK8Is">pic.twitter.com/ZQgVQeK8Is</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1958524899758113136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>That new <em>Lego Batman</em> game will have Riddler trophies to find</h2> <p>That newly announced <em>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em> game looks to be the <em>Arkham</em> sequel fans have wanted for years now. And adding to that feeling is the confirmation from folks who have played the game at Gamescom that there will be <a href="https://youtu.be/sbOodsqBSmk?t=472">Riddler trophies and puzzles spread around the game’s open world</a> waiting for players to find and collect them all. Good luck with that.</p> <h2>Analogue delays its fancy N64 console…again</h2> <p>Analogue’s fancy, 4K Nintendo 64 console has been delayed again. <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/analogue-delays-its-n64-remake-console-yet-again-205343467.html">On August 20, the company announced</a> that the highly anticipated retro games machine had been delayed again until Q4 2025. The $250 Analogue 3D was previously delayed in March and July. Hopefully, this new delay is the last one, and we’ll get our hands on this cool-looking console later this year.</p> <h2>Sony is selling its stake in the fighting game event EVO</h2> <p>Around four years ago, Sony spent a lot of money to buy up popular fighting game tournament EVO. It was weird! And in the years since, it’s remained a weird thing. And now, that era is ending as <a href="https://www.shacknews.com/article/145596/sony-sells-evo-co-ownership-nodwin-gaming?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter">Sony announced on August 21</a> that it was selling its ownership stake to co-owner NODWIN Gaming. Sony will remain a sponsor of future EVO events.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-switch-2-framerate-footage-video-gamescom-2000618923"><em>Elden Ring</em> is struggling to run on the Switch 2</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-the-game-announced-will-feature-multiplayer-and-solo-story-mode-2000618930">Michael Myers is back in a newly announced <em>Halloween</em> game</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-layoffs-2k-games-delay-2000618914"><em>Bioshock 4</em> studio gutted by recent layoffs</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Militsioner - Official Public Playtest Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c18RAdJs5Iw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

              <p>Every version of the PlayStation 5 <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873">is now $50 more expensive</a> in the U.S., but at least for now, a new deal at GameStop will cover the difference. The meme stock retailer announced it will start giving anyone who trades in their last-gen consoles an extra $50 in-store credit toward the purchase of a new PS5.</p> <p>This deal applies to anyone trading in an old PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, or Nintendo Switch. If you really want a PS5, it’s better than nothing. The all-digital edition, the cheapest Sony offers, is now $500 starting August 21. So instead of just getting $55 toward that from trading in a PS4, you’ll get $110. An Xbox One currently trades for about $45, so just $95 total. The Switch isn’t much better. You’ll only get $60 for it before the new bonus credit, even though Nintendo recently raised the price of a new one to $340.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">“Offer valid through 8.23.25” is in such small print at the bottom lol</p> <p>GameStop only has your back for a few days 💀</p> <p>— Carlton (@carlton_ec08) <a href="https://twitter.com/carlton_ec08/status/1958345035302240471?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Xbox Series X/S owners looking to move over to PlayStation will have it a little easier. A Series S, now sold new at $370, will still get you up to $176, while a Series X, sold for $600, will get you up to $300. I could see taking that. When it comes to the other consoles, the price difference is harder to swallow. GameStop also buries in the fine print that this <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881">bonus Trump tariff credit</a> will only be active through August 23.</p> <p>Is it better than nothing? Sure! But it still lowkey sucks in the worst way. This whole thing is basically GameStop saying, “Reckless trade policy has hiked the price of a PS5, so here’s a bonus credit for these already terrible trade-in values that you’ll have to give right back to us.” GameStop’s edgelord CEO Ryan Cohen, despite being Canadian, has been <a href="https://twitter.com/MattBinder/status/1908538518919323827">a big booster</a> of Trump, even as the president rolled out the current tariff regime earlier this year. His Elon Musk-lite impression included using the sale of GameStop’s Canadian operation <a href="https://fortune.com/2025/02/19/gamestop-selling-canadian-french-operations-stores-ryan-cohen-wokeness-dei/">to dunk on DEI policies</a>. He’s currently <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-bitcoin-half-a-billion-500-million-meme-stock-1851782733">using GameStop to buy billions in Bitcoin</a>.</p>
