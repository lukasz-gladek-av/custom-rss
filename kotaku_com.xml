But he has life goals that supersede fighting CGI aliens. “When I have kids, you will not see me in movies anymore,” he says. “Golf and dad.

That could make 2026 as good a time as any for a swan song. </p><p>Time has also begun showing its effects on the actor, who <em>Spider-Man </em>director Jon Watts says once did a full standing backflip in his audition for the superhero role that changed his life. Holland says he successfully did the same backflip recently, but this time he pulled every muscle in his stomach and “could not laugh because my stomach was so sore” for weeks. That sort of pain is enough to make anyone rethink their career. </p><p>As one of the most important superhero actors of a generation nears the age of 30, it might be a good time to binge your favorite Holland films before there’s no more to go around. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Given an audience willing to fork out eye-watering amounts for its laptops and phones, it’s perhaps not surprising that the company assumed it could do the same in the cursed world of VR with the $3,500 Vision Pro mixed-reality goggles. Except, according to sourced reports, it couldn’t. The Vision Pro is said to no longer be in production.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196012" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku Goes Hands-On At The Apple Developer Showcase" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="86" data-playlist="196012,195371,197298" data-current="196012"><div><p>Kotaku Goes Hands-On At The Apple Developer Showcase</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196012/196012_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196012/196012_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196012/196012_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196012/196012_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21534.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>This is all based on a report from October 2024 on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-sharply-scales-back-production-of-vision-pro&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-sharply-scales-back-production-of-vision-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Information</em></a></span><em> </em>(a site that, appositely, charges $300 to $1,000 a year to read its articles) which claimed, based on multiple sources, that Apple would be winding down production on the Vision Pro as the year ended, given the backlog of unsold devices. There was also rumor of a cheaper model going into production instead of a previously planned second version of the Pro, potentially for an end-of-year 2025 release.</p><p>The Vision Pro’s failure to set the world aflame is perhaps somewhat predictable. Not only does absolutely no one actually want mixed-reality headsets for their work life, but they especially don’t want to pay the price of a second-hand car for the honor. At $3.5k, you’d have to hope the Vision Pro came with a suite of absolutely essential apps and uses, and, er, it didn’t do that either.</p><p>Back in October, <em>The Information</em> said its sources at component manufacturers told the site they’d supplied enough parts for over half a million headsets, with “tens of thousands of undelivered parts” filling the suppliers’ warehouses. It was claimed at the time that Apple had sold 370,000 Vision Pros—a figure that seems enormously optimistic, but one that allegedly represents only two-thirds of the stock that had been made. Compare that to the millions of units Meta has shifted of its Meta Quest VR headsets, at a seventh of the price of Apple’s tech.</p><p>If all this proves to be accurate, that means that as of now Apple is no longer making new Vision Pros, because just not enough people saw a reason to pay such a whacking fee for such an entirely superfluous piece of tech. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/31/vision-pro-may-be-out-of-production/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/31/vision-pro-may-be-out-of-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>MacRumors</em> points out</a></span>, Apple had reportedly originally asked its Chinese manufacturer to expect to make eight million Vision Pros, meaning it’s likely sold a twentieth of its initial expectations. The reports claim Apple has told the manufacturer to expect to make half that many for its next, cheaper version of the AR headset which, while suggesting a massive drop in expectation even at a cheaper price, still seems ludicrously unlikely.</p><p>Meta’s relative success with the Quest VR headsets in 2024 is likely due to its finding that sweet price point of $300 to $500, where people are more willing to take a gamble on a piece of unproven tech. Arguably, Apple could still find its niche in this space, if it can get things down to $1,000 and capture the business market that feels obliged to jump on gimmicks, leading to overworked people in hot suits being forced to look at virtual Power Point demonstrations until they quit their jobs and take up macrame.</p><p>We’ve contacted Apple for a comment.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is a creation by Doctor Gerald Robotnik, who went on to create Shadow as the “true” product of his research into creating an immortal being. Since Gerald doesn’t create Shadow in the movies, as he’s an alien from another planet like all the anthropomorphic animals are, there was no need to include the Biolizard in <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3</em>. However, it turns out the movie does feature a brief reference to the creature during Shadow’s flashbacks. 50 years prior to the events of the movie, Shadow lived in a government facility with Maria Robotnik, Gerald’s granddaughter. The two became close like siblings, and are shown playing together while scientists attempt to perform experiments on the speedy hedgehog. One of these moments sees the pair watching a kaiju movie that, at a glance, appears to be an homage to early <em>Godzilla </em>films. But upon further inspection, it’s also a clever reference to the Biolizard. The giant reptile shown terrorizing civilians in the movie bears a striking resemblance to the character, from its slender mechanical eyes to the cables that extend from its jaws down its body. The movie the two watch is in black-and-white, but I imagine if it had been in color more people would have immediately caught onto this reference seeing its orange-brown skin.</p><p>On one hand, it is cool to see the movie pay homage to an important figure in Shadow’s game story, but given the way the live-action <em>Sonic </em>universe has previously treated one of the big monster-like enemies of the games as a comic relief prop, some fans aren’t thrilled with how <em>Sonic 3</em> references the Biolizard, fearing that it’s becoming a pattern for these movies. Iblis, a fiery monster from <em>Sonic ‘06</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/knuckles-paramount-sonic-06-iblis-flames-of-disaster-1851427520&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/knuckles-paramount-sonic-06-iblis-flames-of-disaster-1851427520">is referenced in the <em>Knuckles</em> Paramount+ show</a></span> as a stage puppet in a rock opera episode. So now, having a second of the games’ big kaiju-esque monsters turned into something else has made some fans a bit wary, as they wonder if Sonic and friends will ever face something on that scale in the live-action movies.</p><p>That being said, some fans are fine with the Biolizard’s omission, saying its presence could have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/redelecbeanz/status/1874178115146309798&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/redelecbeanz/status/1874178115146309798" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complicated the story</a></span>, which then might not have translated to the screen as gracefully <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SabdierZ/status/1874316026734862546&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SabdierZ/status/1874316026734862546" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as the more focused tale did</a></span>.

If not, there’s always Perfect Chaos, the final boss from <em>Sonic Adventure</em>, a water-based monster that floods entire cities. These movies have been playing fast and loose with the timeline, so there’s no harm in going back to a game before <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
