              <p>It’s&nbsp;<span>highly unlikely that we’ll see <a href="https://kotaku.com/portal-valve-erik-wolpaw-half-life-alyx-steam-counter-s-1848807049">a new&nbsp;<em>Portal</em> game</a> anytime soon from series creators </span>Valve. But now you can create your own<em> Portal 3</em> in a place I didn’t expect: <em>Minecraft</em>. Or you can play through 50 pre-made <a href="https://kotaku.com/portal-2-is-the-better-portal-but-you-better-bring-a-f-5793326"><em>Portal</em> <em>2</em></a> puzzles via a newly released <em>Minecraft</em> mod.</p> <p>On August 22, <a href="https://portaljavaedition.net/about">a group of 20+ modders and fan devs released <em>Portal: Java Edition</em></a>, a free remake of Valve’s 2011 first-person puzzler built entirely in vanilla Minecraft using resource and data packs. That <em>technically</em> means the project, which is free to download now on PC, doesn’t use any “mods,” though the creators do include extra third-party mods that help with optimization. And you’ll likely want to install those if you plan to play. This rebuilt version of<em> Portal 2</em> in <em>Minecraft</em> is pushing the Java version of the popular crafting game hard, and it can chug on even beefy PCs without the extra mods.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Portal: Java Edition | Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8v7ZfuKZNis?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>According to the team behind it<em>, Portal: Java Edition</em> started development in 2020 and has taken roughly five years to complete. The mod includes all the mechanics and features from <em>Portal 2</em>, including portals (of course), lasers, light bridges, and mobility gels. The project is shipping with 50 levels spread across eight map packs. And if you burn through all of those, well, don’t worry, you can make some more, thanks to the included level editor. The level editor should be pretty easy to use for <em>Minecraft</em> vets, as it seems to function just like building anything else in Mojang’s crafting game, just with more big red buttons and companion cubes.</p> <p>To play <em>Portal: Java Edition</em>, you’ll need to own <em>Minecraft: Java Edition</em> on PC and then download the project’s files from GitHub. I had to download an older version of <em>Minecraft</em> to get <em>Portal</em> working in the game, but that’s not too hard and is fully supported by the official <em>Minecraft</em> launcher. Once more people are playing this and building levels in it, I expect to replay <em>Doom’s</em>&nbsp;E1M1 and the first level of<em> Super Mario Bros</em>. in the near future.</p>

              <p><em>Replaced</em> has been turning heads since it was first revealed back at E3 2021 (RIP), but actually completing the game has taken longer than anyone thought it would, including its developers at Sad Cat Studios. At long last, there’s good news, though: the team recently confirmed the gorgeous pixel art action game will arrive sometime next spring.</p> <p>That early 2026 timeframe will be a bummer to those secretly hoping <em>Replaced</em> might still sneak out onto PC and Xbox before the end of the year, but it’s better than nothing for fans who have been waiting years to finally see the cinematic cyberpunk platformer in action for themselves. After missing its original 2022 launch window, the day-and-date Game Pass game has been subject to continuous delays. A 2024 launch slipped into 2025, which has now slipped into 2026. What makes this time any different?</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Replaced: Official Development Update Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qPoyEkQePA4?start=146&amp;feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>“This is the first time I’m addressing this personally and that’s because I can finally say it with confidence,” game director Yura Zhdanovich revealed in a new developer update. “<em>Replaced</em> will be released in spring of 2026. We will need just a little more time to get it polished. And to be more precise, our final trailer for the game with the exact release date will be shown later this year.”</p>  <p>Zhdanovich seems to be teasing a final date getting announced at The Game Awards 2025. Until then, <em>Replaced</em> has looked surprisingly good during its recent showing at Gamescom. <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-interview-delay-hollow-knight-team-cherry-2000619168">Much like<em> Silksong</em></a>, its repeated delays seem to have less to do with development woes (<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sat-cat-studios-delays-i-replaced-i-to-support-staff-affected-by-ukraine-invasion">minus having to relocate because of the Russian invasion of Ukraine</a>) than the fact that Sad Cat Studios had just been severely underestimating how much time it would take to get <em>Replaced</em> right.</p> <h2 tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="4 minutes, 55 seconds This is the first time I'm addressing"><em>Replaced</em> is more than just eye-candy</h2> <p>Sporting a <em>Batman: Arkham</em>-like, combo-based combat system and tons of vibrant, detailed pixel art backgrounds, <em>Replaced</em> is exactly the kind of “hand-crafted” indie project that deserves as much production time as it can get. Add in the cinematic mood and ambiance of puzzle-platform games like <em>Inside</em> and <em>Planet of Lana</em>, and you have the recipe for something very special if Sad Cat Studios can pull it off. The latest demo of the game <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9c8Buktx_K0">looks as promising as ever</a>.</p>  <div tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="4 minutes, 55 seconds This is the first time I'm addressing"> <p>“We have done more than 600 clips of animation, which effectively translates to several thousands of hand painted frames of those animations blended together with beautiful VFX, amplifying the mix between retro and modern visuals,” Zhdanovich said. No AI-generated slop in sight. You love to see it.</p> </div>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-gamescom-digital-foundry-2000620055</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-reportedly-pushing-devs-to-release-on-switch-1-instead-of-sharing-switch-2-dev-kits.1280118/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Switch 2 launched just a few months ago and was immediately a smash hit, selling more than 3.5 million devices within four days of launch. Since then, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/switch-2-has-sold-more-than-6-million-units-and-almost-as-many-copies-of-mario-kart-world">Nintendo’s sold nearly twice</a> that much, sitting at roughly around six million machines. Those are great numbers for Nintendo, which is why it’s strange that a recent report indicates that the console manufacturer is seemingly hesitant to get dev kits for its hybrid console into the hands of devs.</p> <p>Thanks to reporting from our comrades over at <i>Digital Foundry</i>, enthusiastic interest from developers to get their games running as best they can on Switch 2 isn’t enough. Nintendo is encouraging studios to “ship [their games] on Switch 1 and rely on backwards compatibility,” according to John Linneman on episode 228 of <i>DF Direct Weekly</i>. He continues:</p> <blockquote><p>There are a lot of developers that are unable to get Switch 2 dev kits. We talked to a lot of devs at <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460">Gamescom this year</a> and so many of them said the same things: They want to ship on Switch 2. They would love to do Switch 2 versions [of their games]. They can’t get the hardware. It’s really difficult.</p></blockquote> <p><i>DF Direct Weekly</i> cohost Oliver Mackenzie spoke for all of us when he added that he doesn’t “understand the strategy.” He noted that for a while now, there were rumors that Nintendo was, at best, inconsistent with who it got dev kits into the hands of, and at worst, withholding. Mackenzie added that it’s <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/chillin-by-the-fire-switch-2/">odd to see the devs behind <i>Chillin’ by the Fire</i></a> receive developer machines to work on while some bigger names are seemingly left out in the cold. You can check out <a href="https://youtu.be/N0SW7R5H5wY">the whole <i>DF Direct Weekly</i> episode here</a>:</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DF Direct Weekly #228: Elden Ring/FF7R Switch 2! #StutterStruggle Fixed? Valve Console Specs!" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N0SW7R5H5wY?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Despite the increased power of the new handheld compared to the first iteration of the Switch and its popularity, there’s still a lack of native Switch 2 versions of a variety of games out there. That’s something Nintendo should seem interested in fixing, no? It’s an odd situation for sure. Then again, just about <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881">all of reality is an odd situation</a>, seeing as the <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-inflation-tariffs-2000614220">Switch 1 literally saw its price <i>increase </i>eight years</a> after it shipped and a few months after its successor launched. Nintendo’s not alone in that, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873">Sony just upped the price of the PS5, too</a>.</p> <p><i>Kotaku</i> has reached out to Nintendo for comment on this story.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On Sunday, a cameraman inexplicably walked onto the court during a <a href="https://kotaku.com/us-open-tennis-champion-does-video-game-celebration-aft-1847662401">US Open</a> first-round match between tennis pros Daniil Medvedev and Benjamin Bonzi. This led to the judge giving Bonzi a new serve, angering Medvedev and leading to a six-minute delay after he rallied the crowd to boo and yell at his opponent and the decision.</p> <p>On August 24 in New York City’s Louis Armstrong Stadium, Russian player Daniil Medvedev, who won the US Open in 2021, was losing his match against French player Benjamin Bonzi. When Bonzi went to complete his second serve, a cameraman walked onto the court. This forced the match umpire, Greg Allensworth, to stop play and demand that the man leave the court. The umpire then awarded Bonzi a new first serve, <a href="https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/46068258/bonzi-survives-medvedev-late-surge-chaotic-us-open-match">which <em>ESPN</em> reports</a> is common in professional tennis when situations like this occur. However, Medvedev wasn’t happy about the call and stormed up to Allensworth while yelling at the umpire.</p> <p>“Are you a man? Are you a man? Why are you shaking?” is what Medvedev reportedly shouted at Allensworth. “He wants to go home, guys, he doesn’t like it here. He gets paid by the match, not by the hour.”</p>

 <p>He then referenced another player who <a href="https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/43733166/reilly-opelka-calls-umpire-suspended-penalty">was fined earlier this year</a> after calling Allensworth the “worst ump on tour,” shouting to the crowd, “What did Reilly Opelka say!?” multiple times and motioning with his arms for the audience to join in on his yelling. And they did exactly that.</p> <p>The US Open crowd jeered, booed, yelled, and chanted, delaying the match for nearly six minutes as Bonzi was unable to serve due to all the screaming and taunting. At multiple points during the yelling, you can see Medvedev cheer on the crowd, though eventually even he started asking them to quiet down. Meanwhile, during all of this, umpire Allensworth begged the crowd to quiet down, but it didn’t work. Eventually, the audience quieted down enough that Bonzi could serve. When the ball crashed into the net, the audience got even louder.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Daniil Medvedev ignites crowd after a photographer walked on the court at match point | 2025 US Open" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oXmpP1kLyxQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>While Medvedev rallied after the delay and Bonzi’s failed serve, he would ultimately lose the match to the French player and get knocked out of the US Open.</p> <p>“For me, it’s like my best victory ever,” said Bonzi afterwards, according to <a href="https://www.espn.com/tennis/story/_/id/46068258/bonzi-survives-medvedev-late-surge-chaotic-us-open-match"><em>ESPN</em></a>. He also directly blamed Medvedev for the extended delay and crowd yelling at him, saying that after the crowd reacted poorly to the umpire’s call, “he put oil on the fire.”</p> <div data-testid="paragraph-15"> <p>“It was crazy. I may have got some new fans, but also some new non-fans,”&nbsp; <a href="https://www.reuters.com/sports/tennis/media-mishap-sparks-medvedev-meltdown-russian-exits-us-open-2025-08-25/">said Bonzi, according to the <em>AP</em></a>. “The energy was crazy. Thanks to all who were booing. Thanks for the energy. I’ve never experienced something like that. We waited maybe five minutes before the match point, and it was crazy. There was so much noise.”</p> <p>After losing the first round match, Medvedev—who told reporters later that he didn’t agree with the ump that the cameraman interfered long enough to warrant a new first serve—sat on the side of the court for a few minutes before grabbing a tennis racket and smashing it in anger in front of the remaining audience.</p> </div> <figure id="attachment_2000620047" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000620047"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000620047">©ESPN / US OPEN / Kotaku</figcaption></figure>
