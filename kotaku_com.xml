              <p>AI’s all-encompassing usefulness is now well beyond debate. A stellar AI tool is great. An AI tool on sale for 82% off is even better. An AI tool on sale for 82% off that you can also stack with a special checkout code that drops another $10 from the price and gives you a lifetime subscription for just $30? That’s downright unbeatable, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4692/">that’s what’s waiting for you right how at StackSocial — a lifetime license to 1min.AI is all yours for $30.</a></p>
<p>1min.AI also spares you from doing the deep dive to find out which of the ever-growing number of AI models is the best one to use, because 1min.AI is not an AI model — it’s a smorgasbord of several AI models all in one interface. So if you’re already signed up for several model subscriptions, now’s your chance to streamline them, reduce your bills, and not miss out on any of the latest AI advances.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4692/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>Newbies Welcome</h2>
<p>Even if you’re just now dipping your toe into the AI pond (which is more like an ocean by now), and the idea of suddenly having several different models at your fingertips is intimidating, there’s no need for concern. 1min.AI is amazingly accessible even for newbies. The intuitive user interface is easy to learn once you start feeding it text and/or images and asking it to generate your desired output.</p>
<p>If you’re working with visuals, you can even backtrack if you don’t like what 1min.AI has done with your creative suggestions. It has a Generative Remove tool to take out unwanted elements, giving you ultimate control over your own creative vision. And that vision can take its form virtually any way you like when you deploy the AI models of 1min.AI: image generation, keyword research, content creation — it’s basically limitless.</p>



<h2>One Payment, All the Power</h2>
<p>The one-time purchase of a lifetime subscription to 1min.AI gives you access to AI models including GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, Claude 3 Opus, Gemini Pro 1.5, Llama 3, MistralAI, Command, and more. In time you’ll find which one suits your needs best, and the odds are different needs will be handled best by different models.</p>
<p>The lifetime subscription to 1min.AI’s Pro plan is all-inclusive, with all future updates covered — no recurring costs or monthly fees buried in the small print. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4692/">It normally sells for $234, but StackSocial’s 82% off deal brings the price down to $40, and when you add the code <strong>SAVE10</strong> at checkout, the price gets knocked down to just $30</a>. It doesn’t require any artificial intelligence to see what a great deal this is.</p>

              <p>How will Radiance Cores make make web-slinging even better in <em>Spider-Man 3</em>? How much of<em> Battlefield 7</em> will be AI-generated once Saudi Arabia takes over? And why is licensed DLC fueling a <em>Sonic</em> kart-racing renaissance? Welcome to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. The Eagles spiked another one last night. Now begins the annual Philly football crashout before things start to recover after Thanksgiving.</p>   <p>The architect behind Sony’s upcoming gaming hardware sat down with AMD’s senior VP of computing, Jack Huynh, to discuss how the two companies’ joint partnership in advancing GPU tech will make Joel’s beard in <em>The Last of Us Part I</em> look even more awe-inducing on next-gen hardware. They talked about Neural Arrays, Radiance Cores, and Universal Compression. No, these aren’t <a href="https://x.com/JackMHuynh/status/1976272374543630842?s=19"><em>Destiny 2</em> patch notes</a>, they’re a roadmap to what will seemingly make gaming on PS6 marginally better than current-gen tech.</p>

 <p>In layman’s terms, it’s all supposed to mean more efficiency that lets developers draw better performance and visual fidelity out of the existing GPU. It will seemingly scale with AI tech to give you more bang for your buck across the spectrum, whether you’re playing on a high-end living room console or the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-leak-specs-sony-handheld-price-release-date-2000614206">rumored PlayStation handheld</a> that’s coming. Cerny didn’t call out the PS6 by name but did suggest it will be here in the next “few years.”</p>

 <p>“Overall, it’s of course still very early days for these technologies, they only exist in simulation right now,” he said. “But the results are quite promising and I’m really excited about bringing them to a future console in a few years’ time.” Microsoft is also working with AMD on its next-gen hardware, which it <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-next-gen-console-leak-rumor-costco-sams-club-2000632026">promises it hasn’t canceled</a>.</p>

 <h2>Players are having too much fun with the new <em>Minecraft</em> pack in <em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</em></h2>   <p>The <em>Minecraft</em> pack arrived in-game this week and costs $6 for the addition of Steve, Alex, Creeper, the<em> Minecraft</em> vehicle and World course, and other cosmetics. Sonic fans are already calling it “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/1o1s4wa/the_minecraft_track_is_peak/">peak</a>.” Sonic can <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SonicTheHedgehog/comments/1o1s1eo/lol_most_sonic_characters_barely_stick_out_the/">barely see out over the top</a> of the <em>Minecraft</em> cart vehicle. In no other game can you have a Creeper race Shadow while riding in a Hatsune Miku box.</p>

 <h2>Galactus tells Ubisoft to “fuck off” over canceled Civil War-era <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Once again, fuck off <a href="https://t.co/kidkOjOZYd">https://t.co/kidkOjOZYd</a></p> <p>— Ralph Ineson (@ralphineson) <a href="https://twitter.com/ralphineson/status/1976428674397491324?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>British actor Ralph Ineson had <a href="https://x.com/ralphineson/status/1976428674397491324">harsh words</a> for the publisher following former<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/scoop-ubisoft-cancelled-a-post-civil"><em> Kotaku</em> EIC Stephen Totilo’s report</a> that an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game featuring <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-game-cancel-reconstruction-black-slave-2000633318">a former slave fighting an emerging Ku Klux Klan</a> during post-Civil War Reconstruction was canceled over fears it was too controversial during America’s current reactionary lurch. The actor played Charles Vane in <em>Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag</em> (<a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-4-black-flag-remake-skull-bones-1850596271">which is currently getting an unannounced remake</a>) and more recently Cid in <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> and Lorath Nahr in<em> Diablo 4</em>. He <a href="https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-first-steps-galactus-ralph-ineson-suit-1851786828">also played Galactus</a> in this year’s<em> Fantastic Four </em>movie. Ineson had a similar response to Hollywood agents <a href="https://x.com/ralphineson/status/1972041256277848253">trying to promote an AI actress</a>.</p>

 <h2>EA exec calls generative AI “very seducing”</h2> <p>Speaking of everyone’s favorite $1 trillion Ponzi scheme, EA’s general manager of DICE and Criterion Games, Rebecka Coutaz, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c8xrkxdkkrno">told the <em>BBC</em></a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-exec-insists-players-wont-see-anything-made-by-very-seducing-generative-ai-in-battlefield-6"><em>IGN</em></a>) that there is no generative AI in the finished version of <em>Battlefield 6</em>, though the technology is used early in the development process “to allow more time and more space to be creative.” CEO Andrew Wilson previously told investors that AI was going to be at the heart of everything the company does moving forward, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">some developers within the company</a> have told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> there’s new pressure from above to experiment with AI tools wherever possible.</p>

 <p><em>The Financial Times</em> reported that EA’s new Saudi and private equity owners are banking on an AI transformation to help it pay off $20 billion in debt. &nbsp;“If we can break the magic with AI it will help us be more innovative and more creative,” Coutaz told the<em> BBC</em>.</p> <h2><em>Fortnite</em>‘s new Ghostface mythic weapon is wrecking people</h2>   <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/blueskynoise.com/post/3m2rxomnvss2u">The Last Call Knife</a> changes your costume to the <em>Scream</em> icon and offers voice lines and a speed bonus. Most importantly, it lets you use a phone to ping nearby enemies so you can get the jump on them. Players can also pick up Leatherface’s weapon from<em> Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> but it’s apparently not as good. “Just so everyone knows, Ghostface beats chainsaw. Found out the hard way,” one fan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1o2ffu7/new_ghostface_mythic_is_awesome_at_making_people/">wrote</a> on Reddit.</p> <h2>Physical Switch editions of the PS1-era <em>Final Fantasy</em> games are finally coming West</h2> <p>They won’t be cheap, though.

At least there’s not a game key card in sight though for these HD remasters. Square Enix must know their fans are marks. I suspect they (we) know it too, though I personally prefer the PS4 version of <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasy/comments/k6m2g9/everyone_is_hating_on_the_cover_of_ffviii/">with this neat box art</a>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-extraction-pvpve-progression-wipe-loot-2000633739">Arc Raiders is an extraction shooter trying to solve the worst thing about extraction shooters</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-discord-hack-sounds-really-really-bad-2000633690">The Discord hack offers an important warning</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379">Is <em>Battlefield</em> back?

              <p><span>Last week, a Portland protestor named Seth Todd showed up at the ICE protests in the Oregon city dressed up in an inflatable frog costume. Footage of armed soldiers backing up as the protester confidently walked toward them went viral on social media, along with a video of an agent spraying pepper spray into the costume’s air filter. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/trump-autism-tylenol-press-conference-reaction-jokes-2000627950"><span>President Donald Trump</span></a><span> has been trying to </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/us/portland-oregon-trump-history"><span>paint a grim picture of the protests</span></a><span>, saying the city has become “war-ravaged,” but seeing a protestor dressed in a frog costume tells another story. Now, the frog costume has inspired dozens of other Portland citizens to dress up as animals as they continue to fight against ICE and America’s continued descent into fascism.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><i><span>The Oregonian</span></i><span>, a local outlet in Portland, interviewed several protesters last night, October 9, who came to the ICE facility dressed up as frogs in an act of solidarity.&nbsp;</span></p>

The outlet reports that the armed federal officers “retreated” without interacting with the costume party outside.</span></p>   <p><span>The Portland ICE protests have been ongoing since June, and while the Trump administration would have you believe that Portland citizens have become violent and dangerous, videos keep popping up showing that the people aren’t the ones instigating any violence.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-doesn%E2%80%99t-have-a-smartphone-this-tiny-and-cheap-even-100-still-gets-you-change-back.1321939/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Let’s rewind time for a moment. Remember when cell phones first passed that threshold where they stopped being a luxury and became something that just everyone had? They weren’t smart yet, they were just phones. And for those first several years, each iteration got smaller and smaller. Screens weren’t important. Customers prioritized the convenience of being able to fit your phone in any pocket. They only started trending upwards in size when we started to be able to access the internet, and watch videos. Social media became phone-first in design and manufacturers began making the screens bigger to accommodate a better experience when glued to your screen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4691/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>
<p>Though, the advent of the smartphone has not eliminated the benefits of a smaller device. Some of us still would prefer to have something less intrusive. It might also help us reduce our embarrassingly high screen-times to switch over to a phone that isn’t designed to keep out attention for 24 hours a day. That’s where the NanoPhone shines. It’s on sale over at StackSocial at the moment. It’s already starting as an extremely affordable price relative to other smartphones on the market — $200 — but has come down to less than half that. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4691/">For a limited time, you can snag yourself this mini 4G smartphone for only $90.</a></p>

<h2>The Size of a Credit Card</h2>
<p>The NanoPhone is a fully functional smartphone that comes in an incredible compact form factor Its touchscreen only measures in at three inches across, but it still presents in HD. It weighs under three ounces and can be fit reasonably into your pocket without taking up the whole thing.</p>
<p>The cameras are perfectly serviceable for a phone at this price point. You’d be working with a 5MP lens on the back of the device with a 2MP selfie cameras on front for quick pics and video calls. The phone’s 2,000mAh batter will last your through the day and the phone recharges over the now standard USB-C cable.</p>



<p>This phone supports 4G LTE and data plans with most cellular providers. It’s SIM card-ready right out of the box, able to be set up with Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and all other US carriers. You can even use it with budget and no-contract service providers including Cricket, Boost, Visible, and Mint.</p>
<p>The phone is running Android 10 so you can use a whole slew of your favorite apps like WhatsApp, Instagram, X (The Everything App), YouTube, and more.</p>
