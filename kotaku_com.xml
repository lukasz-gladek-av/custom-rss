Last night, NetEase <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-new-patch-notes-captain-america-luna-snow-1851756109&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-new-patch-notes-captain-america-luna-snow-1851756109">announced<em> Marvel Rivals</em> players</a></span> would have their competitive rank nerfed mid-season. Barely a few hours later, the company said that it would actually not be doing that at all. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195697" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="170" data-playlist="195697,196406,196086" data-current="195697"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Mortal Kombat 1</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195697/195697_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21194.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Ranked modes have become common in online multiplayer games, and it would be boring if players finally attained a rank commensurate with their skill level and then barely ever budged. So like many games, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> takes players several pegs down the ranked ladder at the start of every season to give them a new goal to grind toward. Unlike many games,<em> Marvel Rivals</em> also wanted to do this during the middle of each season too. </p><p>“Ranks will be reset when the second half of Season 1 starts on February 21, 2025,” the game’s developers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250210/40954_1210988.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250210/40954_1210988.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">announced on February 10</a></span>. “Based on your standing at the end of the first half of Season 1, prepare for a drop of four divisions. For example, if you ended the first half of Season 1 at Diamond I, you’ll start the second half at Platinum II.”</p><p>The 500,000 member <em>Marvel Rivals</em> subreddit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/search/?q=rank&amp;cId=2f433fb9-8c67-442c-b819-d9589608b1b6&amp;iId=f0fc68b0-d992-42ad-ae89-697ca415b0f1&amp;t=week&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/search/?q=rank&amp;cId=2f433fb9-8c67-442c-b819-d9589608b1b6&amp;iId=f0fc68b0-d992-42ad-ae89-697ca415b0f1&amp;t=week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">immediately rebelled against the decision</a></span>. “De-ranks twice a season for Players below gold will kill this game,” read one upvoted thread. “Honestly mid season de-ranks make me want to play less,” read another. “Dropping ranks mid season is a TERRIBLE idea,” read a third. As one player in the subreddit put it, “Why bother with Ranked if my Rank is reset every month?”</p><p>It only took NetEase a few hours to recalibrate. “After the release of Dev Talk 10 regarding the seasonal rank adjustment, we received a wealth of feedback from the community,” it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250211/40954_1211177.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250211/40954_1211177.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote in an updated dev diary</a></span>. “When the second half of the season begins, there will be no rank reset. Players will retain their ranks and scores from the end of the first half.”</p><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> will still give players who hit gold rank their rewards on February 21, but instead of needing to rank back up following that date to unlock the rest, they’ll merely need to complete 10 additional matches in competitive mode before the end of the season. Doing so will unlock the second set of rewards, including a new Gold rank costume and a variety of Crests of Honor, featuring distinct designs for Grandmaster, Celestial, Eternity, and One Above All.</p><p>Live-service games are a delicate dance between developers trying to maintain the overall health and longevity of the game while players want to Have Fun, and not feel Screwed Over. Even beloved hits like<em> Helldivers 2</em> have occasionally missed the mark when it comes to this balancing act. Kudos to <em>Marvel Rivals</em> for course correcting so quickly. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We’ve picked out some of the most impressive deals and interesting games from the list.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196131" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="328" data-playlist="196131,195189,195624" data-current="196131"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21668.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Couch co-op has traditionally described games played together in-person, sat side-by-side on the obligatory couch. Of course, being Steam with its Remote Play Together feature, this doesn’t exclude those who don’t want awful other people coming in their private space. Most games with a couch co-op feature have adopted this system, that lets you play co-operatively online, without  other players having to own a copy of the game. All of the convenience, none of the vacuuming.</p><p>The remit is spread very widely here, such that anything with a co-op mode is included, rather than being to particular about the furniture used—not least because most people playing on PC aren’t sat in a sofa. And this is to our advantage, of course, because it just means more games are on sale. Valve has done a decent job with the layout for the sale, too, so while—yes—<em>Call of Duty Black Ops III</em> and <em>NBA 2K25</em> are in there, they’re not dominating such that indie games aren’t visible.</p><p>We’ve picked through <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/category/multiplayer_coop?snr=1_4_4__118&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/multiplayer_coop?snr=1_4_4__118" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the colossal list</a></span> for some co-op games you might have missed that we think deserve your attention, or are major titles you already know but now a lot cheaper. Like, you know, <em>Portal 2 </em>for 99c. The list below shows you the sale price, <strong>good through February 17</strong>, and the regular price in parentheses after.</p><hr><p><strong><em>Portal 2</em></strong> - 99c ($10)</p><p><strong><em>Left 4 Dead 2</em></strong> - 99c ($10)</p><p>These two Valve titles are now old enough that you may have missed them the first time around. Both are extraordinary, we’re talking “best games of all time” levels of good. Getting them both for two bucks is wonderful madness.</p><p><strong><em>Baldur’s Gate III</em></strong> - $48 ($60)</p><p><strong><em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em></strong> - $13.49 ($45)</p><p>Obviously any time the best game of 2024 is on sale is a good thing, but if you’ve already completed it, you might want to go back a generation and play the developers’ previous game, <em>Divinity: Original Sin II</em>. You may have been put off by the number in the title, but fear not—this is a completely standalone game, and damned close to as good as <em>BG3</em>. (I, whisper it, think I prefer it.)</p><p><strong><em>UFO 50</em></strong> - $21.24 ($25)</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ufo-50-review-retro-games-steam-1851649865&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ufo-50-review-retro-games-steam-1851649865">As championed by <em>Kotaku</em>’s backbone, Carolyn Petit</a></span>, this collection of imagined retro classics is one of 2024's best releases, and while the discount here is minimal, the game’s still new enough that this is a great deal.</p><p><strong><em>Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</em></strong> - $10 ($50)</p><p><strong><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em></strong> - $20 ($50)</p><p><strong><em>Overcooked! 2</em></strong> - $6.24 ($25)</p><p><strong><em>The Jackbox Party Packs</em></strong> - various</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/33030169/view/541096269502742768&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/33030169/view/541096269502742768" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The whole <em>Jackbox</em> collection is on sale</a></span> in this fest, the earliest games at 50 percent off, the most recent (7-10) at 35 percent off, bring them down to around $15 to $20 each.</p><p><strong><em>Hellcard</em></strong> - $15 ($25)</p><p>If you ever wanted to play <em>Slay the Spire</em> in co-op, <em>Hellcard</em> is your answer.</p><p><strong><em>Stranded Deep</em></strong> - $10 ($20)</p><p>I feel that <em>Stranded Deep</em> was rather underrated, as a result of its releasing at the absolute saturation point for survival sims. There was very much a vibe of “yet another one” about it, and that’s not really fair. It’s lacking a unique twist (it doesn’t have <em>The Forest</em>’s horror or <em>Raft</em>’s raft) but it delivers the core experience with respectable solidity.</p><p><strong><em>Chained Together</em></strong> - $4.49 ($5)</p><p><strong><em>Pico Park</em></strong> - $4 ($5)</p><p><strong><em>Broforce</em></strong> - $3 ($15)</p><p><strong><em>The Past Within</em></strong> - $3 ($6)</p><p>Rusty Lake’s approach to co-op was, of course, far weirder than anyone else’s. One player is in the Future, the other in the Past, trying to solve puzzles together, while not being entirely sure if you trust them.</p><p><strong><em>Cassette Beasts</em></strong> - $12 ($20)</p><p><strong><em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em></strong> - $3 ($15)</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
