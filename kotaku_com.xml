              <p>If you randomly received a bunch of test messages from the Xbox mobile app today, you didn’t do anything wrong. Many others, including myself, received the random spam messages this afternoon.</p> <p>On February 25, at around 12:30 PM, people with the Xbox app installed on their phone began receiving multiple test notifications in quick succession. I received eight such test messages, and all of mine featured the icon for <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em> for some odd reason.<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nicolefacee.bsky.social/post/3mfp7awat4s2h"> Others online shared screenshots</a> that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/numbereighty3.bsky.social/post/3mfpakbuot223">showed even more messages</a> than I received. Each message contained the following text:</p> <blockquote><p>“This is a dummy message sent via Braze, please capture a screenshot once you receive it. This should take you to the recently added gallery.”</p></blockquote> <p>A quick Google seems to indicate that <a href="https://www.braze.com/product/overview">Braze is some sort of cross-platform social media and digital messaging platform</a> used by a lot of different big companies. So it seems likely that the Xbox app is using Braze or is switching over to it, and something went wrong and now a bunch of people have random test messages spamming their home screen.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Xbox for comment. We only sent one email. Not seven.</p> <p>The timing of this odd tech snafu couldn’t be worse for Xbox as the company is going through a big and <a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059">reportedly messy shake-up, with longtime CEO Phil Spencer stepping down last week</a> and a new <a href="https://kotaku.com/asha-sharma-xbox-future-plans-roadmap-2000673378">AI-focused CEO taking over in his place</a>. Some, including myself, have suggested this is the end of Xbox as we know it. That it might be dead. But I guess a dozen random messages in the afternoon proves it’s still alive. At least part of it.</p>

              <p>If you’re a <em>Pokémon</em> fan, you have no doubt experienced the <a href="https://kotaku.com/all-the-big-pokemon-games-ranked-from-worst-to-best-1849984595">mainline games</a> with all their catching, battling, and being the very best like no one ever was. But the series has a wide selection of spin-off games that span different genres and subject matter. Even if you’ve only ever played the RPGs, there’s probably something for you in the spin-offs simply because there’s such a wide range of experiences to be found. So what better to do with an eclectic collection of <em>Pokémon </em>games than to come up with a qualitative ranking to decide which is the best? We’re just days away from the series’ <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-where-when-to-watch-generation-10-switch-2000671968">30th anniversary stream</a> where we’ll learn what The Pokémon Company is up to in 2026, so to get ourselves in the mood, we’ve rounded up 25 of the most notable <em>Pokémon </em>spin-off games, putting them in order from real stinkers to some of the most important games and sub-series in the franchise.</p> <p><em>This ranking was originally published in 2023.</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-hexe-clint-hocking-ubisoft-2000673657</link>
            <guid>1446130</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this week, Ubisoft revealed three <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-vets-leading-frnachise-series-vantage-new-games-2000672792">new leaders for <em>Assassin’s Creed</em></a>. One of those will now be taking over as creative director for <em>Assassin’s Creed Hexe</em> as its existing lead, Clint Hocking, departs the company after a cumulative 20 years working on Ubisoft games.</p> <p>As first <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/assassins-creed-hexe-director-clint-hocking-has-left-ubisoft-as-part-of-franchise-upheaval/">reported by<em> VGC</em></a>, staff were informed about Hocking’s departure during an internal meeting with the new Assassin’s Creed leadership team just this week. “We sincerely thank [Clint] for his vision, creative contributions, and dedication over the years, and we wish him the very best in his next chapter,” a spokesperson for Ubisoft said. “Development on Assassin’s Creed Codename Hexe continues with a seasoned team.”</p>

 <p>Hocking first joined the French publisher in 2001 to lead projects like <em>Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory</em> and <em>Far Cry 2</em>. He eventually left for <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-lucasarts-fell-apart-1401731043">brief stints at LucasArts, Valve, and Amazon Games</a> before returning in 2015 and later directing <em>Watch Dogs Legion</em>. Like <em>Far Cry 2</em>, it was an ambitious, systems-driven sandbox where players swapped between procedurally generated characters on the streets of London to fight a fascist surveillance state. It was mechanically innovative but sales disappointed.</p> <p>Hocking has been on Hexe, the next blockbuster <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game coming in the pipeline with <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-extraction-shooter-assassins-creed-hexe-ubisoft-2000672574">a reported release date goal of 2027</a>. “After over a year of working in the darkness, happy to announce I’m working as the Creative Director on Assassin’s Creed: Codename Hexe, with an amazing team in Montreal,” he posted back in 2022.</p>

 <p><em>Hexe</em> takes place in the “latter stages of the Holy Roman Empire,” involves witch trials, and would seemingly take on a much more survival horror-infused tone than other games in the series. We’ll see if that’s still the case now that, as <em>VGC</em> reports, Assassin’s Creed veteran Jean Guesdon, a director on <em>Black Flag</em> and <em>Origins</em>, is taking over.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-griefers-throwers-bounties-intlist-2000673645</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Intlist, a website that allows users to post bounties “on griefers &amp; throwers” in </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Valorant</span></i><span>, went live on February 23, and the </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span> community is particularly ticked off about it, mostly because they believe that NetEase is to blame for letting things get to this point in the first place. Intlist promises that those who respond to the bounties on the website will be paid for their work, but it’s clearly trying to have its cake and eat it too, as its founders state that the posted bounties are ”not a green light to harass the target.” In spite of this statement, several bounties on Intlist feature information about the targets in question that can be used to track them down elsewhere, such as their Twitch usernames.</span></p> <p><span>Founded in part by a “former pro player” called EchoRivals, Intlist’s official page on </span><a href="https://x.com/IntlistOrg/status/2025963500653203478"><span>X</span></a><span> states that the site’s creation is also NetEase’s fault, due to their implementation of Engagement-Oriented Matchmaking in </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>(via </span><a href="https://fandomwire.com/marvel-rivals-fans-demand-shutdown-of-a-website-letting-players-post-bounties-on-throwers-and-griefers/"><i><span>Fandomwire</span></i></a><span>). “intlist.org exists because the devs left a gap — and the community filled it. Remove EOMM and actually ban throwers? We’ll gladly shut down.” For context, NetEase </span><a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1955117077561593877?lang=en"><span>has stated</span></a><span> on multiple occasions that </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span> doesn’t use EOMM.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000673662" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000673662"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000673662">©</figcaption></figure> <p><span>However,</span><i><span> Marvel Rivals</span></i><span> players are upset with NetEase due to the lax methods it uses to punish people who throw games and grief teammates. Prior to Inlist’s creation, posts criticizing NetEase for not banning those who abuse this fact seemed to pop up on r/rivals on a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rivals/comments/1r03rip/throwers_are_killing_the_game/"><span>daily basis</span></a><span>. “Can we just start banning people for throwing. I don’t get how we’re a year into this game and people are still throwing games left and right 24/7 without anything happening to them.”</span></p> <p><span>That being said, the same subreddit isn’t too fond of Intlist either, as the community is now asking NetEase to go </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1rdm7f8/are_we_for_real_there_is_bounties_for_throwing/"><span>after the website</span></a><span> directly. According to several players in the thread, Intlist is clearly only making the problem worse. “There is also a Saudi millionaire paying people to target throwers, and now every game is people throwing each other’s games. Can we do something about this, please? Perma these people.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Perhaps the most obvious sign that Intlist isn’t doing its due diligence here are the specific names featured in the bounties. One of the targets posted on the site is pro player Jay3, founder of the Jay3 Community Clash tournament, who has a 7-dollar bounty on his digital head. It also doesn’t help the founders’ case that the </span><a href="https://x.com/IntlistOrg/status/2026535423938265521"><span>latest post</span></a><span> on Intlist’s X page states that the website is currently down for maintenance so they can “cook a few things.” That is slightly underselling the reason behind its “maintenance,” as earlier this morning, founder EchoRivals announced on the official Intlist Discord server that the site is offline because they “detected unauthorized access.“ As a result, a “limited number of email addresses tied to bounty posts were exposed.”</span></p>

              <p>For nearly 20 years, I have been constantly astonished by what people are capable of creating in&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>. Thanks to Creative mode, people have been able to build the most astonishing buildings, then towns, then cities, then countries. Maps like <a href="https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/city-of-newisle-v-07032015-solo-modern-build/">Newisle</a>, <a href="https://www.westeroscraft.com/">Westeroscraft</a> and, well, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/PippenFTS">the entire planet Earth</a> are breathtaking pieces of work, years in the making, but it turns out they’re being created in easy mode. At least, in comparison to YouTuber stan616, who took it upon himself to spend nearly 80 days building a spectacular recreation of <em>One Piece</em>‘s Marineford in Hardcore, using over a million blocks.</p> <p>To explain: Usually, when people take on enormous builds like this in&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, they play in the game’s Creative mode, which allows you to generate any number of any block type at will. Also, it lets you fly. This means that while still huge feats, people at least have the resources and dexterity to just crack on with constructing their masterpiece. But stan616 has opted for something far sillier. In Hardcore, every cube of every part of every building, ship, pathway and mountain has to be mined, harvested and crafted from scratch. Oh, and every tool used to do this, too. And if he wants to fly, that’s going to require vast numbers of eyltra and fireworks, and you can’t build while you’re doing that. Sound ridiculous enough? Because that’s the easy bit. That’d be how you’d do it in Survival mode. But in Hardcore, the world is also filled with aggressive mods spawning in and attacking, and should he die, the <em>whole build is lost</em>.</p>

 <p>Heck, if he fell from a wall he was building and missed a bucket clutch, he’d be in big trouble. Yes, he did the whole build with a Totem of Undying in one hand, meaning death can be averted, but once that Totem’s gone he’s got to swap another one in damn fast or he could be done for. Anyone who’s fallen in <em>Minecraft</em> will know how horribly possible it is to pop your Totem, then fall again before you know what’s happening. (Never. Dig. Straight. Down.)</p> <p>There are moments in the 90-minute edit of the 77 days this project took where he comes horrifically close to death. Like the time a Creeper sneaks up behind him as he’s building and blows itself up, popping his Totem and leaving him shaking in his chair. Or, far more stupidly, when he flew full-pace into a wall, narrowly missing the window, and nearly brained himself. Why do this? Why make it this hard? Because you gotta stand out.</p>

 <p>The video is great fun. Despite the embarrassingly pompous opening narration, the rest of the hour is nothing like that, with stan616 including moments of humiliation (like when he realizes he spent a day working on the wrong template), humility, and good-natured humor.</p>

  <p>You’ll note that when building in Hardcore, he’s working from schematics. This is a technique where elaborate crafts are designed in Creative, then the designs are exported with a mod like <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/litematica">Litematica</a> into the Hardcore world. These then appear like ghosts in the world, and builders fill them in with the appropriate blocks. It makes builds of this scale plausible, but as you’ll see from the video, doesn’t guarantee success.</p> <p>The logistics here are phenomenal. The designing, the blueprinting, the mining, the networks of chests, the oxidizing all the copper, the smelting, the searching the map for Trial Chambers and amethysts and everything else, all before the build even begins, all of this while risking death at any moment. If you want to avoid all that for yourself, stan616 <a href="https://www.patreon.com/cw/stan616">is selling the build on his Patreon</a> for $55.50.</p>

 <p>Just the thought of gathering the blocks required makes me want to go back to bed. In total, he used 1,187,773 blocks. But doing it in Hardcore? Dude. No. Just imagine. Absolutely incredible work.</p>
