            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last night, as I browsed the Xbox Store on my Series X, <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-october-2025-ninja-gaiden-grinch-price-2000633269">I spotted the newly released Grinch game, which is now available on Game Pass</a>. Curious how players were receiving the not-so-great-looking family-friendly Christmas platformer, I decided to check out the user reviews. What I stumbled into was a warzone filled with shots at Xbox’s recent price hikes and way too many people wanting to fuck the Grinch.</p> <p>Originally released in 2023, <em>The Grinch: Christmas Adventures</em> was a sloppy co-op platformer that had few fans and was promptly forgotten after it launched. But now it’s back and updated and is being sold as a new game with a new subtitle: <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/the-grinch-christmas-adventures-merry-mischievous-edition/9ppjp7x77nnb"><em>Merry &amp; Mischievous Edition</em></a>. I’m not sure how many people were clamoring for a new version of this bleh Grinch game, but it’s here just in time for Halloween. It is also one of the first games to be added to Game Pass after the <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-gets-massive-price-hike-yet-amid-big-changes-2000630604">massive price increase earlier this month</a>, which explains why so <em>many</em> user reviews for <em>TGCAM&amp;ME</em> (as the kids call it) are dunking on the subscription service.</p> <hr> <blockquote><p>“$30 A MONTH FOR THIS???? A GAME THAT LOOKS LIKE AN AWFUL 360 MOVIE TIE IN GAME?? 🤣🤣🤣🤣”</p>  <p>“BE ACTUALLY REAL XBOX. Awful clunky game about the grinch in the middle of october????? I AM THE SECOND REVIEW?????? 50% PRICE INCREASE. UBISOFT COLLECTION WITH 50% BOARD GAMES. I AM LEAVING THE SERVICE. THERE ARE FISH HOOKED UP TO WIRES RUNNING EVERYTHING AT THE XBOX H.Q. APPARENTLY IM SUBSCRIBED TO XBOX GAME PASS BABIES WITH DAY ONE DROPS OF THE GRINCH. UNACCEPTABLE . P.S if you dislike this review i’m automatically assuming ur a dev. “It’s for kids” argument DOES NOT WORK AS IT IS SLOP AND WHAT PARENT IS GONNA SPEND 30 DOLLARS A MONTH FOR THIS”</p> <p>“Bruh. You’re telling me for 30 dollars a month? I get this?…. Yeah, I’m glad my ultimate ends the 23rd. I got BF6 and multiplayer access all i need.”</p> <p>“Lolz. Ms wants $30 a month for this clunky ****?👀”</p> <p>“$30 4 this?? Cancel Gamepass.”</p> <p>“50% price hike for the Grinch is CRAZY. If xbox is raising the prices they better start putting out games that aren’t this”</p> </blockquote> <p>While these reviews make some sense–people are mad about the price increase and are lashing out at being given a bad shovelware game right in the wake of it–I can’t as easily explain why there are also so many horny reviews for this updated Grinch platformer. Seriously, what the heck is going on? Here’s just some of what I found. Be warned, a lot of this is NSFW. Oh, and the first two reviews below are the very first two reviews you’ll see on Xbox and the website as of this story’s publication. Merry Christmas, kids!</p> <hr> <blockquote> <p>“Grinch took my v card. He sat me down and bounced that grussy on it.”</p> <p>“My Parents Love the Grinch. My parents had a little too much egg nog and stayed up ALL night with Mr. Grinch. They said his heart grew 3 sizes! I woke up once and heard my mom yelling, ‘You’re a mean one, you’re a mean one!’ They must’ve had a good time, though, because I’ve never seen my parents smile so much!”</p> <p>“The Grinch. The Grinch assaulted me in a bad area…”</p> <p>“GOATED. Watched this green ahh hunk o’ junk bounce that mcboy grus ALL OVER max’s red rocket. Best 30 a month”</p> <p>“Grinch grew 3 sizes alright. 3 sizes in my Christmas stocking stuffer if you know what im sayin 10/10 would Grinch again”</p> <p>“Horny. He made me wet”</p> <p>“I stole lakes v card. The Grinch stole Lake v card”</p> <p>“This game gave me hard b0ner. The Grinch turned me on”</p> <p>“Something in my pants keeps moving. While I was playing as the Grinch, a snake kept growing in my pants. I decided to put it in my mouth and it tastes like BBC!”</p></blockquote> <p>Anyway, I’m not sure what else to add to all of this. I guess this is what I get for reading the user reviews on a Grinch Xbox game. My bad, everyone.</p>

              <p>Running out of space as a creator or gamer is never ideal; it kills your momentum and affects your productivity. An easy way to make sure that never happens is to invest in a high-capacity, high-speed memory card. Right now, Amazon is offering a solid deal on one of the best in the category.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/">The Samsung Pro Plus 1TB microSD memory card plus adapter is down to $75, which is 38% off its regular price</a>. You’re saving $45 on a solution that fixes your storage problems for the long term, but the deal won’t be around for long. We suggest acting fast to grab it for less while you can.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Storage Paired With Impressive Speeds</h2>
<p>1TB capacity is more than enough to house tons of high-resolution media content, games, important documents, programs, and so much more. You get read speeds up to 180MB/s and write speeds up to 130MB/s when used with compatible Samsung readers, meaning you won’t have to deal with frustrating wait times or an overall slow performance. If you’re using it with a GoPro or drone, these translate into smooth 4K UHD video capture and quicker burst shots. Even better, it is UHS-I, U3, V30, and A2 rated, so you can also run apps directly from the card on Android devices.</p>
<p>The included SD card plays nicely with your computer, handheld gaming console, tablet, drone, etc. Basically, if your device has a microSD or SD card slot, you’re good to go. Just note that this version isn’t compatible with the latest Nintendo Switch 2 yet.</p>



<p>The card is also built to last. It’s water, temperature, X-ray, magnet, drop, and wearout proof, so everyday wear and tear won’t affect the performance. It can handle a few splashes and drops without throwing a fit, which makes it great to take with you on the go.</p>
<p>In short, if you’re a creative, work professional, or just someone whose storage needs are growing and want a solution that won’t give up on you this is a smart pickup. The Samsung Pro Plus 1TB microSD offers the right mix of speed, performance, and space. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/">You really won’t have to deal with that “storage full” message for a while. It is now down to $75, after a whopping $45 discount.</a> We don’t see it go for less than $100 often, so this is definitely a rare sight. Just be sure to grab it for less while you can.</p>
