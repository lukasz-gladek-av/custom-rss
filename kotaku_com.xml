For now, Romero Games is seeking a new publisher to bring its game past the finish line. According to the statement, “several” publishers have reached out to the company about seeing the game through, and the team is “evaluating” its options. So while nothing’s set in stone, it does seem like there’s a chance that some interested party or parties will help salvage the game after Microsoft pulled out of the deal. (The statement itself says it cannot name the publisher due to “confidentiality agreements,” but members of the studio have already stated publicly that they were caught up in the layoffs at Microsoft.)</p><p>Hopefully, whatever Romero Games is working on sees the light of day.

No reason was given for why that didn’t work out. Cleveland, who directed the first game, has now broken his silence, shedding some potential light on a power struggle facing one of 2025's most-anticipated PC releases. </p><p>“We know that the game is ready for early access release and we know you’re ready to play it,” he wrote on Reddit on Monday. “And while we thought this was going to be our decision to make, at least for now, that decision is in Krafton’s hands. And after all these years, to find that I’m no longer able to work at the company I started stings.” </p><p>According to Cleveland, the sudden upheaval came as a shock. The underwater survival exploration sim was set to come to Steam Early Access at some point later this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-krafton-early-access-fired-1851785479&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-krafton-early-access-fired-1851785479">but as we reported last week</a></span> the cryptic press release from Krafton suggested that might no longer be the case. It alluded to quality controls and a milestone process needed to ensure the game meets player expectations. </p><p>“As part of its oversight, Krafton is committed to achieving regular milestones to assess progress across its creative studios,” the publisher wrote. “These reviews, based on clearly defined metrics and targets, will help ensure that games meet both creative and quality standards. This process is essential to delivering the right game at the right time. Unknown Worlds’ new leadership fully supports this process and is committed to meeting player expectations.”<br></p><p>Reading between the lines of Cleveland’s Reddit post, it sounds like there was a fundamental disagreement over whether to ship sooner and get<em> Subnautica 2</em> into players’ hands for feedback, or wait  potentially until 2026 to make the game playable to the public. Cleveland and the others sold Unknown Worlds to Krafton in 2021, at which time the publisher <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-inc-to-acquire-unknown-worlds-the-developers-behind-subnautica-and-natural-selection/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-inc-to-acquire-unknown-worlds-the-developers-behind-subnautica-and-natural-selection/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">claimed it would</a></span> continue to “function as an independent game development studio.” I guess in 2025 that means independently of the co-founders.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-unknown-worlds-krafton-early-access-1851785764]]></content:encoded>

That led to dinosaurs being brought to the mainland, off their island habitat, and eventually spreading around the world. It was a cool idea that <em>Jurassic World Dominion,</em> the last film in the franchise, never did much with. Dinosaurs spreading around the world is a bonkers idea that could provide you with endless storylines, scenarios, and moments to build movies and TV shows around. That could power 20 years of storytelling. </p><h2 id="h6770"><a id=""></a>Rebooting <em>Jurassic Park</em></h2><p>Sadly, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-world-4-rebirth-trailer-screenshots-2025-1851636033&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-world-4-rebirth-trailer-screenshots-2025-1851636033"><em>Rebirth</em></a></span><em> </em>tosses that all out the window, reminding viewers four separate times in the opening half hour that dinosaurs can’t survive on modern Earth and most of them are now dead. The survivors can be found on some islands dotted around the equator, but that’s it. </p><p>We do get one scene <em>very </em>early into <em>Rebirth </em>that features a big brontosaurus stuck in New York City, covered in graffiti and trash and causing a traffic jam. The movie then swiftly moves on, but not before reminding you one more time that they are all dead and this big dinosaur is probably the last one in North America. </p><p>So, after essentially retconning the end of the<em> Jurassic World</em> trilogy, what does <em>Rebirth </em>do? It fires up a plot that has nothing to do with the rest of the world and takes place on an island. So why the retcon? Your guess is as good as mine! </p><p>Anyway, <em>Rebirth’s </em>plot involves mercenaries (led by Scarlett Johansson) heading to a top-secret island where dinosaur experiments happened, so they can grab some prehistoric blood samples from massive beasts for a rich pharmaceutical company that wants to make a new heart disease medication that will bring in trillions of dollars. </p><h2 id="h6771"><a id=""></a>Prehistoric questing</h2><p>This half of the movie is where a lot of the dinosaur action happens, and director Gareth Edwards knows how to put together intense, action-packed prehistoric setpieces. One sequence involving large flying dinosaurs and a giant rock cliff is a standout moment. But whenever there aren’t dinos on screen, the mercs’ plotline feels like a boring video game fetch quest.</p><p>Get three DNA samples from these big creatures, each in a different biome, and bring them back to get your reward. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-jurassic-world-rebirth-movies-ranked-1851776876&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-park-jurassic-world-rebirth-movies-ranked-1851776876">Most of them are killed off</a></span> before you can care, and the one death that does leave an impact is undone to provide a nice, happy ending, though fans of corporate assholes getting their comeuppance will be satisfied by one late kill in the movie. </p><p>The other half of <em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em> involves a small family: A dad, his young daughter, his older daughter who leaves for college soon, and her lazy boyfriend. It’s here that<em> Rebirth</em> really shines, as the family members actually have character arcs and change as the movie goes on. The film’s script, while filled with some dumb moments, does a great job of fleshing the family out and making you care about them. When they were in danger,  I was sitting upright and hoping they’d all make it out alive. </p><h2 id="h6772"><a id=""></a>A mutated, hybrid narrative</h2><p>These two halves of the movie barely interact with each other. The family and mercs crash into each other at the start, but then spend 60 percent of the runtime separated, their paths only merging in the last 25 minutes or so.</p><p>This is when <em>Rebirth’s </em>mutant hybrid dinosaurs become a big threat to the family and the mercenaries. Sadly, because they are featured in the film so briefly, neither the raptor-like Mutadon nor the massive mutated T-Rex, known as a D-Rex, makes much of an impact. Their designs are strange and disturbing, but unlike <em>Jurassic World’</em>s now-iconic Indominus Rex, which played a huge part in that film, neither of these mutants is going on my list of favorite movie monsters. </p><p>As <em>Rebirth </em>wrapped up, and the familiar<em> Jurassic Park</em> music played over the survivors leaving dino island, I felt conflicted. I’m always down for dinosaurs, and the CG beasts in <em>Rebirth </em>are the best-looking in the franchise. And damn scary, too. But <em>Rebirth’s </em>two plotlines don’t come together well, and so I ended up hating one half of the movie  for getting in the way of the other. </p><p>The end result is, ironically, a strange, mutated hybrid of a movie that is mostly enjoyable if you don’t think too hard about what’s happening on screen. In other words, it’s another <em>Jurassic Park</em> sequel. Better than some, worse than others, and nowhere near as good as Spielberg’s original classic. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-is-it-good-reboot-jp-film-1851785757]]></content:encoded>

That cultural ubiquity is exactly why Gunn <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/james-gunn-interview-superman-film-2025-david-corenswet-dhb3bw3rp&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/james-gunn-interview-superman-film-2025-david-corenswet-dhb3bw3rp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>The Times</em></a></span> he has no interest in movies wasting time telling a story we’ve all known for decades.</p><p>“I don’t need to see pearls in a back alley when Batman’s parents are killed. I don’t need to see the radioactive spider biting Spider-Man. And I don’t need to see baby Kal coming from Krypton in a little baby rocket. We have watched a million movies with characters who don’t have their upbringing explained, like when we see <em>Good Night, and Good Luck</em>—we don’t need to know the early life of Edward R. Murrow to explain how he became a journalist. Who cares?”</p><p>That’s a good question: Who cares? The central purpose those origin stories serve is to connect us with the heroes on a human level. Most of us don’t have more money than God or a Batcave nicer than most homes, but we all know losing our parents could emotionally damage us forever. Yet with the success of grounded superhero movies like Matt Reeves’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-batman-part-2-sequel-delayed-2026-2027-dc-reeves-1851729434&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-batman-part-2-sequel-delayed-2026-2027-dc-reeves-1851729434"><em>The Batman</em></a></span>, we’re now seeing more films take a similar approach, relying heavily on exploring their heroes as people as they seek to deconstruct these legendary characters. We don’t need to see his parents’ murder early in the film to grasp the nature of his internal torment later on. He’s a broken man throughout the film for numerous reasons and is only held together by a dutiful compulsion to prevent crime.</p><p>From defending his upcoming Superman movie’s political slant to deriding critics who think his choice for the Man of Steel is a “pussy,” Gunn didn’t hold back in his<em> Times</em> interview. And hopefully, he keeps disrupting the superhero industrial complex known as Hollywood for years to come. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/james-gunn-spider-man-batman-superman-dcu-1851785756]]></content:encoded>

Most of us here at <em>Kotaku </em>own the thing and have been playing it over the past four weeks. Now that we’ve had extensive time with the Switch 2, what do we think about it? How has Nintendo’s follow-up to one of the most revolutionary video game consoles of all time turned out? We gathered everyone on staff with a Switch 2 and asked them to weigh in on a few topics.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0baa1469b490b61470f1c432195fc892" data-recommend-id="image://0baa1469b490b61470f1c432195fc892" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luigi drifting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luigi drifting." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0baa1469b490b61470f1c432195fc892" data-recommend-id="image://0baa1469b490b61470f1c432195fc892" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luigi drifting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Like most folks, the Switch 2 game I’ve put the most time into is <em>Mario Kart World</em>, though not as much time as you might think. A lot of my time with the Switch 2’s launch line-up has also involved booting up <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, being like, “Oh wow, this works pretty well,” then closing it out. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on a handheld is the kind of sicko shit that should have me glued to my Switch 2, but once the novelty wears off, I remember I’ve played it fairly recently and it can’t maintain my attention for that long. Funnily enough, the game I’ve spent the most time playing on my Switch 2 is a Vita game from 2015. Shout-out to <em>Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth</em>. It’s a bit telling that Switch 2 games aren’t really what I’m playing on my system. While it’s certainly not set up to fail in the same way, the launch line-up of mostly older games that put the system’s jump in power front and center is giving Wii U. These games are great, they run well, and it’s nice to have them on something I can play on a plane. But I’m waiting for <em>Donkey Kong </em>and the Switch 2 version of <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p><p><em>Mario Kart World </em>is really, really good! It’s a blast to play with friends or by yourself. It looks sharp, performs perfectly, and even includes a nifty open world that’s fun to explore. And uh, well, ummm, I guess there were some other games, too. But nearly every game available on Switch 2 at launch was something I’ve played or could play on another, more powerful platform. Yes,<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> looks nice on a Switch 2, but I’ve got it on PC. And Xbox Series X. I think when the dust settles and we look back on the Switch 2’s launch, it will be clear that it’s one of the weakest debut line-ups in Nintendo history. -<strong>Zack Zwiezen</strong></p><p>The launch lineup always felt weak, but a month with the new hardware has made that fact inescapable. My<em> Mario Kart World </em>excitement (and that of my kids) petered out after the first couple of weeks. I think <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Hitman: World of Assassination</em> both run decently—much better than PS4/Xbox One games did on the Switch 1. <em>Street Fighter 6</em> plays well on the Switch 2 as well. It’s far from ideal-looking, but I hope many more people now experience last year’s excellent <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> thanks to the Switch 2 port. But between Game Pass (<em>Rematch</em>/<em>The Alters</em>) and <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign </em>and<em> Death Stranding 2</em> on PS5, I’ve barely touched the new console this last week. Does<em> Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom </em>look better than ever? It sure does, but I already played over 100 hours of it on Switch 1. — <strong>Ethan Gach</strong></p><p>Though I bought <em>Street Fighter 6 </em>for my Switch 2 and am still looking forward to playing through its RPG-lite story mode, World Tour, at some point, the two games in heaviest rotation on my Switch 2 have definitely been <em>Mario Kart World </em>and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. <em>MKW </em>is a delight. Every time I fire it up and see Mario or Wario or Wiggler or some other character tooling around in that bright, inviting landscape, I just feel good, ready to hit the open road. Still, now that I’ve gotten gold in most of the game’s single-player cups and knockout tours, I’m not playing it as regularly as I did initially. I do still enjoy jumping in sometimes to try to defeat another Nintendo-provided ghost racer in a time trial or to tackle a few more P-Switch challenges, though. And I’m always down to hop into online action with friends, where the game really shines.</p><p>But, oddly, it’s not a Nintendo game that’s keeping me most occupied with my new Nintendo console—which definitely makes this a departure from a typical Nintendo launch for me. Instead, it’s <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. I have my issues with this game but it plays great on Nintendo’s handheld hybrid, and I love smoothly shifting from a Night City session on my TV to a bit of gameplay in bed. As much as I’m in awe of the port, though, which indicates to me that the Switch is capable of some very impressive things, it is odd and arguably not great that the strongest thing available out of the gate on the Switch 2, for me at least, is a game that’s several years old and available on numerous other platforms. Of course, it’s early days yet, and <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>is just a few weeks away. But I hope Nintendo has a few other surprises up its sleeve to give these first few post-launch months a little more oomph. — <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong></p><p>There were launch games? I don’t think I can count five-year-old ports in that category, so we’re pretty much left with <em>Mario Kart</em>, and…ehh. It’s quite something when adding an entire open world still leaves the game feeling far too much like other recent entries, and as such, it has made the Switch 2 itself feel so utterly unessential on launch. That’s the word I keep coming back to, when friends ask if it’s worth buying one for themselves or their kids. Honestly, right now, it’s just inessential. I really hope that will change once <em>DK</em> is out. — <strong>John Walker</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fb493a3f5158cef82e3505901f3b5553" data-recommend-id="image://fb493a3f5158cef82e3505901f3b5553" data-format="jpg" data-width="2397" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Switch 2 with the Joy-Cons detached." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Switch 2 with the Joy-Cons detached." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fb493a3f5158cef82e3505901f3b5553" data-recommend-id="image://fb493a3f5158cef82e3505901f3b5553" data-format="jpg" data-width="2397" data-height="1350" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Switch 2 with the Joy-Cons detached." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Switch 2 feels hefty, but also, maybe <em>too</em> hefty. The original Switch felt mostly fine, but its Joy-Cons were about as sturdy as a children’s toy. Switch 2’s controllers feel expensive and premium, and the bigger screen does feel like a pretty sizable upgrade from the Switch. The downside is that the Switch 2 is heavy enough to give me wrist pain when I’m holding it for too long. As such, I try to play mine in tabletop mode as much as possible when I’m in bed, and the Joy-Cons are the perfect controllers for a side sleeper who sets the Switch 2 up on its kickstand next to his pillow. The Switch 2 feels like a high-end device, but it comes with drawbacks to my wrists. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p><p>The Switch 2 looks great and feels even better, at least relative to the Switch 1. I don’t like that the back panel still flexes and feels hollow, and the Joy-Con are still a bit too wobbly for my taste. I wish there were some great third-party portable-mode alternatives for the Joy-Con right now, but because of the magnetic locks it seems like Hori and others will need a minute to develop the Switch 2 versions of their Switch 1 controllers. Also the screen blur feels like I’m drunk. Just kidding, I actually can’t tell at all. Despite the technical tests revealing staggeringly slow refresh speeds for the Switch 2, I’ve had zero complaints so far. I love that the screen is edged this time too, instead of the rounded surfaces of the original. — <strong>Ethan Gach</strong></p><p>I’m no <em>Digital Foundry</em> so my understanding of what’s actually inside the new box is limited, but it sure <em>feels</em> better. It’s a joy to play <em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em> and not have to wait for the doors to open after shooting them. As for the Switch itself, it feels very solid, the kickstand feels sturdy, and there’s nothing cheap or tacky about it. But, like its only launch game, it certainly suffers from looking and feeling far too much like what we already had. — <strong>John Walker</strong></p><p>I’m not the type to scrutinize my device’s screen for faults or to measure frame rate on one platform against another, so I’m not really the person to ask serious questions about hardware quality. I can say that I have no complaints; the device has a sturdy heft to it, the screen is—to my eyes—bright and captivating, and the Switch 2 Pro Controller feels like a natural extension of my hands. — <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong></p><p>The OG Switch felt like a cheap toy in my big, dumb hands. In less than a week, the kickstand on my Switch broke, and it flapped open when I tried to hold it as a handheld. One of my Joy-Cons succumbed to stick drift and had to be taken out back. It never completely failed on me, and it was always charged and ready for me to play it. But using the Switch was a disappointing experience for me.</p><p>Switch 2, on the other hand, is wonderful. It feels like a high-end tech device, which is nice considering its daunting price tag. The kickstand is strong. The Joy-Con feel better. Everything feels better. The screen is also bigger. The whole unit just sits more comfortably in my massive, chunky hands. And that’s all I wanted. -<strong>ZZ</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5c1fe1e7bc6256b6c00c2c1f7f41e8dd" data-recommend-id="image://5c1fe1e7bc6256b6c00c2c1f7f41e8dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Switch 2's main menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Switch 2's main menu." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5c1fe1e7bc6256b6c00c2c1f7f41e8dd" data-recommend-id="image://5c1fe1e7bc6256b6c00c2c1f7f41e8dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Switch 2's main menu." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Switch 2’s user interface and home screen are essentially carbon copies of the OG Switch. Some are disappointed by this, but I like it. For so long, consoles have tried to reinvent the wheel with each new release. And so each new console generation brings fresh menus that have to be updated and improved, as they often lack key features and options found in the old UI. But with the Switch 2, Nintendo took a page from Xbox and just copied the old UI, improved it in some small ways, and called it a day. Would I like some new themes? Sure. For now, though, the UI and menus work perfectly, and I didn’t need to relearn everything. That was nice. -<strong>ZZ</strong></p><p>I guess you don’t have to fix what isn’t broken, but it was kind of funny to boot up the Switch 2 and see its menus look exactly like those of the first system. This is pretty standard fare for tech these days. You boot up an old iPhone, and its screen looks pretty similar to a brand-new one. However, this doesn’t happen as much with game systems. The UI of most video game consoles looks noticeably different from that of its ancestors. Though the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S kept visual elements from their predecessors, they weren’t carbon copies of the last generation. The Switch 2’s menus are faster and snappier, but if you put a gun to my head and showed me both screens side-by-side, I’m not sure I’d be able to differentiate between the two. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p><p>It’s fine? Hardly anything is different. The responsive eShop is nice but I’m betting performance on that does not hold up even by the end of the first year. And there’s still so much negative space in the home menu and no way to customize it. Sigh — <strong>Ethan Gach</strong></p><p>I genuinely found the Switch 2’s UI to be profoundly disappointing. Psychically upsetting, even. There’s always that horrible moment after you’ve bought a new phone, spent all that money to buy a slightly improved rectangle, then transferred across all your stuff to realize it now just looks like the phone you already had. That was exactly my experience with the Switch 2. I did the data transfers as instructed on first booting, and then had this gut-punch moment when I looked down and saw…my old Switch. Same games, in the same order, in the same layout, with the same poorly labeled on-screen buttons. For god’s sake, they could at least have given it a punch-up, just <em>something</em> new. — <strong>John Walker</strong></p><p>Nintendo knows how to be subtly charming, using cute little blips and blops to lend a sense of laid-back fun to UIs that prioritize simplicity, elegance, and ease of use. The Switch 2’s are basically a redux of the original Switch’s in this regard, and why not? That all worked fine. (Well, the eShop certainly didn’t, and it’s great to see it running so much more smoothly and quickly here, but the basic design worked fine, and that’s largely unchanged.) I do hope Nintendo gives us more options for themes at some point, as I’d love to finally have a home screen on my Switch that boasts more personality. But I’m not disappointed with what’s here, even if it does feel like a bit of a missed opportunity to drive home the feeling that you’re using a new, more powerful device than the one you’ve been using for the past eight years. — <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="aa7a4dba172d452b3bf43437ff553648" data-recommend-id="image://aa7a4dba172d452b3bf43437ff553648" data-format="jpg" data-width="1596" data-height="896" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A bunch of people playing Mario Kart with cameras on." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A bunch of people playing Mario Kart with cameras on." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aa7a4dba172d452b3bf43437ff553648" data-recommend-id="image://aa7a4dba172d452b3bf43437ff553648" data-format="jpg" data-width="1596" data-height="896" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A bunch of people playing Mario Kart with cameras on." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Switch 2’s online features fall into the same trap as my PlayStation 5’s do, in that it’s so much simpler to connect with people on external apps, I don’t use the ones built into the system. The C button opens up GameChat, but it’s not as convenient as hopping on a Discord call and using better mics and cameras. It’s funny watching your friend’s camera shake when you hit them with a Blue Shell in <em>Mario Kart World</em>, but I can’t see myself using any of these internal systems when I’ve grown so accustomed to better, easier services to keep in contact with friends, regardless of if they’re playing a Switch 2 game with me. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p><p>Once, while I was playing <em>Mario Kart World </em>with Zack and his wife Sarah, I hit him with a red shell as he sped past me. Not only did this make his kart spin out; it also made the live feed of his face, which was hovering above his kart thanks to the webcam he hooked up, spin around as well. What more could you want in a new console’s online features? GameChat owns, and I look forward to using it a lot more in the months and years to come. — <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong></p><p>Here’s something I never expected: To be impressed with a Nintendo console’s online features. The real star of the show is GameChat, which at first glance looked like a crappy Discord knock-off. And to be fair, it kind of is, but it also works brilliantly. I was able to play <em>Mario Kart</em> with my wife and I, sharing a TV, and two other people online. And it just worked.</p><p>We could chat to them and they could talk to us with no headset needed. I could even see their gameplay via the share screen feature. Their faces even appeared in the game thanks to the Switch 2’s webcam support. As someone who doesn’t use Discord much, having all this built into the console is nice and makes playing games online with our buddies so much more communal and friendly. -<strong>ZZ</strong></p><p>I honestly don’t know. I’ve only ever hit the C button by mistake, as the last thing I want is other people interfering when I’m trying to play video games. I guess I’m glad the device can run its own god-awful store software this time, though? — <strong>John Walker</strong></p><p>I tested out the GameChat and video share features and found them to be somewhere between barebones and a fun novelty. Quality aside, simply using the system still isn’t as easy or intuitive as what’s on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, and nothing beats Discord for cross-platform hangs (at least for now). Until Nintendo does something really creative with it, it feels like a function I’ll barely use because that’s not what I play on my Switch 2 for. —<strong> Ethan Gach</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="027ba490f5b0ba39e4773858cdb30cd4" data-recommend-id="image://027ba490f5b0ba39e4773858cdb30cd4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1498" data-height="838" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A group of Switch 2s arranged in a circle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A group of Switch 2s arranged in a circle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="027ba490f5b0ba39e4773858cdb30cd4" data-recommend-id="image://027ba490f5b0ba39e4773858cdb30cd4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1498" data-height="838" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A group of Switch 2s arranged in a circle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I like my Switch 2, but it has mostly slipped comfortably into the same space in my life as the original Switch did. Sure, it’s a better One of Those, but that’s all it feels like right now. Without a big gimmick or game-changing shift, it’s the same thing with a bigger screen and heavier Joy-Con. I’m glad I got it, though. I was willing to pay half a grand for a device that would likely play <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> with fewer framerate dips and that would give me a new way to play <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. I’m playing the thing pretty consistently, but I forget that it’s a shiny new thing most of the time. It is the most “phone upgrade” console leap I’ve felt in years. It’s a better-running Switch, for good and for ill. — <strong>Kenneth Shepard</strong></p><p>Incredibly mid! I think I’m more down on the Switch 2 than most, but it’s been a pretty underwhelming first month for me. After the initial dopamine hit of a new Nintendo handheld wore off I was left with a device that is markedly better but doesn’t have anything for me to really dig into yet. Hopefully, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> turns that around. There’s certainly plenty of other Nintendo games coming out this year. But right now it feels more like I just went from the DS Lite to the DSi XL. The Switch 2 is nice to have but hard to justify. I look forward to singing its unqualified praises in a year, or when the OLED model inevitably arrives in 2028. — <strong>Ethan Gach</strong></p><p>One month in, I’d describe myself as tentatively very happy with my Nintendo Switch 2. It feels like a device that’s bursting with the potential to deliver terrific online experiences and absorbing single-player ones. <em>Mario Kart World</em>, with its support for up to 24 racers at once, and <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, with its wonderfully destructible environments, suggest that Nintendo is trying to demonstrate, right out of the gate, what sets the Switch 2 apart from its predecessor. But its future beyond <em>Bananza</em>’s release also feels pretty ill-defined at the moment, and whether or not it will continue to get the support it needs in order to make this first year a strong one remains an open question. Hopefully we’ll get a Direct this month to fill us in on what we can look forward to in the near future, and I can go from being tentatively pleased with my purchase to simply pleased. — <strong>Carolyn Petit</strong></p><p>I’ve already forgotten I own a Switch 2. It has become the new Switch and quickly has evolved into “my Nintendo console behind the TV.” In some ways, that might sound bad. I spent a lot of money on a device that has already disappeared into the background. Yet I see it as a positive. It shows that Nintendo succeeded at making a new console that was basically like your old one, but bigger, faster, and better in most ways. You don’t have to teach your kids how it works, buy new accessories for it, or rearrange your living room to make it work. It’s just a Switch, but nicer.</p><p>That does mean the Switch 2 isn’t a revolutionary device that will change how you play games. Instead, it will slot right into your daily gaming schedule, and the only time you’ll remember you upgraded is when you boot up something like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and go “Oh right, the old Switch couldn’t do this.” Mission accomplished, Nintendo. –<strong>ZZ</strong></p><p>I’m happier than the tone of my entries here would suggest. These headings just happen to highlight my areas of frustration. As a gaming device, I’m really pleased with it, albeit through a grey lens of annoyance given that my happiness is mostly because of improvements to things the original Switch was crap at. I wish Nintendo had been more imaginative here, even though sales have demonstrated that the company certainly <em>financially</em> made the right choices. I wish it were weirder, and I desperately wish Nintendo were not so hubristic as to have launched it with almost nothing new to play. But they’ve already sold over 5 million of them, so I doubt they’re looking for my advice on matters. — <strong>John Walker</strong></p></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-impressions-launch-games-comparison-1851785748]]></content:encoded>

That said, shoutout to the current 5th place record holder for using Wiggler.</p><hr><h2 id="h6816"><a id="2"></a>Flower Cup</h2><p><strong>Desert Hills: Bowser</strong>’s super heavy stats dominate here. The Reel Racer will help you contend with the sandy terrain.</p><p><strong>Shy Guy Bazaar: </strong>Lightweights reign supreme through these winding tight corridors, with most record holders opting for <strong>Baby Mario</strong>. The Baby Blooper kart is popular here.</p><p><strong>Wario Stadium: </strong>Another showcase for lightweight characters, with <strong>Baby Daisy </strong>being the popular pick here. That said, the Reel Racer is currently a popular pick here too.</p><p><strong>Airship Fortress: </strong>Not to sound like a broken record, but lightweight characters once again win out here. <strong>Baby Mario </strong>dominates on bikes like the Mach Rocket, though Goomba is a surprisingly competitive pick here too.</p><hr><h2 id="h6817"><a id="3"></a>Star Cup</h2><p><strong>DK Pass: </strong>Super lightweights once again reign supreme here, but interesting enough, the dominant character here is <strong>Para-Biddybud</strong>. Baby Daisy also works here, and bikes like the R.O.B H.O.G fare well on these snowy peaks.</p><p><strong>Starview Pea: </strong>It’s another peak, but a different optimal character. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bowser-jr-wario-waluigi-koopa-shy-boo-1851785552&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bowser-jr-wario-waluigi-koopa-shy-boo-1851785552"><strong>Bowser</strong></a></span><strong> </strong>on the Reel Racer occupies nearly every fastest time recorded here.</p><p><strong>Sky-High Sundae: Wario </strong>is your go-to if you’re doing laps around these treats.

More like King Koopa Troopa Beach, because <strong>Bowser </strong>holds all the fastest times here.

The current record holder uses <strong>Penguin </strong>atop the W-Twin Chopper bike, but Bowser, Mario, and even Birdo are all used in close runner-up rankings.</p><p><strong>Crown City: </strong>Yes, this is the second time Crown City has appeared in a cup.

Block Ruins: </strong>As you might expect from a track with so many tight corners, the super lightweights reign supreme.

Everywhere I go I see his face.</p><hr><h2 id="h6822"><a id="7"></a>Lightning Cup</h2><p><strong>Moo Moo Meadows: </strong>No fakeouts this time: <strong>Cow </strong>very appropriately is the top pick for Moo Moo Meadows.

They were nice side dishes but no grilled steak. Everyone appreciates a good potato salad or baked mac, but that’s not why they show up to the BBQ. It has been this way with Xbox for over a decade now. </p><p>There’s no shortage of great games but few are exclusive and none of them—not <em>Forza</em>, not <em>Halo</em>, not <em>Starfield</em>—have popped like the biggest exclusive blockbusters on PS5. Unable to conjure a killer app, it’s tried to buy them, starting with <em>Minecraft</em>, but the result is now that the most compelling parts of Microsoft’s portfolio are all available elsewhere.</p><p>If a family member, friend, or some stranger at GameStop asked me if they should get an Xbox, my answer would look like a spreadsheet full of if/then functions. The value proposition of Game Pass remains strong but increasingly mired in asterisks. Genre diversity abounds and there’s early console access to some of the biggest Steam hits around. There is something for everyone on Xbox if they know how, where, and when to look. My answer for whether to get a PS5 would be much simpler: <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>,<em> God of War Ragnarok</em>, <em>Spider-Man 2, </em>a dozen remasters of <em>The Last Of Us</em>. </p><p>These are not the types of games everyone buys a $500 machine for, but they are definitely the types of games a particular kind of person might buy a $500 machine for. The type of person who buys relatively few games—a yearly <em>Madden</em> update and the new <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>—but doesn’t really discriminate between genres and has no franchise loyalty. They want the big, cinematic blockbuster with a gameplay hook just meaty enough to be fun but not so complex it starts to feel like work.

A new <em>Fable</em>, first revealed before the Xbox Series X/S launched, remains a year out.</p><p>The Xbox 360 surged to prominence thanks in part to Bungie’s <em>Halo</em> and Epic Games’ <em>Gears of War</em>. Neither franchise has been the same under Microsoft’s in-house teams. That might be part of why the company keeps acquiring new ones rather than trying to build them itself. But the results have been just as uneven. “If that were the only reason for this wave of cancellations and layoffs, it would be a terrible shame, but a rational reality,” <em>Polygon</em>’s Oli Welsh <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/analysis/610779/microsoft-layoffs-perfect-dark-everwild-mismanagement&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/analysis/610779/microsoft-layoffs-perfect-dark-everwild-mismanagement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote last week</a></span>. “But the darker cloud hanging over the story is that Microsoft has—consistently and repeatedly, over decades—shown it has no aptitude for running the creative industry it just bought half of.”<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492">A year before he began laying off thousands of staff</a></span> across Xbox’s now-sprawling empire of studios and publishers, Phil Spencer suggested Xbox’s fate was set in stone. The Xbox One generation was too disastrous to recover from. Players were now locked in. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-phil-spencer-interview-starfield-ps5-console-war-1850404446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-phil-spencer-interview-starfield-ps5-console-war-1850404446">He called it “[the] worst generation to lose.”</a></span> That logic paved the way for Microsoft’s pivot away from hardware and toward becoming a third-party publishing platform hitched to subscription and cloud gaming. “There is no world where <em>Starfield </em>is an 11/10 and people start selling their PS5s,” he said in 2023.  “That’s not going to happen.” But <em>Starfield</em> wasn’t an 11/10 or even a 9/10, so we’ll never quite know. It was a convenient time for the quality of exclusives to stop mattering. </p><p>Having watched the Switch cruise to being the second best-selling console of all time purely on the back of first-party exclusives like<em> The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, and <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>, I’m not convinced that the games don’t matter. When Google shut down its first-party studios in 2021, the developers there asked their boss at the time, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fairgame-ps5-heist-shooter-haven-jade-raymond-delay-1851780961?_gl=1*1agp3y0*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTE5MDc4NzMkbzYyJGcxJHQxNzUxOTEyMjg2JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fairgame-ps5-heist-shooter-haven-jade-raymond-delay-1851780961?_gl=1*1agp3y0*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTE5MDc4NzMkbzYyJGcxJHQxNzUxOTEyMjg2JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..">Jade Raymond</a></span>, what that meant for the rest of Stadia, the company’s cloud gaming platform. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stadia-leadership-praised-development-studios-for-great-1846281384&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stadia-leadership-praised-development-studios-for-great-1846281384">According to sources present at the time</a></span>, she said something along the lines of “no gaming platform has ever succeed without strong first-party games.” If you build it, they might come. If you stop, they definitely won’t. </p><p>“I’m proud to introduce the creation of a brand new Microsoft studio, The Initiative, led by Darrell Gallagher, a visionary storyteller who has worked across some of the most iconic franchises for over 20 years,” Spencer said back at E3 2018. “This new Santa Monica studio is building a team of world-class talent to create groundbreaking new game experiences.” It was a play for GOTY blockbusters right in PlayStation’s first-party backyard. The Initiative would have “the resources, the platform, and the creative independence to take bigger risks and create  even bolder worlds.” Apparently the risks were too big and the worlds were taking too long. <br></p><p><em>Correction 7/7/2025 3:04 p.m.: </em>Psychonauts 2<em> came day-and-date to PS5 as well as Xbox Series X/S. </em></p><p><em>.</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732]]></content:encoded>

Go down to Course Selection and make sure it’s set to “Open.” This will let you choose every track and whether it connects to another one. Select a track and then select it again on the preceding list to make it a closed circuit race.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-outfits-mario-peach-luigi-yoshi-toad-1851785556&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-outfits-mario-peach-luigi-yoshi-toad-1851785556">Here’s Every <em>Mario </em>Hero Outfit You Can Collect In <em>Mario Kart World</em></a></span></p><p>You can play these with less consistency using the other Course Selection settings. Going with “Random” is true to the name. Sometimes this put me into a connecting race and sometimes it put me in the old-school type. “Connected” will give you free rein for the first track, but will limit the ensuing choices to three typically connecting races or a random button. Pressing the random button usually resulted in a separate closed-circuit race, although it would occasionally pick something that connected two tracks.</p><h2 id="h6812"><a id=""></a>How to play lap-based tracks online</h2><figure id="" data-id="d79e84aaf337aca6f3dafa9795d59db7" data-recommend-id="image://d79e84aaf337aca6f3dafa9795d59db7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An online track selection screen, with the random option highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An online track selection screen, with the random option highlighted." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d79e84aaf337aca6f3dafa9795d59db7" data-recommend-id="image://d79e84aaf337aca6f3dafa9795d59db7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An online track selection screen, with the random option highlighted." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Racing some closed laps against online opponents is also possible. The bad news is that doing so is more or less left to luck. After finishing a race, all the players will get to vote on what the next track will be. Everyone’s choices will be displayed on the screen’s perimeter as the game cycles through before picking one.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-npc-spike-swoop-dolphin-peepa-pianta-1851785560&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-npc-spike-swoop-dolphin-peepa-pianta-1851785560"><em>Mario Kart World</em> Has A Whole Bunch Of Extra Characters For You To Unlock</a></span></p><p>Just like VS mode and the “Connected” setting, the options are three tracks and the random button. I’ve only seen it offer one unconnected track at most among the listed choices. Picking Random in an online lobby <em>before</em> the recent update always resulted in a three-lap experience. After the update went live, picking Random now incorporates the chances of getting a connecting track from your current location. We don’t know what the odds are for anything, but most people are seeing the intermission tracks a lot more often.</p><p>I’m of the mindset that the function was likely bugged before. Choosing “Random” to limit the choices down to specifically closed-lap races doesn’t sound right when you think about it. This might be a case of something being fixed at the expense of being less fun. Then again, this game gives you vague settings labeled “Connected” and “Open” so who can say how the hell any of this is meant to work. <strong>For now, your safest bet for racing some simple laps online is to select an unconnected track whenever it’s a choice.</strong> If you don’t like the track or maybe don’t even get an unconnected option, go with random and pray for the best.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bowser-jr-wario-waluigi-koopa-shy-boo-1851785552&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-bowser-jr-wario-waluigi-koopa-shy-boo-1851785552">Here’s Every <em>Mario </em>Villain Outfit You Can Collect In <em>Mario Kart World</em></a></span></p><p>Here’s hoping that <em>Mario Kart World</em> is updated in the future to make this easier and not more difficult…again.
