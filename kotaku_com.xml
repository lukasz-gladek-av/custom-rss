              <p><span>For the first time in years, I had a full five-stack in </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>. Friends who had dropped Blizzard’s hero shooter years before and hadn’t given the game so much as a glance were finally back after the company </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-story-vendetta-cinematic-new-heroes-2000665327"><span>added five new heroes</span></a><span>, restructured its seasonal rollout to incorporate story, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-name-change-season-21-cinematic-spotlight-2000665046"><span>dropped that pesky </span><i><span>2</span></i></a> <span>from the title. They weren’t the only ones, either. </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2357570/charts/#1y"><span>reached a new all-time peak on Steam</span></a><span> last night with over 165,000 concurrent players logging in on the launcher. Not bad considering it was, at one point, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-overwatch-2-patch-notes-season-6-battle-pass-1850729064"><span>one of the lowest-reviewed games on the platform</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>That said, </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>is a multiplatform game, and a lot of PC players use Battle.net anyway, so that’s only a small slice of the people who flooded the servers yesterday. I actually had to wait in a queue for probably the first time since </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s launch in 2022. But once I got in, I immediately queued up as my longtime mains while everyone else was trying out the new heroes like a hydrogen bomb descending upon a coughing baby. I kid, mostly. I did put in a fair bit of time as Mizuki, the new support who throws his not-magic hat around the field to heal his teammates. Thankfully, the first night wasn’t </span><i><span>just </span></i><span>mirror matches of the five new heroes the whole time, as a lot of people just logged on to play as their main for a few matches.</span></p>

 <p><span>But in the midst of all those matches, my friends who had long been skeptics of </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s return in a post-PvE cancelation world were hootin’, hollerin’, and admitting that the game “might be good” again. To which I say, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-new-heroes-perks-stadium-returning-2000665736"><span>I told you so</span></a><span>. I’m glad to see so many people coming back and seeing how Blizzard managed to salvage a game after years of mismanagement and corporate sabotage.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Sure, we’re probably in a honeymoon phase. The new heroes have injected a bunch of chaos into the mix, and viral clips of ridiculous plays with the tether-sporting Jetpack Cat are spreading like wildfire. When the dust settles, we’ll probably talk about hero balance again, and Blizzard may rein in some of these antics, but it feels good to see </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>so reinvigorated all at once. This isn’t solely a result of the influx of new playable heroes, but also of the fact that Blizzard is pretty committed to its story integration. We’ve gotten what feel like weekly lore updates, and even gotten another audio drama starring Freja and newcomer Emre that is actually feeding into the internal push and pull between Vendetta and those who have been part of the terrorist organization Talon.</span></p>

 <p><span>Fans have been discovering new layers to characters’ relationships through both the lore drops and the new dialogue before matches. There’s a lot of interpersonal drama with actual momentum now, with characters talking to each other about the state of the world after Vendetta defeated Doomfist, and maps like Watchpoint Gibraltar and Colesseo changing things in the environment and layout as part of the current narrative.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Some of the best character stuff is, unsurprisingly given the theme of the season, coming from the characters who have defected from Talon. Sombra, Reaper, and Widowmaker are on the run after Vendetta’s hostile takeover, and dialogue implies that they’re all part of a tenuous partnership without the Talon banner uniting them.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">New Widowmaker and Sombra interaction!</p> <p>"Not like I didn't warn the boss, but hard to believe Vendetta is starting a war." <a href="https://t.co/i4O5BjkXqz">pic.twitter.com/i4O5BjkXqz</a></p> <p>— Shroomiiee (@mushroomiiee) <a href="https://twitter.com/mushroomiiee/status/2021456512238092617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>One of the most devastating subplots revealed in the game’s dialogue is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatchs-new-hero-is-sigma-an-astrophysicist-who-doe-1836605852"><span>Sigma’s</span></a><span>. The mad scientist character has been conspicuously absent from the season’s cinematic, comic, and audio dramas, but he is also a member of Talon. However, it sounds like Vendetta views him more as a danger to be held captive, and he misses his friend Sombra, who had to cut and run. If Sigma kills Sombra in a match, he utters a devastated </span><a href="https://x.com/UniwatchOW/status/2021460992421658892"><span>“But I still need you,”</span></a><span> or solemnly wonders where his friend has gone. That shit hurts real good. The </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>website has updated several of its heroes’ story blurbs and </span><a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/heroes/sombra/"><span>confirms that Sombra is “keeping a careful eye” on Talon</span></a><span> while Sigma is imprisoned, so maybe a jailbreak is in order later down the season?</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">So remember how Sigma kinda got no mentions during the setup for this new season besides a new lore blurb today? Turns out…he is not happy <a href="https://twitter.com/OW2voicelines?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@OW2voicelines</a> </p> <p>RELEASE MY GOAT! RELEASE HIM <a href="https://t.co/iJB0hhFz5C">pic.twitter.com/iJB0hhFz5C</a></p> <p>— Jetpack Uniwatch (@UniwatchOW) <a href="https://twitter.com/UniwatchOW/status/2021413869986644446?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>It’s not all angst, though. The slew of new hero interactions is giving fans a lot to work with in terms of understanding new, budding relationships. Where once </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>said shipping </span><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/overwatch/overwatch-shipping"><span>wasn’t a priority</span></a><span> in its worldbuilding, there are a bunch of characters with romantic tension in 2026, and that rocks, actually. Lifeweaver and Baptiste feel like they blazed a trail for heroes </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-ptr-lifeweaver-season-4-baptiste-new-hero-1850300708"><span>to start flirting</span></a><span> in pre-matches, and now that the story actually has momentum, maybe ships like Wuyang and Juno or Kiriko and Mizuki can go somewhere. We’re already getting a lot of Freja and Emre, who seem to be canonically ex-lovers, so let’s spread the love, Blizzard. Except for Soldier: 76, who will </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-pride-month-parade-soldier-76-vincent-skin-1851785385"><span>likely remain a yearner</span></a><span>.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">BYE MILKYWAVE IS REAL, I TOLLDDD U BRUH I TOLLDD UUUU <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/milkywave?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#milkywave</a> <a href="https://t.co/DTF7gppUNV">pic.twitter.com/DTF7gppUNV</a></p> <p>— korti 🍪 (@PPYCH0W) <a href="https://twitter.com/PPYCH0W/status/2021391556033294756?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>    <p><span>Overall, it’s kind of wild to feel like there’s reason to hope for </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> again. The PvE campaign didn’t pan out, but the game we have feels more focused and dedicated to delivering a story with momentum, an ever-evolving competitive game with new heroes shaking things up every season, and in-game events to keep people showing up all year. It feels like we’re back in 2016 when the possibilities seemed endless. Here’s hoping Blizzard makes the most of this fresh start.</span></p>

              <p>Poor&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em>, after having a pretty smooth run from launch until the end of 2025, has since started springing leaks faster than developers Embark Studios can plug them up. After <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-permanent-bans-cheaters-stream-sniping-2000660615">cheating scandals</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-dup-glitch-hotfix-patch-1-15-2000667320">item-duplication glitches</a> that have been pissing off its player base, it now seems the latest update has introduced both a weapon-repairing glitch and a way to make infinite ammo. And worse, they’re both incredibly easy to pull off.</p> <p>Usually when we see reports of a new way of glitching something in an online game, it turns out to be an action so complicated that only the most elite and dedicated players would ever even try. Unfortunately, that’s very much not the case in the latest issues to plague the excellent extraction shooter. It’s as simple and clicking back and forth in your inventory, then dropping and picking up weapons. And that means everyone’ll be doing it.</p>

 <p>Brought to wide attention by X user @genos, both the weapon-fixing and ammo-generating glitches use much the same technique. If you have a couple of worn weapons and want them repaired, all you need to do is rapidly switch them between your two weapon slots and for some reason their numbers start to climb. To make this stick, you then need to drop the weapon on the floor and pick it up again.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">NEW REPAIR GLITCH IN ARC RAIDERS. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ArcRaiders?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ArcRaiders</a> <a href="https://t.co/GCKXkAXL3K">pic.twitter.com/GCKXkAXL3K</a></p> <p>— perc (@genos) <a href="https://twitter.com/genos/status/2021383166955786342?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Weapons wear down in&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em> in order to prevent players from being able to overly rely on a particularly expensive, particularly powerful choice, which would reduce the sense of danger when on a raid. It’s a crucial part of the game’s already shaky balance, as much as it might annoy a player in the moment. As such, being able to fix up the most costly, most dangerous guns means people are able to become significantly overpowered, stepping over systems designed to keep things in check.</p>

 <p>This is then made worse by the accompanying glitch, where those constantly top-notch weapons also need never run out of bullets to fire. Again, the top-tier arms have very scarce, expensive ammo, designed to restrict use and prevent domination. But by swapping weapons over, not only do they get repaired, but they’ll also fill an ammo slot. Do this, drop the weapon, pick it up, unload it, drop the ammo and pick that up again, and it’s yours to keep. And yes, this is much more cumbersome, and hardly useful for a rapid-fire automatic weapon, but when it comes to something like a Hullcracker with its super-rare explosive projectiles, it’s a huge issue. And it gets far worse.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">JUST FOUND NEW MONEY GLITCH FOR AMMO LOL <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ArcRaiders?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ArcRaiders</a> <a href="https://t.co/r4t5oYin41">pic.twitter.com/r4t5oYin41</a></p> <p>— perc (@genos) <a href="https://twitter.com/genos/status/2021399834125836455?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It turns out if you use the swapping trick on guns like the Anvil and the Venator, you end up with 102 bullets loaded in guns that are supposed to only hold six and 22 bullets respectively. You can also get the 35-bullet rapid-firing Bobcat to load itself with 102 rounds, which is wildly OP. In a shoot-out, this is obviously a massive advantage, and unlike the ammo-duping glitch above, it’s trivially easy to do. Given that, who&nbsp;<em>wouldn’t</em> load up with 102 bullets, even if they’re just trying to take on the machines?</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">NAH THIS INFINITE AMMO GLITCH IS FUCKING BROKEN <a href="https://twitter.com/EmbarkStudios?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EmbarkStudios</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcRaiderAlerts?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ArcRaiderAlerts</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/THump?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@THump</a> <a href="https://t.co/IGgreMZXWE">pic.twitter.com/IGgreMZXWE</a></p> <p>— perc (@genos) <a href="https://twitter.com/genos/status/2021415495715651812?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Arc Raiders</em> doesn’t have anything like betwixt-player trading markets, so no one’s getting taken advantage of by these schemes, and as such there’s no internal economy that’s broken by such exploits. (There <em>is</em> unofficial trading in-game, where you can swap out items with people you encounter, and this can be exploited for ill gains, but it’s not going to cause major harm.) The issue is far more about an individual player’s progress being artificially boosted, with them able to sell ammo to in-game traders for extra cash, and especially for PVP players getting far better equipped when battling other people.</p>

 <p>I imagine we’ll see an emergency hotfix rolled out pretty sharpish, but in the meantime, perhaps focus on the freshly released <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/patch-notes-1-15-0">Shared Watch event</a> where players are encouraged to work together to fight the machines. And remember, the game’s matchmaking deliberately assigns you to games with players of a similar temperament, so if you’re PVP-averse, you’re far more likely to be put into lobbies with raiders of a similar nature.</p>
