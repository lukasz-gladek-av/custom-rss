Things appeared to die down for a bit following a pandemic-fueled collecting frenzy, but new sets in 2025 are selling out and prices on the secondhand market are skyrocketing. And it’s coming to a head at GameStop, the unlikely new epicenter for <em>Pokémon</em> TCG madness as the struggling video game retailer continues trying to reinvent itself. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197533" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why People Are Rushing To Sell Their Xbox Series X To GameStop Right Now" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="197533,196165,195618" data-current="197533"><div><p>Why People Are Rushing To Sell Their Xbox Series X To GameStop Right Now</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197533/197533_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197533/197533_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197533/197533_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23065.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>2025 kicked off for the TCG with the Scarlet &amp; Violet—Prismatic Evolutions expansion in January, which was followed by the Journey Together expansion in March, and now Destined Rivals is coming at the end of the month.

Even in fair weather, the line etiquette has had some people fuming about people saving spots and cutting. “I gave my spot to the kid behind me because its just fucking cardboard guys, I hope they felt some ounce of shame or guilt but I know that’s not how these people operate,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1ko4stz/this_is_disgusting/?share_id=MzU2oZD-6fm43jKQL3Lhe&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1ko4stz/this_is_disgusting/?share_id=MzU2oZD-6fm43jKQL3Lhe&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote one angry guy</a></span> about a family that apparently budged in front. “I hope they get traumatic delusions full effect,” he continued, referencing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/1i5ucvf/traumatic_delusions/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/1i5ucvf/traumatic_delusions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a nickname for Prismatic Evolutions</a></span> that plays up how fans often seem to find their hopes of pulling good cards from the set amount to nothing. “Hope the kid I gave my spot to gets a god pack. Do better people holy fuck.”</p><p> The growing discontent has led GameStop to institute a new rule for the upcoming Destined Rivals launch. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DJ4oVy4SvoG/?igsh=MnBuejF3MXdmdWM0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJ4oVy4SvoG/?igsh=MnBuejF3MXdmdWM0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Announced on Tuesday</a></span>, new  Pokémon TCG releases will now be limited to one unit per customer. So whether they’re aiming to snag single boosters or entire boxes, more people should have more shots at getting what they came for. It should also disincentive scalpers from swamping stores on days that new packs come out.</p><p>“Finally!” responded one person on Instagram. “I just saw a scalper fall to his knees at GameStop,” wrote another. Many were disappointed the change didn’t come sooner. “If only this rule was applied when the Prismatic Super Premium Collection dropped, I would have been able to get one,” another person wrote. Many locations had been giving out two per customer for Prismatic, even though stores were getting as few as 10 boxes in total. </p><p>Adding to some of the confusion has been a burgeoning ecosystem of communities and apps like Popfindr that help people track which stores are getting new stock for which sets when. Like whiskey nerds waiting outside liquor stores on small batch delivery days, some GameStop employees have noticed customers coming in asking them about store shipments they weren’t even aware of. “This app that people are using to get our inventory is actually starting to piss me off,” one GameStop employee <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1kimvqr/exhausted_of_tcg/?share_id=flq9LrVDsRcJLimE6qh8T&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1kimvqr/exhausted_of_tcg/?share_id=flq9LrVDsRcJLimE6qh8T&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on Reddit</a></span>. “Is anyone experiencing that at all? People have updates of when we get our shipment and it’s weird. I’ve had numerous phone calls and people coming in store telling me I received a shipment with quantity amounts. It’s frustrating.”<br></p><p>Despite the lowkey chaos, GameStop has only doubled down on the Pokémon TCG market since it announced it would start grading and reselling cards last year. Some stores have become “takeover stores” where walls that used to be lined with games, Funko Pops, or other collectibles have been completely given over to displaying <em>Pokémon</em> TCG packs, only for them to get completely wiped out just days later. Once a bystander in that boom-bust cycle, GameStop now stands to profit off the hype of people reselling valuable cards. </p><p>“As a card collector myself, I hate what the hobby has turned into and frankly, I wouldn’t even feel upset if GS stops selling TCG because there are just so many bad apples that ruin it for everyone,,” one fan commented on Reddit. “Like it is totally NOT OK for vendors and restockers to have to worry about being stalked because a scalper air tagged their car. It sucks that to even have a chance in getting cards for the hobby, you pretty much need to camp ahead of release day.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He’s starred in huge movies and franchises. He’s pulled off some of the most amazing stunts ever performed on film. And he’s become Hollywood’s ambassador of Going To The Movies. But I can’t relate to any of that. So let’s talk instead about how this famous dude seems be a big movie theater popcorn sicko. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197567" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="104" data-playlist="197567,197565,197564" data-current="197567"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23091.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On May 20, the official <em>Mission: Impossible</em> Twitter account posted a short video of Cruise <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/mikeryan/status/1924256925425832373&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/mikeryan/status/1924256925425832373" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chatting up AMC employees</a></span> during a big pre-release screening of the latest entry in the long-running series. As he talks about the upcoming  film, <em>Final Reckoning</em>, Cruise can be seen eating popcorn in his distinctive way. </p><p>We can also see the famous actor munching on popcorn in this same way in a different video recently posted to social media. Once again, Cruise can be seen carrying a bucket of popcorn with one hand and chucking small handfuls of the snack food into his mouth with the other. </p><p>It’s a bit odd, but it looks cooler than how I eat popcorn at a movie theater. (I just grab a big handful of the stuff, smoosh it into my face, and eat it like a pony being fed at a petting zoo.) </p><p>If these were the only clips of Tom Cruise eating popcorn, well, I’d not be writing this blog. But this is just the latest evidence that Tom Cruise, the movie star, is a popcorn sicko. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/tcarchive0220/status/1924387860771389573&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/tcarchive0220/status/1924387860771389573" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s a clip of him leaving that AMC theater while eating more popcorn</a></span>.

Here’s a clip from 2015 of Cruise warning people to hold onto their popcorn during that year’s big <em>Mission: Impossible </em>movie, <em>Rogue Nation</em>.</p><p>Apparently, before this recent <em>Final Reckoning </em>screening, Cruise asked the assembled audience of critics and reporters if they all had popcorn. Once he seemed satisfied that, yes, they all had plenty of the popular buttery snack, he then admitted how much popcorn he eats during a movie. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/RachelLeishman/status/1924527232921264149&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/RachelLeishman/status/1924527232921264149" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cruise reportedly eats two buckets of popcorn</a></span> while enjoying a film.

Movies. Popcorn,” said Cruise in the 2023 clip. And I have to agree with the man. Movie theater popcorn rocks.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, Mike Pondsmith, the creator of the <em>Cyberpunk </em>tabletop roleplaying game, which first debuted in 1988, has revealed a pretty important piece of information: Alongside returning to the capitalist hellscape of Night City, the sequel will take us to another city as well.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196452" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="149" data-playlist="196452,197564,196805" data-current="196452"><div><p>Clear Your Calendar For Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196452/196452_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22004.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Speaking to Polish gaming channel tvgry at the Digital Dragons Conference in Poland, Pondsmith talked a little about the upcoming game, revealing that “Orion” will take place at least partially, though not entirely, in Night City. He described some talks he had with the CD Projekt Red team, and said that while he’s not as involved in the sequel as he was with <em>2077</em>, he can say that the game will feature a second city that is “more like Chicago gone wrong.”</p><p>“I spent a lot of time talking to one of the environment guys, and he was explaining how the new place in Orion, because there’s another city we visit —I’m not telling you any more than that, but there’s another city we visit,” Pondsmith said. “Night City is still there, but I remember looking at it and going, ‘yeah, I understand the feel you’re going for this, and this really does work.’ And it doesn’t feel like <em>Blade Runner</em>, it feels more like Chicago gone wrong. I said, ‘Yeah, I can see this working.’”</p><p>Assuming Pondsmith is being careful with his words here, this doesn’t explicitly mean <em>Cyberpunk</em>’s next game is set in Chicago specifically, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Chicago&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Chicago" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">does still exist in the universe</a></span>. He describes the new location as being “like” the city, so it’s probably not the Illinois metropolis itself, and as of yet, it’s unclear in what ways the new setting will resemble Chicago. In its infrastructure? Its culture? Unbearably cold winters? We’ll find out eventually.</p><p>What I’m curious about is how much of a divide there will be between this new city and the Night City we know and love. I know exploring an old map in an open-world game might not sound that exciting, but Night City is still <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791">one of the most well-realized cities I’ve ever explored in a game</a></span>, and I imagine CDPR isn’t too keen to just throw all that work away if there are still stories to tell. I’m also wondering if the studio will include some kind of choice import to have the story of <em>2077</em>’s merc protagonist V referenced in the sequel according to your decisions. I don’t need a cameo from the guy, but I wouldn’t mind a drink at the Afterlife bar paying tribute to his big space heist at the end of the game. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
