              <p>It was around 1:45 in the morning, as I was laying down wooden walkways to help little rodents get to work faster, that I realized I was fully hooked by <em>Whiskerwood</em>, a newly released city-builder and resource manager that blends together <em>Timberborn</em>, <em>Factorio</em>, and <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/sid-meiers-colonization-is-the-best-4th-of-july-video-g-1600113277">Sid Meier’s Colonization</a>.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Out now on Steam via early access, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489330/Whiskerwood/"><em>Whiskerwood</em> is a top-down real-time city builder</a> that has you leading Whiskers, lowly mouse peasants and workers, as they travel to new lands in the 1700s by order of the rich, powerful Claws, a group of royal cats. After picking a spot to build a dock for incoming ships and a warehouse to store goods, you start harvesting supplies to begin building up a tiny mouse settlement. Your goal isn’t simply to survive, but also to harvest enough resources, including fish, berries, logs, and rock, to pay off your taxes, which are claimed every so often in-game by a royal fleet. As you do, the amount of taxes you have to pay goes up, and wait a minute…I don’t think these Claws are good people!</p>

  <p>Early on, one of your mice rightfully points out that, hey, the Claws provided the mice supplies to build structures that would enrich the cats, but failed to provide much more than that, leaving the Whiskers basically on their own to figure out how to build a town and not all perish in a few days. Once again, not sure these cats can be trusted.</p> <p>This part of <em>Whiskerwood</em> is currently the least developed, with what sounds like plans to allow a self-sufficient colony to cut itself off from the Claws and even revolt. For now, that stuff mostly sits in the background and provides a good reason to harvest more and more supplies.</p>

 <p>While the game’s recreation of 1700s colonization hooked me at first, what kept me around until way too late the first night I played was the easy-to-understand city-building mechanics and smartly designed UI. Doing anything in <em>Whiskerwood</em> rarely takes more than two clicks. Each menu is easy to read, navigate, and close, which isn’t always the case in games like this. <em>Whiskerwood</em> also does a fantastic job, even in early access, of providing players with all the information they need to know about where mice are going, what they need, what’s missing, which resources are low, and so forth.</p>

 <figure><figcaption>©Minakata Dynamics</figcaption></figure> <p>I especially love the alert banners that appear for important problems, like an injured mouse. Or to let you know that a mouse might have a long trek to the mines from his tiny hovel. You just click on it, and it zips you to the problem, and from there, you’re usually a click away from moving a mouse or tweaking some part of a building.</p> <p>Making that trip shorter or more efficient is a breeze with <em>Whiskerwood’s</em> snappy building and management menus, which feel like they were built by people who understand how vital this stuff is to making a city builder fun. But all of this smart design doesn’t come at the cost of simplification! This is still a complex game that will demand that you create more and more elaborate networks of buildings, conveyors, stairs, transportation, housing, and storage to be able to not only pay your taxes but also survive harsher seasons and weather.</p>

 <p>I’ve only put about five hours into <em>Whiskerwood</em> so far, but based on what I’ve played and the gushing I’ve seen <a href="https://aftermath.site/whiskerwood-review-impressions-pc-city-builder-hooded-horse/">from city builder experts like Luke Plunkett over at <em>Aftermath</em>,</a> I’m excited to keep playing. Hopefully one day my tiny mice will rise up, seize the means of production from the Claws, and gain independence. For now, they’ll need to keep breaking rocks and cutting down trees for those fat cats.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-forza-horizon-6-ps5-delay-launch-fable-reboot-2000662665</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Earlier this week, Xbox gave us an idea of when to expect its two biggest games of 2026: <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-everything-we-know-xbox-biggest-map-online-play-ps5-release-date-2000662346"><em>Forza Horizon 6</em></a> will land on May 15, and the long-awaited <a href="https://kotaku.com/fable-reboot-features-seamless-open-world-and-is-launching-this-fall-2000662295"><em>Fable</em> reboot</a> will arrive sometime in the fall. But oddly, while <em>Fable</em> is launching on the same (as-yet unknown) day on Xbox and PS5, <em>Horizon 6</em> isn’t. Instead, its PS5 version will arrive sometime after the Xbox release. When pressed on why this was the case, one Xbox exec provided a confusing answer.</p> <p><a href="https://keleops-usa.slack.com/archives/C099JF8RR7T/p1769193061207769">In a new interview with <em>GamesRadar</em></a>, Xbox Game Studios head Craig Duncan told the outlet that he and Xbox have a “pretty simple view” about bringing their games and franchises, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-remake-campaign-evolved-playstation-cross-play-2000638951"><em>Halo</em> and <em>Gears of War,</em></a> to more platforms. “We want our games to reach the most players that we can,” explained Duncan. “It’s rarely more complicated than that. It’s like, how can we get this game to as many players as we can?”</p>

 <p>Okay, sure, we’ve heard this before from Xbox. They want to be on more platforms and give people more ways to play. Fine. But when asked specifically why <a href="https://kotaku.com/fable-reboot-appearance-morality-good-evil-horns-halo-2000662597"><em>Fable</em></a> is launching at the same time on Xbox and PS5, but <a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-game-pass-early-access-price-increase-premium-edition-60-120-2000662606"><em>Forza Horizon 6</em></a> isn’t, Duncan admitted that “sometimes we are inconsistent.”</p> <p>“You see some games in one place, some games in multiple places,” Duncan told the outlet. “Just know that we’re going to work on that, and we’re going to try and be more consistent with what we do.”</p>

 <p>According to him, Xbox won’t commit to every future game launching day one on PS5 because the company wants to “maintain optionality.”</p> <p>“If we’re only in a position to release a game on a platform and not have it show up really well? Then I think we wouldn’t do that. I think we would have a conversation internally and go, ‘Hey, unless we can do it really well and do the right thing by those players, then…’ and that’s when you get into conversations of, well, maybe we can ship it afterwards. Because teams are only a set size. We only have a certain amount of…ultimately, it all comes down to resources. Not everything is limitless. So we just want to do the best job, by each platform, by each game.”</p>

 <p>According to Duncan, sometimes games need extra time to get them running on a different platform. And that does sound plausible. But it is very convenient that <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>, a super hyped-up sequel to one of Xbox’s biggest hits, isn’t coming to PS5 right away. Meanwhile, <em>Fable</em>, a long-delayed reboot of a franchise that has been MIA for over a decade, is launching on PS5 as well as Xbox. You could theorize that Xbox wants to keep <em>Forza</em> on its platforms, like Xbox Cloud and Game Pass, as exclusives for an extended period of time, and push people to play there. Regardless, it’s clear that the future of <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-ceo-halo-ps5-more-multiplatform-games-1851482805">Xbox’s multiplatform strategy</a> is kind of all over the place and will likely continue to be that way for the foreseeable future.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-store-poke-court-nyc-manhattan-robbery-donation-2000662652</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>Earlier this month, Poké Court, a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>card and collectible shop in the Manhattan Meatpacking District, was holding a community event where fans gathered to decorate top loaders for their cards. The event was a first of its kind for the store, which opened in November. But that’s not why the people there that night will remember it. The event was crashed by </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-shops-robbed-100k-nyc-masked-thieves-anime-backpacks-recently-opened-2000660233"><span>a group of masked robbers who held the store up at gunpoint</span></a><span>, smashed glass cases and shelves,&nbsp; and stole over $100,000 worth of collector’s merchandise. “They just grabbed whatever they could,” said owner Courtney Chin.</span></p> <p><span>Stories like this have unfortunately become </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-01-23/pokemon-card-thefts-are-hitting-collectors-across-southern-california"><span>more and more common</span></a><span> as the scalper market has become a quick money-making scheme for people who don’t even care about Pikachu, Charizard, or any of the other monsters in the series. Stores have reported everything from armed robberies and being assaulted with pepper spray to people tunneling into stores like they’re in a heist movie.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>A store in Huntington Beach, California got hit right before the recent Christmas holiday. Thieves reportedly burrowed through some part of the shop’s roof. “It’s hard not to worry with so many other stores being hit,” the owner, Jerry Hernandez, </span><a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2026-01-23/pokemon-card-thefts-are-hitting-collectors-across-southern-california"><span>told the </span><i><span>Los Angeles Times</span></i></a><span>. “I feel like once we got hit and some of the other shops got hit it created a snowball effect.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000662648" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662648"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662648">© Photo: Kenneth Shepard</figcaption></figure> <p><span>When I went to Poké Court this week, located on a cobblestone side street close to the Hudson River, the shelves were mostly still empty, but they did have a bouquet of flowers sitting on them next to some of the Pokémon card top loaders fans had come together to decorate. If I hadn’t already known about the smash and grab, there would have been little to suggest Poké Court had been the target of a terrible crime.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>It was the middle of a cold Manhattan January afternoon, and the store still had dozens of customers coming in and out to joyfully buy and open trading card packs at the shop’s bartop. But if you paid attention, there were clues to what had happened. Before I even spoke to anyone in the store, a customer was offering their condolences to the staff, who graciously accepted their kind words. In the corner of the entrance, Chin was putting the store’s new security system through its paces.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>“A world we must defend”</h2> <p><span>Chin started what would become a brick-and-mortar shop in one of the most expensive real estate markets in the country out of her second bedroom after getting back into </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>collecting in a “really intense way.” She wanted to create something more “specialized” than your average card shop. Trading cards have become such a lucrative hobby and business that most collectible stores diversify their stock, carrying sports cards alongside the </span><i><span>Magic</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Yu-Gi-Oh</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> packs people love. Poké Court is meant to be a place where </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans can reliably show up and know the store is dedicated to the franchise they’re obsessed with, and is staffed by people with extensive experience and knowledge about its long and hype-fueled history.</span></p> <p><span>“These are my friends who also grew up having the same core memories and really loving the franchise and thinking about all the values of Pokémon that we really resonate with,” Chin tells me. “We love the idea of community. We love the idea of trust, and even the theme song’s ‘being the very best,’ right? It tries to bring out the best in people, and it teaches you about resilience and hardship. And I think there are a lot of core lessons that my generation really took to heart.”</span></p>

 <p><span>While many </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>sellers will go to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-tcg-vendor-scalper-reseller-stream-shows-2000630658"><span>larger community events and card shows</span></a><span>, Chin says that having the brick-and-mortar location makes it less feasible to uproot the shop to do temporary events. But that physical presence also helps anchor the business and foster a local community, one that has weathered the changing, difficult storms of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>collecting’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>post-Covid, scalper-addled chaos</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“When I first started, I used to price things at MSRP or even below,” Chin says. “I would want to have the best prices so people would always come to my shop and buy from me. Once it became all about money, we would have some individuals—I don’t want to assign a label to them—but they would come and just buy everything and then immediately sell it. There’s nothing wrong with that. It’s a free market. But then they got really creative and they started botting our site. So we would drop something on our site and then we would immediately get flooded with hundreds of orders from the same individuals buying out all of our products. Then we would get an angry response from our actual customers and our regulars and they’re like, ‘You didn’t save anything.’”</span></p> <p><span>In response, Poké Court has had to adjust prices, which Chin acknowledges raises the barrier to entry for some people. But the lengths to which people would go to buy out all of the shop’s stock for cheap and then flip it became “unsavory,” even escalating into shouting matches and fights outside the store.</span></p>

 <p><span>“It really shouldn’t be about the money but unfortunately that’s what everyone focuses on because it’s so attention grabbing,” Chin says. “Then people get excited, they’re like, ‘oh, my collection is now worth $1,000 instead of $100. I’ve made so much money.’”</span></p> <div> <p>Welcome to Exp. Share, <em>Kotaku</em> ’s <em>Pokémon</em> column in which we dive deep to explore notable characters, urban legends, communities, and just plain weird quirks from throughout the <em>Pokémon</em> franchise.</p></div> <p><span>Fights are one thing, but threats of gun violence were something else entirely. Chin was in the store’s back room when Poké Court’s top loader event was wrapping up. Around 40 customers and 14 employees were in the store at the time, including folks who just wanted to hang out for the festivities. Chin knew something was wrong the second she heard the sound of glass shattering. Employees and customers rushed to the back of the store for safety as the robbers went to work.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000662647" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662647"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662647">© Photo: Kenneth Shepard</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Chin was able to hit the store’s panic button and call the police. Thankfully, no one was hurt, but thousands of dollars worth of vintage and rare merchandise from across the </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> franchise’s 30 years was gone. That’s where most reports about what happened at Poké Court end, but that’s not the whole story.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>“Our courage will pull us through”</h2> <p><span>“I thought that our shop would be deserted and everyone would be scared and employees would resign because they feel like this is an unsafe work environment, but it was almost the opposite,” Chin says. “Everyone really bonded together and wanted to stay here longer. After the robbery, everyone could have gone home, which is the rational thing to do, but everyone, we had 50 people here, and they all wanted to stay. They all stood in line and gave their statements to the police, and they all wanted to be here for each other.”</span></p> <p><span>The New York Poké Court community showed up for each other, but as word of the shop’s story spread, Chin says the broader Pokémon community has reached out in support as well. Big content creators have shared the store’s </span><a href="https://thepokecourt.com/products/poke-court-community-support?utm_source=ig&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=link_in_bio&amp;fbclid=PAZXh0bgNhZW0CMTEAc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQMMjU2MjgxMDQwNTU4AAGnU0K6HAZne1CZRccxo-cJqqgib4qA0IczzxBbERK_Ihk0YJf_IDG8l87qarA_aem_wDNuUu1z2EFKMndQncv8NA"><span>community fund</span></a><span> that’s raised thousands of dollars. Even big names in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389"><span>Ash Ketchum</span></a><span> voice actor </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-ash-ketchum-voice-actor-sarah-natochenny-anime-1850234947"><span>Sarah Natochenny</span></a><span> started reaching out </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DThGXC4jJ5P/?hl=en"><span>on social media</span></a><span>. Chin says the store has gotten an influx of job applications, too.</span></p>

 <p><span>“They’re like, ‘I want to work for you’ and I’m like, ‘We just got held up. I can’t believe you would want to spend more time in this spot.’ So I think that it’s very encouraging that people are bouncing back even harder than ever. We’re not going to let a robbery stop us.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000662649" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662649"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662649">© Photo: Kenneth Shepard</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The support has gone beyond just people donating money. Some have offered musical performances in-store while others bring in food for staff. The immediate pillow of support has been a “big morale booster” for the team. While the Poké Court has been in headlines over one of the worst things that could have happened to it, Chin wants people to know that the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community is more than just collectors chasing the most valuable cards.</span></p> <p><span>“One of the most common misconceptions is that the Pokémon community is full of people who only are in it for the money or only care about investing or are scalpers,” she says. “You just hear the worst, right? But for better or for worse, this robbery has shown how people can come together in a really positive and genuinely heartwarming way to support total strangers, to support their local card shop, to support all the people who were absolutely traumatized by this experience. I’ve just been floored and humbled and I’m so thankful that there’s this massive community.”</span></p> <p><span>As the shop’s story has spread on social media, neighboring card shops around the state have also been reaching out about the stolen merchandise, verifying certification numbers in case the robbers try to sell what they took. The entire thing has made Chin feel like the shop has a “network of friends” that expands far beyond New York City.</span></p>

 <p><span>When I left Poké Court this week, it was just as full of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans as it’s ever been, though it now has additional security. There was a version of the store’s future where fans stopped showing up to buy and open packs, scared off by the threat of violence over a hobby that’s supposed to be about bringing people together. Instead, the store is bouncing back, thanks in no small part to a community that was never in it for the money to begin with. They were in it for each other and the friends they’ve met along the way through a shared love of Pokémon.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-store-poke-court-nyc-manhattan-robbery-donation-2000662652]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[World Of Warcraft’s Transmog Fiasco Ends With Price Cuts But That’s Not The Whole Story]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/world-warcraft-midnight-wow-transmog-changes-update-2000662662</link>
            <guid>1414669</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Days after hiking up the prices to transmogrify your armor in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/world-of-warcraft"><i><span>World of Warcraft</span></i></a><span>, developer Blizzard announced it’s reducing them in half—a decision that came after overwhelming player outrage.</span></p> <p><span>The transmog fiasco started with the launch of the pre-expansion patch for </span><i><span>World of Warcraft: Midnight</span></i><span> on January 20. The patch introduced a plethora of updates to a number of the game’s systems, and the transmog system, which allows players to change the appearance of armor pieces for previously acquired gear without affecting their stats, was one of them. The transmog overhaul ushered in two big problems for the community: the new system is convoluted, and to make matters worse, it’s incredibly expensive. Or used to be, anyway, as Blizzard has already announced it’s dialing the inflation rate back.</span></p> <p><span>“We’re going to lower the cost of outfit creation prices by 50% to bring them more in line with what the prices were prior to the Transmog update,” community manager Linxy </span><a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/free-transmog-change-coming-for-all-characters/2233128/696"><span>wrote on the Blizzard forums</span></a><span> yesterday. “This price reduction is currently under development and should be available within the next day.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The change makes sense, as the new system has characters starting with just two outfit slots for their transmog creations. You can unlock more, of course, but initial prices started at 100 gold and ramped up to almost 800,000 gold to unlock all 20 slots on a given character. So, if you’re somebody who juggles five characters at once and you like to engage with the in-game fashion, having 20 slots for all five of them would cost almost 4 million gold. And this is all without considering the costs of changing the individual pieces in said outfits.</span></p> <p><span>Now, all of these prices are being halved. In addition, Linxy said the team is “going to try” to grant one free transmog to all player-characters soon, before patch 12.0.1. This should “hopefully” happen via a hotfix.</span></p>

 <p><span>The free transmog is also part of the response to community complaints. When Blizzard released the pre-expansion patch, all transmogs that were previously applied to gear were removed. As </span><a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/free-transmog-change-coming-for-all-characters/2233128"><span>explained</span></a><span> by community manager Kaivax on the forums, this was intentional to reflect the transition from a gear-based to a slot-based system. All previously saved loadouts are still present, converted to Custom Sets as part of the new system. The problem, however, is that it costs the normal amount of gold to apply the first transmog to your character, even if you only want to set your appearance back to the way it was before. Kaivax called this “an oversight” on the developers’ part, as players should be able to maintain or reset their existing look without cost.</span></p>

 <p><span>“With the 12.0.1 update before the launch of </span><i><span>Midnight</span></i><span>, all player-characters will be granted one free Transmog,” continues the response. “This will be automatically applied to the next outfit created for each character. We apologize for any inconvenience caused by first-time Transmog costs.”</span></p> <h2><b>Pricing isn’t the only problem with the new transmog system</b></h2> <p><span>While the pricing reduction is a welcoming change, it hardly addresses the only qualm that </span><i><span>World of Warcraft</span></i><span> players have with the new transmog system. The community is also complaining about the convoluted UX, as it used to be simpler in the old system, as well as the multiple added steps the latest changes require.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I think I’ve spent about half of my gametime playing dress up since transmog has been released as a feature,” reads a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1qj7opk/not_to_be_dramatic_but_im_quitting_over_the_new/"><span>Reddit thread</span></a><span> from a </span><i><span>World of Warcraft </span></i><span>player who says they’re quitting the game. “Now (…) trying to set up anything just fills me with apathy. Why was the icon selection and naming of sets downgraded for the ‘main’ transmog screen? The outdated all-in-one icon selection from classic, without search or prioritizing your outfit’s items is MASSIVELY more annoying than the previous transmog system’s auto-select that just went with the first item’s icon of your outfit. Also, 16 characters limit for outfit names is nonsense.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000662666" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662666"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662666">©Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This account is far from the only one voicing such complaints. In the replies to an </span><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/guide/transmogrification/everything-about-transmog-ui-appearances"><span>explainer</span></a><span> by </span><i><span>World of Warcraft</span></i><span> enthusiast site </span><i><span>Wowhead</span></i><span>, people have posted multiple questions about the minutiae of the system. “I just opened up WoW and ALL my warriors look ridiculous,” reads one of the comments. “All the gear I’ve put on them over the years is gone and they look like noobs. I have lost over 2K gold trying to figure out the new transmog bs and when I check them out, they’re still in the wrong stuff. I’ve saved, I’ve bought a slot. I’ve only played WoW since it’s inception so yes, I’m older than most but this is ridiculous and it’s enough to make me want to quit the game.”</span></p> <p><span>Those on roleplaying servers are particularly impacted by these issues, as for many of them, transmogrification is particularly important to defining character identity, as well as adding to the immersion of certain events and actions. Say, for example, that your character is wearing a hood or a helmet, and you want to switch out to a scarf when entering a house. In the old system, you could open your inventory bags and select another transmogged item, switching it on the fly. Now, that individual item transmogging is no longer possible.</span></p>

 <p><span>As </span><a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/transmog-loss-of-an-important-feature-for-roleplayers/2202216"><span>explained by a veteran roleplayer</span></a><span> in the forums, people in these servers are prone to keep flavor items in their possession, such as cloaks to change depending on the weather environment, or a set of white gloves when a character needs to provide medical care for someone.</span></p> <p><span>The use cases are many, but unfortunately, the latest changes to transmogrification have introduced limitations. Instead of selecting an item from your inventory, you would have to pay gold to make a change to your current outfit, only to pay again once you revert it later. Plus, these actions take time, which can interrupt the flow of immersion during active scenes.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I am not a coder, I have no idea how difficult it would be to implement a system where certain items are exempt from the outfit that your character is currently wearing, but I implore you Blizzard, please find a way to allow us to make changes to individual outfit slots on the fly without having to engage with the transmog interface and shell out gold every time,” concludes the post from the roleplayer.</span></p> <p><i><span>World of Warcraft: Midnight</span></i><span> is releasing on March 2. Whether Blizzard decides to roll out more changes based on community feedback remains to be seen.</span></p>
