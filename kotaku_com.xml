The gameplay is that of a third-person shooter in a semi-open world. The most eye-catching part of the footage is that Bumblebee can transform between a robot and a car on the fly in what seems like a pretty seamless and satisfying animation to control. Traversal looks like it might have been a big part of <em>Transformers: Reactivate</em>, and it probably had the potential to play off of the core ability at the heart of the Hasbro toy franchise in interesting ways. </p><p>An executive for the company had previously said the game was shaping up well. <em>Transformers: Reactivate</em> would be a “milestone for<em> Transformers</em> in the next year or two” that “nailed the feeling of playing as a massive, bipedal robot,” senior VP of digital strategy and licensing for Hasbro, Eugene Evans, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/hasbro-wizards-of-the-coast-gaming-interview&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/hasbro-wizards-of-the-coast-gaming-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Game File</em></a></span> in early 2024. </p><p>Who knows whether the rest of the game around that core gameplay premise would have been fun or worthwhile. Making all of the disparate bits of game work together in a satisfying and worthwhile way is one of the biggest design and technical challenges of making any game, and maybe <em>Transformers: Reactivate</em> was ultimately canceled because it just wasn’t coming together, at least in a timeframe Hasbro was willing to foot the bill for. </p><p>“This decision did not come lightly, and it is a difficult time for the studio and our people,” Splash Damage <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/splashdamage/status/1877020458454749485&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/splashdamage/status/1877020458454749485" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote in its statement this week</a></span>. “We want to take a moment to thank the team who worked on <em>Transformers </em>for their dedication and passion. Hasbro was an incredible and supportive partner throughout, and we hope to work with them again. To the many fans, your excitement and support helped keep us going.”</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In addition to showing off the game’s sprawling alien planet geography and setting up the stakes for its sci-fi story, the trailer also gives longtime fans a glimpse of new content, including a section of<em> Chrono Trigger</em>-esque floating islands teased at the very end which weren’t part of the original game. </p><p>But the most important addition to the 2015 game is probably the reworking its UI seems to have gotten. The on-screen HUDs for <em>Xenoblade Chronicles </em>games are notoriously busy and tiny, and <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> was perhaps the series’ worst offender of all with tiny character portraits and stat bars on the left side of the screen while ability cooldowns were wedged in along the bottom. </p><p>In the <em>Definitive Edition</em>, the fonts are bigger, things are more spread out, and there’s more information on the screen explaining what bonuses players will get from what abilities, as well as a combo guide for the game’s all-important but very obtuse Overdrive system. It’s still busy but a lot easier to parse, and will hopefully be part of an overall attempt to make <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em>’s myriad systems easier to navigate for new players. </p><p>The trailer also ends with a look at a hooded figure on a beach, suggesting new story content is coming that might continue the decade-old Wii U game’s story. Fans are already speculating that it might be on the level of <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em>'s <em>Future Redeemed</em> expansion, which helped tie that game into the other entries in the franchise. At the very least it looks like <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> will be a complete package worthy of the Switch’s final year as Nintendo’s main console. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For instance, if you’re in bed next to your significant other and don’t want to wake them, you should be able to pop in some earbuds and keep all your noisy gaming to yourself, right?</p><p>Well, with the PlayStation Portal, you may find yourself a bit disappointed when it comes to headphone selections. Let’s dive into your options.</p><h2 id="h2077"><a id=""></a>Which headphones are compatible with PlayStation Portal?</h2><p>So, first of all, the PlayStation Portal comes with a 3.5mm headphone jack, which means <strong>you can plug in any standard headphones and use them just fine</strong>. If you’ve got an old pair of wired earbuds in a drawer somewhere and don’t mind being tethered to the device with a wire, you’re golden.</p><p>However, things get more complicated if you want to use wireless headphones because, unfortunately, Sony has designed the PlayStation Portal to work exclusively with wireless audio devices that use its proprietary PlayStation Link connection. This means that any wireless headphones you already own likely won’t work with the PlayStation Portal.</p><p>So, which wireless devices <em>do</em> work? Well, you only have two options at this time.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/pulse-elite-wireless-headset-ps5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/pulse-elite-wireless-headset-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PULSE Elite headset</a></span></li><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/pulse-explore-wireless-earbuds-ps5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-accessories/pulse-explore-wireless-earbuds-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PULSE Explore earbuds</a></span></li></ul><p>Yeah, it’s kind of a bummer. Over time, there are sure to be additional headphones that use this technology, but it still kind of sucks to have to purchase an all-new audio device alongside a handheld system just to get such basic functionality.</p><p>Despite this frustrating decision by Sony, the PlayStation Portal remains one of the best ways to play your PlayStation games when you’re not near a console. And if handheld gaming is an important part of your life, it may be worth splurging to make the most of the experience. Or, you know, just dig out those wax-filled wired earbuds you bought back in 2009 and make do. </p><p>.<br>  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
