It seems like some people might be gravitating to whatever broken build they can find currently popping off online in part because they’re struggling with the early game in a way they didn’t in <em>Path of Exile 1</em> or similar games like <em>Diablo IV</em>. </p><p>This exploratory phase is part of the fun of diving into a big new action-RPG though. <em>Path of Exile </em>is a game all about deep character customization that lets players experiment with all sorts of builds until they find something that really suits their playstyle or overperforms in unexpected ways. It’s still the earliest days for <em>Path of Exile 2</em>, which came out in preview mode on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on December 6 alongside its Steam Early Access release (the game is currently $30 but will be free-to-play at its 1.0 launch). </p><p>And dealing with unexpected difficulty curves or build nerfs is better than battling down servers or long queue times. “For those still in queue, what we are doing right now is letting in players in batches so that we can make sure to monitor the backend and not overload it,” the studio <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1865156788636848490&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/pathofexile/status/1865156788636848490" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a></span> late on Friday. “Thanks once again for your patience and hopefully it won’t be too much longer.” </p><p>Things seem to have improved as of Monday. The concurrent player count recently dipped to 330,000 on PC, down from its weekend peak of 578,562. The record launch came despite equally big debuts last weekend from the likes of <em>Marvel Rivals </em>and <em>Infinity Nikki</em>.

That’s happening again today, as the Genetic Apex SP Emblem Event 1 launches, joining the ongoing Venusaur Drop Event and the Bulbasaur-themed Wonder Pick Event. And while it’s strange, it makes it a great time to pick up the game.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,194907,194141" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Emblem Events are, in my opinion, the best of the current rotation of special challenges the mobile card game offers. They’re focused on battling other real-world players rather than the game’s mediocre AI, and with far better rewards than the standard for-the-hell-of-it battles that’ll only net you thimbles of XP. The current Venusaur Drop event against the CPU certainly gives you something to do, but go into it with a half-competent fire deck and you’ll have won all the good loot within half an hour. Emblem Events, named for the badge-like prizes rewarded that you can display on your profile, offer a tastier challenge against real people, with decks you don’t know in advance.</p><p>With <em>Pocket</em>’s signature bemusing lack of clarity, the new event is titled “Genetic Apex SP Emblem Event 1.” And if you’re thinking, “Hang on, I’m pretty sure that already happened,” then no, silly, you’re thinking of “Genetic Apex Emblem Event 1,” which took place in November. Don’t you look daft.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-venusaur-drop-event-full-art-card-1851710232&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-venusaur-drop-event-full-art-card-1851710232"><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s New Venusaur Event Features The Most Beautiful Card</a></span></p><p>SP stands for...ummm...“consecutive wins”? Yeah, no, it doesn’t make a lick of sense. But that’s the goal here: winning multiple matches in a row, which is so much juicier than anything that’s come before. Last month’s version was just about accruing wins overall, but this is much tougher. <em>And</em> it’s also uncharacteristically generous in its first handful of prizes, awarded just for participation!</p><p>For playing once, whether you win or lose, you get three of the coveted Pack Hourglasses, then another three for playing three battles, and once you hit five matches, you get six more hourglasses! That’s enough for a whole new pack, just for playing five times. Then there’s another 12 for battling ten times! Two packs, just for goofing around in the event, is—pleasingly and also miserably—better than the challenge rewards you get for paying the $10 a month for the god-awful Premium Pass. (There’s also 150 Shinedust for winning three battles, but that’s <em>rubbish</em>.)</p><p>The gloat-worthy prizes are the emblems, with four on offer, each increasingly more grand than the last, awarded for winning from two to five battles in a row. So having that crowned picture on your profile comes with some earned bragging rights.</p><p>It’s a short event, only lasting seven days, so get cracking. And don’t forget to gather Bulbasaur and Magnemite cards in the current Wonder Pick Event, and all the promo cards dropped in the ongoing Venusaur Drop Event. Woo! This is <em>Pocket</em> at its best, I reckon, and it’s looking likely to go quiet again on all fronts in a week.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
