The developer told <em>Polygon</em> that over the months he’s been chatting with the people at Scopely, “I’ve come to really find that they share so many of the same values that we’ve held near and dear to us at Niantic in terms of really caring about the player communities that they’ve fostered through their various games.” Which, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-niantic-stufful-community-day-hours-mobile-f-1848697447&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-niantic-stufful-community-day-hours-mobile-f-1848697447">for those</a></span> who <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-avatar-changes-niantic-1851418946&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-avatar-changes-niantic-1851418946">would argue</a></span> <em>POGO</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-shiny-celebi-whispers-in-the-woods-1851566355&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-shiny-celebi-whispers-in-the-woods-1851566355">has perhaps</a></span> not entirely <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-community-day-sprigatito-price-1851732203&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-community-day-sprigatito-price-1851732203">looked out for its communities</a></span> at <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-sword-shield-path-galar-timed-challenge-1851659409&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-sword-shield-path-galar-timed-challenge-1851659409">every</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-remote-raids-passes-price-increase-niantic-1850287791&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-remote-raids-passes-price-increase-niantic-1850287791">opportunity</a></span>, might not read as intended.</p><p>Steranka continues, adding that there are “also lots of shared values on how to operate within a team and caring about the people on the teams as well.” In 2023, despite <em>POGO</em> alone having generated over <em>$6 billion</em> in lifetime revenue, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/niantic-layoffs-pokemon-go-marvel-world-of-heroes-1850591267&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/niantic-layoffs-pokemon-go-marvel-world-of-heroes-1850591267">Niantic laid off 230 employees</a></span>.</p><figure id="" data-id="9cad8411e8aad213a3d7a472b80e11e8" data-recommend-id="image://9cad8411e8aad213a3d7a472b80e11e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Volcanion stood in front of a field of lava." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Volcanion stood in front of a field of lava." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Niantic</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9cad8411e8aad213a3d7a472b80e11e8" data-recommend-id="image://9cad8411e8aad213a3d7a472b80e11e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Volcanion stood in front of a field of lava." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This leads Steranka to conclude that Scopely will allow them to “be able to continue to operate <em>Pokémon Go</em> the same way we always have, with the same practices that we always have, and evolve the game in the way that we’ve always envisioned wanting to do.”</p><p>One aspect that Niantic is emphatic about is that <em>POGO</em> won’t be receiving interruptive adverts or restricted time mechanics. Given the game has made umpteen billions, the former is clearly unnecessary to be profitable (at the moment, at least), while the latter would fundamentally break the game.</p><p>There was a reply that struck me as more troubling, when <em>Polygon</em> asked about concerns that user data would now be owned by another company, that is owned—as the site rather delicately put it—by “a different country.” Instead of addressing this, Steranka responded that Niantic does not sell data to third parties “full stop.” But this of course isn’t relevant when it will be the Saudi regime, via its “Public Investment Fund” (of which Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is the chairman), that owns the data outright. Steranka said, “So if there are any fears that this is going to other places that you may or may not know or may or may not trust, I hope that what I’m sharing today can help quell any of those fears.” Well, no.</p><figure id="" data-id="5f8eb16e199bc2b074723cc802d3b1a9" data-recommend-id="image://5f8eb16e199bc2b074723cc802d3b1a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Archen standing on a rock." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Archen standing on a rock." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Niantic</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5f8eb16e199bc2b074723cc802d3b1a9" data-recommend-id="image://5f8eb16e199bc2b074723cc802d3b1a9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Archen standing on a rock." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of course, all of Steranka’s assurances fail to recognize that the game is already an absolute cluster of monetization that’s only gotten worse and worse over the years.
