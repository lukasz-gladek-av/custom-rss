But bear with me. First off, it’s one of the best <em>Call of Duty</em> storylines in recent memory, but it’s also an excellent introduction to the gameplay and mechanics you’ll encounter in multiplayer. It’s similar to the Training Course, providing you with a foundation.</p><p>While the AI may not pose a significant challenge, especially on normal difficulty or lower, they will allow you to test out your aim, learn cover mechanics, time your abilities, and memorize hotkeys for gadgets and equipment, all of which transfer over to multiplayer.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8e65d4e78fc0bde3b04a064b86706980" data-recommend-id="image://8e65d4e78fc0bde3b04a064b86706980" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Protocol, the Training Course map in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Protocol, the Training Course map in Black Ops 6" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8e65d4e78fc0bde3b04a064b86706980" data-recommend-id="image://8e65d4e78fc0bde3b04a064b86706980" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Protocol, the Training Course map in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When you load into the <em>Black Ops 6</em> multiplayer, sure, you can jump straight into the core playlist and dive into Team Deathmatch or Hardpoint. But first, we recommend you test out your abilities in the Training Course. It’s a single-player match featuring seven stations, teaching you the basics of directional movement. You can and should work your way through:</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>Basic Movement</li><li>Essential Equipment</li><li>Omnimovement Basics</li><li>180-degree Combat Dive Drill</li><li>Combat Supine Drill</li><li>Combat Slide &amp; Dive Drill</li><li>Body Shield Drill</li></ol><p>These all prove valuable in competitive multiplayer, but especially the Omnimovement basics and combat drill mechanics. You’ll use them frequently, and even a basic grasp of these can put you ahead of your competition, and lead you to the winning circle.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cbe160f0dce1b3fa8e84a32c7dfaa830" data-recommend-id="image://cbe160f0dce1b3fa8e84a32c7dfaa830" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Ops 6 Omnimovement in action" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Black Ops 6 Omnimovement in action" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cbe160f0dce1b3fa8e84a32c7dfaa830" data-recommend-id="image://cbe160f0dce1b3fa8e84a32c7dfaa830" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Ops 6 Omnimovement in action" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>You’re liable to blame it on age, waning reflexes, or children who have nothing but free time, but learning Omnimovement in <em>Black Ops 6</em> initially feels downright painful. Everyone feels faster, more fluid, than you. But they’re not. They’re using the same control schemes and hotkeys as you, but more effectively.</p><p>The best way to learn Omnimovement, aside from spending considerable time in the Training Course, is to throw yourself into the fray. Load into the core playlist, ideally Team Deathmatch, Domination, or Hardpoint—a team-oriented game mode—and practice. You’ll likely lose, and you may wind up suffering text or voice abuse from your teammates—this is <em>Call of Duty</em> after all—but you’ll find that after a few rounds of leaping around like a fool, you’re beginning to gain ground with Omnimovement.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0fca0adea705b1a8182b14adeff68487" data-recommend-id="image://0fca0adea705b1a8182b14adeff68487" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The reloading animation for the AK-47 in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The reloading animation for the AK-47 in Black Ops 6" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0fca0adea705b1a8182b14adeff68487" data-recommend-id="image://0fca0adea705b1a8182b14adeff68487" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The reloading animation for the AK-47 in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If you ask anyone online, especially on social media, they’re going to tell you to stick with the meta—the best weapons in the game that everyone uses. Right now, most players opt for the AS VAL or C9. They’re excellent, fast-firing, and hard-hitting weapons that make quick work of players. But they’re only a small part of the game.</p><p>Personally, I almost always use the AK-74. I like its crosshairs, powerful feel, and its sound design. Do those aspects make for a meta weapon? No, but I still frequently place in the top three on my team. The point is, find a weapon that you enjoy using, then practice with it. You don’t have to stick with the meta, you can still dominate <em>Black Ops 6</em> multiplayer with any gun in the game.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f5955ede19752fe00a8bb14ba303ea80" data-recommend-id="image://f5955ede19752fe00a8bb14ba303ea80" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Deathmatch game mode in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Deathmatch game mode in Black Ops 6" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f5955ede19752fe00a8bb14ba303ea80" data-recommend-id="image://f5955ede19752fe00a8bb14ba303ea80" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Deathmatch game mode in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>At least in the beginning. While everyone certainly has a few favorite game modes, Team Deathmatch and Domination offer team-centric matches with simple objectives that give new players an opportunity to learn. They’re not overly dramatic or complex, but straightforward, in-your-face gunfights and a point-scoring method that doesn’t demand too much of beginners.</p><p>Inevitably, you’ll move on to test other game modes, and quickly find favorites. But starting with the basics allows you to plant a foundation down that will resonate down the line.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d5e302572833e9817ea11f1795afe01e" data-recommend-id="image://d5e302572833e9817ea11f1795afe01e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Daily challenge rotation on the multiplayer menu in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Daily challenge rotation on the multiplayer menu in Black Ops 6" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d5e302572833e9817ea11f1795afe01e" data-recommend-id="image://d5e302572833e9817ea11f1795afe01e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Daily challenge rotation on the multiplayer menu in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Every weapon, attachment, and Scorestreak in the game remains locked behind specific ranks. As such, if you have your sights set on a specific gun, for instance, you’ll want to level quickly. How? The best way is, of course, by playing multiplayer. But more importantly, focus on your daily challenges. These swap out every 24 hours, and they include challenges such as scoring specific types of kills, or a certain number of headshots.</p><p>Every time you complete a daily challenge, you’ll earn a few thousand XP. Once you complete all three, you’ll unlock the fourth bonus, rewarding you with even more XP. It’s an excellent way to jump two or three levels simply by playing the game.</p><hr><p>Once you nail down the basics of multiplayer, don’t forget to check out the other modes.

However, the game’s handling of trans identity goes beyond just options you can choose in the character creator that may support your own personal headcanon. In <em>The Veilguard</em>, BioWare has given you the option to actively declare in-game that your hero is transgender, in a way that’s reflected in dialogue throughout the game. Historically this has been the kind of thing that players have had to just apply to a game’s hero through their own imaginations, so I was happy to see BioWare went the extra step to codify it for those who want to play a trans Rook.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Rather, it comes a few hours into the game when you unlock Rook’s quarters in the Lighthouse base. This isn’t something you can miss, so if you’ve started your own playthrough and haven’t seen it yet, don’t worry, you just haven’t gotten to this point in the game. When you’re setting up Rook’s room, one of the items you’ll put down is a handheld mirror. This gives Rook a moment of self reflection and you the opportunity to add some backstory to your character based on things you included in the character creator. Personally, I chose to talk about my tattoos and speak a little lore for my hero into the universe. But there’s one option that allows you to touch on Rook’s gender identity, specifically stating that your character is transgender. This isn’t tied to anything specific in the character creator, so no matter what options you choose while making them, you can still have a trans Rook in your story.</p><figure id="" data-id="953fc0d4a86c3c2f21e1346ae8710ace" data-recommend-id="image://953fc0d4a86c3c2f21e1346ae8710ace" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook looks at something off-screen as the dialogue options to declare your character as transgender appear on-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook looks at something off-screen as the dialogue options to declare your character as transgender appear on-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="953fc0d4a86c3c2f21e1346ae8710ace" data-recommend-id="image://953fc0d4a86c3c2f21e1346ae8710ace" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rook looks at something off-screen as the dialogue options to declare your character as transgender appear on-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The three options include “I’m getting there,” “I love who I am,” and “Feels good to see the real me,” so you can designate your trans identity and also color in where you think they are in their personal journey. This will unlock some dialogue options throughout <em>The Veilguard</em> that allow you to discuss this aspect of your identity with other characters, so it’s not just a thing you have to internalize. However, as far as I can tell after finishing the game, if you don’t pick this option when you’re setting up Rook’s room, it doesn’t come up again later. So be sure to go down this dialogue path when you’re examining the mirror if you want to play as a trans Rook and have it be recognized in dialogue. It just might give you a point of common connection with some characters that will enrich your story throughout.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, one genre that you might not immediately think of as a hotbed of good scares is role-playing games. You’d be wrong, though. RPGs of all types have some of the best horror stories in the medium, thanks to the focus on expansive worlds and player freedom that can easily be twisted into a scary situation of your own making. If you’re a fan of thrills as well as lengthy games you can really sink your teeth into, then these seven terrifying RPGs are the perfect treat for Halloween.</p></div><div><p>We all saw this coming. The 2004 vampire RPG basically has the market cornered on horror RPGs even two decades after its release. But there’s good reason for that! <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wit-and-charm-are-powerful-weapons-in-vampire-the-masq-1835701842&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wit-and-charm-are-powerful-weapons-in-vampire-the-masq-1835701842"><em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</em></a></span> drops you into an incredibly realized world of vampire politics that you get to involve yourself in and change through a slew of wonderful combat and dialogue systems. It’s a great RPG but it’s also deeply rooted in the compelling vampire world it’s set in, so you really can’t do better than this.</p></div><div><p>While <em>The Witcher 3</em> is already a gritty and dark fairytale RPG full of monsters, its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-blood-and-wine-the-kotaku-review-1779646150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-blood-and-wine-the-kotaku-review-1779646150"><em>Blood and Wine</em></a></span> expansion might be an even better pick for Halloween. Sure, the brown and gray color palette gets a Technicolor update, but that’s just to make all the blood look even more vibrant. <em>Blood and Wine</em> is a vampire story that builds on the solid systems and characters of the base game. You don’t even have to play <em>The Witcher 3</em> first, as you can start <em>Blood and Wine</em> right from the menu.</p></div><div><p>The best parts of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/deciding-whether-to-restart-a-video-game-is-my-latest-d-1835134928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/deciding-whether-to-restart-a-video-game-is-my-latest-d-1835134928"><em>Pathologic 2</em></a></span> only show themselves once you die. The horror RPG is all about managing your resources to stay alive. You need to eat, drink, rest, and heal constantly, on top of managing your reputation across the game’s many towns. But once you do die, a weird meta encounter informs you that the world has gotten worse and so have you. What was already a strange and dangerous world becomes exponentially so through debuffs like less health or more unconventional things such as losing the ability to hug characters. The more you die, the more things change, and there is always a little bit of a pull on your curiosity to find out how bad things can really get.</p></div><div><p>Square Enix’s cult classic answer to <em>Resident Evil </em>will always deserve more attention than it gets. As you’d expect from the makers of <em>Final Fantasy</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/parasite-eve-had-more-in-common-with-final-fantasy-than-1788134625&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/parasite-eve-had-more-in-common-with-final-fantasy-than-1788134625"><em>Parasite Eve</em></a></span> added RPG elements to the survival horror genre to great success. You play as Aya Brea, a rookie NYPD cop who, over the course of a lonely week in late December, works to save the city from a mitochondrial outbreak that threatens to destroy the world. It’s pulpy, it’s scary, it’s fun, and it’s worth playing if only for seeing the jaw-dropping opening cinematic.</p></div><div><p>For my money, no game has done gothic horror better than <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-the-kotaku-review-1695227854&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-the-kotaku-review-1695227854"><em>Bloodborne</em></a></span>. The city of Yharnam, with its constant sense of dread that bears down on you as you explore its cobblestone streets and gothic structures, has one of the most imposing atmospheres in any game ever. Sure, there’s still the tough-as-nails combat and constant retreading of territory we know from the <em>Souls </em>games—this is still FromSoftware—but rather than dark fantasy, <em>Bloodborne </em>evokes true horror. That happens both in the grotesque monster designs you encounter during its difficult fights but also in its story of cosmic dread and humanity’s overambition.</p></div><div><p>Cosmic horror will—for better and worse—always be synonymous with H.P. Lovecraft. One of the author’s most famous creations, Cthulhu, has even spawned a fantastic tabletop RPG, on which the video game <em>Call of Cthulhu</em> is based. That video game is a great translation of Lovecraftian cosmic horror thanks to its emphasis on sanity. As you progress, you’ll slowly lose your mind, but before you do that you’ll be out to work as a detective. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-the-kotaku-review-1695227854&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-the-kotaku-review-1695227854"><em>Call of Cthulhu</em></a></span> lets you choose your background, which then opens up different dialogue options during investigations.
