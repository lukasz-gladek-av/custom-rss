              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-round-up-switch-2-metacritic-2000635309"><em>Pokémon Legends Z-A,</em></a> the newest entry in the long-running Nintendo RPG franchise, is officially out today on Switch and Switch 2. And while many are excited to hop in and start catching pocket monsters, many fans aren’t happy with <em>Z-A</em>‘s small and boring map, which lacks the environmental variety found in past <em>Pokémon</em> games.</p> <p>While <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A&nbsp;</em>technically didn’t launch until today, October 16, fans have been playing leaked versions of the game for <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-leaks-switch-2-image-mega-evolution-2000630717">a few weeks now</a> and have begun sharing their thoughts online about the game’s map, which is the entirety of Lumiose City, located in the Kalos region. This location first appeared in 2013’s <em>Pokémon X </em>and <em>Y.&nbsp;</em>In those games, Lumiose City was just one of many locations included in the large open world. However, in <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shiny-hunting-despawn-sound-effect-2000636142">Z-A</a>,</em> Lumiose City is essentially the entire playspace, and that’s proving to be a disappointing fact for some players.</p>

 <p>Over on the <em>Pokémon</em> subreddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1o7tmfh/it_takes_less_than_7_minutes_to_run_the/?share_id=JYaiqjNJddNjichD9iq1V&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">a popular post with over 3,000 upvotes claims</a> that you can walk around the entire city in less than seven minutes. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-long-does-it-take-to-run-around-the-entire-pokemon-legends-z-a-map-weve-tested-it-and-its-shorter-that-youd-think"><em>Eurogamer</em></a> tested this out and confirmed that, yes, if you sprint around and avoid battles, you can run around the whole circular city in just about six minutes and 20 seconds. Now, a smaller map isn’t entirely a bad thing. Some open worlds don’t need much space to be wonderful. <em>Grand Theft Auto 3</em> feels pretty dang small when you go back to it in 2025, but it packs a lot in its limited sandbox. However,<em> Z-A’s</em> map isn’t just small, it also lacks visual variety. This is demonstrated perfectly <a href="https://youtu.be/Q-HGlHqkd3M">in this short video from YouTuber 101Leafy.&nbsp;</a></p>

  <p>On Reddit and YouTube, you can find comments from players lamenting the small map’s lack of visual variety. For a franchise that used to be about discovering new cities, towns, biomes, and environments, <em>Z-A</em>‘s focus on one city, filled with reused buildings and props, is disappointing to many. And while some of the complaints are clearly from fans who have long been done with the series but can’t stop torturing themselves, the more you look at screenshots and videos of <em>Z-A</em>, the more it becomes clear that, yeah, there ain’t much here.</p> <p>At least if you buy the game on Switch, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-switch-2-comparison-framerate-upgrade-2000635404">it mostly looks the same as the Switch 2 version</a>. Don’t worry, everyone gets to enjoy the same copy-pasted buildings regardless of their platform of choice. That’s nice.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-odds-scarlet-violet-ivs-red-gyarados-1850248457"><span>Shiny hunting</span></a><span> is a beloved pastime for many </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans. Finding these rare critters with different shades and color palettes than their species’ default appearance is such an involved undertaking with secret math and other nonsense to contend with that some people spend hours looking for just one of these guys. Others spend even longer trying to find one of every ‘mon in the Pokédex. </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is out today, and players have discovered the RPG has made one crucial change to Shiny hunting that has taken some of the difficulty out of this process, and while some fans are rejoicing, others are lamenting how much easier it’s gotten to capture these alternate-colored Pokémon.</span></p> <p><span>When you enter </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s Wild Zones, designated areas where wild Pokémon live and can be captured, typically every monster you encounter is refreshed when the game’s day and night cycle changes, your party is knocked out, or if you fast travel. However, that doesn’t seem to be the case for Shinies. Players have tested this on Pokémon they’ve found in the overworld, and it seems like, unless you defeat it in battle, Shiny Pokémon don’t despawn.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I found a Shiny Magikarp. I changed to nighttime to make it disappear and back to daytime and it was still there. </p> <p>I fast traveled away and back and it was still there. </p> <p>I had my character knocked out and came back and it was still there. </p> <p>Enjoy <a href="https://t.co/tA42rUM9iv">pic.twitter.com/tA42rUM9iv</a></p> <p>— SBCoop (@SBCoop89) <a href="https://twitter.com/SBCoop89/status/1978582662752178301?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">LZA has special behavior to keep shiny Pokémon from despawning! This looks to be intentional. The game stashes up to 10 shiny Pokémon and keeps them from despawning if you leave the area.</p> <p>Essentially, nonshinies are rerolled but shinies are not, as you can see here in this clip. <a href="https://t.co/FHo3uqAR7R">pic.twitter.com/FHo3uqAR7R</a></p> <p>— Anubis (@Sibuna_Switch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sibuna_Switch/status/1978821040026329409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">can confirm this too! 🤯</p> <p>I thought i accidentally depsawned a shiny cuz the sound played after i was already walking up the stairs to a new area – went back down and it was still there!!</p> <p>love that they added a shiny failsafe! this is HUGE<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PokemonLegendsZA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PokemonLegendsZA</a> <a href="https://t.co/0OroFXjVuc">https://t.co/0OroFXjVuc</a> <a href="https://t.co/F6DG8XvvDk">pic.twitter.com/F6DG8XvvDk</a></p> <p>— Junzz (@junzztv) <a href="https://twitter.com/junzztv/status/1978640948528545830?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>This means that there’s now significantly less risk during Shiny hunting, as </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>goes out of its way to make sure you have a chance to engage with these monsters before they disappear forever. It is still possible to lose out on a Shiny, though. If you knock it out or if you scare a skittish Pokémon off, that’s that. So </span><i><span>some </span></i><span>risk does remain.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>As Shiny hunting has become easier thanks to items like the Shiny Charm, which increases their (still minuscule) spawn rates, longtime fans have stopped seeing collecting these rare Pokémon as a badge of honor, while others are just glad that they’ve become less frustrating to catch. Missing out on a Shiny can feel devastating, and fucking it up may lead to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-hunting-treecko-stream-two-reset-aelfgar-1851588124"><span>viral moments</span></a><span>, but would you rather have a funny story or a Shiny Pokémon in your collection?</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This isn't just a quality-of-life update. It's the death of a legend.</p> <p>The thrill of finding a shiny was always magnified by the heartbreaking risk of losing it.</p> <p>By removing the risk, they have guaranteed the reward.

Now, if a Shiny Pokémon spawns nearby, you’ll hear a short jingle to signal to you that it’s somewhere in your vicinity. It always felt weird that </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet </span></i><span>skipped out on a feature that was especially helpful for colorblind players who might not be able to clock a Shiny at first glance, so it’s nice to see </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>bring it back.</span></p>
