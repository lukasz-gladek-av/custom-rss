              <p>The latest update for&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em> begins with an apology. Recognizing that communication with players hasn’t been Funcom’s strong suit of late, the developer explains that it’s in part because of “state mandated” vacations.</p> <p>“I apologize if people feel the communication around issues with the game has been lacking,” says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/515218419125060312">the latest update posted to Steam</a> (thanks,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/dune-awakening-promises-an-endgame-overhaul-and-says-communication-has-been-bad-because-developers-had-state-mandated-vacations/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>). “We are focused on improving this. With a percentage of the team having their well-earned (and state mandated) vacations, customer service and the community team have not always had access to developers who can answer their every question.”</p> <p>If you’ve ever been on a trip to Norway (and Sweden) during July, you’ll have learned the hard way (I speak from experience) that <em>everything is closed</em>. This is a result of <em>fellesferie</em>, the annual summer “common holidays” where just about everyone takes their vacation at the same time. Which is quite mad, but for Norwegians, entirely ordinary. It’s normal for offices to just close down in July, and people who do persist in working during the month will struggle if they rely on suoport from their colleagues. It appears to be <em>fellesferie</em><em>&nbsp;</em>that’s affected&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>.</p>

 <p>Regarding the enforced nature of these vacations, Norway has something called the The Holiday Act, that mandates all employees receive 25 days of vacation a year, meaning it’s even more tricky to prevent an entire team all disappearing off at once.</p> <p>“We’ve been playing whack-a-mole with bugs, cheats and exploits during the July month of summer,” says Funcom. “We’ve banned thousands of cheaters, fixed a bunch of duplication and exploit bugs and continued working on the stability of the game. We’ve been working to achieve a cadence of patches that allows us time to make stable and consistent fixes, while being fast enough to address issues like exploits before they get too far out of control. Live Game development is a blend of reactivity and long term planning.”</p> <figure id="attachment_2000618409" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618409"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618409">© Funcom</figcaption></figure> <p>While players have loved <em>Awakening</em>, there’s been a lot of dissatisfaction around what there is to do once the main content is finished. Funcom explains that its Gamescom news is going to be focused on the Chapter 2 Free Update and The Lost Harvest DLC, neither of which will affect the endgame, saying, “this is because Chapter 2 and the DLC were planned and began development before launch.” But, it goes on to list what’s happening in the later stages.</p>

 <p>It seems the big problem facing Funcom, other than an empty office, is that&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em> has drawn in what it describes as “very different demographics,” who all want something different from the MMO’s endgame. However, the issues are boiled down to “loss of items/vehicles, players feeling that they are forced into PvP, exploits and cheats, and lack of endgame content/grind.” Arriving soon are the following changes:</p> <ul> <li> <p><b>Improved Player Logging</b>&nbsp;– One of the key frustrations we see is the lack of information and clarity around why certain items/objects/vehicles are gone. We will increase the information in your logs so that you have a better idea of what is going on. For example, listing the names of people who take things from chests in your base.&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p><b>Vehicle Salvaging System</b>&nbsp;– We’re working on a vehicle salvaging system that will allow you to recover lost vehicles.&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p><b>Cobalt Paste/Vehicle Inventory&nbsp;</b>– We’re adjusting the volume of the infamous cobalt paste and adding more slots to the Assault Ornithopter vehicle inventory. We will be adding a cargo container that can be carried by the Carrier Ornithopter.&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p><b>Instanced Deep Desert Loot</b>&nbsp;– The constant camping and queuing of the Deep Desert Testing Stations leads to a frustrating experience where people arrive at an empty Testing Station. We’re going to change these to be more in line with the rest of the game.&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> </ul> <ul> <li> <p><b>Offline Notifications about important events&nbsp;</b>– We understand that not everybody can or wants to log in to check power/taxes constantly in the game. We would like to create a notification service that sends you the status of your base via email. This one is squarely aimed at you, Ben.</p> </li> </ul> <p>The post then continues with longer-term plans for endgame content:</p> <blockquote> <p>As we’ve mentioned previously, the Landsraad is supposed to be the endgame activity driver. Currently it does not have the breadth or depth of content or progression to serve that function. As we work towards Chapter 3, we will begin to tie the faction progression of the game to the Landsraad, while also systematically building out the Landsraad with a greater variety of activities across the world.&nbsp;<wbr></p> <p>As a player this means that you can increase your faction rank by completing Landsraad tasks, checking in with your Duke or Baron occasionally to perform special missions and visit faction vendors.&nbsp;<wbr></p> <p>Landsraad activities will become contract based, rather than delivery based, which will allow us to effectively remove the issue of stockpiling that is currently endemic in the game.&nbsp;<wbr></p> <p>This ensures that people are rewarded for solo play (as well as making contributions easier for them to track) and will give you many choices in how you progress over time.&nbsp;<wbr></p> <p>As for the planned activities, we have plenty in mind in addition to the current testing stations and shipwrecks. The following list contains examples, and not promises, as these will take work and time to deliver. But currently we are thinking of things like: Assassinations, Treasure Maps, Races, Construction Challenges, Duels, Faction vs Faction maps, Improved control points, Scavenger Hunts, Temporary Crafting Challenges etc.&nbsp;<wbr></p> <p>These activities will make use of the Overland Map, spawning in new maps as required. We have always wanted to flesh out the Overland Map over time, and this will boost that along.</p> <p>Of course, we are open to your suggestions so please share with us on social media the kinds of activities you would like to see in the Landsraad.&nbsp;<wbr></p> <p>As the Landsraad activities become more fleshed out, we will then transition the Deep Desert back towards the original intention – a sandbox area where players can compete for control of the spice. We will continue to iterate on the Deep Desert – adding no-fly zones to enforce ground combat, adding more layouts with more variety and challenge, and ensuring that there is clear progression. In addition, we are experimenting with the tech behind the Deep Desert and if things go well, you will experience the Deep Desert in a much more stable environment.</p> </blockquote> <p>This will apparently be the focus for the rest of 2025, now everyone’s back in the office. Before they all take off again for Christmas.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><span>I never really think of </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </span></i><span>as a great game for recreating other movies and music videos until I see the lengths some creators go to use Nintendo’s life sim as their movie studio. I’ve been obsessed with Netflix’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span> for the past month, and several nights a week I’ll find myself scrolling through my feeds looking for reaction videos, covers, and other indulgences to feed my ongoing brainrot. Now, I’ve found an </span><i><span>Animal Crossing </span></i><span>channel that is recreating all the movie’s musical numbers in </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span>, and I’m mostly just surprised at the creative solutions they came up with to make up for the game’s lack of fantasy weaponry and demons.</span></p> <p><span>Anyone who’s played </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </span></i><span>knows that it has some pretty robust creative options in terms of outfit design, character customization, and even set creation. Where the challenge lies in recreating something like a </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>music video is in finding animations, items, and characters that can at least somewhat emulate things that don’t exist in the game. YouTuber Magic Studios, who has recreated almost every musical moment in the film, has managed to use the tools in </span><i><span>New Horizons </span></i><span>to creatively represent actions like demon fighting and skydiving from a busted plane, and, to the best of their ability, tried to capture the film’s choreography.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="✨K-Pop Demon Hunters: What It Sounds Like (An ACNH Music Video)✨" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fKk9WeRNXxg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Some of the most clever details will likely hit hardest for people who have both seen the movie and put an exorbitant amount of time into perfecting their </span><i><span>New Horizons </span></i><span>island, such as the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-tom-nook-is-misunderstood-506751609"><span>money-loving tanuki Tom Nook</span></a><span> representing Gwi-ma, the demon king final boss that the Kpop girl group Huntr/x faces in the finale. My favorite part of these videos, however, is seeing how Magic Studios recreated different costumes for both the main cast and side characters using </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span>’ Custom Designs feature. Some videos are more elaborate than others, like the “Golden” music video which faithfully recreates the movie’s pre-performance hype cycle as the girls are promoting the upcoming single.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="✨K-Pop Demon Hunters: GOLDEN (An ACNH Music Video)✨" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/arDp3X_5lyg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>You can check out all of Magic Studios’ </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span> videos </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@magicstudios7112"><span>on their channel</span></a><span>. The film is streaming on Netflix and is now the </span><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/most-popular"><span>second-most-popular movie ever on the platform</span></a><span>. If you can still grab tickets, Netflix is putting the movie in theaters this weekend for a limited-time sing-along event.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kirby-air-riders-looks-like-way-more-than-just-another-switch-2-racing-game.1273695/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>A 45-minute deep-dive into <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-nintendo-direct-mario-donkey-kong-1851774194"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a> revealed all the ways it’s setting itself apart from other kart racers. While director Masahiro Sakurai began <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-kirby-air-riders-smash-bros-sakurai-2000618190">the latest Nintendo Direct</a> by joking that his new Switch 2 exclusive is basically <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-free-roam-open-world-burnout-paradise-1851776569">just <em>Mario Kart</em></a>, everything that followed built the case for why it’s actually much more. Essentially a<em> Kirby Air Riders</em> Let’s Play starring the <em>Smash Bros.</em> director himself, the showcase revealed new modes, mechanics, and the game’s release date.</p> <p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> will come to Switch 2 on November 22. In addition to the main racing mode, it’ll also feature a series of other contests, from time trials to a destruction mode that looks an awful lot like <em>Twisted Meta</em>l. The menus and sound effects look <a href="https://kotaku.com/smash-bros-sakurai-youtube-sequel-switch-2-1851678195">straight out of <em>Smash Bros. Ultimate</em></a>, including the win screen that shows characters applauding. The entire showcase even ended with a surprise reveal for what seems to be a new Kirby character that looks like Meta Knight if he were dragged out of an alternate, post-apocalyptic dimension.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Kirby Air Riders Direct – 19/08/2025" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gn5c4RkoYAc?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The main attraction in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is the titular Air Riders mode. While it’s structured much like the original GameCube release back in 2003, a second button has been added to the control scheme. In addition to pressing a button to drift around corners and building up boost, characters also have access to a special ability that can be unleashed to speed up or attack other players. The courses are also bigger this time around to accommodate more racers, with an updated roster and vehicle garage for players to mix and match with.</p>

 <p>The returning City Trials mode looked with up to 16 players this time looks far more interesting. Like <em>Mario Kart World,</em> it drops you into a big sandbox where you drive around exploring and collecting power-ups. Random events then spawn that you can join to compete in with your upgraded vehicle. The challenges range from battles to gobbling up as much food on the map as possible. There are also mini-games reminiscent of hitting the sandbag in Smash Bros., with players aiming and flinging themselves at a wall of different scoring cubes to rack up points.</p> <p>Whether that’s all enough to make <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> feel like the big November release the Switch 2 deserves remains to be seen. It’ll arrive just a month after <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, and we still don’t know when<em> Metroid Prime 4</em> is coming out. Sakurai ended his stream saying that there’s still more to reveal in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, hinting at another Nintendo Direct coming sometime in the fall. In the meantime, it would be great to get the GameCube version on Switch Online.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> latest update has given players plenty of new things to do, from grinding for new talismans to trying not to die to the new 9-star boss fights. But players on PC are still struggling with poor performance optimization, and Capcom now says no major fixes will be ready until the winter.</p> <p><span>“To our hunters playing <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> </span><span>on PC, we’re committed to listening to your feedback and improving both performance and stability of the game,” an update posted on X on August 18 <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1957473035885121806">reads</a>. “Although we will continue to implement gradual improvements in the weeks ahead, we are targeting Free Title Update 4 this winter to implement a multifaceted plan, including CPU and GPU related optimizations, followed by a second stage of mitigation measures afterwards. We’ll share more information on the specifics in the future.”</span></p> <p>The response from fans so far has been less than stellar. “It’s not normal to wait one year to get at least a small optimization for PC players,” wrote one. “We are paying for stability and performance as the same time free updates. I have a war machine and i have to play everything on LOW hoping it’s going well.” Another posted, “Love MHWilds I really do, but waiting almost a year for the game to run at least a little better is a bit crazy.”</p>

 <p>Similar sentiments have been echoed across the game’s subreddit and recent Steam reviews where <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> still sits at just 25 percent, up from an all-time low earlier in the summer, but still far from where the overwhelmingly positive ratings other recent entries in the series sit. While not everyone’s facing issues, people on a range of machines are still reporting crashes, ugly textures, and unstable framerates even at 30fps.</p> <p>There’s currently a new Title Update 3 scheduled for September to add a new monster and more balance adjustments to combat and progression, followed by Title Update 4 in the winter. There’s also the game’s first expansion, which new <em>Monster Hunter</em> entries tend to get 12-18 months after they ship. It’ll be a make-or-break moment for the players on PC who feel like the last six months have been closer to an Early Access experience.</p>
