Registration will open tomorrow, January 17, at noon PT / 2 p.m. CT / 3 p.m. ET and will last until noon on January 26 local time for each city. After you’ve registered, you’ll have to wait until April, as the events themselves will be staggered across all three cities during the month. The full schedule is as follows:</p><h3 id="h28982"><a id=""></a><strong>New York</strong></h3><p><strong>April 4 – April 6</strong></p><p>Center415</p><p>417 5th Ave</p><p>New York, NY 10016</p><h3 id="h28983"><a id=""></a><strong>Los Angeles</strong></h3><p><strong>April 11 – April 13</strong></p><p>Television City</p><p>7800 Beverly Blvd</p><p>Los Angeles, CA 90036</p><h3 id="h28984"><a id=""></a><strong>Dallas</strong></h3><p><strong>April 25 – April 27</strong></p><p>Embarcadero Building at Fair Park</p><p>1229 Admiral Nimitz Dr.</p><p>Dallas, TX 75210</p><p>Registration won’t be enough, however, as the official website says that tickets will be distributed through a randomly selected drawing. So keep that in mind as you register—it’s not a race. Nintendo says that being one of the first to register won’t increase your chances, as “everyone who registers will have an equal chance of being selected.” Also, you’ll need a Nintendo account.</p><p>Right now, we don’t have any clue as to what games might be playable at the event beyond what looks like <em>Mario Kart 9</em>, but we’ll know more about the system just days before the New York event when Nintendo holds <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-release-date-april-2025-1851740848">a Direct showcase for the system on April 2</a></span>.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After a waterfall of leaks, it was expected that the Japanese company would make an announcement for the official reveal this week, and then went and threw everyone by just surprise-announcing it at 8 a.m. ET without warning. Within that announcement was a screen showing a date for a new Nintendo Direct.</p><p>This will be the first Nintendo Direct since July 2024, the <em>Mario</em> makers having entirely skipped their usual September edition, which only fueled confusion over what was happening with the Switch 2. It’s described as being for the “Nintendo Switch 2,” but doesn’t make clear if this will be purely detailing the console itself (which many had hoped would already be available by April), or games that will be available for it too.</p><p><em>Mario Kart 9</em>, already widely expected to be a release title (given it’s been an extraordinary 11 years since <em>8</em> first came out), <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-9-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-trailer-1851740833&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-9-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-trailer-1851740833">is pretty certain to be among them</a></span>, but fans are obviously hoping to see a new tentpole <em>Super Mario</em> title, given it’s been well over seven years since <em>Odyssey</em> shifted the original Switch.</p><p>We know that Switch 1 (as we’ll have to get used to calling it now) games will mostly work on the new system, both physical and digital editions, but obviously there’s going to be great clamor for brand new titles that’ll take advantage of the new system specs which will also hopefully be fully revealed before or during the Direct.</p><p>Best guess: the Direct will be pre-empted with a lot of leaks from stores about dummy boxes and stock expectations for the Switch 2 itself, with a release date revealed in the Direct broadcast. Maybe early May? Please don’t be later than that, Nintendo.</p><p>Until then, more speculating, rumor-pondering and thumb-twiddling.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
