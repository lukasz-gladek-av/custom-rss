              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/one-of-ffxivs-most-important-mods-is-shutting-down-and-people-are-losing-it-2000619228"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></a> came out over a decade ago and has been running on PlayStation 4 since soon after it launched. Sony’s last-gen hardware won’t be able to support Square Enix’s MMORPG forever, though, and director Naoki “Yoshi-P” Yoshida recently explained why.</p> <p>“My basic stance is that I do want to continue supporting hardware which has grown old,” he said in <a href="https://feed4gamers.com/game-news/317170/final-fantasy-xiv-s-next-chapters-an-exclusive-talk-with-yoshi-p.htm">an interview with Feed4Gamers</a> (via <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/107343/sony-loosens-ps4-os-rules-for-final-fantasy-xiv-but-the-mmorpg-may-be-forced-to-drop-ps4-soon/index.html">TweakTown</a>). “But I do have one concern, and that’s regarding the OS of the PlayStation 4, and this is regarding the hardware regulations which were made by Sony. These regulations are related to the limit of the data, and because there’s that limit of the data, well, we are continually incorporating updates for <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> and we are now approaching that limit.”</p> <p>He continued:</p> <blockquote><p>And so for this limit that’s in place, we have been asking Sony Interactive Entertainment from our side to increase that just for <em>Final Fantasy 14</em>, and they have kindly been doing that so far. But they’ve told us now that they are also reaching their limits. So I will repeat myself: I do want to provide support for platforms as long as possible. However, there will eventually come a time when the hardware is at its limits in terms of its technology, and at that point in time we would have to provide an end to the service on that hardware. But I will be sure to provide clear reasoning for that decision when I communicate it to the players.</p></blockquote> <p>According to Yoshida, Sony’s already been making exceptions to its standard developer rules in order to accommodate new content for <em>FF14</em>. The game has received several major updates since last year’s <em>Dawntrail</em> expansion, including this month’s patch 7.3, The Promise of Tomorrow. It’s unclear just how much wiggle room is still left for further upgrades and content drops.</p>

 <h2>When is<em> Final Fantasy 14</em>‘s next expansion coming?</h2> <p>Square Enix has been cagey on the timing of its next expansion, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxivdiscussion/comments/1m2cj8g/fan_fest_schedule_still_not_announced_80/">with speculation from some fans</a> that it could arrive as late as spring 2027. Yoshida teased that there will at least be an update on the date for FF14 Fan Fest 2026 on the 10-year anniversary of <em>A Realm Reborn</em> this week.</p> <p>Other big multiplayer games <a href="https://kotaku.com/well-bad-news-for-pubg-players-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-2000617500">like <em>PUBG</em></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/genshin-impact-ps4-ps5-hoyoverse-support-2000615960">and <em>Genshin Impact</em></a> are both dropping support for last-gen consoles in the coming months. While<em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> is still coming to PS4 and Xbox One this fall, other big annual franchises like<em> MLB: The Show</em> and <em>Madden NFL</em> have all ditched the aging hardware. Considering we’re nearly five years into the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S lifecycles, the only surprising thing is that these moves didn’t come sooner.</p> <p>Originally released on the PS3 in 2013, <em>FF14 </em>left that console behind at the time of the <em>Stormblood</em> expansion in 2017, a departure for which Square Enix <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/57i207/ps3_support_to_end_in_40/">provided eight months of notice.</a> My guess is that update 8.0, whenever it arrives, might similarly mark the end of the MMORPG’s journey on PS4. And by that point, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-leak-specs-sony-handheld-price-release-date-2000614206">PS6 will probably be just around the corner</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Every Game Delayed By Silksong]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, after years and years of waiting, we finally got a release date for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong.</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-september-release-date-trailer-2000619152">The highly anticipated 2D action platformer is out next week</a>, which is exciting for fans, but it is proving to be a problem for a number of indie studios that were planning to release their own games around that time. A bunch of games are being delayed to avoid <em>Silksong</em>.</p> <p>On August 21, <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-interview-delay-hollow-knight-team-cherry-2000619168">Team Cherry announced that its <em>Hollow Knight</em> sequel, <em>Silksong,</em></a> will launch on PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, Switch 2, and PC on September 4. That blew up the schedules for a number of indie devs and publishers who had staked out a release date around that time and were now suddenly competing directly with what will likely be one of the biggest games of 2025. So, as you might expect, a lot of these devs and publishers have started announcing delays to get out of <em>Silksong</em>‘s way. This has become known as getting “Silksong’d” or “Silksonged.”</p> <p>Here’s the full list of games that have announced delays and blamed it on <em>Silksong</em>. We’ll update this list if more games get moved back.</p> <ul> <li><em>Demonschool</em> – <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1900250/Demonschool/">Delayed to November 19</a></li> <li><em>Aeterna Lucis</em> – <a href="https://x.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579">Delayed until 2026</a></li> <li><em>Little Witch In The Woods</em> – <a href="https://x.com/SunnySideUp_DEV/status/1960291045528547599">Delayed to September 15</a></li> <li><em>CloverPit</em> – <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314790/CloverPit/">Delayed to September 26</a></li> <li><em>Megabonk</em> – <a href="https://x.com/MegabonkGame/status/1959235591154872547">Delayed to September 18</a></li> <li><em>Baby Steps</em> – <a href="https://youtu.be/l5apDFK64tI">Delayed to September 23</a></li> </ul> <p>Of course, as more games are delayed to the week or so after <em>Silksong</em>, they all start running into each other, which might be its own problem. But I bet it’s more manageable than having to take on one of the most anticipated games of 2025 directly. And hey, some of these games I had never heard of before, and now I’m writing about them on <em>Kotaku</em>. So perhaps there’s another reason to announce a delay and jump on the “Silksong’d” bandwagon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>After two months on the streaming service, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i></a><span>has officially surpassed </span><i><span>Red Notice</span></i><span> to become </span><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/most-popular"><span>Netflix’s most popular movie ever</span></a><span>. Consider the Honmoon sealed, hunters.</span></p> <p><span>The animated musical took the crown on August 26, lapping the Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson and Ryan Reynolds-led action comedy by six million streams. As of right now, </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>has been viewed 236 million times, and that’s not even counting its <a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-jinu-death-memorial-anime-expo-rumi-2000620346">limited-time singalong screenings</a> in movie theaters this past weekend.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I hadn’t really been paying attention to what the most popular Netflix movies were until the Sony Animation film launched in June, but I was flabbergasted to see </span><i><span>Red Notice</span></i><span>, a movie with big names and no notable cultural cache, had such a massive gap between it and former runner-up </span><i><span>Carry On</span></i><span>, another movie I could not identify if you put a gun to my head. I know </span><i><span>Don’t Look Up </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Bird Box</span></i><span>, though, which are also on the top 10 list. Shoutout to the children and families who have had Huntr/x’s tale on loop for the past two months, as you’ve no doubt been instrumental in securing this victory.</span></p> <p><span>As a fan of the film, I’m happy to see </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span> soar, especially as it defies all expectations the companies behind it had for it. It’s such a colossal miscalculation on Sony and Netflix’s parts that they clearly didn’t anticipate this film would become <a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-jinu-death-memorial-anime-expo-rumi-2000620346">such a cultural juggernaut</a>. A better-prepared company would have dolls of the titular trio in the toy aisle of every store and costumes up for preorder for Halloween, and given the film more time in theaters than a two-day limited run. Nevertheless, it has become a huge hit with viewers of all ages. So long as Netflix lets the team cook and meaningfully continue the story, I can’t wait to see where it goes next.</span></p>

Swift announced their engagement on her Instagram account with the caption, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.” While the comments are turned off (as they are with every post on her profile), as you can imagine, the internet is losing its mind. “Why are you writing about Taylor Swift on a video game website?” </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-shakes-her-polys-in-band-hero-5329622"><span>She was in </span><i><span>Band Hero</span></i></a><span>, leave me alone.</span></p> <p><span>Love them, hate them, or feel nothing for them, Swift and Kelce are America’s sweethearts. The general public is already greatly invested in Swift’s love life, since her songs and the mythos around her have etched the 35-year-old pop star’s romantic ups and downs into modern pop culture folklore, and seeing her in a relationship that seemingly lacks the kinds of dramatic complications you write albums about has prompted fans to root for this relationship to be the one that works out. A lot of people have been tuned into the lore for years, and for those who have treated Swift’s love life as a story they’ve been watching unfold, it’s basically like watching a slow-burn romance finally reach its next stage.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">me telling everyone I know that Taylor Swift got engaged <a href="https://t.co/MpS8BLPOZj">pic.twitter.com/MpS8BLPOZj</a></p> <p>— Siobhan ✨ (@Siobachka) <a href="https://twitter.com/Siobachka/status/1960389888366219708?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I AM SO HAPPY FOR MY CLOSE AND PERSONAL FRIEND TAYLOR SWIFT <a href="https://t.co/O2gBDwphSa">pic.twitter.com/O2gBDwphSa</a></p> <p>— pippa (@piptweets) <a href="https://twitter.com/piptweets/status/1960388307847631020?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">literally crying for my close and personal friend taylor swift <a href="https://t.co/65TZrdVhVq">pic.twitter.com/65TZrdVhVq</a></p> <p>— burcu ❤️‍🔥 (@thatsoburcu) <a href="https://twitter.com/thatsoburcu/status/1960388498931769581?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">taylor is finally living her fairytale dreams that she would write songs about as a teenager someone SEDATE ME <a href="https://t.co/NcQraMZkUZ">pic.twitter.com/NcQraMZkUZ</a></p> <p>— Taylor Swift Updates (@SwiftNYC) <a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftNYC/status/1960391657104294356?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">how do i explain to my nervous system that i’m not being held at gunpoint and it’s just taylor swift announced her engagement?

This may change in October when she releases her next record, </span><i><span>The Life of a Showgirl</span></i><span>, which is her first album to be recorded entirely during the two’s relationship. Swift announced the album on Kelce’s podcast </span><i><span>New Heights</span></i><span>, and described it as “exuberant and electric and vibrant,” a stark contrast from the moodier and more introspective </span><i><span>Tortured Poets Department</span></i><span>. The album will launch on October 3.</span></p>
