On mobile devices, the game is free-to-play with microtransactions. Which isn’t great, but it’s hardly unexpected from a mobile game meant to make you check in with daily puzzles and challenges (and maybe spend a buck or two). Where things get weird, however, is that the Switch version is a $10 purchase, but still has all the microtransaction elements intact.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,195905,196646" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-friends-switch/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/pokemon-friends-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Basic Pack”</a></span> on Nintendo’s console includes “30 puzzles, 70 craftable plush, and all 11 yarn types.” On top of this, there are two “Puzzle On!” packs that cost $15 each, or you can buy them together for $26.

The intended trade-off here seems to be that you can play <em>Pokémon Friends</em> on your Switch without ever being hit with a puzzle limit, but you lose the chance to try the game out to see if you even like the thing, as you can do on your phone. We’ve reached out to The Pokémon Company for comment and will update the story if we hear back.</p><p><em>Pokémon Friends </em>was one of the only real reveals during today’s Pokémon Presents showcase, but there was plenty of other news about the company’s already-known mobile games, a new look at the next season of <em>Pokémon Concierge</em>, and a breakdown of the story and characters of <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-friends-switch-price-free-microtransactions-1851786692]]></content:encoded>

I hope for <em>Pokémon</em> fans’ sakes Nintendo made a lot of them.</p><p>Of course, you don’t actually need a Switch 2 to play <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>. The latest entry in the franchise will also be available on the old Switch, though given the performance issues around 2023's <em>Pokémon Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>, who knows how playable it will actually look and feel on the old hardware?<br></p><p>But while the Switch 2 was harder to recommend at launch in June <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-launch-lineup-single-player-mario-3d-mkw-1851784352&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-launch-lineup-single-player-mario-3d-mkw-1851784352">when<em> Mario Kart World</em></a></span> was the only real thing going for it, the case for it will be much easier to make come the fall.

My guess is it lands in September, followed by <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> (a Switch 2 exclusive) in November, but Nintendo still hasn’t confirmed exact dates. </p><p>Regardless, the new hardware should have a better library by then, especially if other third-party ports like Borderlands 4 are able to land before the end of the year. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-bundle-pokemon-legends-za-preorder-cheap-1851786686]]></content:encoded>

This is usually where we get a bunch of updates on live-service games like <em>Pokémon Unite</em>, <em>TCG Pocket</em>, and <em>Go</em>, as well as a more substantial look at whatever RPG is in development over at Game Freak. As expected, <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A </em>made an appearance, and there were a few surprises along the way. If you want to watch the full presentation you can do so below, but if you just want the highlights, read on.</p><h2 id="h408274"><a id=""></a></h2></div></div><div><p>The stream began with a pre-show of sorts with a DJ set hosted by a pair of DJs Pikachu. (Much like “attorneys general,” DJs Pikachu is the correct plural here.) The music selections included some pretty rad electronic remixes of classic <em>Pokémon </em>music. Release the tracks on streaming, TPC!</p></div><div><p>Kicking off the Presents is a look at the next season of <em>Pokémon Concierge</em>, the amazing stop-motion show on Netflix. Haru is still working at the resort and has an unruly Sealeo to take care of, but she also has to deal with her ex-boyfriend Kent showing up. The show looks just as wholesome and soul-cleansing as season one. The new episodes will premiere on Netflix on September 4. </p></div><div><p>A new stop-motion series is also in development called <em>The Misadventures of Sirfetch’d &amp; Pichu. </em>The charming teaser features a Wooloo calmly grazing as all kinds of Pokemon-related shenanigans are happening just out of view.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ba787347bc13d74ee02d2787ce47215a" data-recommend-id="image://ba787347bc13d74ee02d2787ce47215a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1799" data-height="1013" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The art for PokePark Kanto." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The art for PokePark Kanto." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ba787347bc13d74ee02d2787ce47215a" data-recommend-id="image://ba787347bc13d74ee02d2787ce47215a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1799" data-height="1013" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The art for PokePark Kanto." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A new outdoor attraction is opening up in Japan. Made to look like a real forest and town featuring statues and attractions based on Pokémon, it’s set to open in 2026. Tickets will go on sale later this year.</p></div><div><p>Now for the game updates. <em>Pokemon Go</em>’s next Go Fest event, Max Finale, will take place on August 23 and 24, and will feature Max Pokemon, including Eternatus.</p></div><div><p>We didn’t see much of <em>Pokémon Masters EX</em> this time, but Carmine &amp; Sinistcha will join the game on July 29 as a sync pair.</p></div><div><p>A bunch of pirate-themed characters and cosmetics are coming to the puzzle game/management sim <em>Pokémon Cafe ReMix</em>, including a captain outfit for Lapras, Alolan Meowth, Totodile, and Minccino. You can also recruit a summer-themed Jigglypuff to help out at your cafe.</p></div><div><p>The Legendary Beasts are coming to <em>Pokemon Sleep</em>, so expect to see Suicune, Entei, and Raikou show up in your research in September. A new area called Amber Canyon is also coming to the game in August.</p></div><div><p>Latias is joining the MOBA <em>Pokémon Unite</em> for its fourth anniversary. Latios joined the roster on July 18, with Latias to follow on August 8. A new battle mode called Electrode Volleyball is also now available in-game.</p></div><div><p>We saw some of the new full-art Mega Evolution cards coming to the Trading Card Game, including Lucario, Gardevoir, Kangaskhan and Venusaur.</p></div><div><p>Minutes before the Presents began, a new puzzle game called <em>Pokémon Friends </em>was released on the App Store. Someone flipped a switch too early, it seems. The game centers around collecting <em>Pokémon </em>plushies by solving short puzzles in a variety of classic, traditional brainteaser formats. The game is free-to-play on mobile and apparently a $9.99 package on Switch.</p></div><div><p>After a brief mention of the game’s Switch 2 upgrades, it was announced that <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet </em>are getting new tera raids for the Treasures of Ruin, but you’ll only be able to capture them after the raids have been completed one million times across all players.</p></div><div><p>We finally saw our first footage of <em>Pokémon Champions</em>. The battle simulator includes ranked play, private battles, and a new training mode that lets you alter monster stats and move pools, and really craft your team. It’s coming to Switch and mobile in 2026.</p></div><div><p>Closing out the show is a new look at <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>. We started with a pretty slick trailer showing the main character running around the city, meeting new characters, and trying on new clothes, with their Pokémon following them around the whole time. The presentation focused on the story, cast, and what you can do in the moment-to-moment, but it also revealed one new Mega Evolution: Dragonite, which brings back some of the visual elements of its previous evolution, Dragonair, such as wings on its head and a pearl on its tail. And that was it. Alrighty then. The game looks really cool and there’s some exciting stuff here, but I was hoping for a more substantial blow-out on the rumored Mega Evolutions. Maybe they just want to keep those under wraps until the game comes out on October 16.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legends-za-champions-friends-concierge-1851786682]]></content:encoded>
