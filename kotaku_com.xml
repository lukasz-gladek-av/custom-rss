              <p>Valentine’s Day is less than a month away, and it’s the perfect excuse to tell your partner how much they mean to you. A thoughtful gift can, of course, sweeten that expression, and if you’re after something beyond flowers or chocolates – something that lets you both spend quality time together – the LEGO Art Love collectible building set deserves your attention.</p>
<p>You can create your own small version of Robert Indiana’s famous LOVE sculpture with this one, that too without paying the full price right now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6783/">It’s currently available at Amazon for just $64, down from $80, after the retailer slashed the price by 20%.</a> But as you’d expect, the offer is selling out fast. Hurry to pick one up, before it’s too late!</p>

<h2>Fun Weekend Activity</h2>
<p>This set comes with 791 pieces in total, and is based on the famous real-life sculpture with a similar design and colors (red, blue, and green). Less than 800 pieces means it won’t really be one of those massive building projects that take weeks to complete. It can be a fun weekend activity with your loved one, where you guys bond over the experience. You can take turns following the steps, or each focus on one letter, as the set comes with two building instructions. Prepare some hot chocolate, pull out a list of thoughtful questions, and get started with the thing. Before you know it, you won’t even realize how long it’s been since you last picked up your phone.</p>



<p>You can even gift it to a friend to appreciate their presence in your life, or a parent who enjoys creative activities. Once built, the model measures over 10 inches (25 cm) high, 10 inches (25 cm) wide, and 2.5 inches (6 cm) deep. It can be a great display piece anywhere you like; place it on a shelf in the living room, the dining area, or even your office to add some personality to it. The model is sure to turn some heads!</p>
<p>Getting started is straightforward. The included instruction books take you through each step of the process one-by-one. The booklets are quite easy to follow, but you can also download the LEGO Builder app for 3D instructions. The app offers zoom and rotate features that make it easy to view each block from every side.</p>
<p>The LEGO Art range features more such brick-built artworks that let you create iconic pieces and pop-culture figures. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6783/">We’re spotting quite a few sets at a discounted rate, which makes now a great time to grab the ones you’ve been eyeing for a long time.</a> As for the current discount, we’re expecting it to wrap soon. It’s best to act quickly to score the drop.</p>
