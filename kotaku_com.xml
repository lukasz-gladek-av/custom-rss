              <p>And just like that, it’s already time to start shopping around for the holiday season. Finding the right gifts for all your friends, family, and loved ones can be quite stress inducing. Sure, we like to get unique gifts catered to the recipient, but also a good gift that works across the board for everyone can be equally appreciated and save you a lot of time and effort. Just about everyone under the sun could find a good use for a portable power station. Amazon happens to hat this one from Anker on sale for a solid $70 off. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/">Anker power bank is typically sold for $150, but for a limited time, Amazon has it down by nearly 50%</a>: The price has dropped to just $79.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Emergency or Entertainment</h2>
<p>The Anker power bank is able to hold a massive capacity of 60,000mAh (or 192Wh). This much power will allow you to charge multiple devices from zero to 10%, multiple times over. It’s a great gadget to bring along for extended trips outdoors, whether its a day trip excursion or full weekend of camping. Likewise, it’s an excellent tool to have on had in an emergency situation like during a blackout or if your car has broken down on the side of the road. It’s good to be able to keep a charge phone in such events.</p>
<p>Built durably to last, the Anker portable power station has a lifespan 10 times as long as comparative models. Even after a full year of not being used, it will still have retained at least 85% of it’s charge. This way, if you are keeping it on hand in your car or in your closet in the event of an emergency, it will work for you as expected when it comes time that it’s needed.</p>



<p>The power bank includes a smart display on the front which can communicate helpful information while powering or charging your devices. It can be set to show the power station’s battery life, input and output power, remaining charge time, charge modes, among other data.</p>
<p>Atop the power station is an LED light which can be set to two different brightness modes. The convenient strap allows it to be easy to pick up and transport.</p>
<p>Choose between either green or gray for the Anker power bank. Both color options are on sale right now for 47% off. That brings them down from $150 to just $80, saving you $70 for a limited time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagate-20tb-hdd-priced-like-peanuts-amazon-bottoms-out-at-0-01-per-gb-2000639129</link>

              <p>Between 4K videos, raw photo files, game libraries, and endless work documents, running out of storage space feels like a monthly crisis. The Seagate expansion 20TB external hard drive solves this problem in one massive swoop, and right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4615/">has slashed the price from $499 down to just $229 for both Prime and non-Prime members</a>. This early Black Friday deal <strong>beats even Seagate’s own website pricing</strong>, and here’s the kicker: you’re paying the same price you’d normally fork over for a 10TB drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4615/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Storage Meets Desktop Convenience</h2>
<p>This is not a portable drive you will slip into your pocket: The <strong>Seagate 20TB device is a desktop unit that requires its own power supply</strong>&nbsp;which gives it the muscle to deliver consistent performance for your bulkiest files. Inside the black enclosure lives a 7200 RPM Seagate <em>BarraCuda</em> drive with a 512MB cache, pushing <strong>read speeds around 246-257 MB/s and write speeds of 239-256 MB/s</strong> according to real-world testing. These numbers mean you can transfer a 50GB game in about three to four minutes, or back up your entire photo library from the past decade without aging five years in the process.</p>
<p>The <strong>drive connects via USB 3.0 using a micro-USB port</strong> and it comes pre-formatted in exFAT so both Windows and Mac machines recognize it immediately. Just plug in the included 18-inch USB cable and 18W power adapter, and you’re ready to drag and drop files without installing a single piece of software. Mac users who want to use Time Machine will need to reformat the drive, but that’s a quick one-time setup.</p>



<p>It also includes Seagate’s <em>Rescue Data Recovery Services</em>&nbsp;which means if the worst happens, <strong>you’ll have access to pro data recovery</strong>. The service covers everything from accidental deletion to physical damage; you’d need to check the fine print for limitations. You also get international power adapter plugs, which are a nice touch if you travel or switch countries. There’s a <strong>one-year limited warranty on the hardware</strong> while most external drives tend to run hot during operation, this one reportedly stays at around 55°C, which is warm but not concerning.</p>
<p>The real story here is value: While the prices of external drives have dropped, this deal presses the cost per terabyte down into territory usually reserved for smaller capacity drives. It’s large-capacity drives make sense for media professionals, gamers with massive libraries, or anyone needing to archive years of files without having cloud subscription fees eat into their budget month after month</p>
<p>This drive won’t supplant a speedy NVMe SSD for active work, but for long-term storage, or consolidating scattered files across multiple older drives, it delivers exactly what most people need.&nbsp; You’re getting a 20TB drives in one unit for $229, which means you’re paying $0.01 per GB. And this is a record low.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-the-stinky-gas-generator-jackery%E2%80%99s-1500w-power-station-is-going-for-pennies-on-amazon.1340863/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Winter has arrived, and portable power stations have become the hottest commodity on Amazon as people scramble to protect themselves from unexpected power outages. The <strong>Jackery Explorer 1000</strong> (1500W) ranks among the most popular options for backup power and this early Black Friday deal seems almost too good to be true: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5029/">has slashed the price from $839 down to $419, marking a historic 50% discount</a> that puts professional-grade emergency power within reach of anyone worried about keeping their home running during the next storm or grid failure. You’ll also get a<strong> free extension cable</strong> in the bundle.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5029/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Silent Power That Puts Gas Generators to Shame</h2>
<p>The Explorer 1000 provides <strong>1500 watts of continuous AC power and has a surge capacity of 3000 watts</strong>. This gives you sufficient power to run refrigerators, space heaters, medical equipment and multiple devices at once. The increased output can handle power-hungry appliances that once needed larger and pricier units. The pure sine wave AC outlets deliver clean power, and protect sensitive electronics like computers and gaming consoles from damage. This is in contrast to cheaper generators which can produce “dirty” power that damages circuit boards.</p>



<p>The LiFePO4 battery technology distinguishes this power station from competitors that still rely on older lithium-ion chemistry: This battery keeps over 70% of its original capacity after 4000 full charge cycles, and <strong>provides a lifespan of more than 10 years with regular use</strong>. In comparison, traditional lithium-ion batteries lose significant capacity after just 500 to 800 cycles.</p>
<p>ChargeShield 2.0 technology offers smart charging that adjusts to your needs through the Jackery smartphone app: When you need backup power quickly during an outage, the emergency charging mode<strong> takes the unit from completely dead to 100% in just one hour</strong>. For daily use, it defaults to a more conservative 1.7-hour charging time, which helps extend battery life by reducing stress on the cells. The quiet charging mode <strong>lowers operational noise to below 30 decibels</strong>, which makes it practically silent for overnight use in bedrooms or RVs, where generator noise can be a problem.</p>



<p>The included <strong>16-foot extension cord</strong> addresses one of the main issues with solar charging by allowing flexible panel placement: You can set solar panels in direct sunlight while keeping the power station shaded or inside your vehicle, maximizing charging efficiency without exposing the unit to heat. This feature is especially helpful during camping trips when the best sun angle might be far from your setup.</p>
<p>With a <strong>response time of under 20 milliseconds</strong>, the UPS functionality makes this unit a seamless backup system for home offices and essential equipment. It sits between your wall outlet and devices, switching to battery power as soon as it detects a power failure. This quick transition keeps desktop computers running without rebooting, protects fish tank pumps during outages, and ensures security cameras continue working during power interruptions.</p>



<p>The port selection accommodates all charging needs, featuring t<strong>hree AC outlets, two USB-C ports each delivering 100 watts, one USB-A port, and one 12-volt DC car port</strong>. The dual 100-watt USB-C ports charge laptops and tablets quickly without needing bulky power adapters, reducing cable clutter in your emergency kit or camping gear. The front-facing port layout simplifies connections with clear labels and LED indicators showing active outputs.</p>
<p>Despite having a capacity of 1070 watt-hours, <strong>the compact design weighs just 23.8 pounds</strong>. This makes it 18% smaller and 10% lighter than competing units with similar specs. A foldable handle on top ensures easy one-handed carrying, distributing weight evenly while moving it between rooms or loading it into vehicles. It measures 12.9 by 8.8 by 9.7 inches, making it easy to slide under seats or fit in closets without taking up too much space.</p>
<p>At $419 instead of the usual $839, this deal cuts the price in half for a power station that often comes with a high price tag. The package includes the power station, AC charging cable, extension cord, and travel case, and provides everything needed to start using it right away.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/love-and-deepspace-dark-skinned-lighting-invisible-2000640537</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/one-of-the-biggest-games-in-the-world-responds-to-criticism-that-its-dark-skinned-characters-are-%E2%80%98invisible%E2%80%99.1340836/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I am still but a tourist enjoying the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/love-and-deepspace-zayne-edge-of-continuum-sex-scene-2000627623"><span>horny fruits of the </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace </span></i><span>community’s labor</span></a><span>, so I guess it shouldn’t surprise me that there are months-long controversies and discourse within the gacha game I had never heard of. However, when I saw </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/love-and-deepspace-devs-respond-to-player-complaints-that-their-dark-skinned-custom-characters-are-invisible-in-cutscenes"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a> <span>reporting on dark-skinned custom characters being essentially “invisible” in some of its cutscenes, I was flabbergasted at how true it was, and that it’s apparently been an issue since the game launched last year.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>Something you’ll learn in film or art school is that you will sometimes have to frame shots, adjust lighting, and consider the environment of a scene depending on the subject’s skin tone. It’s why film and TV will often have stand-ins to help the crew adjust settings before an actor comes in to shoot their scenes. Unfortunately, a lot of filmmaking technology was </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d16LNHIEJzs"><span>made with only lighter skin tones in mind</span></a><span>, and so a lot of effort has gone into making sure that cameras can adjust for different shades. In games, too, some developers come up with ways of testing that lighting in scenes can work for a variety of skin tones, as Elizabeth Zelle who worked on the </span><i><span>Saints Row </span></i><span>games <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kohizeri.bsky.social/post/3m4irtnzvl22d">points out</a>.</span></p>

 <p><span>But you have to actually use those tools and accommodate for it, or you end up with scenes like those in </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace </span></i><span>in which, if you’re playing with a darker-skinned custom protagonist, you quite literally cannot see your character without upping the brightness of the image itself.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/Love_Deepspace?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Love_Deepspace</a>  for giving us darker skin players NO LIGHTING in this new card😒 <a href="https://t.co/innx60E7et">pic.twitter.com/innx60E7et</a></p> <p>— MadameSynclair (@MoonkissedMuse) <a href="https://twitter.com/MoonkissedMuse/status/1976999057332879509?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Despite the game offering players a sizable amount of customization options, </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace</span></i><span>’s lighting just isn’t optimized for darker skin tones, and publisher Infold Games has finally responded to the criticism.</span></p>

 <p><span>“At Infold Games, we’ve always believed that our games are shaped together with the players who love them,” the company said in a statement to </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>. “The community’s feedback, discussions, and creative passion are what keep </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace</span></i><span> evolving and alive. We’ve seen the conversations and truly value everyone who has taken the time to share their experiences and thoughts. Every comment, whether it’s about visuals, storytelling, or representation, helps us better understand how our work resonates across different perspectives and cultures. </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace</span></i><span> is, at its heart, a shared world of emotion and imagination. We hope to keep building it hand in hand with our players, learning and improving together along the way.”</span></p> <p><span>The statement stops short of saying that an update is coming, but Infold does at least seem aware of the criticism. Hopefully, the issue gets addressed soon. </span><i><span>Love and Deepspace </span></i><span>has millions of players worldwide, and I’m astounded it took almost two years for the company to acknowledge this. </span></p>

              <p>We survived another October, folks! The busiest month for <a href="https://kotaku.com/every-game-release-october-2025-pokemon-battlefield-ninja-gaiden-2000630373">big game releases is officially coming to a close</a> as we prepare to coast into the holiday period and the backlog season that lies beyond. And yet even now there are more great games needling their way out of the wood work at every turn. Here are three new games that came out this month that you’ve probably never heard of before and the reasons why we can’t wait to go back to playing them.</p> <p><span>***</span></p> <div> <h2 id="appHubAppName" role="heading" aria-level="1"><strong><em>Super Fantasy Kingdom</em></strong></h2>  <p role="heading" aria-level="1"><b>Play it on: </b>PC, Xbox Series X/S (on Game Pass)<b><br> </b><b>Current goal:</b> Survive for more than 20 minutes<b></b></p> </div> <p><span>It’s been a long-time coming but<em> Super Fantasy Kingdom</em> is finally out in the wild in Early Access. It’s a mashup of roguelite bullet heaven RNG and careful city planning that sort of feels like if you took an old TurboGrafx-16 RPG overworld, ratcheted-up the color saturation, and turned it into tower defense game. You search for warriors to recruit, manage your resources and kingdom’s expansion, and try to keep the enemy hordes at bay. Finding the secrets to balancing expansion and defense requires a lot of trial and error and I could see it starting to get repetitive at some point if I can’t break through to some higher tiers of strategy but for my first few brief sessions it’s kept me coming back hoping to eventually unlock the right recipe for success. — Ethan Gach</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>The Seance of Blake Manor</i></b></h2>  <p><b>Play it on: </b>PC<span><br> </span><b>Current goal: </b>Check into a spooky, isolated hotel</p> <p><span>Traditionally here in the Weekend Guide, we sing the praises of a game we’re already playing. But I’m gonna be upfront with you: I haven’t even touched </span><i><span>The Seance of Blake Manor </span></i><span>yet. It came out earlier this week and I just haven’t had time. However, I’m definitely looking forward to digging into it this weekend. I’ve seen so many folks praise this game for its puzzles and atmosphere, and a spooky, supernatural mystery that puts my powers of deduction to the test sounds like just the thing to curl up with on Halloween weekend. Over </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/the-seance-of-blake-manor-impressions/"><span>in </span><i><span>Polygon </span></i><span>this week</span></a><span>, Giovanni Colantonio called it “</span><span>an ingenious exploration of grief, occult magic, and Irish folklore that’s bound to take over your free time.” And </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dannyodwyer.bsky.social/post/3m4754qid322x"><span>on Bluesky</span></a><span>, head of Noclip and actual Irish person Danny O’Dwyer called it his “favorite game of 2025 so far” and “the best game about Irish history [he’s] ever played.”That’s high praise. So I’m off to an isolated, spooky, maybe even haunted Irish manor for the countryside. Maybe I’ll see you there, wandering the halls. – Carolyn Petit&nbsp; </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b><i>Dispatch</i></b></h2>  <p><b>Play it on: </b>PC, PS5<span><br> </span><b>Current goal: </b><span>&nbsp;Meet the team</span></p> <p><span>One nice thing about AdHoc Studios releasing </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>, its new management sim/superhero/adventure game, in pieces, is that I will have something to reliably fall back on for the </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>Weekend Guide for the next few weeks. I was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-episode-1-2-review-aaron-paul-critical-role-2000639678"><span>a bit mixed on the first two episodes</span></a><span>, but I can’t deny I’ve been jonesing to get back to it now that episodes three and four have dropped. Not to mention I keep narrowly avoiding spoilers on social media, so I can’t really afford to dilly dally. But where we last left off, </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>told me in no uncertain terms I’d be getting more face time with Robert Robertson III’s team of angry ex-villains, who I only really got to know through their radio banter in the first two episodes. So it will be nice to actually get to know them rather than making inferences based on how mean they are to me over a headset.&nbsp; — Kenneth Shepard</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A British trade union group is accusing Rockstar Games of union busting after it reportedly fired over 30 employees across offices in the UK and Canada. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-vi-new-trailer-destiny-renegades-clair-obscur-1851779967"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> maker</a> denies the charges, however, claiming the people were terminated for “gross misconduct.”</p> <p>“Rockstar has just carried out one of the most blatant and ruthless acts of union busting in the history of the games industry,” Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) president Alex Marshall said in a statement, first reported <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-31/-grand-theft-auto-studio-accused-of-union-busting-after-firings?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTkzOTg3MSwiZXhwIjoxNzYyNTQ0NjcxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNTBISEpHUFFRNkMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.9NYooKXrBMU_quRYMOSw6uACDogcIuS-E27t4GD8f2g">by <em>Bloomberg</em></a>. “This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry.”</p>

 <p>But Rockstar parent company Take-Two claims that’s not the case. “We strive to make the world’s best entertainment properties by giving our best-in-class creative teams positive work environments and ongoing career opportunities,” a spokesperson for the company said in an email to&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>. “Our culture is focused on teamwork, excellence, and kindness. Rockstar Games terminated a small number of individuals for gross misconduct, and for no other reason. As always, we fully support Rockstar’s ambitions and approach.”</p>

 <p>According to Marshall, the only people fired from Rockstar were all members of a private trade union chat group on Discord who had either signed up for IWGB membership or were thinking of doing so. While the studio is made up of thousands of employees and headquartered in New York, the biggest office is Rockstar North located in Edinburgh, Scotland.</p> <p>Best known for the <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> and <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> franchises, the studio is currently working to ship <em>GTA 6</em> after its 2025 launch was <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-may-2026-too-many-games-rockstar-trailer-2-1851778860">delayed earlier this year</a>. It’s now set to arrive in May 2026. While Rockstar Games had <a href="https://kotaku.com/inside-rockstar-games-culture-of-crunch-1829936466">a notorious history of crunching during development</a>, the company has <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-27/gta-6-release-date-rockstar-cleans-up-image-after-employee-backlash">reportedly made big strides</a> in recent years in improving its work culture. A controversial return-to-office policy, however, <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gta-rockstar-games-return-office-1851297508">showed there are still tensions</a> between developers and management at the studio.</p>

              <p>Humble Bundle deals can be hard to beat and the latest is no exception. The Indie Fears bundle features over a dozen games for less than $20, including some instant classics like last year’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/mouthwashing-steam-pc-indie-psychological-horror-1851690195"><em>Mouthwashing</em></a> and the more often <a href="https://x.com/PATALOON/status/1950454460225872347">overlooked <em>Threshold</em></a>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/indie-fears-bundle?hmb_source=&amp;hmb_medium=product_tile&amp;hmb_campaign=mosaic_section_1_layout_index_1_layout_type_threes_tile_index_1_c_indiefearsbundle_bundle">Pay at least $13</a> (or more if you want to donate something extra to the Special Effect charity for helping gamers with disabilities) and you’ll unlock PC codes for 13 games. In addition to the sci-fi mystery about crewmates stranded in space and the atmospheric horror game about an attendant at a train station in the mountains, the bundle also gets you <em>Buckshot Roulette</em>, <em>Arctic Eggs</em>, <em>Who’s Lila?</em>, <em>Order 13</em>, <em>No-Skin</em>, <em>Kiosk</em>, <em>Adios</em>, <em>The Boba Teashop</em>, <em>Daemonologie</em>, <em>Massacre at the Mirage</em>, and <em>Terror at Oakheart</em>.</p>

 <p>All of these games are highly rated on Steam, but I can personally vouch for<em> Buckshot Roulette</em> and <em>Arctic Eggs</em>, a surreal physics sim about cooking food for your fellow dissidents at a mysterious military prison. In addition to being cheap, these indie games don’t require a hulked-out PC to play them. If you have a laptop that came out in the last decade, you can probably play them just fine.</p>

 <h2>Four free games to try this Halloween</h2> <p>Okay, if $1 a piece wasn’t cheap enough for you, there are also some free horror games out there just waiting to be claimed. <a href="https://kotaku.com/stasis-shows-how-spooky-a-point-and-click-adventure-can-1728333738">First up is <em>Stasis</em></a>, a 2015 point-and-click isometric adventure about emerging from a pod during a mysterious space voyage and figuring out what the hell is going on. &nbsp;“The game’s atmosphere is thick with tension, but it’s not trying to make you sweat the whole time, so the few moments it breaks things up and hits you with something shocking, it really works,” reads our <a href="https://kotaku.com/stasis-shows-how-spooky-a-point-and-click-adventure-can-1728333738">original review</a>. GOG is currently giving away the standard edition DRM-free for $0.00 <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stasis?cjdata=MXxOfDB8WXww&amp;utm_campaign=cj&amp;utm_medium=affiliate&amp;utm_source=cj&amp;r=true">through November 2</a>.</p>

 <p>The Epic Games Store is also giving out <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/free-games">some Halloween freebies</a>. There’s <em>Bendy and the Ink Machine</em>, the first-person horror puzzle game in the style of old-time cartoons. Put up with its sometimes monotonous point-and-click problem solving and you’ll be rewarded with some neat storytelling.&nbsp;<em>Five Nights At Freddy’s: Into the Pit</em> is also free to claim right now. It takes the usual formula and turns it into a 2D pixel art adventure. Is it the best <em>FNaF</em> game? No. But it’s the cheapest.</p> <p>Finally, We Create Stuff, the team behind the acclaimed 2021 psychological horror puzzle game<em> In Sound Mind</em>, recently released a free game called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3593490/Days_Without_Incident/"><em>Days Without Incident</em></a><em>.</em> It’s free to download and play and it’s getting some decent early Steam reviews. “This game has the same feeling as something Markiplier would have played back in the 2010s,” wrote one player. “It just oozes with old that school indie charm without relying on jump scares and loud noises every couple feet. Its definitely worth an hour of your time.”</p> <p>Sounds like a great way to spend a night pigging out <a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-candy-price-inflation-trump-tariff-snap-2000640156">on overpriced candy</a>.</p>
