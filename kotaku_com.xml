              <p>Building (or upgrading) a gaming PC means making smart choices about where to invest your budget and the processor sits at the heart of everything. AMD’s Ryzen 7 9700X occupies that sweet spot in their lineup where you get serious performance without crossing into extreme enthusiast territory. This 8-core chip from the latest Zen 5 architecture delivers the processing muscle needed for modern gaming and content creation while staying within reach for most builders. Right now, Prime members <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4607/">can grab this processor for just $250 instead of its usual $359 price</a>, but there’s a catch: <strong>this Prime Big Deal Day offer expires tonight</strong>, which makes this your last chance to secure an all-time low on <strong>one of AMD’s newest desktop chips</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4607/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Perfect for Gaming</h2>
<p>The <strong>Ryzen 7 9700X packs 8 cores and 16 threads into your system</strong>, a setup that is no stranger to multitasking and still capable of providing the single-threaded performance that games require. That <strong>5.5 GHz maximum boost frequency means the CPU can increase speed when needed,</strong> accelerating frames in fast-paced games where milliseconds matter. AMD says this part can produce <strong>over 100 FPS in mainstream games</strong> which is supported by the Zen 5 design’s gains in instructions per clock cycle over the previous gen.</p>



<p>The unlockable multiplier gives enthusiasts freedom to <strong>further tune performance through overclocking</strong>. In this manner, you can increase the clock speed beyond the factory level if you have enough cooling, wringing out additional performance from the chip for work that benefits from sheer frequency. The <strong>combined 40 MB cache appears as ultra-fast memory on the very processor die</strong>, and reduces the time that the CPU is sitting idle waiting on data from the system RAM. This amount of cache is key to gaming, as the CPU is always reaching into the texture data, the logic of the game, and the asset files.</p>
<p>DDR5-5600 future-proofs your build by providing support for the newest memory standard. DDR5 has a greater bandwidth compared to DDR4 which translates into more data being transferred between your RAM and CPU per second. It pays dividends on everything from loading times in games through to video rendering, where large data sets require endless shuffling.</p>



<p>Socket AM5 compatibility matters because AMD has committed to supporting this platform through future processor generations. This means you can upgrade to <strong>newer Ryzen chips down the road without replacing your motherboard</strong>, and protect your investment in the platform. The processor <strong>supports PCIe 5.0 on compatible motherboards</strong>, doubling the bandwidth available for graphics cards and NVMe SSDs compared to PCIe 4.0.</p>
<p>The Ryzen 7 9700X is AMD’s mainstream performance option among the Ryzen 7 offerings: It is under the high-core-count offerings like the 9900X and 9950X that target content creators and professionals but over the budget-friendly Ryzen 5 chips that have 6 cores. Where that places the 9700X is in the sweet spot between gamers who want excellent frame rates and have enough oomph left over for streaming or side work like editing video.</p>
<p>Over 2,000 units have been sold in the past thirty days, and <strong>a score of 4.8 stars through virtually 1,500 reviews</strong>, buyers absolutely love what their new CPU is bringing home. You’re saving $109 off the regular price when you pay just $250, but remember that t<strong>his deal ends when the special Prime Big Deal Day ends tonight</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsungs-990-evo-plus-ssd-is-going-for-pennies-amazon-clears-out-its-excess-stock-at-a-record-low-price-2000633103</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Storage limitations can kill productivity faster than almost anything else in the digital age. Running out of space means constant file juggling, deleted projects you might need later and that dreaded warning message interrupting your workflow at the worst possible moment.</p>
<p>This is where a high-capacity internal SSD becomes essential and today is your final chance to grab an exceptional deal: <strong>Prime Big Deal Day ends tonight</strong>, and Prime members can <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4606/">get the Samsung 990 Evo Plus SSD with a massive 4TB capacity for just $199, down from its regular $327 price</a>. This all-time low represents a serious opportunity to supercharge your PC or laptop with professional-grade storage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4606/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Drive Transforms Your PC Experience</h2>
<p>The Samsung 990 Evo Plus brings performance that really changes the way you work with massive files and intensive apps. It <strong>reads sequentially at up to 7,250 MB/s and writes at up to 6,300 MB/s</strong>, figures that equate to real-world performance gains you can appreciate today. <strong>Moving a 50GB video project that can take a few minutes on a hard drive takes just seconds here</strong>.</p>
<p>Those data-transfer rates derive from Samsung’s latest-generation NAND memory technology which is the pinnacle of storage chip engineering. On the interface side, the drive is compatible with <strong>both the PCIe 4.0 x4 and the PCIe 5.0 x2 interface</strong> which translates into the drive auto-adapting to the capability of the motherboard and always providing optimum bandwidth no matter what gen the system is compatible with.</p>



<p>The 4TB capacity resolves the storage bottleneck that creative professionals and power users experience on a regular basis. Today’s game installs easily surpass 100GB, and the 4K video files and high-def photo libraries devour terabytes before you know it. This much storage on one drive obviates the need for external storage wrangling or the maintenance of multiple small drives. Samsung’s Intelligent Turbowrite 2.0 technology streamlines the way the drive approaches large file operations by providing a high-performance buffer that boosts write speed under high-workload conditions.</p>



<p>Thermal management is what distinguishes quality SSDs from the ones that throttle performance when they get hot: The 990 Evo Plus employs a nickel-coated efficiency-specific controller that enables <strong>the drive to reach optimal speed without consuming more power than the earlier generations</strong>. This is crucially important to laptop users whose battery life is critical, as well as desktop builders whoseheat build-up can cause system instability.</p>
<p>Samsung includes with every shipment their <em>Magician Software</em> suite which contains utilities that keep your SSD in top form long after installation. Drive health is monitored through tracking lifetime left and durability-based performance metrics, giving warnings before data loss is possible. Firmware updates also arrive automatically through Magician, ensuring that your drive benefits from Samsung’s newest developments and security patches. More still, the software contains further encryption utilities for safeguarding vital data as well as performance optimization tools that tailor the interaction between the drive and the OS.</p>
<p>More than 9,000 units have been sold in the last month alone and, <strong>following a 4.8-star rating through more than 7,000 reviews</strong>, the 990 Evo Plus has firmly secured itself among intensive users. At $199 per 4TB, you’re <strong>getting approximately 5 cents per gig</strong>, which is brilliant value for such performance. Note that this Prime-member deal is gone after tonight when the Prime Big Deal Day ends, so the price window is very small.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[For the Closing Hours of Prime Day, Amazon Sells Pokemon Card Packs for Just $0.10]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/for-the-closing-hours-of-prime-day-amazon-sells-pokemon-card-packs-for-just-0-10-2000633099</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/for-the-closing-hours-of-prime-day-amazon-sells-pokemon-card-packs-for-just-0-10.1319344/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Building a Pokemon card collection doesn’t have to drain your wallet and right now might be the perfect time to jump in: The trading card craze has sparked fresh enthusiasm across all generations, from kids discovering these iconic creatures for the first time to adults rekindling their childhood passion. <strong>Amazon’s Prime Big Deal Day</strong> is wrapping up today, and there’s a standout offer that everyone can grab, Prime member or not: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/">this assorted lot of 50 Pokemon cards has dropped to just $5, down from its usual $10 price tag</a>. It’s an all-time low that makes expanding your collection incredibly affordable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This collection ships exactly as collectors require without the hassle of searching outlets individually at high-end premium prices. You <strong>receive 50 randomly selected cards taken from the entirety of the Pokemon universe</strong>, <strong>covering every series issued</strong>. You get regular character cards as well as energy cards, which provides usable items suitable for actual play as well as collectibles that fans love.</p>
<p><strong>Duplicates will be found in the randomized sets</strong>, but that is part of the trade that collectors appreciate as they trade the excess with buddies or utilize them towards completing certain deck layouts.</p>
<h2>What Makes This Collection Pack Worth Getting</h2>
<p>The true value here is beyond the rock-bottom price: Each lot is like a surprise package as the cards include random series which can have <strong>anything ranging from vintage Base Set designs to recent releases</strong>. Randomization is something that works favorably in the case of <strong>new collectors</strong> establishing a good base without the need to have encyclopedic information on sets that need to be targeted. For parents introducing children to the concept, it is an affordable method of giving enough cards towards building multiple decks and testing out varied strategies.</p>



<p>The 50-card quantity is just the right size for collection expansion: It’s high enough that it is something significant that you can feel like you’ve accomplished something without being too overwhelming that new collectors don’t know quite what to do with them. Advanced collectors will pick these lots up just as a way to fill missing cards they have from past-generation sets or fill out common cards, which are often needed as part of building out a tournament-legal deck. Because the sets span all generations, you’re handling the initial 151 creatures through the latest expansion sets that include recent release games.</p>
<p>At $5 for Prime Day, <strong>you’re getting roughly 10 cents per card</strong>, which seriously undercuts what you would pay buying single cards or even regular booster packs at retail stores. Because today is the final day that the Prime Big Deal Day concludes, these prices will not last.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ejae, Rei Ami, and Audrey Nuna are set to perform on&nbsp;<em>The Tonight Show</em> in just a few hours, which will mark the trio’s first live performance as Huntr/x, the pop stars from <a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><em>KPop Demon Hunters</em></a>. (At least, not counting <a href="https://youtu.be/LW9QJIT_T-A?si=mK7N33Yd-8Q2GEnz">a cameo in a skit</a> during this weekend’s <em>Saturday Night Live </em>in which they didn’t even perform a full song.) But in advance of that debut performance later tonight, the band has released a new song with no fanfare, one that wasn’t featured in the Netflix musical. Or at least that’s what Spotify is currently indicating. The <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/2yNNYQBChuox9A5Ka93BIn?si=bD2voW0ITLeASfThiMvk-g">Huntr/x Spotify account</a> posted a song called “Mazatlan By Night” on Sunday, and it’s only accumulated about 6,000 listens so far. Considering <a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381">how big <em>KPop Demon Hunters&nbsp;</em>has become</a> in the past few months, you’d think a new song from the titular girl group would have exploded in even just a few days. So what’s up with this song? Well, for one thing, it doesn’t seem to actually be a Huntr/x song.</p> <p>Sometimes other artists’ work will appear on a group’s Spotify page if they’re featured or if one of their songs is sampled, but I’ve listened to the <em>KPop Demon Hunters&nbsp;</em>soundtrack hundreds of times and couldn’t pick out anything from this piece that would put Huntr/x anywhere near the credits. I tried using the Shazam app, which listens to music and gives you the title, and it couldn’t identify the song as anything, much less a new song by Rumi, Zoey, and Mira. This could have been uploaded to the Huntr/x account in error, or there might be something more nefarious going on. The song’s copyright is for “Diskerux Diamond,” which doesn’t bring up any search results on Google. Well, it might bring up this article now. We’ve reached out to Universal Music Group for comment on the situation and will update the story if we hear back.</p>  <p>It’s entirely possible the account was hacked and someone uploaded this song to the Huntr/x account without authorization. Or it could have been a technical error that…somehow ended up on the Spotify page of one of the biggest groups in music right now. Sorry to the 6,000 of you that listened to it expecting something new from the girls. But hey, at least we’ll get to hear them performing “Golden” live on <em>The Tonight Show</em> in a little bit.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/airpods-4-are-now-3x-cheaper-than-airpods-pro-amazon-is-offering-entry-level-clearance-prices-2000632651</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/airpods-4-are-now-3x-cheaper-than-airpods-pro-amazon-is-offering-entry-level-clearance-prices.1319188/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple just released the AirPods 4 as their latest open-ear earbuds that sit outside your ear canal rather than sealing inside it like in-ear models. Compared to the newly launched AirPods Pro 3, the standard AirPods 4 cost three times less while the AirPods 4 with active noise cancellation come in at more than half the price. But those savings only apply if you snag them <strong>during Prime Big Deal Days on Amazon</strong>, where Prime members <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3769/">can grab the standard version for $89 instead of $129</a>, or <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4602/">upgrade to the ANC model for $119 down from $179</a>. You’re essentially getting premium Apple earbuds at budget earbud pricing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3769/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See AirPods 4 without ANC at Amazon</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4602/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See AirPods 4 with ANC at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Open-ear mode appeals to<strong> individuals who don’t like in-ear tips for longer wear times</strong> or prefer remaining attentive to their environments instead of switching between transparency modes. They sit comfortably in your outer ear, not pressing down nor giving that stuffed-up feeling sealed tips tend to produce. The new shape accommodates a broader geometry of ears compared to older AirPods, and fixes one of the largest gripes about prior versions falling off during exercise.</p>
<h2>High-End Features That Could Use a Refresh</h2>
<p>The H2 chip drives both models and offers huge upgrades compared to the H1 chip found in prior AirPods. The newer processor <strong>supports complex computational audio processing</strong>, which supports <strong>Advanced Audio and Personalized Spatial Audio</strong>, both of which involve some serious real-time math. The H2 chip also enhances battery life, supporting the <strong>lengthy 30-hour total listening time</strong> if you count the charging case. The headphones themselves last about five hours per charge, and the case yields several additional charges before it itself must be recharged.</p>



<p><strong>Personalized Spatial Audio creates a three-dimensional soundstage</strong> which adds immersion to music, movies, and games. Head tracking is used to anchor sound to space so if your head moves when looking at a video, sound appears to remain affixed to your monitor rather than moving along with your head. Apple adjusts this setting per your actual ear geometry, gathered by your TrueDepth camera on your iPhone, for improved tailoring of the spatial effect for how your own ear shape affects perceived sound.</p>
<p>The ANC version implements <em>Active Noise Cancellation</em> which is impressive for an open-ear model. Standard ANC is optimized for sealed-in in-ear tips that quiet sound passively before it’s quieted electronically by the electronics. Apple designed a solution to actively cancel external sound even for an open-ear model by employing sophisticated algorithms and processing of the H2 chip. The payoff won’t be equivalent to AirPods Pro’s isolation, but it does a great job of cutting down on background sound in places like a coffee shop or bus/subway ride.</p>



<p>Transparency Mode allows you to easily discern what’s going on around you if you require awareness for sake of safety, for example, or for conversation. As opposed to just silencing your sound, Transparency Mode actually processes external sound so it’s normal-sounding but your music stays playing softly in the background.</p>
<p>Pairing with iPhone occurs automatically by way of Apple’s pairing process: Lift the case by your iPhone and a connection notice pops up automatically. Your AirPods then synchronize on all your Apple devices signed into a single iCloud account, switching automatically between your iPhone, iPad, and Mac as you transition between devices.</p>
<p>At $89 for the standard version and $119 for the model including ANC during Prime Big Deal Days, you’re getting Apple’s new earbud technology at prices comparable to generic Bluetooth earbuds. Those are all-time-low prices for getting high-end elements available without typical Apple markup.</p>

              <p><span>In a move that sounds custom-made to tick every box of your parents’ SEO, Jimmy Fallon is producing a </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span> game show.

I mean, yeah, kinda.</span></p> <p><span>If you somehow haven’t heard of </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span>, it started as a browser-based word game in 2021, which blew up so fast that </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-york-times-nyt-games-wordle-connections-app-1851379895">The</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-york-times-nyt-games-wordle-connections-app-1851379895">New York Times</a></span></i><span>‘ games section acquired it in 2022. Now it’s the centerpiece of the </span><i><span>Times</span></i><span>’ much more high-profile gaming offerings, and it has inspired hundreds of copycat games. The premise is simple: the player has to guess a five-letter word in up to six attempts, with correct letters being marked green or yellow, depending on if they’re in the right spot or not. It’s a simple brain teaser that is easy to pick up and put down every day, so its virality is easy to understand. The question is: How will Fallon and company expand this into a full-blown game show?</span></p>   <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/wordle-tv-series-jimmy-fallon-pilot-nbc-1236569567/"><i><span>Deadline</span></i></a><span> reports that the series, if picked up, will air on NBC, and would give Fallon yet another gig on the network to go along with his hosting of </span><i><span>The Tonight Show</span></i><span>, the reality series </span><i><span>On Brand</span></i><span>, and the musical game program </span><i><span>That’s My Jam</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>Today</span></i><span> anchor Savannah Guthrie is signed on to host the </span><i><span>Wordle</span></i><span> pilot. The show is filming in the UK thanks to Fallon’s Electric Hot Dog production company, and that’s about all we know right now. Is it just going to be guests solving five-letter word puzzles like those in the existing game? That doesn’t sound like quite enough for a full-fledged game show, so I expect there will be more to it than that. Will the players who end up on the show spell out the words “Authoritarian Regime”? </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-fallon-colbert-stewart-trump-kirk-2000627249"><span>Probably not on Fallon’s watch</span></a><span>.

              <p>More games are coming out than ever before. <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-19-000-new-games-limited-pc-valve-unplayed-80-1851738322">Over 18,000 separate store listings</a> were added to Steam in 2024 alone. Our list of notable October releases hit 55, and there were dozens more games we could have included. It’s a good thing that with the market so flooded, the average gamer is also buying tons of games. Oh wait, they aren’t! A new survey by Circana finds the majority of players in the U.S. buy just two games a year or fewer.</p> <p>That data point was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m27zezw2ek2v">shared last week</a> (via <em><a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/sept-2025s-top-new-steam-and-console?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=7owge&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoxMjkxOTExOCwicG9zdF9pZCI6MTc1NDM3NzY3LCJpYXQiOjE3NTk4NjIyODQsImV4cCI6MTc2MjQ1NDI4NCwiaXNzIjoicHViLTE0MDg5Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.P7-FDk_km-Lb5u7RkPNCSLloq8feyciLH5rCuGYy4ew&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">GameDiscoverCo</a></em>) by the firm’s head of gaming research, Mat Piscatella. The group’s upcoming Future of Games report for the last quarter asked respondents how often they purchased new games. A whopping third said they don’t even buy one a year. Only 4 percent purchase more than one game a month. Did you buy <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> and<em> Borderlands 4</em> in September? Congratulations: you are a statistical outlier.</p>

 <p>Piscatella was presenting the data in the context of the recent Game Pass price hikes. While most players barely buy games at all, a small fraction of them spend a ton. “Hyper enthusiast, price-insensitive players are really keeping things going, especially in the non-free-to-play gaming space,” he wrote. We can imagine this as the group who’s going to buy every game on their most-anticipated list no matter what. In fact, they might even buy the Deluxe Edition.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/app.bsky.feed.post/3m27zezw2ek2v" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigtnlcxloqjvmbylrdg2jzzq4x6qlon6az44xwjvfajx6viqo7h3m"> <p lang="en">Hyper enthusiast, price-insensitive players are really keeping things going, especially in the non f2p gaming space.</p> <p>According to Circana's Q3 2025 Future of Games, only 4% of US video game players buy a new game more often than once per month, with a third of players not buying any games at all.</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x?ref_src=embed">Mat Piscatella (@matpiscatella.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:bhqrrxt7yyfpwguioa7rwa7x/post/3m27zezw2ek2v?ref_src=embed">2025-10-02T16:54:18.096Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>You can see this in the recent financial data for gaming companies like Sony. Despite console adoption stalling, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732">they keep making more profit</a> on the same existing slice of fans. While some people buy a Switch 2, PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X/S and only ever buy a handful of games for it, others are content to keep adding to their backlog, a niche concept as foreign to the average gamer as the Criterion closet is to most people who subscribe to Netflix.</p>

 <p>We often think of the gaming as, broadly speaking, evenly divided and homogenous. We take the median player and imagine an entire audience made up of them, as opposed to the market being defined by lots of different groups of players with unique habits, tastes, and conceptions of the hobby. It’s also easy to see why game studios have gotten so precious about release windows. If the majority of people are only going to buy a couple of games of year, best not to go head-to-head with <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Madden</em>, or the next <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>.</p> <p>One obvious solution to this problem? Better curation and discovery. There’s only too many games if you can’t help the right people find the right ones. Valve has put a lot of work into exploring that problem and Steam is still far from perfect. The rest of the platforms, sadly, aren’t even close. And mobile, the biggest platform of all, is the worst of the bunch.</p>
