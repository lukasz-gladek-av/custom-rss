              <p><span>After quite a few leaks, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-winds-waves-pikachu-underwater-2000674398"><i><span>Pokémon Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i></a> <span>have finally been officially unveiled today as part of the series’ 30th anniversary. In </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-winds-waves-trailer-breakdown-presents-pikachu-2000674465"><span>the first trailer</span></a><span>, we saw </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-winds-waves-gen-10-starters-pikachu-vacation-reactions-2000674403"><span>the games’ starter trio</span></a><span>, but otherwise we only saw old monsters that debuted in previous games. However, fans think the few minutes of footage we got may offer a hint about one of the Legendary Pokémon we’ll meet when the games launch next year.</span></p> <p><span>In two sections of the trailer, you can see a cloud formation that looks kind of like a dragon. The first time is in the opening cinematic when a trainer is looking through their drawings of Pikachu in various regions. The final image in this section is one of Pikachu looking out a window into </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span>’ ocean region, and you can see the dragon-shaped cloud in the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Oh hey it appears in the art at the start too <a href="https://t.co/RXHtwi1iOY">pic.twitter.com/RXHtwi1iOY</a></p> <p>— Puppi 🏳️‍⚧️ (@PuppiPoppi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PuppiPoppi/status/2027403817147412543?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Later, in one of the environmental shots, you can see the dragon-shaped cloud prominently in the sky in-game. Given the games’ titles, I wouldn’t be surprised if </span><i><span>Winds</span></i><span>’ mascot legendary was a flying-type Dragon Pokémon and </span><i><span>Waves </span></i><span>got some kind of sea creature. Some are speculating this is a Gyarados’ silhouette, and while the one in the initial sketch from the beginning of the trailer definitely resembles the Water/Flying monster from Kanto, the one we see in the actual game itself doesn’t look like it much at all. Could this be a nod to a Pokémon we haven’t met yet?&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>However, there might be a different explanation based on </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span>’ leaks. Though it hasn’t been officially revealed, the games’ equivalent of raid battles will reportedly be signified in the open world by Pokémon-shaped clouds. So it’s possible this might actually be a Gyarados rather than a new monster, but this also doesn’t preclude it from being a different monster entirely.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Based on the Teraleak, the Pokémon shaped clouds are just the new equivalent raid mechanic. <a href="https://t.co/xG0gUHfu0H">pic.twitter.com/xG0gUHfu0H</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/2027400325032779788?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves </span></i><span>are coming to Switch 2 next year, making them the first exclusive </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>RPGs on the system. I would’ve expected the original Switch to get at least one more </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>RPG given how many Switches have been sold in the past nine years, but if you’re looking for a system seller, the new </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> games will do it.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>This morning, Game Freak </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-30-anniversary-stream-recap-winds-waves-2000674383"><span>officially announced </span><i><span>Pokémon Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i></a><span>, the games that will </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-winds-waves-pikachu-underwater-2000674398"><span>kick off the next generation on Switch 2</span></a><span> next year. We saw around three minutes of footage of the game in motion, and though it is brief, there’s a fair bit to glean from what we saw. Let’s break down the first trailer.</span></p>  <h2><b>The opening cinematic pays tribute to 30 years of </b><b><i>Pokémon</i></b></h2> <p><span>Starting off the trailer is a cinematic showing several illustrations of a Pikachu traveling around the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>world. Each drawing shows Pikachu in a different region from the first nine generations, from Kanto in </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span> to Paldea in </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>. It’s a cute way to lead into the next generation and also pay homage to the series’ 30th anniversary. As the trainer flips through their scrapbook, we end on an image of Pikachu looking out a window to a beach, which is revealed to be the space we’re in now.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Who are these Pikachu?</b></h2> <p><span>After strolling through memory lane, the trainer opens their house door and is greeted by two Pikachu that are glammed up and also notably darker than the average mouse, so fans are speculating that they’re Shiny. Their names are Mr. Windychu and Ms. Wavychu, but we don’t know much about how they’re involved in the story just yet. Given their names, they might be exclusive to the different versions similar to the professors in </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, but that’s just a theory.</span></p> <h2><b>Well, it certainly looks better than </b><b><i>Scarlet </i></b><b>and </b><b><i>Violet</i></b></h2> <p><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves </span></i><span>is the next open-world game in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>series, and for whatever it’s worth, it does look like a significant graphical improvement over </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, which was raked through the coals for looking like a GameCube game. The environments have texture and character to them, which is more than you could say for the bland, flat appearance of the Paldea region. Could this finally be the end of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>graphics debates? Arceus, I hope so.</span></p>

 <h2><b>The new region feels like a bit of a throwback</b></h2> <p><span>While a lot of recent </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games have been defined by city skylines, </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span> seems like it has a much more nature-driven region than the series has routinely sported of late. Yeah, there are some human structures like what appears to be a giant water-based lab, but by and large we don’t see much of human civilization, and it gives it more of that grounded, earthy feel that is much more akin to previous generations. It makes me wonder if it will have the same gyms and Pokémon League structure of previous games, or if we might be spending more time exploring the wild environment instead.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Different outfits for both games</b></h2> <p><span>Like </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span> will change some of the player’s outfit accents depending on which version they’re playing. It’s unclear if this is justified in the story the way it was by having different school uniforms in </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, but the </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>protagonist sports a white and blue rancher hat, while the </span><i><span>Waves </span></i><span>hero wears a darker blue cap. Hopefully </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves </span></i><span>doesn’t pull back on the excellent fashion and customization options from </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> and we still get a plethora of looks and outfits to choose from.</span></p> <h2><b>The Pokédex seems eclectic</b></h2> <p><span>We didn’t see many of the new Pokémon that will debut in </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span>, but we did see a lot of the returning ones and it looks like a nice spread from the previous nine generations. So don’t worry too much about it being another Kanto-filled adventure.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Pikachu didn’t get a makeover</b></h2> <p><span>Early leaks for </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span> included what </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-wind-wave-pikachu-leak-generation-10-redesign-2000635674"><span>appeared to be a redesign for Pikachu</span></a><span> that would have further slimmed him down from his original round look. However, based on the footage we’ve seen, it looks like Game Freak didn’t use this updated design, which is fine by me.</span></p> <h2><b>The starters are the star of the show</b></h2> <p><span>The only new Pokémon we saw in this first trailer are the three starters: Browt, Pombon, and Gecqua. The grass-type bird is described as “lively, but it can also be a bit clumsy” and we know it photosynthesizes the leaves on its brow. Pombon is a Pomeranian fire dog that has a “heat-generating organ within its lungs” and is “guileless and friendly.” Lastly, Gecqua rounds out the trio with its water attacks that it springs from its tail, and is “intelligent and maneuvers shrewdly while putting on airs​.”</span></p> <h2><b>There’s a focus on underwater exploration</b></h2> <p><span>Game Freak made a point to focus on underwater exploration, which is one of the new ways you’ll be able to move through the environment in </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span>’ open world. It’s unclear how we’ll do that, whether it’s through some kind of vehicle or if Dive is returning from the previous games, but it looks like you’ll be able to encounter wild water Pokémon under the sea, rather than just having to fish for them or see them swimming at the surface.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Ugh, they’re gonna make me wait for it</b></h2> <p><span>I guess now that </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet </span></i><span>was a huge technical disaster, Game Freak is trying to put more space between each of its games. </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves </span></i><span>are coming to Switch 2 in 2027, which means we’ll probably have about a two-year gap between it and </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, which came out in October of last year. The company didn’t get any more specific than the year, though, so the games could conceivably launch in the first half of 2027. I’ll just have to sustain myself on </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>for a while.</span></p>

              <p>As is by now traditional, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-winds-waves-pikachu-underwater-2000674398">initial announcement of the existence of <em>Pokémon Winds</em> And <em>Waves</em></a> was accompanied by the reveal of the three new starter Pokémon that trainers will be able to choose from at the beginning of the game, and by extension the first three Pokémon revealed as part of Gen X. They are Browt, Pombon and Gecqua. Let’s meet ’em.</p> <h2>Browt</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000674445" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674445"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674445">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p>First up is Browt, an owl-ish baby bird with big eyebrows. Just imagine the long nights spent trying to figure out that name. It’s the Grass-type starter, described as a Bean Chick Pokémon, and we already have its vital stats:</p> <p>Height: 1′ (0.3m)<br> Weight: 7.7lb (3.5KG)<br> Ability: Overgrow</p> <p>It does seem a bit odd that the game’s gone back to owls as a starter inspiration, given Rowlet was only three generations ago. Although this might be more bizarre design choice than actual species, given it’s described as a “chick.” Given the leaf-like brows on the beast, we can assume it’ll lean into those Bulbasaur-like planty attacks.</p>

 <h2>Pombon</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000674443" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674443"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674443">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p>This fluffy pup is yet another dog-like pocket monster, although the first time one’s been a starter. It’s the Fire-type for the set, and classified as a Puppy Pokémon. Its stats are:</p> <p>Height: 1’4 (0.4m)<br> Weight: 14.8lb (4.3KG)<br> Ability: Blaze</p> <p>There’s not a lot more to discern about this little doggo, other than its obvious inspiration by a Pomeranian. It’ll be interesting to see if it stays cute as it grows, or if things head in a more wolf-like direction.</p>

 <h2>Gecqua</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000674444" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674444"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674444">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p>Hardest to spell is Gecqua, who we can infer from the name alone is an aquatic gecko. Water-type, of course, and with its huge eyes my immediate favorite of the three, with the unimaginative category of Water Gecko Pokémon. Stats are:</p> <p>Height: 1′ (0.3m)<br> Weight: 9.5lb (4.3KG)<br> Ability: Torrent</p> <p>It was only Gen VIII that we last saw a reptilian starter, and a Water-type to boot, with Sobble. And given the visual similarity between the two, especially when you think about Sobble’s final form, Inteleon, it’s another oddly overlapping design. Still though, Gecqua is completely adorable and is already my pick.</p>

 <hr> <p>So, who stands out to you? Have you already fallen in love? Or are you just bemused that Game Freak couldn’t think of any other species to be inspired by for the new starters?</p>
