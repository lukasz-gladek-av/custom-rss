              <p>So Timmy Turner from <em>Fairly OddParents</em>, SpongeBob SquarePants, and Leonardo from <em>TMNT</em> are all in a game together, and no, I’m talking about <em>Fortnite</em>. Not this time. Instead, these and other Nickelodeon cartoon characters are part of <em>Dice of Destiny</em>, a newly released action RPG that plays a lot like <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-open-beta-review-rpg-rogue-build-barbarian-1850244422">Baby’s First <em>Diablo</em>,</a> which might be the perfect game for parents and kids to enjoy together. Just don’t go in expecting something deep, difficult, or long.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/nicktoons-and-the-dice-of-destiny"><em>Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny,</em></a> out now on consoles and PC, is very much a <em>Diablo</em>-like ARPG that removes all the blood and demons and replaces them with famous cartoon characters and family-friendly enemies to smack around over the course of the game’s six- to eight-hour campaign. Like Blizzard’s popular ARPG,<em> Dice of Destiny</em> is played from a top-down isometric perspective and features lots of gold to collect, loot to find, and new skills to unlock to better kill all the hundreds and hundreds of fish men, robots, evil books, jellyfish, and even big bosses who want to stop our heroes from collecting powerful dice that will let them escape this fantasy world they are trapped in.</p>

  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-action-rpg-blizzard-torchlight-path-of-exile-1850506636/6"><em>Dice of Destiny</em> doesn’t reinvent the wheel when it comes to ARPGs</a>. You’ll feel right at home with the combat, movement, and progression if you’ve played a <em>Diablo</em>, or a <em>Titan Quest</em>, or even a <em>Path of Exile.&nbsp;</em>You enter areas filled with enemies to kill, find some loot and gold, perhaps stumble upon a side challenge or hidden chest, level up, and then return to a hub area to sell loot and tinker with your character and inventory. Yeah, you’ve played this game before. You know how this goes.</p>

 <p>And to <em>Dice of Destiny’</em>s credit, it plays very well and runs like a dream on my Xbox Series X. Sadly, combat isn’t challenging, even when I turn the difficulty up before entering a mission. At least the different biomes you visit, each inspired by Nickelodeon shows like <em>SpongeBob</em>, look wonderful, with a vibrant art style that pops on a big 4K TV. You might get a bit bored fighting the same enemies and getting little loot for it, but at least it all looks nice and runs well, which is not something I can say for other <a href="https://kotaku.com/walking-dead-destinies-new-game-bad-kong-game-mill-1851032588">Gamemill-published titles.</a></p>

 <p>Sadly, where <em>Dice of Destiny</em> sort of falls apart is that all the playable characters lack skill trees. Combine that with a lack of loot drops and you start to wonder why you’re grinding away through all the missions. Characters also level up so fast that after a few missions, I was well beyond the level of later missions and felt nearly invincible outside of boss fights. It leads to the game lacking any meaningful RPG progression, and I went from a weakling to a powerful murderer in no time. While I found this to be disappointing, as it meant an already easy game became even easier, I can see how kids would appreciate the ability to level up quickly and acquire new powers to use.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000631080" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000631080"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000631080">©Gamemill</figcaption></figure> <p>I think for most people who regularly read <em>Kotaku</em>,<em> Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny</em> will be a boring and somewhat shallow ARPG adventure through some gorgeous cartoon worlds that will make you want to reinstall <em>Diablo IV.</em>&nbsp; But if you have a young kid who’s getting into video games and wants to play an RPG, this is probably a perfect choice. It’s very likely they will know at least some of the characters in <em>Dice of Destiny,</em> and the lack of a skill tree and the game’s reluctance to drop loot or flood the screen with baddies makes it a relatively kid-friendly experience, especially if this is one of their first “big” games. And there’s just enough depth and action here that parents playing with their kids in co-op, which the game supports locally, won’t be bored to tears.</p> <p><em>Nicktoons &amp; The Dice of Destiny</em> is out now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC. I’d recommend waiting for it to drop in price during a sale, as the $50 sticker slapped on this thing is a bit too high for what’s on offer here. But hey, maybe your kid (or you) really wants to kill 200 jellyfish as Jimmy Neutron? If so, run, don’t walk, to <em>Dice of Destiny</em>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-mod-video-npc-memories-blurbs-2000631070</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/red-dead-redemption-2-mod-shows-you-the-memories-of-npcs-you-kill-and-it%E2%80%99s-hilarious.1314979/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>A lot of games play with the idea of guilting the player for their actions. Sometimes it’s choice-based games in which your decisions can potentially result in the deaths of companions, like the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-best-character-squadmates-garrus-liara-tali-1851693416"><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i></a> <span>series, or it’s something like </span><i><span>Spec Ops: The Line, </span></i><span>which makes you sit with the dire consequences of the war crime you committed. Blurbs, a content creator on YouTube and Twitch who creates mods for games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-the-kotaku-review-1829984369"><i><span>Red Dead Redemption 2</span></i></a><span>, decided to take this a step further by giving every NPC in Rockstar’s open-world western memories of their own that play out if you kill them. While this mod could have turned </span><i><span>Red Dead Redemption 2</span></i><span> into a 50-hour guilt trip, Blurbs gave it some levity by letting his Twitch chat submit the monologues that he would hear after gunning someone down. The results are chaotic.</span></p>  <p><span>Blurbs tells </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> that the original idea was to make players feel guilty for committing acts of wanton violence against the citizens of </span><i><span>Red Dead Redemption 2</span></i><span>, but once Twitch chat got involved, it went “off the rails.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“I mean, really, who even thinks about the non-story characters ever?” Blurbs said in an email. “It felt like an interesting thought experiment to give these characters past lives and to be forced to take ownership of your actions.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Before chat submitted captions, a lot of these memories made your actions tragic by reminding you that these people you slaughtered had rich, full lives that they’ll never get back to, like a man remembering his newborn child, a couple reflecting on their marriage, or a guy hanging out with his dog. Things got silly, however, when viewers submitted text to go along with the scenes, which was put through a text-to-speech service to play over the memories those characters relive in the instant before death after protagonist Arthur Morgan takes them out. Blurbs didn’t read them before implementing them into the mod, and says that Twitch’s automated mods helped avoid any “bad actors” who might have submitted something untoward.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“My favorites were the really absurd ones like explaining </span><i><span>Rick &amp; Morty</span></i><span> to a baby, the guy barking at his own dog, or the man trying to subconsciously make his baby a Mets fan,” Blurbs said. “I can usually count on my Twitch chat to do a good job coming up with ridiculous voice lines.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The YouTube video about the mod above is the latest in a series in which Blurbs tries to bring mod ideas suggested by his chat to life. Typically, several of these are all put into one video, but Blurbs tells </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> this one “warranted its own video” because it was such an involved process.</span></p>

 <p><span>“It could’ve been just a plain textbox with an NPC’s life summary, but my whole mission is overproducing really dumb ideas that no one else would ever think to make,” he said.</span></p> <p><span>Blurbs has gotten his Twitch chat involved in other projects as well, including the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3RJ2gkfPJI"><span>“Text-to-Skyrim”</span></a><span> mod that lets viewers write dialogue for NPCs in </span><i><span>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</span></i><span>. He also has upcoming projects based on </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span> and the </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span> series.</span></p>

              <p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate just shot up another 50%, jumping from $20 to $30 per month. Folks are canceling subscriptions left and right with reports of the web page to change you Microsoft subscription plan going down due to overwhelming traffic. $30 every month for a service is a bad price. Microsoft should know better, but not all of their services are that excruciating on your wallet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/">Right now, you can upgrade to Windows 11 Pro for just $10. StackSocial has it marked down from $199 by 94% for a limited time.</a> It’s a one time upgrade too. No subscription, just pay for the license once and you got it.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro offers a whole slew of new security features and an updated UI designed for multitaskers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>New Features to Maximize Your Productivity</h2>
<p>Universal Search has been added to the taskbar. This new tool allows you to search for anything, pretty much anywhere. Doesn’t matter if you’re looking for a specific file on your computer or need a recipe or directions from the internet, the search will look through all systems to pull up precisely what you need — all with just one search bar.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro gives you OneDrive support. You can synchronize preferences and files across your different devices, accessing them from anywhere. Say an urgent email comes through in which you need to reply to immediately with an attachment. Or perhaps you forgot to submit the paper you wrote, but now you’re sitting in class without your laptop. You can pull up OneDrive on your phone and submit from there. Easy-peasy. It’s a great tool to have while traveling too.</p>



<p>Desktop is a terrific, albeit a poorly-named feature. Like c’mon. Desktop already has a definition. Use something new. Anyway, ‘Desktop’ allows you to set up customized workspaces on your PC. Tailor your wallpaper, shortcuts, logins, widgets, and more for your different needs. Have one set up for gaming, another for student activities, perhaps another for a side hustle. You can then easily swap between them right at the taskbar.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/">Windows 11 Pro has built-in all sorts of keyboard shortcuts you may not know about</a>. Have you ever used Win + V? It’s kind of like Ctrl + V on steroids. Instead of just pasting the last thing you copied, it will pull up your clipboard and history of all your recent copies. This is a complete game change for any workflow that requires a lot of copying and pasting, like if you need to move multiple bits of info into a form you’re filling out or perhaps a spreadsheet. No need to flip back and forth between your tabs, copying and pasting one item at a time.</p>

              <p>We’re inching closer to the second Prime Day of the year, and it’s a great time to invest in smart home devices. Amazon has started the celebration early, and we’ve just spotted the newest Amazon Echo Show 8 going for $100 on it.</p>
<p>It’s a straightforward $50 discount – no coupon codes required. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4450/">Even better, if you already own an Echo device, you can trade it in for an extra 20% off on top of the discount.</a> The offer is available on both black and white color options, but it ends soon, so you might want to act fast to grab it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4450/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Improved Screen, Better Sound</h2>
<p>Echo Shows have always been more than just great displays. This one packs a stunning 8-inch HD touchscreen that pushes vibrant, true-to-life visuals. The screen is paired with room-filling spatial audio, so there’s no need for external speakers to enjoy great sound, whether you’re watching a video or just vibing to your favorite song. There’s support for Netflix, Prime Video, Fire TV Channels, and more, so entertainment options are also plenty.</p>
<p>The solid 13 MP front camera with auto-framing keeps you centered during video calls, while built-in noise reduction makes sure you’re heard clearly on the other end. Of course, smart home compatibility is top-notch. Those with devices that support Zigbee, Matter, or Thread can pair and control them directly using just their voice. Need to dim the lights, but five steps to the switch feel like two miles? Just ask Echo Show to handle it. Doorbell just rang, and you want to see who’s there without getting up? Say the word.</p>



<p>And when not in use, Echo Show 8 smartly doubles as a digital picture frame, so you can keep your favorite moments close! You also have the option to invite your family and friends to share photos on the device – a great way to stay connected.</p>
<p>Setting up the whole thing and getting started is fairly simple. It sits well pretty much anywhere, but if you want better angles or prefer it at eye level, you might want to invest in a dedicated stand (sold separately). All in all, the Echo Show 8 brings a lot of convenience to your day-to-day tasks, especially if you’re looking to manage all your smart home devices in one place. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4450/">This version brings better video and sound quality, and can now be yours for just $100. Be sure to grab it before it’s too late.</a></p>
