Unfortunately, <strong><em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em> also doesn’t support cross-saves</strong>.</p><p>This means that <strong>if you’ve been playing the game on Apple devices since launch and want to pick the game up on Nintendo Switch or PC, you’ll have to start over completely</strong>. You can’t swap freely between the two devices using a single save, nor does the game allow you to transfer a save to a new ecosystem.</p><h2 id="h230447"><a id="online"></a>Do you need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to play <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em>?</h2><p>Though you can’t play <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em> with players on other platforms, Nintendo Switch players can still hook up with other players on that platform via online multiplayer. If you’re looking to pal around with your friends, though, <strong>you will need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to access multiplayer features</strong>. Luckily, this subscription is only $20 per year, so it’s a small price to pay for playing with your besties, and it will allow you to use online functionality of many other Switch games as well.</p><p>It’s a shame that <em>Hello Kitty Island Adventure</em> doesn’t support crossplay or cross-save functionality, but here’s hoping it could come in a future update given how popular these features are. In the meantime, just talk your friends into buying the game within the same ecosystem as you. Be assertive. We believe in you.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Let’s dive in.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cccbdc9c0ef49dcac6f0c813627db685" data-recommend-id="image://cccbdc9c0ef49dcac6f0c813627db685" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Fantastic Four trailer shifts aspect ratios." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Fantastic Four trailer shifts aspect ratios." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cccbdc9c0ef49dcac6f0c813627db685" data-recommend-id="image://cccbdc9c0ef49dcac6f0c813627db685" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Fantastic Four trailer shifts aspect ratios." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps </em>takes place in a 1960s-inspired retro-future, so it’s fitting that the trailer starts in a 4:3 aspect ratio similar to what you would have seen on televisions before the introduction of HD widescreen in the 90s and 2000s. It makes a transition to widescreen a few seconds in, so it’s likely most of the film will use the standard 16:9 aspect ratio seen in most modern movies. But 4:3 is making a comeback in recent years with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.avclub.com/nickel-boys-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.avclub.com/nickel-boys-review">modern films like <em>Nickel Boys</em></a></span>, so I wouldn’t be surprised if <em>First Steps </em>had at least some segments in 4:3. The 4:3 segment shown has Pedro Pascal as Reed “Mr. Fantastic” Richards and Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm, aka the Invisible Woman, giving a tour of their home in The Baxter Building, the group’s home base. It seems like a deliberate choice to portray this idyllic domesticity in 4:3, then to transition into the 16:9 aspect ratio when superhero elements like The Thing show up, creating a contrast between the two tones.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="937de6d4be6ee753637597324ed514d4" data-recommend-id="image://937de6d4be6ee753637597324ed514d4" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Thing and H.E.R.B.I.E. are shown cooking in the kitchen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Thing and H.E.R.B.I.E. are shown cooking in the kitchen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="937de6d4be6ee753637597324ed514d4" data-recommend-id="image://937de6d4be6ee753637597324ed514d4" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Thing and H.E.R.B.I.E. are shown cooking in the kitchen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Did you know the “Highly Engineered Robot Built for Interdimensional Exploration” was introduced in a 1978 animated series to replace the Human Torch in the Fantastic Four because <em>The New Fantastic Four</em> didn’t have rights to the character? I didn’t know that until today, but it’s fascinating that the little robot assistant has such an odd history and has still managed to persist. I had my first exposure to him in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, helping him push a payload through Manhattan. Is H.E.R.B.I.E. the Harley Quinn of the Marvel universe?</p><p>Anyway, H.E.R.B.I.E. is shown with an appropriate retro-future look and is kind of giving Rosey from <em>The Jetsons</em>. He’s shown cooking with the Thing, portrayed (with the help of CGI) by <em>The Bear </em>actor Ebon Moss-Bachrach. It’s a cute scene that shows the hero is a gentle giant despite his rocky exterior. But I’m just thinking about the little robot dude. He’s trying his best. He doesn’t have taste buds to know his recipe is missing that special something.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c496951ae26dfbbfff69f052c9982818" data-recommend-id="image://c496951ae26dfbbfff69f052c9982818" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The members of the Fantastic Four are shown putting on their astronaut suits and their rocket blasting off into space." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The members of the Fantastic Four are shown putting on their astronaut suits and their rocket blasting off into space." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c496951ae26dfbbfff69f052c9982818" data-recommend-id="image://c496951ae26dfbbfff69f052c9982818" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The members of the Fantastic Four are shown putting on their astronaut suits and their rocket blasting off into space." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once again we’re back in 4:3, looking at what seems to be archive footage of the Fantastic Four’s foundational voyage into space. (The group’s origin story involves the four astronauts gaining their superhuman powers after exposure to cosmic rays during a mission in space.) While the MCU opted to skip Spider-Man’s origin story after bringing the character into the films a bit late, it looks like Marvel is going to explore the Fantastic Four’s beginnings to some extent in <em>First Steps</em>. We see shots of what looks like Sue’s invisibility manifesting for the first time on their spaceship, and the Thing watching old footage of himself before his skin was replaced with rocks. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e857659dbfc00abc1a95766caf8a6ec1" data-recommend-id="image://e857659dbfc00abc1a95766caf8a6ec1" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Thing watches footage of himself before his became a living rock." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Thing watches footage of himself before his became a living rock." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e857659dbfc00abc1a95766caf8a6ec1" data-recommend-id="image://e857659dbfc00abc1a95766caf8a6ec1" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Thing watches footage of himself before his became a living rock." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the Thing’s most iconic looks sees him in a trench coat and fedora, traditionally a way for the living rock man to get around incognito in the comics ever since the hero’s debut in the 60s.

It’s a fleeting glimpse from behind, showing him looming menacingly over New York and looking at the Statue of Liberty. He also doesn’t speak, so we don’t get to hear the rumbling bass of Ineson’s performance. But maybe that’s the kind of reveal you want to save for close to the movie. Hell, it would be great if we don’t even see him at all until the film is out. I am curious how <em>First Steps</em> will make a Thanos-level threat into something the Fantastic Four will face alone.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="51553e41bb3b6f5e127ce57a62bd71cc" data-recommend-id="image://51553e41bb3b6f5e127ce57a62bd71cc" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Fantastic Four stands on a stage in costume." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Fantastic Four stands on a stage in costume." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51553e41bb3b6f5e127ce57a62bd71cc" data-recommend-id="image://51553e41bb3b6f5e127ce57a62bd71cc" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Fantastic Four stands on a stage in costume." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The trailer ends with a shot of the Fantastic Four donning their blue-and-white uniforms. It’s kind of giving Spirit Halloween, but I’m keeping an open mind. This is meant to portray a different point in history than the rest of the MCU, after all, so it makes sense that they wouldn’t look as glossy and high-tech as the rest of the heroes.</p><p>Surprisingly, we see everyone’s powers in this trailer except for Mr. Fantastic’s. Maybe the stretching limbs are at a different point in the animation process and aren’t ready for primetime. We’ll probably see him in action in the next trailer, sure to arrive sometime between now and when the movie launches on July 25.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Even the newest expansion,<em> Life &amp; Death,</em> is marked down from $40 to $30. And if you have an EA Play or Game Pass Ultimate membership you can get an additional 10 percent off on top of the sale price, bringing the newest expansion’s cost down to $27.

Rather, the gamepad is so damn comfortable to use that it feels like GameSir might as well have taken a mold of my hands to make the Tarantula Pro. I’ve had trouble returning to a DualSense pad since using it.</p><h2 id="h67801"><a id=""></a>The GameSir Tarantula Pro is a symmetrical stick delight</h2><p>I grew up as a PlayStation kid, so I have an affinity for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.techradar.com/gaming/symmetrical-vs-asymmetrical-controller&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.techradar.com/gaming/symmetrical-vs-asymmetrical-controller" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">symmetrical (in-line) sticks</a></span> on my controllers. I was an especially big fan of the DualShock 4 for this reason. But despite having big hands, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.link/nj4w9sm1ecbge&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.link/nj4w9sm1ecbge" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PS5's DualSense</a></span> has always felt slightly too bulky for me, as if my fingers never quite land in the right spot without holding the controller just a bit unnaturally. The moment I laid hands on the GameSir Tarantula Pro, however, it felt like returning home after a long trip away.</p><p>Perhaps the most notable difference for me is how my index fingers rest on the Xbox-style LT/RT triggers on the top of the controller much more naturally than they do with a DualSense controller. When you factor in how easy it is to swap them to hair triggers for even faster response time, it’s made FPS games feel better to play than ever before. There are even two customizable buttons on the back of the controller that sit in the perfect spot for my middle fingers to use—but nearby switches can retract them when not in use, allowing them to sit flush with the rest of the controller’s back. It’s a dream.</p><p>The Tarantula Pro isn’t just comfortable, though. At only $69.99, it’s also an affordable entry point for folks seeking a “pro” controller. Here’s a basic rundown of my favorite features:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>It works on PC or Switch </strong>and features mechanically interchangeable buttons to accommodate which of the two platforms you’re using it on at the time. </li><li><strong>It works on iOS/Android</strong>.</li><li>There are two customizable back buttons that feel great to use.</li><li>I’ve seen solid battery life out of it so far, and there are no signs of that slowing down.</li><li>It has multiple trigger modes, each having a purpose based on the type of game you’re playing.</li></ul><p>The Tarantula Pro isn’t perfect, however. It may be extremely comfortable to hold, but it trades affordability for a bland visual style and a build quality that doesn’t feel quite as premium as its feature set. Also, so much of its functionality is trapped behind button combination shortcuts that it feels like you need a journal to keep up with them all. Oh, and it’s kind of a bummer that you have to shell out an extra $10 for a version with a charging stand.</p><p>There’s no shortage of controllers to choose from these days—especially on PC—and the best choice for you is the one that has all of the features you need at a price you can afford. Though it might lack some features that more hardcore, sweaty pro players might desire, the comfort and functionality of the Tarantula Pro makes it an excellent choice, especially for casual gaming where comfort might be the most valued trait. <br></p><p><br>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
