              <p>Microsoft first unveiled Windows 11 and its Pro version in 2021, and since then, the OS has become the go-to option for students, work professionals, creatives, gamers, and even casual users.</p>
<p>If you’ve been meaning to upgrade but don’t want to spend close to $200 on a license, we’ve found an affordable (and legitimate) route. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/">Stacksocial is currently offering a lifetime license for Microsoft Windows 11 Pro for just $15.</a> That’s a straightforward $184 discount on a one-and-done purchase. Once your purchase is successful, you will receive a digital license key via email, which you can redeem and activate on one device within 30 days.</p>

<h2>A Wide Range of Built-In Productivity Features</h2>
<p>For $15, you’re getting full access to one of the most user-friendly operating systems out there. It comes with a bunch of productive features, such as snap layouts, better voice typing, virtual desktops, and built-in AI with Copilot. Work professionals who take security and performance seriously will also appreciate BitLocker device encryption, Hyper-V virtualization, and Windows Sandbox – all of which make it easy to manage sensitive files and work remotely. Even better, there’s DirectX 12 Ultimate support to ensure a more immersive, high-performance gaming experience on compatible hardware.</p>
<p>However, there are some hardware and system requirements you need to meet before making the jump. Your device will need at least 4GB of RAM, 64GB of storage, a UEFI-based system with Secure Boot, and TPM 2.0 support. It also needs to be running Windows 10 or higher to complete the upgrade process. The display should be at least 9 inches diagonally with 720p resolution and 8 bits per color channel. Also, make sure you have a stable internet connection during the activation process to prevent any slowdowns.</p>



<p>Most modern devices already meet these specs, but we highly recommend double-checking before purchasing. It’s also important to note that this is a digital-only deal, and everything is handled via email. Once you’re all set, proceed with your purchase and use the activation code you receive to finish the process.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/">Overall, it’s a solid opportunity for anyone looking to switch to Windows 11 Pro without spending a lot</a>. This deal takes $184 off the usual $199 price, letting you upgrade for just $15. That’s a massive 92% discount, but it might not last long. Those looking to try Windows 11 Home can also get it for $15, down from $139 after an 89% discount.</p>

              <p>Keeping an eye on your indoor situation is as important as securing the outdoors, especially if you have kids or pets. Roku is now making it easier to protect the insides of your home by offering its indoor camera 2-pack for just $40 on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4788/">That’s a $15 discount, and comes out to be just $20 per camera. Snag the offer before it expires or the stock ends for good!</a></p>

<h2>Detailed Picture, Plus Two-Way Audio for Easy Communication</h2>
<p>These mini wired cameras are easy to set up, and can be placed anywhere around the house – hallway, lounge, kids’ room, your own bedroom, etc. You will enjoy a crisp, detailed 1080p HD full-color picture in all lighting conditions, whether it’s a sunny day or dark in the middle of the night. There’s two-way audio that lets you communicate with whoever is on the other side, which is great to stay in touch with your children and calm them down when you’re not around.</p>
<p>You will receive instant motion and sound alerts on your smartphone if the camera senses something. And if you don’t want to bother with certain areas, just set custom motion detection zones to only be notified when there’s activity in the important ones. Emergency situations are covered too, since the camera alerts you the moment it hears a smoke or CO alarm in the house.</p>



<p>Monitoring everything is quite simple. You can do that using your phone or pull a live feed on your Roku TV. It supports voice control, so you don’t even need to get up from the couch to see what your kids or pets are up to. All these features are included in the basic, no-subscription-required plan. But for more advanced features, you can consider getting a Roku smart home subscription. This gets you access to cloud recordings, smart detection that can differentiate between pets, objects, and people, plus smart alerts to minimize false alarms.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4788/">Since this pack gets you two cameras, you can place them in different areas for better, maximum coverage.</a> Maybe install one in the living room, and the other in your kids’ room as a baby monitor. It now costs $40 to grab the pair, which is a nice $15 discount. You’re getting stunning clarity, two-way audio, instant alerts, and so much more in a compact build. Just be sure to grab these fast, as the deal might expire any moment now.</p>
