              <p>A computer is not just a bright new device: it’s also an entrance to your entire digital life. But with that entrance comes the <strong>threat of dark unseen dangers</strong>: hackers, scams, and viruses just waiting to leap at the most inconvenient time. And with Labor Day weekend and back-to-school season already upon us, there’s no better time to lock down your digital life with strong protection that works behind the scenes.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/">Avast is offering a fantastic deal with up to 60% off its security products</a>, making it easier than ever to secure your devices without stretching your budget. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/">Avast Premium Security is available for just $31.20 for the first year</a> ($2,60 a month) for one device. But if you’re looking to protect the whole family or all your gadgets, their 10-device plan wraps your laptops, phones and tablets under one simple subscription.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Avast Premium Security</a></p>

<h2>Protects Your Digital Life</h2>
<p>So, just what does Avast Premium Security do, then? It’s a lot more than your average antivirus: It prevents viruses, malware, and ransomware from causing harm. It also catches phishing scams that want you to give up sensitive information. And it blocks remote access attacks and keeps would-be digital hijackers at bay. <strong>Whether you’re buying online, streaming, banking, or just browsing</strong>, Avast Premium Security operates behind the scenes keeping everything private and secure.</p>
<p>If you desire the ultimate peace of mind, Avast Ultimate is where it’s at – <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/">and it’s currently on sale at $3.67 per month (60% off)</a>. You get all Premium Security features, plus Avast SecureLine VPN which keeps your internet connection safe and your identity hidden (just the thing when you’re browsing public Wi-Fi). And then there’s Cleanup Premium which streamlines and optimizes your PC by deleting junk files and speeds things up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Avast Ultimate</a></p>
<p>So the choice between Premium Security and Ultimate ultimately comes down to what you’re looking for: For superb malware, ransomware, and phishing protection, Premium Security is sufficient. But if you also want extra privacy, advanced device cleaning, and VPN protection, Ultimate offers those extras in one powerful bundle. No matter your choice, Avast is a security leader you can trust and protects hundreds of millions of individuals worldwide. Those days of the “free antivirus” are over—it’s an entire suite of tools for today’s world of connectivity.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-has-a-huge-surplus-of-bose-tv-speakers-so-its-selling-them-now-for-peanuts-2000621690</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-has-a-huge-surplus-of-bose-tv-speakers-so-it%E2%80%99s-selling-them-now-for-peanuts.1284888/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is shaking things up this Labor Day weekend, going after all the big names – and Bose is no exception. If you’ve been thinking about upgrading your audio setup, now’s a great moment to jump in: The Bose TV Speaker, which <strong>works as both a soundbar for your TV and a simple living room speaker</strong><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/">, is down to just $163 on Amazon (41% off)</a>. Considering that it normally retails for $279, that is a huge discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Our Favorite Speaker</h2>
<p>The speaker is designed to<strong> improve the audio from your TV without the bulk of standard soundbars</strong>. It’s simple to hook up with HDMI-ARC, so installation is fast and hassle-free. The HDMI-ARC (Audio Return Channel) permits the soundbar to both transmit and receive audio via the same cable as video, less cord clutter and neater installation. <strong>And it has Bluetooth</strong>, so listening to music or podcasts from your phone or tablet is ridiculously easy and wireless.</p>
<p>Another of the first things you’ll notice about this soundbar is just how evenly balanced and clean-sounding its sound is. Bose engineered it to maximize conversation clarity which is a big plus if you catch yourself from time to time having trouble hearing every word or being drowned out by other sounds when you watch TV. The speaker’s voice-centric design is made to prioritize voices without comprising the depth of your go-to TV movies or shows.</p>
<p>The speaker uses proprietary drivers and proprietary digital signal processing to deliver clear sound that fills the room beyond your TV’s built-in speakers. Bass is unexpectedly strong for something this compact, providing kick to action flicks and music rhythms without distortion, making it a more immersive experience. You feel the actual sense you’re bringing your entertainment to the next level without complicated setups or humongous speakers.</p>



<p>Compact and slim, the Bose speaker just sits on a shelf or TV stand without wasting space or being in the way of your room’s decor. Its black veneer adds a touch of modern sophistication. It can also sit flat on your TV or be mounted on the wall using the included mounting bracket with some adjustability to fit your living room.</p>
<p>The <strong>attached remote control</strong> is another thoughtful touch: It allows you to easily control your sound level, bass, and whatnot, without having to search through a bunch of devices just to get your sound in balance.</p>
<p><span>This is a great opportunity to treat your home audio to an affordable boost this Labor Day weekend.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Borderlands 4 Post-Launch Roadmap Reveals The Return Of Something Fans Loved From Borderlands 2]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pearls-roadmap-takedown-dlc-free-update-2000621708</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-post-launch-roadmap-reveals-the-return-of-something-fans-loved-from-borderlands-2.1284876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Just a couple weeks before launch, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-tag-70-drama-pitchford-80-real-fan-1851784583"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> has announced its post-launch roadmap for free updates and paid DLC throughout the next six months and it’s a lot. But one of the smaller details fans were surprised to see is the return of Pearlescent weapons and shields from <em>Borderlands 2</em>.</p> <p>The <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/post-launch-roadmap/?linkId=856235028">rundown of <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s end-game</a> arrived alongside a developer panel at PAX West walking fans through how the XP-based loot grind will work this time around. The game’s first paid bounty pack arrives in the fall with new missions, a new boss fight, and a slew of Legendary gear and fresh cosmetics. There will also be Vault Cards that let players grind to unlock extra rewards, including gear that can keep being re-rolled until players find the version that fits their build.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000621710" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000621710"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000621710">Gearbox Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p>But the big update is <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s first paid Story Pack coming in early 2026. It’ll feature a new Vault Hunter, a mini-story campaign, new area to explore, and another trove of collectibles. It’s a cosmic-horror-themed expansion based around Mad Ellie, a Pandoran mechanic who happens to be Moxxi’s daughter. Some other past characters will be returning as well, with a second Story Pack following later in the year.</p>

 <h2><em>Borderlands 2</em>‘s Pearlescent drops are back</h2> <p>There are plenty of free updates sprinkled in between each DLC, but the biggest will arrive alongside Bounty Pack 2 in early 2026. It adds the Pearlescent rarity to the game, something fans have been begging to be brought back from<em> Borderlands 2</em> after it was dropped for <em>Borderlands 3</em>.</p> <p>These drops are essentially like ultra-rare drops with unique gimmicks. When they arrived in <em>Borderlands 2</em> they didn’t make or break builds. There were more like Shinies from <em>Pokémon</em> than <em>Diablo’</em>s Uniques, sought after as prizes rather than the deadliest tools in the game. <em>Borderlands 4</em> might change that this time around, however. “Pearlescent gear drops will be incredibly difficult to find, but their power level will match their coveted rarity,” writes Gearbox.</p>

 <h2>Where are <em>Borderlands 3</em>‘s Takedowns?</h2> <p>A returning feature the studio hasn’t mentioned yet are Takedowns. <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-3s-next-big-expansion-will-be-a-western-1843586642">These free updates for <em>Borderlands 3</em></a> were raid-boss-adjacent endgame modes that were designed to push squads of players to the breaking point with their difficulty. Gearbox hasn’t mentioned them by name yet, thought it has mentioned Invincible Bosses coming in a future free update for <em>Borderlands 4</em>.</p> <p>“Think of them as bosses on steroids: new unique mechanics, massive health pools (not literally invincible, but close to it), extremely lethal attack damage, and other new modifiers that can make quick work of any unprepared Vault Hunters,” the new announcement reads. The first of these will drop before the end of 2025. Weekly big encore boss fights, wildcard missions, and Maurice’s Black Market Machine are all coming after launch as well.</p> <p>If <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s base campaign can deliver a better story than <em>Borderlands 3</em> and make good on the <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-split-screen-coop-switch-2-amon-skill-tree-2000618064">promised variety, variability, and build-crafting depth</a> of the new Vault Hunters, the post-launch roadmap definitely looks like it will be showering players with all of the content they’ll want in the endgame. Those are two big ifs. But with <em>Destiny 2</em> currently spiraling and <em>Diablo 4</em> still awaiting its next big expansion, I’m as primed for some fresh, smooth-brained loot chasing as I’ll ever be.</p>

              <p><em>Mortal Kombat 2</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/mortal-kombat-2-karl-urban-johnny-cage-first-trailer-1851786495">was set to hit theaters</a> on October 24, just a week before Halloween. It seemed like good timing for a hyper-violent video game classic about warriors fighting horrors from other dimensions. Apparently Warner Bros. disagreed. The studio has now delayed the sequel by nearly seven months because it thinks the corny fist-fest can make more money in the spring.</p> <p>That’s according <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/08/mortal-kombat-ii-opening-date-1236501771/">to <em>Deadline</em></a>, which reported the news late on Friday before the Labor Day holiday weekend. It claims “research screenings have been strong” and that Warner Bros. didn’t want to bury its latest video game adaptation in a “crowded late October frame” between<em> Springsteen Deliver Me From Nowhere</em> and <em>Regretting You</em>.</p> <p>So instead, <em>Mortal Kombat 2</em> will now come out on May 15, 2026.<em> Avengers: Doomsday</em> was originally set to open that month but was pushed back to December of next year. The only real competition will be <i>The Mandalorian and Grogu</i>, which arrives at the end of next May. So even if <em>Mortal Kombat 2</em> ends up having a surprisingly long tail, it’ll probably get kicked out of most theaters by<em> Star Wars</em>.</p> <p>The sequel brings in<em> The Boys</em>‘ Karl Urban as the shade-wearing, split-kicking Johnny Cage and its July trailer looked decent. If it has the budget to double-down on some of the big spectacle fight sequences the 2021 reboot was missing, it could be fun, though I still think its cheesy gore-fest sensibility was a great fit for Halloween. I don’t usually like slasher movies but I’ll make an exception if Scorpion’s the one doing the impaling.</p>
