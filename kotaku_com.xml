              <p>The current YouTube thumbnail meta requires people to pose extravagant claims or make dramatic declarations alongside exaggerated facial expressions of shock or skepticism. It’s <a href="https://nationalpost.com/news/mind-the-curiosity-gap-how-can-upworthy-be-noble-and-right-when-its-clickbait-headlines-feel-so-wrong">curiosity gap</a> farming on steroids, increasingly aided by genAI to flood the platform with absurd content. BabyTuber thumbnails are the antidote.</p> <p>An artist who goes by Jamie on Bluesky shared the first one <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lmaonadestand.bsky.social/post/3md7egs5bus2l">earlier this week</a>. It was titled “Why I’m Switching” and showed an infant furrowing its brow while pondering upgrading from toy blocks to a bead maze. There’s a thought bubble, a greater than sign, and a question mark. It’s perfect.</p>   <p>Jamie encouraged others to get in on the fun and share their own Babytuber thumbnails. Some people did. They are also perfect.</p>   <figure id="attachment_2000663921" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663921"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663921">pikuselu.gay</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000663922" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663922"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663922">‪@wimbostratus.bsky.social‬Follow</figcaption></figure>   <figure id="attachment_2000663923" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663923"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663923">misguidedlavender.bsky.social</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000663924" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663924"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663924">athenap.bsky.social</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000663925" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663925"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663925">nishbae.bsky.social</figcaption></figure> <figure id="attachment_2000663926" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663926"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663926">kinbassar.bsky.social</figcaption></figure> <p>“At the end of the day it’s been fun to see people enjoying it, especially in a time where [every] headline online has been miserable,” Jamie <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-new-baby-youtuber-thumbnail-meta-changes-everything/">told <em>Aftermath</em></a>. “If this silly thing was able to brighten people’s day at all then I’m happy. I’m glad my mutuals seem to be having a laugh instead of being annoyed, haha.”</p>

 <p>Now I need someone to make Baby LinkedIn posts. “Here’s what my 2-year sleep regression taught me about B2B sales.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The decline in Xbox hardware revenue has become so predictable you could <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-bethesda-xbox-game-pass-watch-special-edition-1850527638">set your <em>Starfield</em> watch to it</a>. Microsoft reported its second-quarter earnings on Wednesday and, yes, console sales are down yet again. But the rest of the gaming division didn’t have a such a hot holiday either. The company is blaming year-over-year declines on the lack of strong releases near the end of 2025. Hmmm.</p> <p>“Xbox content and services revenue declined 5 percent (down 6 percent CC) on a prior year comparable that benefited from strong first-party content performance,” reads the company’s <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https://microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/FY-2026-Q2/Document/DownloadDocument/141/SlidesFY26Q2.pptx">latest earnings presentation</a>. “Xbox hardware revenue declined 32 percent.”</p>

 <p>But last year’s numbers weren’t exactly stellar. The gaming division <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-revenue-fell-7-in-q2-as-hardware-sales-dropped-29/">saw a 7 percent decline</a> overall in the second quarter. Xbox hardware was down 29 percent this time in 2025, while content and services were only up 2 percent. Holiday 2024 had <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> and <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> but was otherwise quiet.</p> <p>Holiday 2025, on the other hand, saw the release of <em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em>and&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, while<em> Flight Sim</em> came to PS5. Also the underperforming <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> which, combined with a major Game Pass price hike, might have led to a spike in churn. We don’t know, though, because Microsoft still isn’t releasing new subscriber numbers.</p>

 <p>All we know for sure is that the Xbox Series X/S is an ever-shrinking part of the equation for Microsoft Gaming and the company in general. And it’s been that way <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-sales-microsoft-next-gen-exclusives-1850375665">almost every year</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-ps5-sales-exclusivity-starfield-microsoft-1851436748">since the consoles launched</a>. The company has promised <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-next-gen-backwards-compatibility-microsoft-pc-2000644836">new hardware</a> but the priorities of the evolving Xbox platform seem to increasingly lie beyond it.</p>

 <p>With the AI arms race led by Microsoft and others spiking <a href="https://kotaku.com/intel-cpu-production-pivot-ai-data-centers-shortages-increase-price-ram-memory-pc-2000663095">gaming hardware costs in the near term</a>, maybe that’s for the best.</p>
