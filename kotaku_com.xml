One of these apparently included a Scooby-Doo theme complete with mini-figures, sound effects, and an “incredibly elaborate” PowerPoint presentation.</p><p>“It was <em>Scooby-Doo and The Haunting of Merkmiss Manor</em>, and they had to go and figure out who the Merkmiss monster was, and unmask a bunch of local townspeople, and then clearly they weren’t the real villains,” he told Semafor. “It was evil Lyle Blackwood who was trying to steal the Blackwood fortune.”</p><p>It’s unclear exactly how much of that particular session was made with the help of AI, but Cocks said he believes AI is “supercharging fandom” and will be “a great leveler for user-generated content” in the future. He also sees financial upsides for Hasbro. Possible examples mentioned by <em>Semafor</em> are “subscription services letting other Dungeon Masters enrich their D&amp;D campaigns, or offerings to let parents customize Peppa Pig animations.”</p><p>This isn’t the first time Cocks has praised the possibilities for generative AI in the toy and gaming space. “I’m probably more excited, though, about the playful elements of AI,” he said <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://futurism.com/hasbro-ceo-ai-dungeons-dragons&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://futurism.com/hasbro-ceo-ai-dungeons-dragons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">during a Goldman Sachs conference last year</a></span>. “I play with probably 30 or 40 people regularly. There’s not a single person who doesn’t use AI somehow for either campaign development or character development or story ideas. That’s a clear signal that we need to be embracing it.”</p><p>In the past, Cocks pointed to having ChatGPT help with scripts and Bing’s image generator create the art. It seems like it’s only a matter of time before Hasbro is trying to sell <em>D&amp;D</em> versions of those features directly to players. “We can leverage all of that to be able to build very interesting and compelling use cases for AI that can bring our characters to life,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://venturebeat.com/games/how-hasbro-is-jumping-on-the-game-opportunity-chris-cocks-interview/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://venturebeat.com/games/how-hasbro-is-jumping-on-the-game-opportunity-chris-cocks-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said last fall</a></span>. “We can build tools that aid in content creation for users or create really interesting gamified scenarios around them.”</p><p>That philosophy appears to be on a collision course with the current official stance by Wizards of the Coast’s D&amp;D team, which currently bans the use of AI in generating final products. “For 50 years, D&amp;D has been built on the innovation, ingenuity, and hard work of talented people who sculpt a beautiful, creative game,” the team wrote <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://dnd-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/26243094975252-Generative-AI-art-FAQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://dnd-support.wizards.com/hc/en-us/articles/26243094975252-Generative-AI-art-FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a 2023 statement</a></span>. “That isn’t changing. Our internal guidelines remain the same with regards to artificial intelligence tools: We require artists, writers, and creatives contributing to the D&amp;D TTRPG to refrain from using AI generative tools to create final D&amp;D products. We work with some of the most talented artists and creatives in the world, and we believe those people are what makes D&amp;D great.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Just when you thought Kojima probably couldn’t share any more about the game without spoiling he said, “Oh, just watch me.” The footage opens with a character named Neil who appears to be some sort of black ops spook called in for one last job to smuggle pregnant women across the U.S. Mexico border. He’s played by Italian actor Luca Marinelli and gives intense <em>Metal Gear</em> vibes by the end of the trailer. </p><p> Toward the end of the footage we see him wrapping a bandana around his head and emerging from a burning church with a squad of skeleton soldiers and fireworks exploding in the background like a death cult 4th of July celebration. There are callbacks to Mads Mikkelsen’s Clifford Unger in the first game, as well as obvious allusions to Kojima’s own <em>Metal Gear </em>series and its generations-spanning special forces operative named Snake. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1j7i9fh/luca_marinelli_i_think_if_he_donned_a_bandana_hed/?rdt=55212&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1j7i9fh/luca_marinelli_i_think_if_he_donned_a_bandana_hed/?rdt=55212" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans were quick to point out</a></span> that the director had previously tweeted that Marinelli would make a great Snake in a live action movie. The post came after the actor appeared in the otherwise pretty mediocre Netflix action blockbuster about immortal soldiers called <em>Old Guard</em>. Leave it to Kojima to weave an apparent troll of his former publisher, Konami, into meta commentary for his next serpentine-plotted thriller. </p><p>The trailer ends with Nicolas Winding Refn’s Heartman merging his DHV Magellan ship with a massive BT (hence the collector’s edition statue) to fight another massive BT and a ghostly Kaiju showdown of oozing black oil and paranormal horror. When <em>Death Stranding 2</em> was announced there were a lot of people, including myself, wondering why in the world we needed a sequel. After nearly 30 minutes of carefully crafted pre-release trailers, I’m 100 percent on board. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
