However, the community has been slowly ramping back up ever since <em>Andor</em>’s season two series finale in May. It peaked at around 18,000 concurrent players that month. Then over the past weekend it doubled to an all-time record of 35,321. <br></p><p>The caveat there is that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-the-kotaku-review-1820477183&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-the-kotaku-review-1820477183"><em>Battlefront 2</em> wasn’t</a></span> on Steam back during its initial launch, only arriving years later after beginning life on PC as an EA Origin launcher exclusive.

The drama-fueled, high-stakes thriller ends just before the biggest <em>Star Wars</em> battles kick off in<em> Rogue One </em>and <em>A New Hope</em>. A true feeling of catharsis to the galactic conflict only existed off screen, leaving fans looking for ways to reenact the showdowns for which <em>Andor</em> lays the groundwork.<br></p><p>It helped that one of the show’s actors, Muhannad Ben Amor, used the spotlight to share his <em>Battlefront 2</em> love in an Instagram story <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/WeWantBattlefront3/comments/1ksf0gq/muhannad_ben_amor_who_plays_wilmon_in_andor_has/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WeWantBattlefront3/comments/1ksf0gq/muhannad_ben_amor_who_plays_wilmon_in_andor_has/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that subsequently went viral</a></span>. He said he played almost 500 hours of the game when he was younger (he was only 12 when it released) and called for a sequel.  “Grew up with <em>Battlefront 2</em>—been a veteran since day one,” Amor said. “Let’s HOPE <em>Battlefront 3</em> happens.” He wasn’t the only one trying to manifest <em>Battlefront</em>’s return on social media. </p><p>The Reels and TikTok algorithms were full of <em>Star Wars </em>memes after <em>Andor</em> wrapped, and they instantly became a pipeline to nostalgia-bait of people playing and talking about <em>Battlefront 2</em> like it was a lost treasure from a bygone era. The flood of content was a mix of players reliving the game’s greatest hits, like transforming into Yoda or Darth Vader and demolishing opponents on the battlefield, or putting life on hold to finish Supremacy matches like school had just let out for the summer  in the late, pre-pandemic 2010s.</p><p>Social media platforms convincing you that everyone else is doing a thing can be a powerful incentive. FOMO is a hell of a drug. It also helps that<em> Battlefront 2 </em>is currently dirt cheap. The game is on sale for just $4 on PC and disc copies are still bargain bin fodder at places like GameStop. But I think another major dynamic to the <em>Battlefront</em> renaissance is a recent frenzy of <em>Titanfall</em> rumors <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/respawn-layoffs-star-wars-jedi-apex-legends-titanfall-1851778330&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/respawn-layoffs-star-wars-jedi-apex-legends-titanfall-1851778330">that culminated in the news</a></span> that a mech-based multiplayer incubation project had just been canned at EA. Amid fresh layoffs even as the<em> Madden</em> publisher lavishes shareholders with stock buybacks, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ksngo8/comment/mtoqfhz/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ksngo8/comment/mtoqfhz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the calls for <em>Battlefront 3</em></a></span><em> </em>have reached a fever pitch at the exact moment when it seems the least likely to ever become a reality.</p><p>The role of <em>Battlefront 2</em> as a “throwback” to a better time is an ironic one considering <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/battlefront-2s-complete-history-from-launch-to-its-fin-1843248296&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/battlefront-2s-complete-history-from-launch-to-its-fin-1843248296">its greatest legacy remains a pay-to-win loot box cash grab so brazen</a></span> it forced the entire gaming industry to back off of the microtransaction trend. But with that controversy no longer shading every aspect of the conversation around the game, the parts of <em>Battlefront 2</em> that were fun have been able to shine more than ever. Unburdened by the hype and new release expectations of a $60 game, <em>Battlefront 2</em> can just be that multiplayer distraction that hits all of the <em>Star Wars</em> fanservice sweet spots. <em>Battlefront 3</em> might never happen, but the dream of one has never been more alive. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-andor-sequel-steam-ps5-cheap-1851784922]]></content:encoded>

Though the game is built upon the same mythology as the rest of the series, <em>Cyber Sleuth </em>is a standalone story that anyone can enjoy. Admittedly, the turn-based battles are pretty rote (<em>Time Stranger </em>is a pretty big improvement, based on what I played at Summer Game Fest), but their simplicity means they don’t get in the way of the real meat: the detective story and dense monster-taming mechanics.</p><p>Even if you’re not looking for a critter collectathon, <em>Cyber Sleuth</em>’s biggest draw is its <em>Persona</em>-esque vibes and its elaborate mystery. As the title suggests, you play as a digital detective who is investigating a virtual reality world called EDEN, where users are logging in and ending up in a comatose state in the real world. The titular digital monsters are also running rampant through the program, and as the lines between real and digital begin to blur, it’s up to you and your friends to get to the bottom of the calamity that threatens both worlds. It’s got a lot of moving parts, but it all comes together in a really satisfying fashion by the end of its roughly 50-hour run.</p><p><em>Hacker’s Memory</em>, meanwhile, is a parallel story that follows a hacker who is dealing with all this nonsense from a different perspective, and is best played after <em>Cyber Sleuth,</em> as its story overlaps with the original. It’s another 50 hours or so of digital detective work, and while it’s not quite as impactful, it’s still a great, meaty addition to a game that deserves more players. With sales this cheap and <em>Time Stranger </em>on the way, there’s never been a better time to give one of the best <em>Digimon </em>games a shot.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-cyber-sleuth-switch-pc-sale-hacker-memory-1851784914]]></content:encoded>
