And yes, that $91 million is impressive, but it’s still less than  the last three films earned during their opening weekends. </p><p>Overseas, <em>Jurassic World Rebirth</em> has been even more successful, bringing in $171 million during the film’s first five days in theaters.

However, this time around, the film has a brand new cast of characters, is set in a new location, and includes some new, mutated dinosaur hybrid monsters. After the events of the last <em>Jurassic World</em> trilogy, dinosaurs have mostly died out and are now only found on islands around the equator. A team of mercenaries and a stranded family land on one particular island that has giant dinos, where the plan is to grab their blood to create a powerful new medicine. But things don’t go as planned, and people get eaten. </p><p>The movie has received mixed reviews from critics, but fans seem to love it. Do they love it enough to help <em>Rebirth </em>hit a billion? Not sure. All of the previous <em>Jurassic World</em> movies hit a billion dollars by the end of their runs. We’ll have to wait and see if <em>Rebirth </em>matches that, but for now, it’s looking pretty likely. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-box-office-scarlett-johansson-1851785708]]></content:encoded>

It seemed to have fizzled out in early 2025, but thanks to some YouTube drama the campaign has come back to life with over a million fans voicing their support. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197554" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="GTA 6 Delay Has Enormous Implications For The Industry" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="113" data-playlist="197554,196299,195410" data-current="197554"><div><p>GTA 6 Delay Has Enormous Implications For The Industry</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197554/197554_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23078.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The resurgence began with a new video from Accursed Farms two weeks ago titled, “The end of Stop Killing Games.” In it, Scott laid out why he thought the initiative has run out of steam and was failing, laying no small part of the blame at the feet of fellow YouTuber Jason “Thor” Hall, a former Blizzard developer more commonly known by his indie studio pseudonym Pirate Software. Scott accused Hall of leveraging the latter’s big viewership to misinterpret and spread falsehoods about the “Stop Killing Games” initiative, in part by casting it as naïve and unworkable in the modern gaming landscape where always-online and server-centric releases are flopping all the time. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedrama/comments/1emf1cr/thor_piratesoftware_posts_a_response_to_the_stop/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/youtubedrama/comments/1emf1cr/thor_piratesoftware_posts_a_response_to_the_stop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It wasn’t the first time</a></span> Scott and Hall went into a tit-for-tat post-and-response spree on YouTube, but it may have been the most beneficial for the “Stop Killing Games” movement. Scott’s video, which elicited <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Scary_Triangle/status/1937355553447043233&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Scary_Triangle/status/1937355553447043233" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a fresh round of debate from Hall</a></span>, netted over 750,000 views. More importantly, other big names started chiming in. Content personality Charles “Critikal” White Jr. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sJpTCitKqw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sJpTCitKqw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted about the topic in a June 24 video</a></span> that hit over 2 million views, with the entire exchange becoming ripe for YouTube’s algorithm-fueled drama industrial complex. <br></p><p>This has all helped funnel tons of signatures into the various “Stop Killing Games” petitions floating around online, the biggest of which is the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2024/000007_en&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://citizens-initiative.europa.eu/initiatives/details/2024/000007_en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Stop Destroying Videogames” European Citizens’ Initiative</a></span> which now has over 1.23 million people listed in support, and aims to “prevent the remote disabling of videogames by the publishers, before providing reasonable means to continue functioning of said videogames without the involvement from the side of the publisher.” </p><p>The hope is that more publishers will build offline modes into their games—something <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-offline-mode-deathstroke-season-4-1851715898&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-offline-mode-deathstroke-season-4-1851715898"><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em> recently did</a></span>—or provide the tools for fan communities to support games post-shutdown, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gameworldobserver.com/2023/01/11/duelyst-open-source-counterplay-games-source-code&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2023/01/11/duelyst-open-source-counterplay-games-source-code" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as done by the makers of <em>Duelyst</em></a></span>. At the very least, the goal is to prevent companies from taking away games that people already bought by revoking licenses. The stakes of the fight, including for game preservation in general, are currently on full display with <em>Anthem</em>, the troubled but unique <em>Iron Man</em>-inspired loot shooter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/anthem-servers-still-up-shut-down-bioware-ea-1851785618&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-servers-still-up-shut-down-bioware-ea-1851785618">that EA is now sunsetting in January 2026</a></span>. Unless something changes, no one will be able to play it ever again following that server shutdown. </p><p>The re-energized “Stop Killing Games” campaign has even elicited a full rebuttal by the European game industry lobbying group Video Games Europe, which represents all the biggest companies from Microsoft and Epic Games to Roblox and Warner Bros. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameseurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/VGE-Position-Discontinuation-of-Support-to-Online-Games-04072025.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameseurope.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/VGE-Position-Discontinuation-of-Support-to-Online-Games-04072025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The five-page response argues</a></span> that preservation protections would, among other things,  place burdensome limits on game makers, lead to even more costs as game budgets are skyrocketing, and even create issues for player safety and privacy. </p><p> “As rightsholders and economic entities, video games companies must remain free to decide when an online game is no longer commercially viable and to end continued server support for that game. Imposing a legal obligation to continue server support indefinitely, or to develop online video games in a specific technical manner that will allow permanent use, will raise the costs and risks of developing such games,” the lobbying group claims. It also states that companies are already committed to “serious professional efforts to preserve video games.”</p><p>It lists companies investing in their own video game collections as one such effort, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://embracergamesarchive.com/about/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://embracergamesarchive.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">linking to Embracer’s private archive</a></span>. What could be more reassuring than leaving the fate of preservation in the hands of one of the most ill-fated, acquisition-fueled gaming conglomerates in the industry?</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/stop-killing-games-accursed-farms-piratesoftware-eu-1851785707]]></content:encoded>

However, you’ll come across some battles with support enemies that can buff or heal other foes in the fight. In these cases, always <strong>focus your attention on the support enemy to make the battle go more smoothly</strong>.

In the three years since then, however, both the developer and the animation team at Studio Trigger said multiple times that they’d be open to a new <em>Cyberpunk </em>anime. Now, we’re finally getting one and it will, surprisingly, carry the <em>Edgerunners</em> name.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195259" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Phantom Liberty Is Undoing One Key Thing That Cyberpunk Got Right" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="229" data-playlist="195259,195386,195734" data-current="195259"><div><p>Phantom Liberty Is Undoing One Key Thing That Cyberpunk Got Right</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195259/195259_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195259/195259_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195259/195259_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195259/195259_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20720.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On July 4, CD Projekt Red announced that <em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners 2 </em>is now in development over at Studio Trigger, and will feature a new, standalone story told across 10 episodes. We don’t know much about it beyond that it will be some kind of revenge story, as the official description calls it a “raw chronicle of redemption and revenge.”</p><p>“In a city that thrives in the spotlight of violence, one question remains: when the world is blinded by spectacle, what extremes do you have to go to make your story matter?”</p><p>The next day, the company released a minute-long teaser that is mostly made up of footage from the first season, showing (spoilers) the original <em>Edgerunners </em>crew’s deaths. We then see silhouettes of what seems to be the new cast, with a lingering shot on what looks like a young child holding an old camcorder. I’ve seen some chatter suggesting that this girl could be the daughter of season one stars David and Lucy, but that’s just theorycrafting at this point.</p><p>While we still don’t know much, it does sound like <em>Edgerunners 2 </em>is going to be a bit of a bummer.

I’m from Poland and people in Poland are sad. They are born sad, they die sad, so I just wanted to make the whole world sad.”</p><p>I’m always down for a trip back to Night City, and if the season is truly a stand-alone story that won’t trample all over the first season’s perfect ending, then I’m all for another round of <em>Edgerunners</em>.
