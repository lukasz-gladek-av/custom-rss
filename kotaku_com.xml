Pitchford has since claimed that the game’s release date shifting has nothing to do with other games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>or <em>Marathon</em></a></span><em>. </em>Regardless, the looter shooter is coming out sooner than expected, and so it makes sense that Gearbox wanted to show it off via a new PlayStation State of Play.</p><p>On April 30,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/30/borderlands-4-revealing-vault-hunter-skills-new-planet-kairos-and-more/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/30/borderlands-4-revealing-vault-hunter-skills-new-planet-kairos-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sony aired a 2o-minute gameplay deep dive into <em>Borderlands 4</em></a></span> in which we learned a lot more about the upcoming FPS. Here are 13 key pieces of information from the event.</p><hr><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Pitchford claims <em>Borderlands 4 </em>is going to have a more “grounded tone” that harkens back to the original game.</li><li>Two of the new Vault Hunters in the game were given names and we learned more about them. Vex is a powerful Siren with a ghost-tiger that she can pet and use in combat. Rafa is a former Tediore soldier who uses advanced tech during fights. </li><li><em>Borderlands 4 </em>is set on Kairos, a new planet that was previously controlled and hidden by a mysterious alien being known as the Timekeeper. Some years before the game started, however, a rogue moon crashed into the planet and caused a ton of chaos. (OG character Lilith might have been involved in that...) </li><li>The looter shooter will support crossplay at launch. It will also let you play two-player split screen c0-op. While playing with others you’ll be able to set your own difficulty and all loot will be instanced, so no gun stealing between friends. </li><li>Kairos will feature four massive zones that players can explore freely with  no loading screens. In the mission we saw during the demo, the new hunters were infiltrating a secret blacksite research facility alongside <em>Borderlands 3</em> character Armata. </li><li>You can now glide across large gaps and use your zipline on certain points in exploration or during combat. Gearbox confirmed that sliding, double jumping and dashing are back, too. </li><li>Players will have access to a “Digirunner,” a vehicle which looks a lot like a Sparrow from <em>Destiny</em>. These are single-seat hovercraft that you can spawn into at any point while out in the world. </li><li>While exploring Kairos you’ll discover silos. These are locations that aren’t tied to side quests, but function more like the kinds of activities you might seen in a big open-world game like <em>Assassin’s Creed. </em></li><li>Most of the weapon manufactures from past games, like Tediore and Jakobs, are back. But this time around guns can spawn with “Licensed Parts.” So a Jakobs rifle might have a different brand of scope or barrel, which might change how it fires or the kind of damage it does. This will make the already wildly unique loot you find in <em>Borderlands</em> games even more varied. </li><li>Speaking of loot, Gearbox has reworked how often rare loot drops and promises that Legendaries will be rarer and more powerful than in <em>Borderlands 3</em>. You’ll also be able to unlock enhancements that can make certain weapon brands more powerful. </li><li><em>Borderlands 4 </em>will feature repayable missions and boss fights, which should make it easier than ever to grind for specific loot.</li></ul><p>So yeah, we learned a lot of about <em>Borderlands 4</em>! And I’m excited to see more of the game between now and its (earlier than planned) launch of September 12. <em>Borderlands 4</em> is set to arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Switch 2.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
