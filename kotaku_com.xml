I’ve been playing it with my wife over the last few days  and I have to agree. It’s a truly incredible game that is packed with hundreds of cool moments and ideas. And it seems we aren’t alone in loving <em>Split Fiction</em> because looking around at ever publicly available metric on hand, the game is a smash hit. </p><h2 id="h57758"><a id=""></a>Impressive Steam numbers and Metacritic scores</h2><p>First, lets look at Metacritic, which is a useful if flawed metric of how well a game is doing overall with critics across multiple sites and outlets. The review aggregator has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/game/split-fiction/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Split Fiction</em>, as of March 7, sitting at 91 on PS5 and 92 on Xbox and PC.</a></span> That’s damn impressive, and it’s enough to make it 2025's highest-rated game thus far. But it’s also a big deal for publisher EA, as <em>Split Fiction</em> is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gagadget.com/en/597837-split-fiction-is-the-first-game-for-electronic-arts-in-13-years-to-receive-90-points-on-metacritic/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gagadget.com/en/597837-split-fiction-is-the-first-game-for-electronic-arts-in-13-years-to-receive-90-points-on-metacritic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EA’s first video game to score a 90 or higher</a></span> on Metacritic in 13 years. The last time that happened was in 2012 with <em>Mass Effect 3. </em></p><p>Next, we can look at Steam and how many people are playing the game on Valve’s popular PC storefront. According to the ever-reliable SteamDB, just a few hours after launch, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/app/2001120/charts/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/app/2001120/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Split Fiction </em>had over 190,000 active concurrent players</a></span>. Wowza! That means it was as popular as Steam giants like <em>GTA V, Rust, </em>and <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. That high number also set a record for EA. <em>Split Fiction</em>’s peak player count of 197,000 is the second highest concurrent number EA has achieved on Steam. Only <em>Apex Legends</em>, a free-to-play battle royale shooter, has done better. </p><p>It should also be noted that unlike most other EA games, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pc-steam-third-party-ea-ubisoft-ditching-launchers-civ6-1851623212&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pc-steam-third-party-ea-ubisoft-ditching-launchers-civ6-1851623212"><em>Split Fiction </em>(like 2024's <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a></span>) doesn’t require you to install and use a separate EA launcher to play. This is further proof that ditching third party launchers is a smart move for any publisher. </p><p>EA and Hazelight are also probably really happy that <em>Split Fiction</em> is receiving positive reviews from players on Steam. The new co-op game currently has a 94 percent positive user rating on Steam. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/publisher/Electronic+Arts/?sort=rating_desc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/publisher/Electronic+Arts/?sort=rating_desc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That makes it EA’s fifth most well-reviewed Steam game</a></span>, only slightly behind another Hazelight co-op banger, <em>It Takes Two. </em></p><h2 id="h57759"><a id=""></a>Will EA and other publishers learn a lesson? </h2><p>While we will have to wait and see how well <em>Split Fiction</em> sells, all the currently available data shows that this is a huge home run for EA. It’s yet more evidence that smaller, more focused games (relative to stuff like <em>GTA 6</em> and <em>Starfield</em>) can succeed and blow up in a big way. And you don’t need to spend three years marketing a game for it to find success. </p><p>I also think that EA made a smart move when it decided to not lock <em>Split Fiction</em> behind some third-party launcher on PC. Instead, you buy the game on Steam and just play it. Simple, easy, and a much more appealing offer for the sometimes fickle PC playerbase. And let’s not forget that Hazelight (an independent studio, but one which relies heavily on EA’s money) being able to spend a decade now making smaller co-op games has allowed the team more time to learn and improve at their craft collectively, which means future games are likely to be better. </p><p>Now, will EA and other publishers watching learn a lesson from <em>Split Fiction</em>’s success? Will they allow studios more chances to make smaller games and not burn millions on years of marketing or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818?_gl=1*tht9in*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MTM2MTY2Ni4zNi4xLjE3NDEzNzMzNDYuNDQuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818?_gl=1*tht9in*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MTM2MTY2Ni4zNi4xLjE3NDEzNzMzNDYuNDQuMC4w">lay off people the moment something doesn’t hit as big</a></span>?

You can feel the devs really cared about <em>RoboCop</em> and his world when crafting the FPS, which includes RPG elements and multiple endings. And now, less than two years later, the same team behind <em>Rogue City</em> are ready to release a standalone follow-up, and I’m very excited. </p><p>On March 6, publisher Nacon announced <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527760/RoboCop_Rogue_City__Unfinished_Business/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527760/RoboCop_Rogue_City__Unfinished_Business/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished</em></a></span> <em>Business</em>, which the developers describe as a “new standalone adventure” set after the events of <em>Rogue City.</em> It’s arriving later this year on consoles and PC. And once again, players will hop into the metal boots of RoboCop as he takes on crime, corruption, robots, and a lot of dudes with guns. </p><p>This time around, RoboCop is sent into OmniTower, a massive apartment complex designed to help the most needy in Old Detroit. However, a group of mercs armed with “cutting-edge weapons” has taken over the entire building and turned it into a fortress. Robo has to kick ass and clear the place out. </p><p>Thankfully, RoboCop has some new weapons, including an ice cannon that can literally “freeze” enemies, and will also have access to new finishing moves involving different parts of the environment. </p><p>Perhaps the most intriguing addition to <em>Unfinished Business</em> are a series of missions where players will take on the role of Alex Murphy before he became RoboCop. The devs promise these missions will tie into the larger storyline of the sequel, while also revealing a new side of the famous police officer. But you’ll have to be careful as during these missions you are just a regular dude with neither superpowers nor a robot body. I’m very intrigued to see how these missions play, as they could be a great way to shake up the experience.</p><p>If you haven’t played <em>RoboCop: Rogue City </em>yet, well, now is a great time to check it out. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1681430/RoboCop_Rogue_City/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1681430/RoboCop_Rogue_City/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The original game is currently on sale on Steam for just $10 which is a steal.</a></span></p><p>As for the recently announced follow up, it doesn’t have a specific release date yet. Instead, Nacon says to expect<em> RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business </em>on Xbox, PS5, and PC sometime in Q3 2025. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is, in my experience, complete overkill, but the rest of the mechanical keyboard is so good it doesn’t really matter. </p><p>I’ve been typing and gaming on the “Dark Master” L5 HE 8K test model Lemokey sent me for review (it’s black with a red escape key) and I still get a little dopamine hit every time my fingers punch the keys. They’re firm but plucky. The strokes are surprisingly smooth yet satisfyingly responsive. They sound like fat raindrops hitting a metal warehouse roof and feel like running your hand through a barrel of rich, darkly roasted coffee beans. Not bad for a $200 gaming keyboard that boasts top-shelf build quality and some impressive bells and whistles. </p><figure id="" data-id="482d61862c1fc837496b730d197c3988" data-recommend-id="image://482d61862c1fc837496b730d197c3988" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1505" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A keyboard is held up over a desk.

The final versions will be more expensive when they join the rest of Lemokey’s lineup, the gaming brand from mechanical keyboard maker Keychron. It’s a pricey package that has the specs and looks to back it up. In addition to the 8K polling rate and 32K Hz scan rate, the key selling point is magnetic Hall Effect switches and 0.01mm actuation sensitivity. Lemokey’s browser software (online only) can be used to then customize the precise distance each key needs to travel to register input, as well as assign hotkey combinations and other shortcuts.</p><p>The result is effectively a keyboard limited only by the speed of your own fingers and the grey matter controlling them. The other way of putting this is: it won’t matter for most people. Did I play better on the L5 HE 8K? Score more goals in <em>Rocket League</em>? Get more kills in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>? Not really. But I certainly enjoyed doing all of those things more than on my current default, the no-frills Ducky Zero 6108. And the ultra-sensitive snappiness of actuation points calibrated just so does add a new layer of control. </p><p>The 75 percent formfactor means there’s no number pad and keys like Print Screen have also been jettisoned. It’s a compact layout that’s just shy of feeling cramped, though I wouldn’t have minded more room. A small, gumdrop-sized dial at the top right doesn’t feel as good as the rest of the keyboard, but gets the job done. The L5 HE 8K is wired only, and the RGB backlighting is great but can’t be adjusted on a key-by-key basis. A strip of light running across the back of the keyboard is a nice <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMT8tRrEMC4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hMT8tRrEMC4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tron</em>-like</a></span> accent.</p><figure id="" data-id="45e71013669903cfb0f05f50783b847c" data-recommend-id="image://45e71013669903cfb0f05f50783b847c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="2656" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A keyboard sits on a desk.

There’s no adjusting the angle of the keyboard, which could be a deal breaker for those with palms that don’t perfectly align. Mine adjusted just fine, even if I could feel the longer sessions building up tension in my knuckles. The double-shot PBT keycaps do feel rich and durable and are hot-swappable (and were surprisingly hard to get off the switches when I pulled them off).</p><p>One silver lining to the  L5 HE 8K’s lack of wireless portability is that it sits on my desk like a long black paper weight in the best way possible. The 4.2 lbs. CNC metal case offers complete stability, like you’re typing into a mini-gravity well. It’s sleek and minimalist looking, but conveys the same premium pleasure of pulling out a heavy metal credit card at the hotel bar (and without the terrible compounding interest rates). Gasket mounting helps cushion the metal too, with the option to top mount instead. </p><p>The luxurious button feel, cool design sense, and overall quality of the package are the L5 HE 8K’s main selling points, in my opinion. The rapid input, zero-latency gaming and precise actuation customization are just the cherries on top. There are lots of magnetic Hall Effect switch options out there, including Keychron’s own Q3 Max, but the L5 HE 8K holds its own in terms of both performance, customization, and more intangibles like the underlying build-feel. The off-white option with cream keys looks especially nice. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
