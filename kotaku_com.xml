Complete with refreshed graphics, updated gameplay, and cherished memes intact,  <em>Oblivion Remastered </em>is already topping Steam charts and taking players on an Unreal Engine 5-made trip down memory lane. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

I’m not sure remaster actually does it justice.” While much of <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> seems to be a UE5 glow-up with the original game more or less intact under the hood, many critical systems have received an overhaul, including the original RPG’s infamously tedious leveling system in which skills improved through repetition. The result at the time was players putting rubber bands around their controllers to have their characters grind abilities while they went AFK. </p><p>Newer players will also be delighted to discover <em>Oblivion</em>’s surprisingly star-studded cast. It features Patrick Stewart, Lynda Carter, Sean Bean, Terence Stamp, and Alfred Molina, among others. The soundtrack <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/oblivion-s-soundtrack-is-perfect-for-adventuring-1845245419&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-s-soundtrack-is-perfect-for-adventuring-1845245419">is also top notch</a></span>. Due to <em>Skyrim</em>’s gargantuan success in comparison and many diehard fans considering <em>Morrowind </em>the “best” <em>Elder Scrolls</em> game, <em>Oblivion</em> has arguably been somewhat overshadowed within the broader pantheon of Bethesda RPGs. It’s great that to see it getting a new lease on life in a form that strikes a decent balance between the legacy of the original and modern playability. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
