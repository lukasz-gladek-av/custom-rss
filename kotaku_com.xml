              <p>Brendan “PlayerUnknown” Greene changed the entire course of gaming in 2017 with the release of&nbsp;<em>PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds</em>, now known nonsensically as <em>PUBG Battlegrounds</em>. (<em>Plunkbat&nbsp;</em>forever.) Without it–for good or ill–we may not have <em>Fortnite</em>, one of the most successful games ever.&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em> isn’t doing too badly itself, with more than half a million people playing at least once every day. Now, Greene is hoping to revitalize the survival genre with <a href="https://kotaku.com/pubg-2-prologue-brendan-greene-playerunknown-metaverse-1851765648"><em>Prologue</em></a>, developed over the last four years and today revealing a surprise free open beta.</p> <p>Reminiscent of games from the survival sim heyday, <em>Prologue&nbsp;</em>drops its players in a woodland cabin and challenges them to find their way to a weather station, randomly placed on the sprawling 8-by-8km map. Along the way, you’ll be bombarded by weather extremes and hungry wildlife, while needing to keep yourself fed, watered and warm. Which, while certainly a familiar premise if you played <em>The Long Dark</em> or&nbsp;<em>The Forest</em>, is aiming for a different emphasis.&nbsp;<em>Prologue</em> appears to be aiming for the extremes of isolation, a sense of agoraphobic loneliness in its procedurally generated maps.</p> <p>Plus, of course, this comes with the pedigree. Greene may have moved on from&nbsp;<em>PUGB</em>, hence the title now only containing his nickname’s initials, but PlayerUnknown Productions comes with a lot of expectation. And then a lot of confusing rhetoric about “metaverses” and the like. But if you want to find out exactly what the game’s about, well, you can right now! For free!</p> <p>Available on both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/prologue-go-wayback-72ee27">Epic</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Prologue: Go Wayback!&nbsp;</em>playtest lets you download and play the game ahead of its Early Access launch intended for later this year. To get it on Steam, head to the store page (the “go wayback” title, which hopefully isn’t permanent, at least makes it possible to search for) and then click on the “Request Access” button beneath the demo link. You’ll instantly get in, and will find the game available to install at the top of your Steam library. I’m downloading it as I type.</p>

              <p>Remedy, the creators of&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake</em> and&nbsp;<em>Control</em>, have had a good six months. The company’s revenue has risen by 63 percent, which is just the sort of good news you want to be able to tell your parents, and at the same time the company completed buying all the rights to&nbsp;<em>Control</em> from publishers 505 Games, as part of its plans to become fully independent of external publishers. Lovely to be them. However, despite all this good news, it seems Remedy’s latest game, three-player co-op shooter <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, is still struggling. But Remedy isn’t giving up on it.</p> <p>Back in July, while acknowledging the launch hadn’t gone as well as hoped, Remedy’s Thomas Punha <a href="https://kotaku.com/remedy-control-fbc-firebreak-lowplayer-count-update-1-3-1851785449">tried to downplay the significance of the very low player counts on Steam</a>. “Steam is a very important part of the business of&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>,” he told&nbsp;<em>GameSpot.</em>&nbsp;“The Steam [active player count] is a very easy statistic to dig up, but it isn’t everything.”</p> <p>However, it seems like it’s still an awful lot. In the <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=6303448b-0b96-4d9c-a724-ca82e23faae5">company’s latest financial report</a>, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala concedes that PC was where <em>Firebreak</em> had been intended to best succeed, but it has instead fared vastly better on console thanks to subscription deals. “On Steam, which was planned as the primary consumer sales channel on PC, the launch underperformed,” says Virtala. “The game’s initial onboarding experience and mission structure resulted in high early player drop-offs and an influx of negative reviews. As players spent more time in the game and we released updates improving the game, sentiment in reviews turned more positive.”</p>

 <p>Well, that’s kinda true. The game remains on “Mixed” reviews on Steam, although it’s trending slightly more positively. Currently 68 percent of the 1,685 reviews are positive, although even this stat belies just how few people are playing. It’s all very well to say players are having a better time, but how many? To this day, the game has an all-time peak simultaneous player-count of 1,992, and that was two months ago. In the last 24 hours, the game peaked at 24 people. It’s a colossal flop.</p> <p>The higher (although not stated) numbers on console are likely because the game was included day-one on both Game Pass and PS Plus, meaning anyone with a sub can take a risk-free look, even, if they–like most humans–will struggle to coordinate three people to play at the same time. Still, you make money by putting your games on these services, as Virtala points out:</p> <blockquote><p>“Commercially, we were unsatisfied with the launch-phase consumer sales of <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>. Thus far,&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>’s commercial performance has largely been driven by the Xbox and PlayStation subscription service agreements. A considerable portion of the revenues from these agreements will still be recognized throughout the contract period.”</p></blockquote> <p>Despite all this, Remedy is valiantly sticking with <em>Firebreak</em>, even though I think anyone would give them a pass at this point. There’s still a “Major Update” coming in September, which the company plans to support with a marketing campaign in an effort to turn its fortunes around. Virtala adds, “We are committed to continuing to work on <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, engaging with the community, and expanding the game.”</p> <p>In better news, the report states that&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em> is meeting its milestones, and the <em>Max Payne 1 &amp; 2&nbsp;</em>remake “continues its progress and remains in full production.” Meanwhile, the original&nbsp;<em>Control</em> has now sold over 5 million copies, which is stunning. And the company is well on its way to becoming self-sustaining as a self-publishing studio freed from publisher pressure and fees.</p>

               <p>I’m here to start the campaign to replace the term “4X” with “4E”. Call me a pedant, but if you look very carefully the words “Explore,” “Expand,” “Exploit” and “Exterminate” all begin with an E. I’ll compromise on “4Ex” games–I’m nothing if not magnanimous. So, the good news is, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/4x_strategy">Steam is having a big sale on 4Ex games this week</a>! We’ve gone through and picked out some highlights from the world/space-conquering genre.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Steam 4X Fest 2025: Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q6D0DG2VUEA?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p>4X (I relented already) is a genre that covers an awful lot of territory. Pun grimly intended. It stretches from Earth to all of space, from&nbsp;<em>Civilization</em> to&nbsp;<em>Stellaris</em>, via the historical strategy of&nbsp;<em>Hearts of Iron</em> to the magical fantasy of&nbsp;<em>Age of Wonders</em>. All of which, happily are in this extraordinarily comprehensive sale.</p> <p>It’s worth noting that Steam’s “Fest” collections pull together every example of the genre, but not all are on sale. For some bizarre reason, none of the&nbsp;<em>Total War</em> games are discounted, for example. Despite this, just the added attention has pulled <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III?snr=1_49_4_xstrategy_100726"><em>Total War: Warhammer III</em></a> into the top selling list at its full price of $60. However, other big-name franchises&nbsp;<em>are</em> showing some enormous price drops, as high as 90 percent. Here’s a selection from the many games available, picking out some all-time classics and perhaps a couple you’ve not heard of before. And just in case you thought my headline was exaggerating, yes, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/410980/Master_of_Orion_2/"><em>Masters of Orion 1 </em>and<em> 2</em></a> are in there for just over $2. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/4x_strategy">You can browse all 356 games here</a>.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Sid Meier’s Civilization VII - Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kK_JrrP9m2U?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2><em>Sid Meier’s Civilization VII</em></h2> <p>Perhaps the headline discount is <em>Civilization VII</em>, the latest entry in the 34-year-long franchise. It’s still sitting on “Mixed” for its Steam reviews, after <a href="https://kotaku.com/civilization-7-patch-notes-ui-steam-reviews-crossplay-1851760312">a very rocky launch</a> in February this year, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/civilization-7-patch-notes-1-2-0-switch-steam-reviews-1851777269">a long, slow attempt to recover</a>, but given it’s reached from an astonishing 45,000 reviews, it’s not for want of sales. Perhaps a 30 percent discount to $49 can help to bring in new players now so much of the game has been patched? Still, if you want a&nbsp;<em>Civ</em> that’s tried and tested, you could always pick up&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/289070/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VI?snr=1_49_4_xstrategy_100709"><em>Civ 6</em> for $6</a>, or&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/8930/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_V/"><em>Civ 5</em> for $7.50</a>, maybe&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3900/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_IV/"><em>Civ 4</em> at $6</a> (or just £3 in the UK for some reason), or even&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3910/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_III_Complete/"><em>Civ III</em> with all the trimmings for just 99c</a>.</p> <h2><em>Galactic Civilizations IV</em></h2> <p>At the other end of the universe, you’ve got the&nbsp;<em>GalCiv</em> series from Stardock. These space-conquering epics have been appearing for 13 years, and all four of them are on sale. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/226860/Galactic_Civilizations_III/"><em>GalCiv 3</em></a> is 67 percent off, now $10, while 2023’s most recent,&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1357210/Galactic_Civilizations_IV/"><em>GalCiv 4</em></a>, is half off at $20. (<em>Disclosure: I did a lot of script editing on the text in GalCiv 4. Still couldn’t actually figure out how to play the game.</em>)</p> <h2><em>Stellaris</em></h2> <p>Paradox’s&nbsp;<em>Stellaris</em> made such a massive splash when it came out in 2016. It breathed life back into the 4X genre, with a bunch of bold new approaches to taking over the galaxy, as well as more tool tips than a Home Depot catalog. With its mix of playable alien races and huge regions of space to explore, it’s one of those games that became legendary for generating <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diary-multicultural-turtle-utopia-stellaris-part-1">original and fascinating stories</a>. But despite being almost ten years old, it’s still receiving regular free patches and both free and paid updates, most recently patching the Wilderness Open Beta last week. This week you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/">grab the base game</a> for a quarter of its usual price at $10, or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/281990/Stellaris/">pick up every last bit of content for the game</a> for 45 percent less than usual, at $140.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Europa Universalis IV - 8th Anniversary Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hWQ8AXwHPQg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2><em>Europa Universalis IV</em></h2> <p>Despite being 12 years old,&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/236850/Europa_Universalis_IV/"><em>Europa Universalis IV</em></a> remains so popular that it’s shot straight into the top 10 most popular games in this 4X Fest. That the epic and historically accurate sim is 90 percent off so just $5 definitely helps. The pitch is that you can pick any nation in the world, then be in charge of it across four hundred years, from the end of the middle ages to the beginning of the Napoleonic era. There’s also a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/1134298/">Starter Edition</a> that adds in three expansions, 80 percent off at $12, and an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/22085/Europa_Universalis_IV_Ultimate_Bundle/">Ultimate Bundle</a> which compiles 12 years of updates and expansions for 40 percent off at $105.</p> <h2><em>Victoria 3</em></h2> <p>To complete a trio of Paradox games (certainly one of the biggest players in the 4X field), 2022’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/529340/Victoria_3/"><em>Victoria 3</em></a> has a tidy 70 percent drop making it just $15 during the Fest, along with around 50 percent off the more expensive bundles of DLC. Far more focused than the enormous nature of most 4X grand strategy games,&nbsp;<em>Victoria 3</em> zooms in on, as you might have guessed, the 19th century. It’s about controlling a society more than an army, although given you can play as dozens of nations in the era, expansion was something of an issue at the time.</p>

 <h2><em>Sins of a Solar Empire II</em></h2> <p>Another Stardock entry, <em>Sins of a Solar Empire II</em>–the follow-up to the 2008 original–comes from the original development team, Ironclad Games. Most think of it as a 2024 game, given that’s when it released on Steam, along with a wealth of DLC and extra content. However, it originally appeared on the Epic Games Store in 2022 as an early access release, presumably as one of the lucrative deals Epic was handing out at the time. It’s Steam release coincided with the game having as much content as the original game’s peak. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1575940/Sins_of_a_Solar_Empire_II/">get the base game</a> for a 30 percent discount this week, making it $35, or for $70 you can pick up the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/1108073/">Premium Edition</a> that contains the base game, this year’s&nbsp;<em>Paths To Power&nbsp;</em>expansion, plus three as-yet unreleased expansions, also 30 percent down.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dune: Spice Wars – 1.0 Release Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MmLKKenSn5c?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2><em>Dune: Spice Wars</em></h2> <p>Before&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>, in 2023 Funcom published a game by Shiro Games called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1605220/Dune_Spice_Wars/"><em>Dune: Spice Wars</em></a>, a 4X RTS by the same team who made&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/466560/Northgard/">Northgard</a>&nbsp;</em>(84 percent off at under $5). It’s all about taking control of Arrakis with one of a number of factions, along with all the spice trading you could wish for. It’s 60 percent off, $14. You can also pick up the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/38656/Dune_Spice_Wars__The_Ixian_Edition/">Ixian Edition</a> which includes DLC&nbsp;<em>House Vernius of Ix&nbsp;</em>for 55 percent less, $20.</p>

 <h2><em>Zephon</em></h2> <p>Let’s get a bit more niche.&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1481170/ZEPHON/"><em>Zephon</em></a> comes from indie team Proxy Studios, who previously created 4X title&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/489630/Warhammer_40000_Gladius__Relics_of_War/">Warhammer 40,000: Gladius – Relics of War</a>&nbsp;</em>(90 percent off, $4), then came back with their own property. This time you’re turn-based 4Xing in a post-apocalypse which features both eldritch monsters and cyberpunk horrors. The game only came out late last year, and has already received a DLC expansion. You can get the base game this week for a 25 percent discount at $30, or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/54708/ZEPHON__Complete_Edition/">pick it up with the DLC and various support bumph</a> for $60.</p> <h2><em>Heart of the Machine</em></h2> <p>Getting right up to date,&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001070/Heart_of_the_Machine/"><em>Heart of the Machine</em></a> by Arcen is so new it’s still in Early Access. Released at the beginning of this year, the RPG/RTS hybrid has proven very popular with players. You play as the first sentient AI, waking up in a city and trying to take control, but with an enormous amount of freedom about how you go about this. There’s still another six months of Early Access intended, the game patching and changing in response to player feedback, but it’s already fully playable. And right now it’s included in both the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/isometricrpgsale2025">Isometric Sale</a>, and the 4X Fest, knocking 35 percent off the price to just under $20.</p>
