              <p>Ask any gamer who travels or shares a living space: <strong>one screen is rarely enough</strong>. Whether you’re running a Switch on the go, playing Xbox in another room, or extending your gaming laptop setup, a secondary display changes everything. The <em>KYY</em> 15.6-inch portable monitor delivers that upgrade without the bulk or the cost. It’s slim, lightweight, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4216/">and now sitting at an all‑time low on Amazon at $69, down from $99.99</a>. At this price, it’s one of the most affordable full HD portable gaming monitors you can grab right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4216/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Convert Any Console or Laptop into a Dual-Screen System</h2>
<p>The <em>KYY</em> monitor <strong>houses a 15.6-inch Full HD (1920×1080) IPS panel with clear detail, deep color capture, and generous 178-degree viewing angles</strong>. In other words, sharp images regardless if you’re gaming on the Switch, connecting a PS5 or extending your PC setup for extra workspace. Its <strong>HDR</strong> technology ramps up contrast so things can feel more vivid, blacks get deeper, and motion remains fluid even in swift action scenes.</p>



<p>The screen boasts <strong>two full-function USB-C ports and a Mini-HDMI connector</strong> and you get plug-and-play convenience with laptops, game consoles and phones with video output. One cable more often than not does everything and you get power and display that is a big advantage if you’re flying light or hate dealing with multiple adapters. Plug it into your console and you’re good in an instant for big-screen console gaming in a hotel room.</p>
<p>Weighing a light 1.7 pounds and a slim 0.3 inches in thickness, the monitor can fit easily into any backpack or laptop sleeve. You’re able to game in landscape orientation for hardcore gaming, switch it up into portrait orientation for livestream conversations, coding sessions, or reading files. It’s the type of display that transitions from gaming into productivity and does so without losing anything. The <em>KYY</em> also features practical add-ons which add up in the long run: You get a high-grade PU leather smart protective cover which also functions as a collapsible stand.</p>



<p>The stereo speakers built into the display provide respectable audio for everyday use, though headphones or an external speaker can always be plugged in through the <strong>3.5mm jack if more complete audio is desired</strong>. Along with the matte anti-glare coating, the eye-care mode and blue light reduction, the screen itself seems comfortable enough to gaze at for extended periods.</p>
<p><span>With the price cut all the way down to $69 from Amazon, it’s in a clearance range that’s difficult to resist.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ecoflow-offloads-the-delta-2-for-pennies-clearing-out-leftover-stock-following-the-delta-3-release-2000636090</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ecoflow-offloads-the-delta-2-for-pennies-clearing-out-leftover-stock-following-the-delta-3-release.1327192/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>EcoFlow built its reputation on one device: the Delta 2. It became the go‑to power station for campers and anyone who needed quick and reliable energy without the fumes or noise of a gas generator. Now that the newer Delta 3 is out, EcoFlow is clearing out stock and Amazon has dropped the 1800W Delta 2 to its lowest price ever: This<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/">&nbsp;best‑seller is down to $429, from its original $699, a record low 39% discount that makes it hands‑down the smartest buy</a> of the season if you’ve been considering portable power for home backup or outdoor adventures.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4505/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Similar Performance Than Delta 3</h2>
<p>Although the Delta 3 has some improvements, the Delta 2 still meets the same sweet spot in terms of power, speed, and reliability all at a significantly lower price. With a<strong> 1024Wh capacity and peak output of 1800W</strong>, the station can power most household devices, tools, or entertainment equipment. Consider mini-fridges, coffee machines, gaming stations, and even hairdryers – <strong>this little hulk powers up to 90% of the things we all use daily</strong>.</p>



<p>The outdoors enthusiast also relishes the dual purpose of the Delta 2 as a solar generator with up to 500W solar input capability: You can pair it with matching panels (sold separately) and charge green while camping or off-grid. It’s the perfect configuration for RV power, work anywhere, or charging devices in an environmentally friendly manner. What’s more, its minimum base level 1kWh capacity can be increased easily with add‑on batteries up to 3kWh: That versatility converts the Delta 2 from a weekend camping friend into a serious residential backup solution.</p>
<p>If you’ve been waiting to commit to the EcoFlow ecosystem, this deal can’t be missed. The Delta 2 still houses the same high-end performance that brought the brand into the spotlight and for $429, it’s darn close to a steal. Once inventory dies off, the price isn’t returning this low at least for some time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> has some tough-as-nails fights, especially if you’re coming to the strategy RPG formula for the first time. <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> remaster</a> ups the ante with a new Tactician difficulty mode that stacks the odds even more against your burgeoning squad of heretical recruits. As someone who’s played the game a dozen times before, I love the new layer of challenge even if some of the encounters kicked my ass.</p> <p>Importantly, <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-tips-guide-ivalice-remaster-jobs-2000630228"><em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em> adds</a> some helpful features for navigating the game’s underlying difficulty. Unlike in the original, it’s generous with auto-saves and lets you flee any battle at any time. No more getting trapped in multi-encounter missions with no other save files to escape to. You can also dial the difficulty up or down throughout the campaign and, like in the original, every story mission <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-guide-xp-jp-grind-tips-2000633724">lets you over-level</a> if you’re diligent enough.</p>

 <p>Even so, some of these fights get tricky! Here’s my ranking of the toughest battles in<em> Final Fantasy Tactics</em> and some tips for how to beat them.</p> <h2>10. Dorter Slums</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636206" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636206"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636206">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> It’s early in the game, your characters are probably under-developed, and the map layout heavily advantages the enemy, which includes an Archer high up and two Black Mages. Most kick-ass battle music in the whole game, though.</p>

 <p><strong>What to do about it:</strong> The easiest strategy is to have Ramza hang back and use Focus a couple of times until he’s able to move in and take out one of the Black Mages in a single hit. Make sure he has battle boots and Move +1 equipped. A fully outfitted Knight to tank damage is useful but you can really get away with just Chemists and Squires as long as you focus on staying healed until Ramza can go on a rampage.</p>

 <h2>9. Fovoham Windflats</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636209" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636209"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636209">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> Any fight against a character with Holy Knight abilities is bullshit, and the game throws this one at you super early. Wiegraf can immediately take your party down to critical HP if they stay bunched up, and his backup will start killing you from there.</p>

 <p><strong>What to do about it: </strong>This is the one battle I’ve never tried to beat without cheese. Just make sure you have at least a couple of ranged attackers and Ramza (preferably as a Monk) is able to get one hit on Wiegraf before dying. Focus exclusively on him until you get him to flee.</p>

 <h2>8. Finnath Creek</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636202" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636202"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636202">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> This is the first time you see a Red Chocobo. Cute, right? Not when they start one-shotting your party with ranged Meteor attacks. It doesn’t help that they already have incredible movement range and the river is hard to navigate. Give them even a moment to breathe and the Yellow Chocobos will have them all healed up.</p>

 <p><strong>What to do about it:</strong> Put your party back as far as possible to try and prevent any of them from being hit in the first round. Then prioritize sniping them from afar with Holy, Flare, or actual guns. Have tanky characters move just far enough in front to act as decoys while using X-Potion to keep themselves alive.</p> <h2>7. Ziekden Fortress</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636207" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636207"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636207">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> This fight is great because you finally get to kill Argath. What sucks is he now has Auto-Potion at a point in the game where few of your attacks will be hitting for more than the 30 HP he gets healed. In addition, there are three tanky Knights and two Black Mages. Plus he will pick at you from afar with a crossbow.</p> <p><strong>What to do about it:</strong> The battle has you start with characters split between the two sides of the fort but you should just immediately bring the group that doesn’t include Ramza over to the bottom corner of the map where he is. Have Ramza use Focus and hang back. Get an Archer with Jump+1 to climb the tower and use an Aim+3 on Argath and try to lure him in close so you can hit him with a magic attack. Ideally, you can get one of his own Black Mages to target one of your characters and then move them right next to him before it goes off. Once Argath is dead, the battle is over.</p>

 <h2>6. Walled City of Yardrow</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636203" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636203"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636203">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> You meet Rapha during this fight and if she dies you automatically lose. What makes that extra challenging is that it’s very easy for her to die before you even get a turn. Plus there are multiple Ninjas and Summoners to contend with, and a city wall that’s a pain to traverse.</p> <p><strong>What to do about it:</strong> Assuming Rapha survives (there’s a chance the Ninja Throw attacks can miss her, so keep resetting if that doesn’t happen), have a Chemist or White Mage heal her up and then hope she runs to the corner and stays out of trouble. A Lancer is good for this fight to scale the walls and block the Ninjas’ attacks. A Summoner can also hit lots of targets as they bunch up near the entrance. Agrias is also clutch in this fight. Just plop her down in front of the entrance to keep the enemies inside and buy yourself some extra time.</p>

 <h2>5. Golgollada Gallows</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636210" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636210"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636210">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> It’s a trap! Not only do you have to fight Gaffgarion and his goddamn self-healing Night Sword attack, you also have to deal with being surrounded by a bunch of enemies including Knights and Archers. But mostly that Night Sword thing.</p> <p><strong>What to do about it:&nbsp;</strong>As with any Sword Magic-based enemy, you can try to burst them down as quickly as possible or just use the Knight’s Sword Break ability to try and destroy his weapon. If it doesn’t work, reset and try again. Eventually you’ll be able to neutralize him within the first few turns. If you don’t want to be a coward you can use Mustadio’s <span id="Arm_Shot">Arm Shot</span> ability to disable him, or the Mystic’s <span id="Hesitation">Hesitation</span> equivalent.</p> <h2>4. Lionel Castle Gate</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636208" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636208"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636208">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard: </strong>Gaffgarion’s back and this time he’s got Ramza trapped on the other side of the gate. <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> loves these little duels but they completely subvert the normal strategies the game usually incentivizes. In addition to being stuck in a one-on-one, the rest of your team is thrust into a Summoner meat grinder with basically no cover.</p>

 <p><strong>What to do about it:</strong> If you’re a try-hard you can teach Ramza Teleport and have him simply leave Gaffgarion behind to be dealt with last. You can also use that Weapon Break trick again. Personally, I like to have Ramza as a Monk keep himself healed with Chakra while a Time Mage on the other side of the gate casts Haste on him. Eventually you can either have him get down to open the gate and let everyone else through, or stack enough extra speed with Tailwind to just overpower him. A Summoner with Bahamut or Cyclops can make quick work of the rest of the enemies.</p> <h2>3. Riovanes Castle Roof</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636201" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636201"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636201">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> It’s time to keep Rapha from dying again, only this time she’s in the middle of a brawl with the most busted enemies in the whole game: Celia and Lettie. Before you even get a chance to move, she’ll be near death.</p> <p><strong>What to do about it:&nbsp;</strong>Hopefully you’ve had someone learn Teleport by now. The key is being able to act before she gets killed. Try to get as many of your characters in range to draw the enemy’s attention or use a skill that has a chance of casting Confuse on Celia, Lettie, or Elmdore. Characters with higher speeds get to act first, so having Ninja unlocked on someone helps, as does having a pair of Sprint Boots equipped.</p> <h2>2. Lost Halidom</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636205" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636205"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636205">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:</strong> Dragons. So many dragons. Plus they can fly and cast magic. Also two guys with magic guns. And a giant chasm through the middle of the map. RIP.</p>

 <p><strong>What to do about it:</strong> I don’t have much good advice for this one. You can try to rely on Mustadio to keep Barich and his Chemist from being able to act. Dealing with the dragons is still a pain. You can roll a couple of Mediators to try and tame them which will not only absorb a lot of aggro but also dish it back out. One big plus is having a movement skill equipped on Orlandeau so that he can quickly get across the ravine and keep up the attack. Just make sure your characters stay on spots with adjacent squares of the same elevation. This will stop the dragon’s magic attacks from only targeting a single square and increase the chance they miss entirely. Otherwise you’ll be getting one-shot all across the map.</p> <h2>1. Wiegraf and Belias</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000636204" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636204"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636204">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><strong>Why it’s hard:&nbsp;</strong>Another one-on-one fight with Ramza, except this time you can’t escape. Wiegraf will kill most players in two turns, giving you little room to heal and attack him. Plus the fight goes directly into the Belias showdown and Ramza doesn’t get healed in between. Nasty!</p>

 <p><strong>What to do about it:</strong> Not to sound like a broken record but you can try to break Wiegraf’s sword. The Full Restore reactive ability also comes in handy here since he’ll almost always get you down to critical. This will effectively keep you at full health and free you up to just attack him. Ramza Monk is still the best option for this fight. Or if you want to play a game of Chicken, you can go the Thief or Ninja route and keep using the Tailwind Mettle ability plus Haste to slowly raise your speed and start stacking extra turns.</p> <p>Okay, but what about Belias? On Tactician, this is actually the harder part of this two-pronged encounter. It’s the one that gave me the most trouble in my recent playthrough, and I only finally beat it on my ninth try with a bit of luck. Mostly, it came down to a Summoner with Short Charge using Bahamut and wiping out all of Belias’ accompanying Demons in one turn. From there you’ll want to keep whaling on him but keep your party spread out. Once he’s out of magic he’ll start using Petrify so watch out. A Lancer with Jump comes in handy here, as long as the timing syncs up right.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Boy howdy, there sure are a lot of<a href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-the-kotaku-review-1845822473"><em> Yakuza/Like A Dragon</em></a> games to play! Perhaps, like so many others, you’ve been wanting to hop into the elaborate and wild franchise all about Japanese gangsters and bizarre side characters. Well, a big ol’ <em>Yakuza</em> franchise sale, happening now on Steam, might help you finally check out this popular series.</p> <p>20 years ago, in 2005, the very first <em>Yakuza</em> game launched on PS2. Since then, there have been over a dozen entries in the franchise, including remasters, re-releases, spin-offs, and even a weird non-canonical entry featuring zombies. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/LikeaDragonFranchiseSale2025">And (almost) all of those games are currently on sale on Steam</a> as part of a big <em>Yakuza</em> franchise sale that ends on October 23.</p>

 <p>I say almost, because the zombies spin-off, <a href="https://kotaku.com/prepare-to-yakuza-in-2012-with-dead-souls-452566043"><em>Yakuza Dead Souls</em></a>, isn’t included as it has never been ported to PC. The other odd duck here is<em> Yakuza 3 Remastered</em>, which isn’t on sale despite being included in the sales event page. Perhaps Sega made a mistake, and it will be marked down to $11 like most of the other <em>Yakuza</em> games in the sale. Who can say? Regardless, if you’ve been waiting to hop into the <em>Yakuza</em> series, this is a great time to snag a few (or all!) of the games and start enjoying them. As former <em>Kotaku</em> writer Luke Plunkett recommended in the past, <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-yakuza-games-to-play-after-yakuza-0-1792025738">you should probably start with <em>Yakuza 0</em></a> if you’re hopping into the series for the very first time. After that, check out <em>Yakuza</em> <em>Kiwami</em> and <em>Kiwami 2</em>.</p> <p>Here are all the games currently on sale as part of the ongoing <em>Yakuza/Like A Dragon</em> sales event:</p> <ul> <li><em>Yakuza 0</em> – $11 ($20)</li> <li><em>Yakuza Kiwami</em> – $11 ($20)</li> <li><em>Yakuza Kiwami 2</em> – $11 ($20)</li> <li><em>Yakuza 3 Remastered</em> – $20 – Not on sale… I guess??</li> <li><em>Yakuza 4 Remastered</em> – $11 ($20)</li> <li><em>Yakuza 5 Remastered</em> – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Yakuza 6: The Song of Life</em> – $11 ($20)</li> <li><em>Yakuza Complete Series</em> Bundle (0-6) – $77 ($140)</li> <li><em>Yakuza: Like A Dragon</em> – $8 ($20)</li> <li><em>Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</em> – $21 ($70)</li> <li><em>Like A Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name</em> -$18 ($50)</li> <li><em>Like A Dragon: Ishin!</em> – $12 ($60)</li> <li><em>Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii</em> – $33 ($60)</li> <li><em>Judgment</em> – $12 ($40)</li> <li><em>Lost Judgment</em> – $15 ($60)</li> </ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I’m very early in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shiny-hunting-despawn-sound-effect-2000636142"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>, but I just found something in Lumiose City I had to tell somebody about, or I might explode.

That’s what nearly happened to me, but luckily, I did stumble upon the Lumiose Museum in the northeast corner of the city.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000636163" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636163"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636163">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure>  <p><span>If you’ve played <i>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</i>, you’re gonna want to stop by this place and check out one of this museum’s exhibits. As I passed by, a citizen remarked that it had a showcase of artifacts from the Hisui region, which was enough to make me spin on my heel and beeline into the building. </span><i><span>Arceus </span></i><span>players will know that Hisui is the previous name of the Sinnoh region from </span><i><span>Diamond </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Pearl</span></i><span>, and the historical setting of the last </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> game.

However, the Lumiose Museum’s exhibit may give us at least a few details about what happened after </span><i><span>Arceus</span></i><span>’ conclusion.</span></p>

 <p><span>Once you’re there, head to the second floor and you’ll see several familiar artifacts from the Hisui region. There are hieroglyphics of legendary Sinnoh Pokémon, hand-crafted early Poké Balls, and a few outfits previously worn by characters like </span><i><span>Arceus</span></i><span>’ protagonist, the surprise villain Volo, and Commander Kamado, an ancestor of Professor Rowan from </span><i><span>Diamond </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Pearl</span></i><span>. While we don’t see anything belonging to him, one of the displays mentions a man named Ingo who would train people in Jubilife Village in the ways of Pokémon battles, but long-time fans will know that he was much more than that.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636162" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636162"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636162">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Ingo made his debut in </span><i><span>Pokémon Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>as an elite trainer at the Battle Subway alongside his brother Emmet. His appearance in </span><i><span>Arceus</span></i><span> indicated he’d been shot through time just as the protagonist had been, only to have gradually forgotten his previous life in the modern day. It was an incredibly dark and tragic fate for a Pokémon character, and because </span><i><span>Arceus </span></i><span>ended without either of these displaced trainers going back home, fans have spent the past three years assuming they lived out the rest of their lives in Hisui and never saw their loved ones again. In the case of Ingo, at least, that doesn’t seem to be the case.</span></p>

 <p><span>The diagram of Ingo’s old training grounds has an accompanying text that says Ingo one day “simply vanished” after telling the people of Jubilife that it was “time for [him] to return.” Though we haven’t seen Ingo in any games since, it sounds like he did get to go home to his brother and friends eventually.&nbsp;</span></p>

Volo, the ancestor of </span><i><span>Diamond </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Pearl </span></i><span>champion Cynthia and a surprise religious zealot intent on usurping Arceus’ power for himself, also gets an epilogue of sorts in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. You can find his final boss outfit in a glass case next to statues of legendary Pokémon Palkia and Dialga, and one of the museum’s patrons says that the person who wore it donated it to the exhibit personally. He also apparently looked at some of the sketches on display “with this nostalgic air,” implying that Volo has, somehow, persisted into the modern day. Is he time-traveling? Is he immortal? Will we see his crazy ass again? I have so many new questions.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever happened to Volo and Ingo, it also stands to reason that </span><i><span>Arceus</span></i><span>’ protagonist was likely able to return to the modern day as well, though I haven’t been able to find any direct mention of their whereabouts. Their uniform is on display here, though. So one way or another, history has not forgotten them and what they accomplished in Hisui all those years ago.</span></p>
