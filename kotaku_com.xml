The second season deals with the mistrust Ellie has formed for Joel after suspecting him of lying to her about what happened after she was put under for the surgery. If you’re familiar with the PlayStation games the series is based on, the second season will be both familiar.

Thank you for your attention to this matter!</p></blockquote><p>It’s hard to take anything the White House says about its ongoing trade ware seriously at this point, but in the short term this means that places like Vietnam and Cambodia, where Nintendo moved much of its Switch 2 manufacturing in recent years, will only be subject to an additional 10 percent tariff as opposed to the rates of as much as 46 percent that had previously been announced. But any electronics coming out of China would presumably double in price as Trump ratchets up his tariff bluster. </p><p>The 90-day  pause on other tariffs takes us past the June 5 launch of the Switch, and presumably gives Nintendo and other manufacturers a brief reprieve during which more inventory can be shipped into the U.S. Some analysts feel that a certain level of tariff taxation was already baked into the $450 price, suggesting it might not increase if the pause continues. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-tariff-trump-mario-kart-tour-zelda-totk-1851775036&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-tariff-trump-mario-kart-tour-zelda-totk-1851775036">Nintendo said that wasn’t the case</a></span>, however.

And in the days since that event we’ve learned more about the Switch 2 via statements from Nintendo, interviews, and more. For example, did you know that Nintendo confirmed Friend Codes are back, or that the Switch 2 carts will taste disgusting? </p><p>Keeping track of all this new information is tricky. A lot of it has been revealed in various places and across many days and it’s all a bit of a mess. To help, we’ve gone looking for smaller details about the Switch 2 that you might care about, but not be aware of yet. Then we took all those details and collected them into one easy-to-find place. We’re just really nice like that. </p><p>So here are nine things about the Switch 2 that you might not know about. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7347aeb04ce4b37f60cf9f68205d44d7" data-recommend-id="image://7347aeb04ce4b37f60cf9f68205d44d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7347aeb04ce4b37f60cf9f68205d44d7" data-recommend-id="image://7347aeb04ce4b37f60cf9f68205d44d7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One of Nintendo’s big shifts for the new hardware is the addition of GameChat, a tool for voice chat and sharing video with people on your friends list. But how do they get added to that list to begin with? Still friend codes, it turns out; Nintendo’s annoying method of finding other players that requires entering bespoke strings of numbers into a text field instead of browsing by username. </p><p>Fortunately, there’s now a new, easier way to link up with people that bypasses the tedium of entering friend codes: QR codes. Players can now share them via the smartphone app to easily sync up with one another. Not great, but still much better than the current system. —Ethan Gach</p></div></div><div><p>Sadly, the Nintendo eShop on Switch 2 won’t have a musical theme like it did on the Wii.

It was also a pain to transfer it between consoles when upgrading, requiring you to deal with an entirely separate smartphone app. Not so with Switch 2. System transfers have been streamlined for the new hardware, including when going from Switch 1 to Switch 2.</p><p>“When you do the system transfer, everything like save data will remain on the Nintendo Switch and once it moves to the Nintendo Switch 2 as well,” hardware director Takuhiro Dohta <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553410/acnh-animal-crossing-new-horizons-island-transfer&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553410/acnh-animal-crossing-new-horizons-island-transfer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Polygon</em></a></span>. The transfer will include players’ islands. “But the [<em>Animal Crossing</em>] island will be an actual move. So it will leave Nintendo Switch and move over to Nintendo Switch 2,” he added. Millions of players with hundreds of hours cultivating their <em>Animal Crossing</em> retreat can breathe a collective sigh of relief. - EG</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2d76d9268cb4af5e2231a5168f6f5656" data-recommend-id="image://2d76d9268cb4af5e2231a5168f6f5656" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2d76d9268cb4af5e2231a5168f6f5656" data-recommend-id="image://2d76d9268cb4af5e2231a5168f6f5656" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once again, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/news/553774/nintendo-switch-2-no-achievements&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/news/553774/nintendo-switch-2-no-achievements" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo has decided to not include system-wide achievements in a new console</a></span>.

During the episode, they even show never-before-seen footage from behind-the-scenes, where Jones says to the camera, “My name’s Walter Jones, I play Zack. I’m Black, and I play the Black Ranger — go figure.” During the series’ casting, Oliver revealed how the Black Ranger “seemed to have the swagger of the group,” while the Yellow Ranger was “peaceful” who tended to “the conscience of the group.”</p><p>For many millennials, Power Rangers is a big part of their childhood, so of course they took to X with their thoughts on the matter. Some fans were quick to point out that the roles eventually were replaced, with a Black actor taking over as a Yellow Ranger and an Asian actor taking over as the Black Ranger.</p><p>Should they have thought more about stereotypes before casting the show this way? Or was the representation in the 90s good enough for the time? Fans seem divided on the issue. For some, this revelation is not that big of a deal. One user wrote, “Nobody was upset about this watching this as kids.” Another added sarcastically, “Cause 3 y/o me is so mad rn.”</p><p>One X user called out the show for making the Black Power Ranger “pop-lock before every punch/kick.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
