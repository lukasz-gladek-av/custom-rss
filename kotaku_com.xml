Please stay tuned.” The message was short and sweet from a filmmaker who previously demonstrated his penchant for direct and economical storytelling on a global stage with his 2023 monster classic. </p><p>While there’s no word on a title, premise, or release date, the news is enough to get fans excited after <em>Godzilla Minus One</em> proved there’s still plenty of gas left in the Kaiju tank. Its sparring yet excellent special effects combined with a humorous but tragic plot <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/oscars-2024-godzilla-minus-one-action-figures-shoes-1851326296&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/oscars-2024-godzilla-minus-one-action-figures-shoes-1851326296">snagged it an Oscar</a></span> earlier this year and tons of acclaim from other storied directors like Steven Spielberg. </p><p>The Japanese language movie grossed over $100 million on a $10 million budget. And while Yamazaki has been making movies for decades, the next <em>Godzilla</em> could end up being his biggest budget production yet. Whether that becomes purely additive or risks diluting the team’s creative vision will be the big test.</p><p><em>Godzilla Minus One</em> tells an origin story of the giant lizard that takes place shortly after World War II as Japan recovers from a devastating bombing campaign that included two nuclear strikes. The citizens navigate post-war politics and personal trauma to defeat the monster, only for it to secretly begin reconstituting itself beneath the ocean waves. Whether  Yamazaki’s movie ends up being a direct sequel or just another riff on the long-standing premise, it’s going to be one to watch out for. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As with each iteration of the franchise, where the competitive scene favors speed and tenacity over careful planning and precision, the more lead you can sling at an opponent, the better. With that in mind, the best C9 build in <em>Black Ops 6</em> aims to enhance your firing rate, improve hip-fire accuracy, and boost momentum to keep you at the forefront of your team.</p><p>In this C9 build guide, we’ll focus on the best attachments for the submachine gun, the most viable Perks, and the appropriate Wildcard to enhance the build and play-style. We’ll also offer a few tips on using the close-quarters weapon effectively.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6fcdf8ed0323e8a3c89cbe93144c73fd" data-recommend-id="image://6fcdf8ed0323e8a3c89cbe93144c73fd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The C9 gunsmith screen in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The C9 gunsmith screen in Black Ops 6" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6fcdf8ed0323e8a3c89cbe93144c73fd" data-recommend-id="image://6fcdf8ed0323e8a3c89cbe93144c73fd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The C9 gunsmith screen in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The goal is to ensure the C9, which is already quite an accurate submachine gun, becomes more like a laser beam. We want to reduce vertical and horizontal recoil with our carefully selected muzzle, stock, and underbarrel attachments. For this build, we’re foregoing the suppressor in favor of the compensator, as we don’t need to worry about remaining off the mini-map, but instead want to prioritize moving quickly and hitting hard.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Compensator</li><li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Long Barrel</li><li><strong>Stock</strong>: Balanced Stock</li><li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Vertical Foregrip</li><li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Recoil Springs</li></ul><p>Should you choose to take the Gunfighter specialty, which is typically recommended for any build, then you can equip three additional attachments, namely:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Optic</strong>: Accu-Spot Reflex</li><li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Quick Draw Grip</li><li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Extended Mag I</li></ul></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6000ee8665bee812607739f6d09cebc4" data-recommend-id="image://6000ee8665bee812607739f6d09cebc4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The loadout screen for the C9 in Black Ops 6." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The loadout screen for the C9 in Black Ops 6." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6000ee8665bee812607739f6d09cebc4" data-recommend-id="image://6000ee8665bee812607739f6d09cebc4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The loadout screen for the C9 in Black Ops 6." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In the early game, you may not feel overly confident when wielding the C9. Its fast-firing nature can make for an unwieldy weapon, even in close quarters. But the <strong>Quick Draw Grip</strong> helps improve ADS speed, allowing us to quickly bring up the iron sights and land on target shots with greater accuracy, thanks to the <strong>Long Barrel</strong> and <strong>Balanced Stock</strong>.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li><li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Long Barrel</li><li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Extended Mag I</li><li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Quick Draw Grip</li><li><strong>Stock</strong>: Balanced Stock</li></ul></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="df3e074d1b949d650cb2a4c592bc0420" data-recommend-id="image://df3e074d1b949d650cb2a4c592bc0420" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Dexterity perk on the C9 loadout in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Dexterity perk on the C9 loadout in Black Ops 6" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="df3e074d1b949d650cb2a4c592bc0420" data-recommend-id="image://df3e074d1b949d650cb2a4c592bc0420" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Dexterity perk on the C9 loadout in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As the entire submachine gun class in <em>Call of Duty</em> relies on movement, we want to buff that while increasing target acquisition with Assassin. Once you get the hang of the game’s Omnimovement system, you’ll put Perks like Dexterity and Double Time into overdrive, sliding and leaping across the map with practiced ease, as you hip-fire the C9 with wild abandon.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Assassin (Enemies currently on a killstreak receive a unique map marker)</li><li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Dexterity (Reduce weapon sway while jumping, sliding, and diving)</li><li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time (Increase Tac Sprint duration)</li><li><strong>Specialty</strong>: Enforcer (Kills grant temp buffs to movement speed and health regen)</li><li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Gunfighter</li><li><strong>Lethal Equipment</strong>: Semtex</li><li><strong>Tactical Equipment</strong>: Stim Shot</li><li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Assault Pack</li></ul></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="673b4a8a5f454b7e6a888ae5a59890c6" data-recommend-id="image://673b4a8a5f454b7e6a888ae5a59890c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Using the C9 SMG in Domination in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Using the C9 SMG in Domination in Black Ops 6" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="673b4a8a5f454b7e6a888ae5a59890c6" data-recommend-id="image://673b4a8a5f454b7e6a888ae5a59890c6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Using the C9 SMG in Domination in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Unlike your standard assault rifle, which is more beginner-friendly, wielding an SMG in <em>Black Ops 6</em> is a mixed bag for most players. It’s a unique play-style that rewards speed, ferocity, and risk-taking behavior. As such, a few tips go a long way:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>While it’s still an SMG and, as such, favors close-range encounters, the C9 is unique within its weapon class because it’s more than capable of hitting long-range targets, too. If you’re rocking the proper attachments to reduce weapon recoil and sway, along with a comfortable scope, take the distant shot occasionally.</li><li>The slower rate of fire of the C9 often causes the SMG to become overshadowed by the likes of the Jackal PDW, but that slow rate of fire means it’s more accurate. It’s a trade-off that only you can decide is worthwhile.</li><li>Keep up the momentum of the fast-paced C9 by equipping the Grekohova as a secondary. It’s a fully-automatic pistol that, in the right hands, can take down one or two enemies with a single magazine.</li></ul></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5cbaf76c826a6dca094bf0aa56e2ca8d" data-recommend-id="image://5cbaf76c826a6dca094bf0aa56e2ca8d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The KSV inspection animation in Black Ops 6." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The KSV inspection animation in Black Ops 6." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5cbaf76c826a6dca094bf0aa56e2ca8d" data-recommend-id="image://5cbaf76c826a6dca094bf0aa56e2ca8d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The KSV inspection animation in Black Ops 6." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The C9 requires a certain mindset to utilize effectively. As such, you’ll likely want more versatility if you’re not a fan of fast-paced, run-and-gun play, with flick-shot antics to dominate enemies in close and mid-range encounters. The C9 excels up close and personal, but here are a few worthwhile alternatives in class and out:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>KSV</strong></li><li><strong>Marine SP</strong></li><li><strong>Model L</strong></li><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xm4-best-build-1851685201&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xm4-best-build-1851685201"><strong>XM4</strong></a></span></li></ul><p>The weapons in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> run the gambit, with the assault rifle class dominating the battlefield for the most part. But if you want to stick to up-close engagements, but require additional precision or spread, then the Marine SP proves worthy.</p><hr><p>If you’d prefer an assault rifle with a little more oomph behind every shot, our <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ak-47-best-build-1851683031&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ak-47-best-build-1851683031"><em>Call of</em>&nbsp;<em>Duty: Black Ops 6</em> build guide for the AK-74</a></span> should satisfy you!</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Referencing their first fight on Namek, Goku grabs Frieza’s tail before swinging and throwing him off into the distance.

His default grab has him use a three-hit punch combo to launch enemies away horizontally.

While he doesn’t comically swing them around, he does grab the terrifying monster’s tail and slam him downward. Fans might remember Android 16’s fights against Cell’s evolved forms more, but he did have his moment thrashing this imperfect form.</p><p>Besides looking more brutal, it can take out additional health from the big bug if he hits the ground. If you throw him from high in the air, you can also follow up with a vanishing attack, the Hell’s Impact super, or the Self Destruct Device ultimate.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bae761ed867af9a5fd7096d696b08346" data-recommend-id="image://bae761ed867af9a5fd7096d696b08346" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Teen Gohan uppercuts Perfect Cell into the air." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Teen Gohan uppercuts Perfect Cell into the air." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bae761ed867af9a5fd7096d696b08346" data-recommend-id="image://bae761ed867af9a5fd7096d696b08346" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Teen Gohan uppercuts Perfect Cell into the air." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Gohan’s first foray into the Super Saiyan 2 form is rife with lightning-fast attacks and slower heavy ones too.

Gohan will hit Perfect Cell with a devastating punch to the gut, and then follow up with an uppercut that launches his nemesis into the sky. A nice touch is that Cell attempts (and fails) to throw a punch of his own, which makes this one of the more dynamic throws in the game. It’s also a fun, faster representation of the first two hits Gohan lands on the villain in this form.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d4c7b95038fed3ec080cbeb4de40e272" data-recommend-id="image://d4c7b95038fed3ec080cbeb4de40e272" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Super Saiyan 3 Goku punches Majin Buu in the face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Super Saiyan 3 Goku punches Majin Buu in the face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d4c7b95038fed3ec080cbeb4de40e272" data-recommend-id="image://d4c7b95038fed3ec080cbeb4de40e272" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Super Saiyan 3 Goku punches Majin Buu in the face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This version of Goku has a slightly different default throw from the one we mentioned earlier. He still swings Majin Buu around by their foot, but opts for an upward launch instead of throwing them downward. Although you’ll miss out on additional damage from a possible ground smash, there can be more potential to combo from the launch.</p><p>Super Saiyan 3 Goku doesn’t just throw Majin Buu, but grabs him by his stretchy antenna to punch him in the head first before tossing him aside. The punch certainly makes this a hilariously brutal cinematic. Otherwise, the only real difference is that this is a horizontal throw and a great reference to these two fighters’ first meeting.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fbec5415e41c5e3e6b41d72af5f8921d" data-recommend-id="image://fbec5415e41c5e3e6b41d72af5f8921d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gohan swings Super Buu around by his antenna." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gohan swings Super Buu around by his antenna." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fbec5415e41c5e3e6b41d72af5f8921d" data-recommend-id="image://fbec5415e41c5e3e6b41d72af5f8921d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gohan swings Super Buu around by his antenna." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Ultimate Gohan spends more time hitting the enemy than his teenage self manages.

He throws a punch before, you guessed it, grabbing Super Buu’s antenna and swinging him around. Aside from the total disrespect that the punch adds, which is accurate to the initial fight between these two in the anime, this will launch the hungry pink blob upward.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c02a7fb8b5b5f7527286ee6798f958a1" data-recommend-id="image://c02a7fb8b5b5f7527286ee6798f958a1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta pulls up Goku Black by his hair and screams in his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta pulls up Goku Black by his hair and screams in his face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c02a7fb8b5b5f7527286ee6798f958a1" data-recommend-id="image://c02a7fb8b5b5f7527286ee6798f958a1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Super Saiyan Blue Vegeta pulls up Goku Black by his hair and screams in his face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The blue-haired version of Vegeta, who has the unnecessarily long name of Vegeta (Super) Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan, normally uses two heavy punches to launch the opponent forward. If you’re confused about it counting as three hits, it’s because the first punch counts as two. He’s just that damn cool I guess.</p><p>Vegeta is a lot more vicious against Goku Black in his Super Saiyan Rose form. After punching the latter onto the ground (which looks strange when using this throw in the air), Vegeta picks the body-stealer up by his hair and delivers a headbutt and punch. It’s mechanically identical to the default throw as both send the opponent flying forward.</p><p>Even though there isn’t a gameplay difference, and it’s unfortunately missing the entire speech the Prince of all Saiyans delivers during this <em>Dragon Ball Super</em> moment, the throw is still one of the coolest in the game. But maybe that’s my bias speaking as a Vegeta fan.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0621bd811f11d052f5db21d53d309ef8" data-recommend-id="image://0621bd811f11d052f5db21d53d309ef8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ultra Instinct Goku stares down Kefla in her Super Saiyan 2 form." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ultra Instinct Goku stares down Kefla in her Super Saiyan 2 form." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0621bd811f11d052f5db21d53d309ef8" data-recommend-id="image://0621bd811f11d052f5db21d53d309ef8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ultra Instinct Goku stares down Kefla in her Super Saiyan 2 form." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Goku’s first Ultra Instinct form is an imposing sight, and his throws back that up as some of the coolest-looking in the game.

Although his regular throw is more vicious, fans are sure to love this memorable scene reenactment from his introductory movie.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9be807eb836f4719c7cc862bff7fd786" data-recommend-id="image://9be807eb836f4719c7cc862bff7fd786" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Frieza shows a look of pain as he is being kicked in the stomach by the modern version of Broly." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Frieza shows a look of pain as he is being kicked in the stomach by the modern version of Broly." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9be807eb836f4719c7cc862bff7fd786" data-recommend-id="image://9be807eb836f4719c7cc862bff7fd786" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Frieza shows a look of pain as he is being kicked in the stomach by the modern version of Broly." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This version of Broly has a lot of unique moves, but the two screaming Saiyans with a green color scheme have a bit more in common than their name. The similarities unfortunately include the default throw for his Super Saiyan form, as it is the same animation as his sadistic predecessor’s.</p><p>His unique throw is thankfully a decent departure from everyone else’s. When fighting against Frieza (Super), the angry Saiyan uses his giant feet to get in some kicks and a sick backflip, before punching him away. This exact scenario plays out in the movie <em>Dragon Ball Super: Broly</em>, albeit with Frieza being kicked into a giant rock. While it looks strange in-game, since there is no rock or wall to play off of, the backflip does add a lot to the coolness factor.</p><hr><p>It is pretty disappointing that <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> doesn’t have more unique throws, given the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-unlock-every-character-shop-1851670640&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-unlock-every-character-shop-1851670640">abundance of characters</a></span>. Despite that, these are still a very welcome treat if you can trigger them in a fight. The animations are great and they do spice up your matches a little bit. Just as with the Special Finishers, we can only hope more are added through updates or DLC.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
