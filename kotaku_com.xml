              <p>I love winter, but I am definitely the complaining type. Anything below 15 degrees is a bit too cold for me, and the same is the case during summer; above 30°C is basically the boiling point. If you can relate and are looking for a year-round solution that offers both focused and diffused modes, the Dyson Hot plus Cool AM09 Jet Focus heater and fan is an excellent option to consider, especially at its current price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4614/">Right now, you can pick it up for just $350 at Amazon, after the retailer took a whopping $150 off its usual price</a>. It’s a post Black Friday deal that made it through the main event, but it won’t be around forever. It won’t be long before the price shoots back up, so it’s best to get your orders in quickly.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4614/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Uninterrupted Airflow</h2>
<p>It’s Dyson, so as you’d expect, the overall design is quite minimal. The solid base makes it easy to place it just about anywhere, from the middle of the lounge to a corner of your room. Year-round comfort is made possible with its dual capabilities; cools you in summer and warms you up when things start to get chilly.</p>
<p>The fan uses an Air Multiplier technology that amplifies the surrounding air to give you a smooth, uninterrupted airflow. There are two operating modes to choose from. The Focused mode delivers fast, personal heating or cooling, while the Diffused mode gently adjusts the temperature of your entire room. Speaking of temperature, you can adjust it anywhere from 32 to 98.6°F. For instance, in winters, if you’ve just come home after spending time with friends on a chilly evening, go for the focused mode to relax your body a bit, and then switch to the Diffused mode to warm the entire room up. The ceramic plates heat up fast, so you won’t have to wait too long for the thing to work, either. When using the diffused mode, the fan oscillates at a 70° angle to direct airflow around the room evenly.</p>



<p>It also works fairly quietly, which is great if you want to take a nap with it running. What’s more, you can create sleep timers to program the fan to turn off after pre-set intervals. These can range anywhere from 15 minutes to 9 hours​. The included remote makes it easy to do this and more. You can adjust the temperature, switch modes, create schedules, etc. It’s also magnetized, so you can store it neatly on the fan itself and never lose track of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4614/">This deal brings the price of this smart, multifunctional fan to just $350, saving you $150 on your purchase.</a> It can be used in both summer and winter, doesn’t make an annoying sound while working, and even lets you set timers for added convenience. The Silver finish gives off a premium look, so it can blend into any setup with ease. And since the fan isn’t cordless, you don’t have to worry about running out of power when you need it the most. Just plug it into an outlet, and enjoy an uninterrupted stream of airflow for hours. Again, the retailer has listed it as a limited-time discount, so we don’t expect it to last long. In fact, it might not even make it through the weekend. If you’ve been after a unit that works as both a heater and a fan, now is the time to make the move.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning. I’ve got some great news for you. Today, yes today, is Friday. Tell everyone you know. Spread the word. Friday is back, baby. And on this wonderful Friday, I welcome you to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of video game news and other stuff you might care about. Today, we wonder what happened to a good <i>Black Ops 7 </i>map, learn more about why <em>Hytale</em> is skipping Steam, and ponder high console prices.</p> <h2>Used Xbox consoles are going for some wild prices</h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1pefqsl/dang_these_prices_are_getting_absurd/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Over on Reddit,</a> people are shaking their heads in disbelief at the state of used game console prices. In 2025, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/collections/certifiedrefurbishedxbox">Microsoft is selling refurbished Xbox Series X consoles for $550</a>. In 2020, I bought an Xbox Series X at launch for $500. Microsoft is also selling used Xbox Series S consoles for $330. At launch, the smaller machine was just $300, and you could often get it for less if you found a deal. These are absurd prices, but also not surprising when you consider how expensive consoles are in 2025, thanks to various factors like tariffs, inflation, AI squeezing demand, and every company trying to grow profits.</p>

 <p>Regardless of why prices are so high, it sucks that this is the first console generation where PlayStation and Xbox machines are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1kdmdw4/a_history_of_xbox_console_prices_at_launch_vs_4/">more expensive five years after launch</a>. And <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-helldivers-2-lava-skyblivion-delay-2000650525#:~:text=SSD%20and%20RAM%20maker%20Micron%20announced%20it%E2%80%99s%20getting%20out%20of%20the%20consumer%20business%20to%20focus%20on%20manufacturing%20for%20companies%E2%80%99%20AI%20computing%20needs.%20%E2%80%9CThe">prices are likely to keep going up for new and used consoles</a>. I can’t wait to take out a small bank loan to buy a PlayStation 6.</p>

 <h2><strong>A popular <em>CoD: Black Ops 7</em> map has been mysteriously removed</strong></h2> <p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7′</em>s first season is now live, and while it has added a lot of new content to the online FPS, it has also removed something: the fan-favorite map Blackheart. This was one of the original maps to launch with<em> Black Ops 7</em> and quickly became one of its most popular. But it’s gone now. Activision says it was removed “temporarily” from both private and public map pools as it investigates an undisclosed “issue.” The map will return in a future, but-not-yet-specified update.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">📢 Call of Duty: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps7</a> </p> <p>Blackheart has been temporarily removed from both Public and Private map pools while we investigate an issue. It will return in an upcoming update.</p> <p>Details: <a href="https://t.co/rmpoklhguD">https://t.co/rmpoklhguD</a></p> <p>— Call of Duty Updates (@CODUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1996651809017045428?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote>    <h2><strong>Newly discovered fish species gets <em>Dragon Ball-</em>inspired name</strong></h2> <p>As spotted by <em>Dexerto</em>, a new small fish was discovered deep in the ocean near an island off the coast of Japan. And, likely due to its bright yellow markings across its body, the fish has been given the scientific name of Vanderhorstia Supersaiyan. Yup, this is a <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> fish. <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10228-025-01047-6">You can read more about the fish here</a>.</p>

 <h2><strong>Newly resurrected <em>Hytale</em> won’t be on Steam at launch</strong></h2> <p>Earlier this year, <em>Minecraft</em>-inspired survival game <em>Hytale</em> was canceled by Riot Games. <a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-riot-minecraft-hypixel-revived-cancel-shutdown-2000645248">Then, in November</a>, the original creator behind the project was able to negotiate the rights back for the game, and now Hytale is back in development with some of the team that was working on it before it was canned. But when it launches in early access, you won’t find it on Steam.</p> <p><a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-s-1st-faq">As explained in a new FAQ</a> on the game’s website, the devs are going to avoid Steam for a bit to focus on its existing community and improving the game instead of chasing “a flood of cold first impressions that could overcorrect the game’s direction.”&nbsp; The post clarifies that the team isn’t looking to avoid “bad reviews,” but I have to imagine that’s part of the reason the team is staying away from Steam until the game is in a good state. A game on Steam with negative or mixed reviews can be hard to overcome. I’ll be curious to see if more teams follow this move.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-carter-wu-homer-simpson-nipples-skins-shirtless-2000650650">Nipples are now allowed in <em>Fortnite</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-rpg-inventory-weight-encumbered-2000650641">Oh no, <em>Outer Worlds 2</em> gave me what I wanted, and I hate it</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/it-took-19-years-but-were-finally-getting-total-war-medieval-3-2000650612">Wow, 20 years later, <em>Medieval Total War 3</em> is happening&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-banjo-kazooie-sequel-remake-game-built-in-dreams-impressive-2000650541">Wow, this fan-made <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em> game is rad</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

              <p>Cyber Monday and Black Friday are a thing of the past at this point, but if you didn’t get a chance to grab all that you wanted during the biggest sale of the year, all is not lost. We’re still spotting quite a few lingering deals across retailers, so whether you’re after a new laptop, the latest smartphone, a kitchen appliance, or a subscription, there’s still time to save.</p>
<p>Stacksocial, in particular, is being the most generous with its post-Cyber Week drops. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/">We just spotted it offering a lifetime license of the 2021 Microsoft Office Professional for Windows at a whopping 84% discount.</a> This brings the price down to just $35, from $220. It’s selling out fast, though. We recommend grabbing your sooner rather than later, as the offer could wrap up any moment now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>Ideal for Students and Work Professionals</h2>
<p>Note that this licensing type will be connected with your actual device, and not your Microsoft account. You will receive the redemption code with all the instructions immediately via email after your purchase, and you’ll have a week to set everything up. There are some system requirements you should know about before proceeding, as well. First, you should have Windows 10 or 11 installed, as the license is not supported on older versions. You’ll also need at least 1GB RAM, 4GB space available for hard disk formatting such as HFS+ (aka Windows OS Extended or HFS Plus), and a monitor with 1280×800 resolution or higher. Most latest systems already have all of this, but we still recommend double-checking before you proceed.</p>
<p>Office Professional 2021 includes Microsoft Office Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, Teams (Free version only), OneNote, Publisher, and Access; everything you need for work, creative, and personal use. Word makes it easy to create and edit documents with a whole bunch of useful tools built right in, while Excel offers an easy way to handle data on a regular basis. You’ll be able to create stunning, jaw-dropping presentations with PowerPoint, take quick meetings using Teams, and manage calendars or emails using Outlook like a pro. OneNote is a personal favorite because of how fun it makes creating notes and organizing them in a single place. You can create different notebooks for different projects, incorporate media content within those, and a lot more.</p>



<p>Students can use these helpful programs to create assignments and collaborate on projects. Work professionals will be able to track their deadlines, create presentations, and manage emails; the possibilities are endless. On a regular day, you’d pay around $220 to enjoy all these features, but thanks to this Cyber Week deal, you can do it for just $35 today. It takes $185 off the price of an all-in-one solution. Don’t confuse it with Microsoft 365, though, which is a subscription service that offers the latest Office apps and lets you use them on multiple devices. This one is more of a one-and-done purchase with the core applications. You also won’t be able to use the programs on multiple devices with this license.</p>
<p>Make sure you redeem the activation code within 7 days of your purchase, as it won’t be valid after that. This is also a great time to grab some other subscriptions for less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/">For instance, Stacksocial is also offering Windows 11 Home and Pro at a massive discount, as well. But get your orders in quickly, because the deals are selling out fast</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Pushes PlayStation 5 Pro at Its Black Friday Low While Xbox Series Consoles Stay Full Price]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-pushes-playstation-5-pro-at-its-black-friday-low-while-xbox-series-consoles-stay-full-price-2000650666</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re now a full week out from Black Friday, but it looks like someone forgot to tell Sony. Amazon has the PlayStation 5 Pro on sale for $101 off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/">This latest model of the console has recently been priced as high as $750, but for the holiday season, you can grab the system of just $649.</a></p>
<h2>The PS5 Has No Games</h2>
<p data-start="136" data-end="775">Alrighty, we all love to go online and make jokes. The recurring meme around the PS5 is that the system “has no games.” It’s become a tired bit at this point. When you step back from the jokes and actually look at what the console has to offer several years into its lifespan, the idea that the PS5 is starving for content just doesn’t hold up. While it would have been nice to have a more exclusives, the current library is anything but empty.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6100/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The PS5 Has Tons of Games</h2>
<p data-start="777" data-end="1567">A standout title of this generation is Ghost of Yōtei. This visually striking and mechanically tight action game that showcases the PS5’s graphical and performance capabilities better than anything in its wake. Then there’s Returnal, a fast-paced third-person shooter with roguelike elements that blends frenetic combat with an eerie atmosphere reminiscent of classic Metroid titles. It’s challenging, stylish, and moody. Gotta love it. And of course, Astro Bot marks a triumphant return to the 3D mascot platformer, a genre we’ve been missing for far too long. This game is a charming, heartfelt celebration of PlayStation’s history, packed with creativity from start to finish. The game’s quality and infectious fun earned it the title of 2024’s <em data-start="1508" data-end="1526">Game of the Year</em> at The Game Awards—well-deserved.</p>


<p data-start="1569" data-end="2375">If you happened to skip the PlayStation 4 generation entirely, the PS5 becomes an even more enticing system. You’ll find a treasure trove of beloved titles waiting to be experienced for the first time, with some receiving enhancements specifically for Sony’s latest console. Games like The Last of Us Part I and The Last of Us Part II continue to dominate discussions about storytelling in video games. The first entry is widely regarded as one of the strongest narratives the medium has ever produced, while the second remains divisive—but passionately defended by many fans who appreciate its bold thematic choices. Regardless of where you ultimately land, both games offer emotionally charged journeys through a post-apocalyptic world that became iconic enough to inspire a major HBO adaptation. Worth checking out at the very least.</p>
<p data-start="2377" data-end="2801">For players who want access to a large back catalog without purchasing every title individually, PlayStation Plus Premium is an excellent gateway. The subscription grants access to hundreds of games spanning multiple PlayStation generations. You can dive into acclaimed modern titles like Control, Kingdom Hearts III, and Final Fantasy VII Remake, as well as older classics that shaped the platform’s legacy.</p>
