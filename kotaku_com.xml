            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Desk space is a luxury these days, especially for people working from home or studying in smaller apartments. A full-size tower PC can feel excessive when all you really need is reliable performance which you can get from something more compact. Mini PCs solve that problem neatly, and the ACEMAGIC Mini PC is a strong example of how much power can fit into a surprisingly small box. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6899/">Right now, it’s also much cheaper than usual, thanks to Amazon discounts that shave as much as $240 off select configurations.</a></p>
<p>The first thing you notice about the ACEMAGIC Mini PC is its size. It’s compact enough to sit unobtrusively on a desk, tuck onto a shelf, or mount behind a monitor. It works for students, professionals, or really anyone building a clean, minimalist workspace.</p>
<p>ACEMAGIC is offering multiple configurations to suit different needs and budgets.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6899/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p><strong>The entry-level option comes with 16GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, powered by an AMD Ryzen 7 6800H processor with integrated graphics</strong>. This setup is more than capable of handling everyday tasks like web browsing, document editing, video streaming, and light creative work. It normally sells for $459, but the current discount drops the price to $329, marking a 28% savings.</p>

<p>Users who need extra power can step up to the higher-end model, which includes 32GB of RAM and a 1TB SSD. This version runs on the AMD Ryzen 7 H 255 processor and is better suited for heavier multitasking, larger and more plentiful files, and more demanding applications. Its usual $759 price tag has been cut to $519, a 32% discount that brings premium specs into a far more approachable range. Storage expansion is also supported, with room to add an additional SSD for up to 4TB total capacity.</p>
<h2>Small Stature, Big Performance</h2>
<p>In daily use, performance feels snappy and responsive. The system handles office software, photo editing, and multitasking without slowing down, particularly in the 32GB configuration. Windows 11 Pro comes preinstalled, so setup is quick and straightforward right out of the box.</p>



<p>Display options are well supported. Using USB4 Type-C or DisplayPort 2.0, it can drive an 8K display at 60Hz. An HDMI port supports 4K at 60Hz. The three together means up to three monitors can be connected at once without any extra adapters.</p>
<p>Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 4.2 keep wireless connections fast and stable, while six USB 3.2 ports provide enough room for wired peripherals. Cooling is handled by dual centrifugal fans, a layered fin design, and a dedicated aluminum heatsink for the SSD, keeping noise and temperatures under control.</p>
<p>For anyone looking to reclaim desk space without giving up performance, the ACEMAGIC Mini PC is worth a look—especially with current discounts pushing the top configuration down to just $519.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-goes-all-in-on-soundbars-ht-s400-with-wireless-subwoofer-is-even-cheaper-than-airpods-2000663275</link>
            <guid>1417321</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most TVs don’t come with strong built-in speakers. If your entertainment setup is missing solid sound, and you often find yourself fiddling with the volume settings and rewinding scenes just to hear what was said, it might be time for an upgrade.</p>
<p>A soundbar can be an excellent investment, and you don’t have to break the bank to pick one up today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6898/">The Sony HT-S400 2.1ch soundbar bundle, which includes a wireless subwoofer, is currently going for $228 at Amazon, after an impressive 24% discount on its usual $300 price</a>. You’re saving $72 on an option that’s going to make movies and TV shows a lot more enjoyable by offering a truly immersive listening experience. This $228 price is also the lowest we have seen the soundbar go for in the last 30 days. Just note that the stock is already running low. We suggest placing your orders without wasting much time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6898/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Superior Sound</h2>
<p>Both the soundbar plus the subwoofer come in a minimal design, and are made to easily blend into any room. The soundbar features a flat back, so you can mount it on a wall for an even cleaner setup.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, it’s got S-Force PRO Front Surround and Dolby Digital that come together to create a 3D, cinematic style surround sound that follows you. Audio won’t be blasted from a single place but instead, fill the room in a natural way. Think whispers coming from across the couch, laughter in the air, footsteps around the room – basically, the kind of immersive sound that makes you feel like a part of whatever’s happening on the screen.</p>



<p>Then there’s the X-Balanced Speaker Unit and Separated Notch Edge, which deliver wide-ranging sound and enhanced vocal clarity for crisp dialogs. You won’t miss a word, whether the characters are mumbling to themselves or whispering a secret out. The included wireless subwoofer takes the experience even further. It has a large 160mm speaker unit to push deeper, richer bass that brings music to life. You’ll enjoy all the highs and lows exceptionally well. What’s more, there are multiple sound modes to choose from, including Sound Field, Voice Mode, and Night Mode. The Voice mode, for instance, offers clearer dialogs, while the night mode reduces the overall volume to avoid disturbing others around the house. So, just to recap – this system gets you better dialogs, richer bass, and an overall surround sound experience for all your favorite movies, TV shows, and tracks. That’s almost like bringing the cinema home!</p>
<p>Setting things up and getting started couldn’t be easier. You can connect the system to your TV with either HDMI ARC or optical connection, or other devices via Bluetooth. The OLED display window on the sound bar keeps you in the loop about information such as input source, volume, and sound settings. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6898/">There’s plenty more to like here, especially now that the soundbar, along with the subwoofer, can be yours for just $228</a>. It’s a rare drop on a highly-rated model, but it won’t last long. It’s best to grab it while the offer is still live to avoid paying full price later.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-dark-knight-everything-we-know-date-2000663464</link>
            <guid>1417318</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-preview-arkham-2000633994"><i><span>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</span></i></a> <span>was one of the big surprises during last year’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-dark-knight-arkham-new-game-2000618481"><span>Gamescom: Opening Night Live</span></a><span> showcase. Not only is it mechanically a pretty big departure from the usual fare of Traveller’s Tales’ </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>games, but it also kind of seems like a follow-up to the </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>games that we’ve been lacking for over a decade. The game’s still a few months away, so let’s break down everything we know so far.</span></p> <h2><b>The obvious </b><b><i>Arkham </i></b><b>influence</b></h2> <p><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>draws heavily from Rocksteady’s </span><i><span>Batman: Arkham </span></i><span>games. Like those games, it takes place in an open-world Gotham with Bruce gliding and grappling around as he finds thugs to beat up and Riddler puzzles to solve. When he’s on the ground, the mini-figure Batman rides around on a motorcycle and in the Batmobile, and in combat, he throws almost rhythmic punches, kicks, and parries like he does in the </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>games. When I played the game in October, my muscle memory for those old games kicked in pretty quick. It’s QTE-driven, which means that if you’re on top of your blocks and dodges, you can pretty much dance your way through a fight without taking a hit.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>fans will also recognize a few of Batman’s tools, including the explosive gel that he uses to break through walls. Overall, it looks like Traveller’s Tales is stepping up in Rocksteady’s absence.</span></p> <h2><b>Playable characters</b></h2> <p><span>Like most </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>games, </span><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>is a co-op game. One player will play as Batman, while the other can play as multiple characters from a rotating roster of partners. The ones we know of include Catwoman, Jim Gordon, Nightwing, Robin, and Talia al Ghul. Each of them will have a special ability, which will sometimes be necessary to progress through a level. Gordon, for example, has a foam gun which can be used to block obstacles in Batman’s way. If you don’t have someone to play with, you can swap between characters on the fly to use these abilities.</span></p>

 <h2><b>An homage to the many Batmen that came before</b></h2> <p><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>seems to pay tribute to multiple versions of Batman from movies, animation, and of course, comic books. Some notable cameos we’ve seen in the trailer include characters from the Christopher Nolan, Tim Burton, and Matt Reeves films, and no matter what version of </span><i><span>Batman</span></i><span> is your favorite, you’ll probably see it celebrated here. The idea is that you’ll be playing through a blocky version of Batman’s life, drawing from different iterations but telling the general story of how he went from sad orphan boy to sad orphan man who beats up people in dark alleyways. We’ll surely see cameos from different characters, such as the rest of the Bat Family, his butler Alfred, and maybe members of the Justice League and League of Assassins. Plus, we know we’ll see plenty of Batman’s iconic villains, such as the Joker, Bane, the Penguin, and Poison Ivy.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Release date and system info</b></h2> <p><i><span>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>is coming to PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S on May 29, with a Switch 2 version expected later in the year.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bluetti-mini-portable-power-station-drops-below-black-friday-prices-now-an-affordable-emergency-backup-for-outages-2000663272</link>
            <guid>1417300</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Power stations make it easy to keep your important devices, as well as essential home appliances, running during outages and off-road trips. If you’re concerned about a winter storm affecting the electricity supply in your area, or just want a reliable backup power solution for your outdoor adventures, a power station can come in handy.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6897/">Now is a great time to pick up a portable option, as Amazon is offering the Bluetti Elite 10 mini at a 43% discount today.</a> You can pick it up for just $113, after saving a nice $86 on its retail price. This offer applies to both grey and meadow green versions of the power station. The only thing to note here is that the offer is only around for a limited time. We highly suggest grabbing it sooner rather than later if you want to avoid paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6897/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easy to Carry</h2>
<p>This power station is truly portable. It fits in your palm, weighs just 4.0 lbs, and features an ergonomic handle that makes the thing incredibly easy to carry around. In fact, it fits within the size guidelines of most airlines, so you can take it with you on flights, too.</p>
<p>As for the power, the Elite 10 is a 128Wh option that’s equivalent to 4 regular power banks. You’re getting a 200W AC outlet, 100W USB-C fast charging, and multiple DC ports to keep multiple devices charged and running. The capacity is more than enough to charge your smartphone more than 6 times and juice a laptop to full twice. You can even power a mini fridge for around 1.8 times, or keep a projector running for a bit. It plays nicely with a wide range of devices, so whether it’s your tech essentials that need a boost or some emergency lights requiring power, it supports them all.</p>



<p>The Elite 10 mini includes a built-in light with three lighting modes with up to 50 hours of illumination, too. These include warm, cool, and SOS, which is handy in low-light situations and emergencies. You can control the power station right through your phone using the dedicated app. It lets you keep an eye on the charging situation, choose light modes, adjust input, and more.</p>
<p>When it comes to recharging the power station itself, you can power it back up in three ways. The first is 150W AC charging, which helps it hit 100% in just over an hour. The 100W solar charging (best to pair with Bluetti 60W/100W panels), and 100W car charging via cigarette lighter are supported too. What’s even better is that the Elite 10 mini comes with a built-in 10ms UPS and features 350W bypass output, which can keep gadgets running without interruption during outages.</p>
<p>Included in the box are the Bluetti Elite 10 mini power station itself, an AC charging cable, a car charging cable, and a user manual. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6897/">You can pick this portable, easy-to-use, but powerful option for $113 at Amazon.</a> This is nothing considering the ease of mind and convenience this appliance brings. Be sure to get your orders in fast, as the deal can wrap up any moment now.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-clears-out-original-airtags-as-airtag-2-arrives-prices-drop-to-an-all-time-low-2000663265</link>
            <guid>1417279</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="542">Apple’s Find My app is one of those tools you don’t fully appreciate until the moment you really need it. It’s the safety net for those heart-stopping situations when you realize something important isn’t where it’s supposed to be. Leaving a phone behind at a restaurant, walking away from a laptop at a café, and looking down at your wrist to check the time and being met with a harsh tan line where you watch is supposed to be—all scenarios where Find My proves its worth. It doesn’t always deliver miracles, but even knowing where something last checked in can bring a surprising amount of relief.</p>
<p data-start="544" data-end="1001">The real magic of the Find My ecosystem shows up when you expand beyond Apple’s core devices. AirTags make it possible to track everyday items with the same confidence you’d have with an iPhone, iPad, or Apple Watch. These small, lightweight discs can be attached to or inserted into nearly anything you own. Keys, wallets, backpacks, and even tech like handheld gaming consoles can all be added to your digital map with minimal effort.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="544" data-end="1001">Ease Your Mind When on the Move</h2>
<p data-start="1003" data-end="1401">Travel is where AirTags truly shine. Lost luggage is one of the most frustrating parts of flying, especially when airlines struggle to provide clear updates. Slipping an AirTag into a checked bag gives you a real-time view of where your belongings are, sometimes offering more accurate information than the airline itself. It may not mean you’ll get it back any sooner, but at least you can be confident whether your bag is at least in the same continent.</p>
<p data-start="1403" data-end="1776">For anyone considering adding AirTags to their setup, Amazon is making the decision easier right now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">A four-pack that typically sells for $99 is currently discounted to $70 on Amazon. That’s a 29% price drop, bringing the cost down to roughly $17.50 per AirTag</a>. For an accessory that can protect hundreds or even thousands of dollars’ worth of gear, that’s really nothing at all.</p>


<p data-start="1778" data-end="2149">Setup is straightforward. Pairing an AirTag requires nothing more than bringing it close to your iPhone or iPad and following a brief on-screen prompt. Once connected, it appears in the Find My app alongside your other devices. Custom names can be assigned to each AirTag, making it easy to tell at a glance which one is attached to your keys, bag, purse, etc.</p>
<p data-start="2151" data-end="2480">Finding misplaced items around the house is another area where AirTags prove their usefulness. The built-in speaker can be activated through the Find My app, producing a clear sound that helps pinpoint items hiding under furniture or buried in clutter. That can save you a whole afternoon of turning your entire apartment upside down to find your car keys.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-goes-hard-on-valentines-day-deals-love-sculpture-art-set-hits-its-lowest-price-and-is-selling-out-fast-2000663268</link>
            <guid>1417255</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO has endured for a reason. It’s rare to find a brand that speaks just as clearly to kids exploring creativity and adults rediscovering it later in life. There’s something calming about opening a LEGO box, dropping out all the individual pieces across the carpet, sorting them out, and then getting started with the build. I personally like to pop on music or a podcast as I connect brick to brick, zoning out for a bit and enjoying the break from every day life for a moment.</p>
<p>Though putting together LEGO doesn’t have to be a lonely activity. It’s something you and your partner can do together, perhaps even as a Valentine’s Day date at home. And LEGO has the perfect set for the occasion. This art collectible set spells out in four letters, L-O-V-E to remind each other why you’re doing it. Show you love someone by gifting them this home decor LEGO set, then putting it together with them. It even happens to be one sale ahead of the special holiday. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6783/">Normally sold for $80, it’s now marked down 20%. That ends up shaving off $16, bringing the price to just $64 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6783/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Celebration of an Icon</h2>
<p>Now this isn’t just some design LEGO cooked up themselves. This is based on artist Robert Indiana’s iconic pop art. He first created it as a card back in 1964. Later in 1970, he adapted it into a 144-inch tall sculpture, now located in the Indianapolis Museum of Art at Newfields. Since then, many different incarnations have been created, finding homes in cities including Philadelphia, New York City, San Francisco, but now potentially your living room too.</p>
<p>This 791-piece LEGO set is thankfully not as tall as the original. No, this one only measures in at a humble 10 inches tall by 10 inches wide, by 2.5 inches deep. It has the same vibrant red, blue and green colors. Just looking at pictures of this has me wondering when LEGO is going to make a set of the Nintendo 64 start-up screen logo. One day, hopefully.</p>



<h2>Build With a Loved One</h2>
<p>Really leaning into the Valentine’s Day theming of this set, it is even packed with two copies of the instructions, encouraging couples or duos of any kinds to work together on the build.</p>
<p>The set is even popular enough that a number of third party vendors on Amazon are selling <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6895/">LED kits custom made to line up with the outer edge of each letter, turning your lovely LEGO set into a cute lamp.</a></p>
