              <p>In her introduction email to Xbox employees, Asha Sharma, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059">new CEO of Microsoft Gaming</a> and former president of Microsoft’s CoreAI, promised a return to Xbox. This, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nothing-about-the-big-xbox-shakeup-makes-sense-2000672914">among many other things</a> about the announcement, raised some questions, with perhaps the most relevant being, “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/phil-spencer-asha-sharma-microsoft-xbox-options-whats-next/">What does that even mean?</a>”</p> <p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-talking-to-new-xbox-ceo-asha-sharma-and-cco-matt-booty"><em>Windows Central</em></a> sat down with Sharma and new CCO Matt Booty to ask just that. Instead of clarifying her plans, Sharma offered vaguely positive-sounding platitudes that amounted to little of substance. “For me, the spirit of ‘Return to Xbox’ is about returning to the spirit that the team was founded on,” Sharma said. “It’s that spirit of surprise, it’s the spirit of building something nobody else was willing to try—I’ve heard ‘renegade,’ ‘rebellion,’ and ‘fun’ used. That’s what I was thinking about when I wrote that.”</p>

 <p>Sharma did, at least, acknowledge that she has a lot of work to do before making any big decisions, but it’s bizarre that Microsoft would just set her loose for interviews when she admits she still has so much to learn about Xbox. When asked about Xbox getting rid of game exclusives and whether or not that policy might be revised, she said, “Right now, I need to learn, candidly. About the ‘why’ of these decisions, what we were optimizing for, and what the data says about the Xbox strategy today. That’s the honest answer. I’m looking at lifetime value, not just what happened in a previous moment, or in short term efficiencies and things like that. The plan’s the plan until it’s not the plan.”</p> <p>On the subject of AI, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xboxs-new-boss-promises-not-to-flood-it-with-soulless-ai-slop-2000672087">Sharma reiterated</a> that she wouldn’t “flood [the Xbox] ecosystem with slop,” and said she stands by what she wrote in her introduction email. Booty jumped in with further clarification, adding, “We’ve got no pressure from Microsoft, there are no directives on AI coming down.”</p>

 <p>Overall, the interview is light on concrete details about Sharma’s vision for Xbox. As she said, “I think from here, the work is proof over promise.” We’ll just have to wait and see what that work actually looks like.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony’s Spider-Man Universe Headed For Reboot After Disastrous Morbius, Madame Web, And Kraven Movies]]></title>

              <p>Tom Rothman, CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group, told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RIBjgm-DdY"><em>The Town with Matt Belloni</em></a> that Sony’s Spider-Man Universe isn’t dead, but it is, as Belloni put it, getting a “fresh reboot” with “new people.” This comes after the box-office and critical bombs of <em>Morbius</em>, <em>Madame Web</em>, and <em>Kraven the Hunter </em>over the last three years.</p> <p>The backlash to <em>Morbius</em> and <em>Madame Web</em> alone was enough for <a href="https://kotaku.com/kraven-the-hunter-spiderman-jc-chandor-1851707831"><em>Kraven the Hunter</em> director J.C. Chandor to plead before the film’s release</a>, “People have got to give us a chance and come out and support this film, and literally try to wash away some of the other stuff that’s happened. Give our film a chance.” But <em>Kraven</em> turned out to be just as bad as the others. Even the most successful films of the bunch, <em>Venom</em>, <em>Venom: Let There Be Carnage</em>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/venom-last-dance-knull-explained-spider-man-marvel-1851647953"><em>Venom: The Last Dance</em></a>, have been embraced more for their unintentional camp than their actual quality.</p>

 <p>The reboot strategy is one that Sony has tried before with their Marvel characters, and it didn’t go particularly well last time. After producing three well-regarded Spider-Man movies directed by Sam Raimi between 2002 and 2007, the studio brought Marc Webb on to helm a reboot series in 2012. Only two out of the planned three movies were ever made. After that, Sony collaborated with Disney to bring Spider-Man into the massively successful Marvel Cinematic Universe, even though Sony owns the film rights to the character. It was, as Belloni said in the interview, “kind of a tail-between-the-legs moment to have to go to Disney and say, ‘Listen, we kind of ran this into the ground, we need you to bring this back.'”</p> <p>Rothman disputed Belloni’s accounting of how the Disney deal went down, arguing that the MCU crossover has been hugely successful for Sony, but it’s hard to ignore the evidence that Sony has struggled to figure out how to make a good comic book movie on its own. Rothman didn’t share any other details about what a rebooted SSU might look like.</p>
