After the game’s opening act, your first line of business is to find Tomiko and establish your hideout. This is your base of operations where you’ll accrue allies and build facilities, though you’ll quickly find one of the most valuable ones is locked off: the Forge. You’ll see that this building has the prerequisite “Recruit a Blacksmith,” so naturally, you’ll want to knock that off your to-do list.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195776" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195776,195922,196345" data-current="195776"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21286.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>To get your own blacksmith, look for the quest “Way Of The Blacksmith” in the Objectives tab of your main menu under Tomiko’s icon</strong>. You might recall that Tomiko mentions recruiting a blacksmith named Heiji in the cutscene where she and Naoe discuss the first two Onryo to hunt, so you’ll almost certainly have access to this quest if you’re reading this. Of course, assuming you’re playing on the game’s default settings, you’ll have to do a tiny bit of legwork to track Heiji down, so you can check out his location below if you just want to get to him right away.</p><h2 id="h1724039"><a id=""></a>’The Way Of The Blacksmith’ quest location</h2><p>As the game’s hints directly indicate, <strong>Heiji is located in Sekai</strong>. <strong>You’ll find this area directly southwest of the hideout</strong>. Sekai is also where you’ll begin your hunt for the Golden Teppo, so you can kill two birds with one stone by going there first. Well, technically you kill one bird and recruit another bird, but you get the picture.</p><figure id="" data-id="533b6b01d42b410b8e920346ea2ccec3" data-recommend-id="image://533b6b01d42b410b8e920346ea2ccec3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the map in Assassin’s Creed: Shadows.

They’re common foes, so dispatch them however you please; you can easily complete this battle even if you’ve not bothered to level up or grab new equipment. Talk with Hieji after the battle and you’ll learn about the circumstances that have broken his spirit. Pick whichever dialogue option feels best to you, and Heiji will make his way to Tomiko’s hideout. Once you gather enough resources, you’ll finally be able to build a forge at your hideout.</p><h2 id="h1724040"><a id=""></a>How to best use the Blacksmith</h2><figure id="" data-id="dc27ad6ee1d80021a144eedc27265b77" data-recommend-id="image://dc27ad6ee1d80021a144eedc27265b77" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from Assassin’s Creed: Shadows.

Naoe is standing in front of Heiji inside the Forge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>With the Forge now built, run to wherever you parked your shiny new building and look for Heiji. Upon talking with him, you’ll have access to the following options:</p><p><strong>Upgrade</strong>: Invest resources into any piece of equipment to increase its level. Equipment cannot be higher than your character’s level (level equivalent gear simply won’t appear). You can use Gold to immediately upgrade a piece of equipment to your current level, but Gold is a rare resource that should not be confused with normal currency (Mon). <strong>Save your Gold for bigger upgrades down the road; don’t use it by accident in the early game</strong>!</p><p><strong>Engrave</strong>: Apply one of your found Engravings to an applicable piece of gear (it will say “Visit the Hideout’s blacksmith to engrave a perk” under its stats). Engravings are not consumed upon use and can be overridden, though note this process will consume Mon every time.</p><p><strong>Salvage</strong>: Break down a piece of gear into upgrade materials.<br></p><p>In short, if you find a great piece of gear that proves essential to your build, come here to refine it as you play to keep its stats relevant. And if you’re just beginning your journey in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, be sure to keep some resources on hand for when Yasuke joins your party! <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/digimon-card-game-con-mobile-phone-app-teaser-renamon-1851770444&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-card-game-con-mobile-phone-app-teaser-renamon-1851770444">previously teased</a></span>, we saw an upcoming mobile card game, but we also got new looks at the future of <em>Digimon </em>video games and anime in between some (incredibly long) merchandise drops. If you want to watch the nearly three-hour presentation, you can do so below. If you want the highlights, read on.</p></div></div><div><p>Bandai Namco announced <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger </em>last month during the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-state-play-2025-everything-we-saw-sop-1851761893&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-state-play-2025-everything-we-saw-sop-1851761893">PlayStation State of Play showcase</a></span>, and we didn’t see much new from the RPG in the Digimon Con 2025 presentation. However, the team confirmed a few things about the game’s structure, noting that you’ll be able to move between the real world and the digital world, both of which have their own towns and environments where you can walk around, interact with the locals, and prepare before embarking on quests. The team also introduced some of the characters you’ll meet, revealing that you can choose between a male or female protagonist and that the character you don’t pick will be your “operator,” assisting you throughout the game. The presentation also announced that the starter Digimon this time around are Patamon, Gomamon, and DemiDevimon, and there will be over 450 Digimon you can recruit in total.</p></div><div><p>The presentation then shifted over to the card game. After showing off the new Protector of Light and Hero of Hope starter decks, new booster pack sets, and a new run of the <em>Digimon Liberator </em>online comic, the showcase revealed the new mobile game <em>Digimon Alysion</em>. The card game app seems a bit more elaborate than <em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, as it includes a story mode complete with a new cast of characters. It will feature cards that are in the current TCG, as well as exclusive cards only found in the game. New Digimon and characters will make their debut in the game as well. A closed beta test is in the works.</p></div><div><p>There were two major announcements on the anime side. The first was the reveal of <em>Digimon Adventure Beyond</em>, an OVA set between the <em>Digimon Adventure tri. </em>and <em>Digimon Adventure: Last Evolution Kizuna </em>films. The four-minute video is available to stream on the official <em>Digimon</em> channel. The more notable announcement was <em>Digimon Beatbreak</em>, the next season of the anime set to premiere in October 2025.</p><p>The short teaser is light on details, but references “emotion-devouring digital lifeforms.” We also see a brief glimpse of the new protagonist and their Digimon partner, but that’s about it. <em>Beatbreak </em>is bringing <em>Digimon </em>back to TV after a two-year hiatus. The last anime series, <em>Digimon Ghost Game</em>, concluded in 2023.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Using FPGA technology (which replicates original hardware instead of emulating it), the company promised the “ultimate solution to play N64 today in total fucking glory” for just $250. It was scheduled to release last year but ended up being delayed until early 2025. </p><p>Earlier this week, the company delayed it again. “Analogue 3D shipping is delayed (as of March 18th, 2025) and is now shipping by July 2025,” an update to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.analogue.co/support/resource/3d-preorder-faq&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.analogue.co/support/resource/3d-preorder-faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the pre-order FAQ read</a></span>. “We are working hard to get your 3D order in hands asap and appreciate your patience.

Especially since the Analogue 3D is still currently sold out. </p><p>Of course, even if Luckey’s M64 turns out to be as good as the Chromatic, it’ll still require buying retro gaming hardware from a guy who says stuff like, “The United States should not be the world police. We should be the world gun store.”<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
