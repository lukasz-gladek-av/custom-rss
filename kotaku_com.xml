But damn, it was close.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197586" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Disney+ Pulls The Abyss Over Controversial Rat Scene — Again" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="128" data-playlist="197586,196406,197589" data-current="197586"><div><p>Disney+ Pulls The Abyss Over Controversial Rat Scene — Again</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23107.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Superman</em> made a fantastic $122 million in its domestic opening weekend, but lagged behind internationally, with $95 million coming in from the other 78 nations. <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>, however, flipped that around—the latest entry in the MCU <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/year/world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took in $118 million in the United States</a></span>, but $100 million worldwide. And yes, you’re right, those figures are all <em>incredibly</em> close.</p><p>$218 million for <em>Fantastic Four </em>to <em>Superman</em>’s $217 million means both Marvel and DC can be feeling pretty good about things right now. It also does put a lot of the last couple of weeks of handwringing about Supe’s international performance in a different perspective</p><p>Post <em>Superman</em>’s release, James Gunn has given a bunch of comments about why the film may not have performed as well overseas as hoped, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/news/james-gunn-superman-woke-anti-america-box-office-1236465776/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/james-gunn-superman-woke-anti-america-box-office-1236465776/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most recently claiming</a></span> that “anti-American sentiment around the world” could be behind the discrepancy, as well as suggesting Superman isn’t as well known in some foreign territories as names like Batman. But given both superhero flicks have made almost identical amounts, it seems that it could be a lot less about Superman specifically, and perhaps more about superheroes themselves.</p><p>Things are still going well for <em>Superman</em>. After three weekends of release, it’s now crossed the half-billion point, with a reported total of $502,701,478, with percent of that domestic. In contrast, 54 percent of <em>Fantastic Four</em>’s opening total is from the U.S. So, again, rounding errors, but the same pattern.</p><figure id="" data-id="69d291abf7f3fc913134b32f16353b4b" data-recommend-id="image://69d291abf7f3fc913134b32f16353b4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1380" data-height="776" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="HERBIE the robot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="HERBIE the robot." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="69d291abf7f3fc913134b32f16353b4b" data-recommend-id="image://69d291abf7f3fc913134b32f16353b4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1380" data-height="776" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="HERBIE the robot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The reason anyone cares about this is the implication that the perceived lack of overseas sales means these films might not be making as much money as they “should.” Looking through this years’s biggest movies, the normal proportion of total box office to come in domestically is between 32 and 50 percent. <em>F1: The Movie</em>, the extraordinary advertising feature starring Brad Pitt, made just 32 percent of its $510 million in the U.S. <em>Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning</em> is on $592 million, with 33 percent coming in from American audiences. Even <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> got more than 50 percent abroad, and the same for <em>Thunderbolts*</em>.</p><p><em>A Minecraft Movie</em> teeters shy of the big one billion at $995 million, 44.4 percent domestic, while the biggest American movie of the year so far, <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em>, got 42 percent of its $1 billion from home shores. (The biggest movie of 2025, the Chinese animated film <em>Ne Zha II </em>which has pulled in an eye-watering $1.9 billion, got just one percent of that in the U.S.!)</p><p>So, given all this, producers and distributors will be wondering why international audiences aren’t showing up to skew the stats in a similar way for these two superhero movies. While sitting on thrones made of diamond-encrusted gold bullion.</p><p>It’ll be interesting to see if <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> has the same legs as <em>Superman</em>, especially given it’s a somewhat more obscure property among the non-comics-reading public. Still, it’s already the 13th biggest film of the year after just a couple of days.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-first-steps-opening-weekend-superman-1851787100]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the fantastic <em>Star Trek: Strange New Worlds</em> back for season three, the potential for the franchise feels so strong. As opposed to back in January when <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-trek-section-31-cameo-big-name-jamie-lee-curtis-1851747475&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-trek-section-31-cameo-big-name-jamie-lee-curtis-1851747475"><em>Section 31</em> came out</a></span>, and the potential for the franchise felt desperately weak. That’s <em>Star Trek</em>: as good as its last outing. So where will the forthcoming <em>Starfleet Academy</em> series leave us? Hints arrive with the first teaser trailer for the show. But can something this po-faced and “uplifting” offer anything compelling?</p><p>You know what? I’m left with no idea at all. What a strange trailer, telling us absolutely nothing substantive whatsoever. Lots of things to say, “Ooh look, he’s back!” but if someone asked you what it’s <em>about</em>, you’d be pretty stumped.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Set in the 32nd century, a thousand years after the original <em>Star Trek</em>, this is very much a spin-off from the dismal final seasons of <em>Discovery. </em>In that show, once a lovely story about a ship equipped with a unique means of instantly transporting itself anywhere in the galaxy, things got so out of control that it ended up sending itself 900 years into the future and then not knowing what to do when it got there. However, on arrival it <em>did</em> discover that Starfleet still existed, albeit in a much reduced and fragile form, with its Academy still up and running. Thus, <em>Starfleet Academy</em> as a series.</p><figure id="" data-id="d0bf29339b62f5f5c13f98ac4d891d12" data-recommend-id="image://d0bf29339b62f5f5c13f98ac4d891d12" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1084" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Holly Hunter as the captain of the academy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Holly Hunter as the captain of the academy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d0bf29339b62f5f5c13f98ac4d891d12" data-recommend-id="image://d0bf29339b62f5f5c13f98ac4d891d12" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1084" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Holly Hunter as the captain of the academy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So, in the trailer, we see a few familiar faces. There’s the fantastic Tig Notaro reprising engineer Jett Reno—one of the few characters you were always pleased to see in <em>Discovery</em>. Oded Fehr will also guest as Admiral Charles Vance, a character with the personality of a plank of wood in the previous show. And there’s Robert Picardo as the Doctor, the holographic medic from <em>Star Trek: Voyager</em>, now over 900 years old and still teaching nearly a millennium later after he began the role in kids’ cartoon&nbsp;<em>Star Trek: Prodigy</em>.</p><p>Then there are some even more well-known faces from outside of <em>Trek</em>. Holly Hunter is in charge, playing Captain Nahla Ake, who is half-Lanthanite (a long-lived race of aliens who were apparently living on Earth long before first contact with the Vulcans), <em>Bob Hearts Abishola</em> creator Gina Yashere as an as-yet unnamed first officer who is apparently a Klingon/Jem’Hadar hybrid (?), and right at the end, Hollywood A lister Paul Giamatti looking like the series’ cartoon villain. And joining the hybrid gang, he’s Klingon crossed with Tellarite.</p><figure id="" data-id="9d5037c3aa518457ef44e6f7ca285ebf" data-recommend-id="image://9d5037c3aa518457ef44e6f7ca285ebf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1643" data-height="924" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Paul Giamatti as a baddie." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Paul Giamatti as a baddie." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9d5037c3aa518457ef44e6f7ca285ebf" data-recommend-id="image://9d5037c3aa518457ef44e6f7ca285ebf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1643" data-height="924" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Paul Giamatti as a baddie." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Notably absent, however, was Mary Wiseman, who played Sylvia Tilly in <em>Discovery</em>. Her character was endlessly away at the Academy during the final seasons of the show, making it incredibly odd that she’s not a main character here. She is, instead, lined up as a guest star, and didn’t even make the cut for the trailer.</p><p>And the rest look like a sickeningly pretty bunch of starry-eyed hopefuls, all smiling and dancing and I already hate all of them equally. Especially the mopey Klingon Jay-Den Kraag. Gosh, what fun we’ll have learning about how hard it is for him to control his Klingon aggression in Starfleet by having him endlessly fucking mope about it.</p><figure id="" data-id="7bbc7672c2e86471838b40f2fbd5e65b" data-recommend-id="image://7bbc7672c2e86471838b40f2fbd5e65b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1422" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Klingon moping on a windowsill." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Klingon moping on a windowsill." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7bbc7672c2e86471838b40f2fbd5e65b" data-recommend-id="image://7bbc7672c2e86471838b40f2fbd5e65b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1422" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Klingon moping on a windowsill." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Honestly, I don’t have high hopes, but I would sure be glad to be proven a big, stupid wrong-face. Alex Kurtzman’s so-called “expanded <em>Star Trek </em>universe” is so wildly variable, and there’s no pattern to it. Kurtzman is showrunner on <em>Academy</em>, and it was his taking over <em>Discovery</em> in its third season that began that show’s descent into dreadfulness. It’s tempting to therefore credit <em>Strange New Worlds</em>’ showrunner Akiva Goldsman with delivering better <em>Trek</em>, and his name <em>isn’t</em> attached to <em>Academy</em>. But then he was also a showrunner on <em>Picard</em>, a series so abysmal people should probably have gone to prison. So who knows! Holly Hunter is always compelling, so that bodes well. Paul Giamatti as a possible villain is also a fantastic thought! But there are so many factors that could be a problem.</p><p>First and foremost is the setting. <em>Discovery</em>’s 32nd century was a very silly place, with a bizarrely claustrophobic galaxy across which it tried to portray both impossibly futuristic god-like tech <em>and</em> ancient, cobwebby mysteries. Starfleet by this point has technology so advanced as to be inseparable from magic. They now have “programmable matter,” nano-molecules that can be altered into <em>anything</em>, to the idiotic degree that it’s used for things as mundane as having platforms and bridges extend out in front of people as they walk, while spaceships can reconfigure themselves on a molecular level  while in flight. So, er, anything is possible. Every single storyline is going to have to not only be about why transporter technology can’t be used because, um, it’s a bit windy, but also why they can’t just reprogram any old coffee cup to be whatever MacGuffin is needed.</p><p>“We need a recoupling manifold upgrade-integrator or the whole station will blow up?”</p><p>“Why did this have to happen on a No-Reprogrammable Matter Tuesday?”</p><p>But more than anything else, it’s Starfleet itself. It’s just so insufferable. It’s Life Lessons University, where everyone strives to be the lovely-best they can be, and that’s going to be tripled down on by its newfound underdog position in the galaxy. I’m finding it so hard, following that teaser of wide-eyed gleeful positivity, to imagine anything other than the modern equivalent of a <em>He-Man</em> cartoon, where everyone learns an important message by the end of the episode.</p><p>Please let me be wrong. Please let the completely superb lessons of <em>Strange New Worlds</em> have been learned. Those being: episodic stories are where <em>Star Trek</em> shines, not long, meandering arcs, and that it’s possible to have a lot of fun if you’ve got a ground cast with believable relationships. I want a <em>Starfleet Academy</em> that’s capable of sustaining its own equivalent to <em>SNW</em>’s musical episode, or a <em>Lower Decks</em> crossover, or whatever this puppet-based episode set for season four is going to be!</p><p>Or, and again the trailer doesn’t betray anything close to this, a new <em>Deep Space Nine</em> situation, with deep intrigue taking place in a fixed location, allowing huge, spiraling stories set in new sectors to take place. Anything other than watching a bunch of adorable cadets learn to not think for themselves, like <em>Star Trek</em>’s true Borg mind, Starfleet.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/starfleet-academy-trailer-comic-con-strange-new-worlds-1851787096]]></content:encoded>
