              <p>The Meta Quest 3S stands out as one of the easiest ways to get started with virtual reality gaming right now. It’s budget friendly, doesn’t require a gaming PC, and has a growing library of polished experiences. With current discounts knocking around 10% to 15% off the retail price, the timing feels right for anyone curious about stepping into VR for the first time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6979/">At the moment, the 128GB Meta Quest 3S is selling for $270, down from its usual $300 price tag.</a> The 256GB version has dropped from $400 to $350 and even comes bundled with <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> at no extra cost.</p>

<h2>Access to Tons of Games</h2>
<p>In <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow </em>for the Meta Quest 3S, you’re placed directly in the role of Batman as he hunts down a new villain called the Rat King across Gotham City on the Fourth of July. Acting as a narrative sequel to <em>Batman: Arkham Origins</em>, it leans heavily into the strengths of virtual reality. Combat, investigation, and traversal feel more personal when your own movements drive the action. Using the Quest 3S headset and wireless motion controllers, the experience captures the fantasy of being the Dark Knight in a way traditional consoles simply cannot match.</p>



<p>Having a Meta Quest 3S opens the door to a broad catalog right out of the box. New owners receive three months of Meta Quest+, a subscription that includes access to more than 40 VR titles. One of the highlights is <em>Walkabout Mini Golf</em>, a deceptively rich game that shines through clever course design and relaxed multiplayer fun. Playing a round with friends scattered across different states feels surprisingly close to a real-world hangout. Played a lot of this over lockdown and there are moments, you’re not just hanging around with your buddies for real. Not saying it ever convinces you you’re really on a minigolf course, but it does hit ya with the same dopamine that hanging around in person with your buds does.</p>
<p>Another notable release is last year’s <em>Marvel’s Deadpool VR</em>. This action-heavy title drops players into chaotic firefights filled with irreverent humor, backed by voice work from Neil Patrick Harris. While it is not included with Meta Quest+, it remains one of the biggest VR launches of 2025 and a strong showcase for what the hardware can handle.</p>
<p>From a technical standpoint, the Quest 3S represents a meaningful step up from the Quest 2. The Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset delivers smoother performance, while full-color passthrough and an easy-access action button make switching between virtual and mixed reality seamless. With discounts reaching up to $50 off retail pricing, the Meta Quest 3S feels like one of the most well-rounded VR deals available today.</p>
