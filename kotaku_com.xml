              <p><span>We’re a week out from the assassination of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk, and the internet is still running wild with new information, commentary, and, as the internet often does, dark jokes. That includes AI slop, and one particular brand of it became so viral that Bandai Namco, or more specifically, the company’s toy division, has released a statement about its logo being used in fake mockups of Gunpla models depicting Kirk’s assassination.</span></p> <p><span>The statement was released on the company’s </span><a href="https://x.com/BandaiCollect/status/1968140558959882612"><span>social media channels</span></a><span>, and while it doesn’t reference Kirk’s death by name, it says that it has been made aware of “AI-generated images circulating online that depict the Bandai Namco Toys &amp; Collectibles America Inc. logo on packaging associated with graphic or violent content, including references to recent events.” The images, which </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>has verified, include a fake model of the moment Kirk was shot on September 10 at the Utah Valley University campus with a fake Bandai-branded box in the background. The full statement reads as follows:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>We have recently been made aware of AI-generated images circulating online that depict the Bandai Namco Toys &amp; Collectibles America Inc. logo on packaging associated with graphic or violent content, including references to recent events.</span></p> <p><span>We want to make it unequivocally clear: Bandai Namco Toys &amp; Collectibles America Inc. strongly condemns any form of violence and does not support or endorse the use of our brand, products, or logo in any such context. These images are not created, approved, or affiliated with our company in any way.</span></p> <p><span>We are actively investigating this matter and are taking steps to report and remove any unauthorized or misleading content. The misuse of our intellectual property in a way that misrepresents our values and intentions is deeply concerning and will not be tolerated.</span></p> <p><span>We thank our community for bringing this to our attention and encourage anyone who sees similar misuses to report them to us directly.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Kirk’s death has sparked a whirlwind of controversy that has bled into various industries as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478"><span>public figures have reacted to the event</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>Helldivers 2 </span></i><span>has even been dragged into the entire ordeal after it was reported that a reference to the Arrowhead Game Studios game was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-helldivers-bullet-engraving-2000625439"><span>engraved on the bullet casings used in the fatal shooting</span></a><span>. Naturally, this has led to a rehash of long-debated discussions on whether </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-tyler-robinson-discord-reddit-memes-2000625746"><span>violent crimes can be linked to video games</span></a><span>.</span></p>

              <p>Greater minds than ours have been driven crazy trying to predict what’s coming out of Cupertino, and when it’s coming. Now that Apple’s gotten the iPhone 17 and new AirPods drops out of the way, will there be new MacBooks on the horizon? One set of tea leaves to keep an eye on is the deals they’re offering on their current models, and right now seemingly out of nowhere, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">the 13-inch 2025 M4 MacBook Air is just $800 at Amazon — its lowest price ever.</a></p>
<p>Does that mean there’s a new MacBook Air right around the corner? Who knows — early 2026 is a better bet. But this $800 deal on the current flagship of the MacBook Air fleet is very real, and we can’t imagine it going much lower if at all when the 2025 holiday rush starts.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M4 For the Win</h2>
<p>One day there will be an M5 chip driving a new line of MacBooks, but until then, you cannot beat the M4 for speed and sheer processing power. This M4 MacBook Air runs twice as fast as the M1 models that were all the rage more recently than we realize, and a staggering 23 times faster than the last Intel powered models of the MacBook Air.</p>
<p>Of course, the one consistent calling card of any MacBook is the display, and this MacBook Air’s 13.6-inch Liquid Retina screen supports a billion colors, all delivered with brilliance and sharpness. Pair that screen with the 12MP Center Stage camera, three microphones, and four Spatial Audio speakers built into the MacBook Air, and your video calls will always be peak. The M4 processor, Spatial Audio speakers, and Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 connections make the 2025 MacBook Air a streaming and gaming superstar.</p>



<h2>Apple-Style AI</h2>
<p>The 2025 M4 MacBook Air comes with Apple Intelligence built in, with incredible speed and ability as an assistant for research, productivity, or pretty much anything else you want it to do for you. All those searches are yours and yours alone too, because Apple Intelligence has some of the best and most robust privacy features of any AI system — so private that even Apple can’t get to your search history.</p>
<p>Trying to read the smoke signals from Apple about how and when to jump on&nbsp;<em>the</em> best deal is, honestly, often a waste of time. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">What we can tell you is that this $800 deal on the 13-inch 2025 M4 MacBook Air is the lowest price ever for this laptop at Amazon</a>, and that the M4 MacBook Air is worth every penny of the price regardless of when the next-gen MacBooks drop.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As the weather starts cooling down and we start spending incrementally more time indoors week after week, there’s never been a better time to get yourself an iPad. Whether you plan on using it to catch up on emails, to doomscroll on your preferred social media app, or to just pour more hours into&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>but on a larger screen than your phone, the Apple iPad Air might be what you’re looking for. This 2025 model iPad normally starts at $599, but <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4143/">Amazon is running a limited time deal that’s bringing the price down by 25%. This $150 savings means you’ll only have to pay as low as $449.</a></p>
<p>This $449 discounted price is for the Wi-Fi-only 128GB model. There are three other storage sizes available—each with their own $150 discount. You can get the 256GB model for just $549, the 512GB model for just $749, or the 1TB model for just $949. If you want to add on cellular, the discounts are slightly different. The 128GB, 256GB and 1TB models are down $150 still but the 512GB model is only down $84.</p>
<p>For all combinations of storage or cellular capabilities, you can choose between four stylish colors. Pick either blue, purple, space gray, or starlight.</p>

<h2>Powerful Performance</h2>
<p>So AI has been a pretty big buzzword this past year. Will it be the future of consumer tech? Or is it just a speculative fixation like we went through with NFTs. We’ll find out in due time. Though for right now, Apple and companies like it have promised a ton to consumers with the inclusion of their own proprietary AI models they’re sticking into their products. Apple has Apple Intelligence which can be used to help you craft messages, generate images, and things of the like. The M3 chip is powerful enough to make local processing for Ai models such as this possible.</p>



<p>Beyond AI, the M3 chip allows for improved performance on power-hungry apps, letting you run them side-by-side with each other with no hiccups. Graphically intensive games also get a boost.</p>
<p>To get the full use out of your Apple iPad Air, you can pick up the Apple Pencil Pro (sold separately). Use it to quickly jot down notes, draw or edit photos, and more. It’s compatible with tons of productivity and art apps on the App Store.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4143/">Finally get yourself that iPad you’ve been telling yourself you would with the 2025 model iPad Ai powered by Apple’s M3 chipset</a>. Most versions are on sale right now for $150 off.</p>
