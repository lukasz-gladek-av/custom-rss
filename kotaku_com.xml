            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We just zoomed right on by Amazon’s final Prime member sales even of the year. We’re now in a bit of a no man’s zone before we get to Black Friday weekend and Cyber Monday. And yet, even though we’re in this deals desert, it’s not impossible to find an oasis of savings if you look hard enough. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4812/">Like right now, Amazon has this Kamrui mini PC going for 19% off. It’s normally priced at $209, but for a limited time, you can scoop one up for just $169</a>. That works out to a savings of $40.</p>
<p>Taking a peak under the tiny hood of this 2025 Kamrui mini PC, you’ll find a Twin Lake-N N150 four-core, four-thread processor with an integrated graphics card. Among that, you’ll also see 16GB of RAM and a full 512GB SSD for file storage. If that’s not enough for your needs, the M.2 PCIe 3.0 NVMe SSD slot is expandable to up to 2TB. With these specs, you can expect a quick system startup time and fast loading of your documents and data.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4812/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>As far as connectivity goes, the Kamrui Essenx E1 Mini PC is equipped with a multi-functional interface that include two USB-A 3.2 ports, two USB-A 2.0 ports, a DisplayPort 1.4, and HDMI 2.0 port, a Gigabit Ethernet port, plus audio intake and outtake. The HDMI and DisplayPort together means you can connect to two different displays at once. It’s capable of displaying in up to 4K.</p>
<h2>Why Get a Mini?</h2>
<p>So the obvious appeal of a mini PC its its footprint. The Kamrui Essenx E1 Mini PC measures in at only 3.96 inches long and wide and 1.57 inches tall. That shakes out to only about one tenth the size of a standard desktop PC. The ultra-compact form factor means you can dedicate more of your desk to other things like your books or perhaps a second monitor.</p>



<p>Mini PCs also work great as a multimedia hub for a home theater. Sure, most TVs nowadays come with smart features, and even if yours doesn’t, streaming sticks are cheap to come by. That said, a mini PC can provide you with more versatility as its running Window. Thus, you’ll have a wider range of formats supported when playing videos locally or from a PLEX server. Heck, the mini PC itself can serve as your PLEX server if you wish.</p>
<p>Save yourself a solid $40 for a limited time when you pick up the Kamrui Essenx E1 Mini PC at Amazon.</p>

              <p>Staring at another low-battery warning just when you’re about to leave home is the kind of modern frustration no one needs: A reliable wall charger (with several ports) has quietly become one of those gadgets we can’t go a day without. That’s where the <em>Baseus</em> 100W USB‑C wall charger comes in, and right now it’s sitting at an all‑time low price on Amazon: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4261/">three‑port power block has dropped to just $34, down from $49.99</a>, as Amazon clears out the last of its post–Prime Day stock.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4261/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power, and a Compact Build</h2>
<p>The <em>Baseus</em> version produces <strong>up to 100W of charging juice in the form of a single USB-C outlet</strong>, which is enough to fast-charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro from dead to nearly full charge in roughly an hour and a half. It’s <strong>PD 3.0 protocol compatible</strong> meaning it speaks the same charging “language” that most current laptops, tablets, and phones speak so you get the maximum speed you can get without heating up your devices.</p>



<p>What’s more, <strong>its prongs are collapsible so it easily fits in a pocket or laptop sleeve</strong> and takes up very little real estate in a carry-on. It’s meant for the frequent flier or commuter who wouldn’t be interested in having some battery brick taking up valuable space on the wall or acting as luggage dead weight. And in the form of a charger for its rated capacity, it packs well – only slightly larger than your average single‑port telephone adapter.</p>
<p>If you’ve been struggling with having to tote up multiple chargers or are tired of lugging a laptop brick with you, the <em>Baseus</em> 100W wall charger is more than worth snapping up at this all-time low right now. Offers like this almost never stay around after the last batch goes through them, and this one hits almost all the right buttons.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[LEGO Slashes the Harry Potter Aragog Set to Almost Free in a Spooky Halloween Move]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/gift-this-fun-aragog-in-the-forbidden-forest-lego-set-to-a-harry-potter-fan-without-paying-the-full-price-2000635771</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Halloween is a great time to rewatch the classics like Harry Potter, and what better way to relive your favorite moments than with a fun Lego build? Lego has quite a few Harry Potter sets to choose from, but if you’re after something that’s easy to make and doesn’t cost too much, the Aragog in the Forbidden Forest set is a great option to consider.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4814/">It normally runs you around $20, but Amazon is offering it for just $16 after a sweet 20% discount.</a> You’re saving $4 on this budget build that’s fun to work on, and also makes a great gift for any Harry Potter fan out there.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4814/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bring Your Favorite Scenes to Life</h2>
<p>This set comes with 195 pieces and is appropriate for ages 7 and above. You’re getting Harry Potter and Ron Weasley minifigures with two wands and a lantern to guide them through the forest. You can choose between happy or scared faces, depending on the scene you’re trying to recreate. Though honestly, a scared Weasley feels a lot more fitting than a happy one.</p>
<p>There’s a fairly big Aragog figure, whose legs, fangs, and pedipalps are all movable, so you can create your own dramatic setups. The Aragog figure measures about 2.5 inches high, 6 inches long, and 7 inches wide. Plus, you’ve also got a small buildable forest section with plants, a spider web, and two baby spider figures. There’s a lot of room for creativity, so this set is sure to keep your little ones (or you) engaged for the weekend.</p>



<p>The included instruction manual guides you through the building process step-by-step. If that seems a bit too complicated, you can install the Lego Builder app on your phone. It lets you zoom in on the blocks, rotate your sets in 3D, and track your progress in real time.</p>
<p>If you’re a Harry Potter fan and want to introduce your kids to the wizarding world too, this Lego set is a great way to get started. It’s going to be a fun weekend project, and can also look great as a display piece. If you already own a set or two, place it with the rest of your collection to build your own version of magical adventures. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4814/">This set was already quite affordable at $20, but this deal brings it down to just $16.</a> The discount, however, might not last too long, so we suggest hurrying to grab it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dell’s OptiPlex 7020 Mini PC Falls 71%, From 6× the Price of a Mac Mini to Clearance-Level Pricing]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-only-thing-skinnier-than-this-powerhouse-dell-desktop-is-its-71-off-amazon-deal-2000635765</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell%E2%80%99s-optiplex-7020-mini-pc-falls-71-from-6%C3%97-the-price-of-a-mac-mini-to-clearance-level-pricing.1326439/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Maybe you’re still unconvinced by the recent wave of mini PCs, but you’re still not willing to plop a full-sized PC tower onto your desk, or even under it. Here’s a massive new Amazon deal on a desktop PC that’s slightly bigger than the other minis, way smaller than the towers, and quite possibly blows them both all of the water when it comes to performance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4813/">The skinny Dell Optiplex 7020 is a fat 71% off at just $996.</a></p>
<p>The heart and brains of the Optiplex 7020 is the 14th-gen Intel Core i7-14700T processor that delivers enough power to handle all of your productivity tasks and even some creative ones too, and it can do so at sizzling speeds of up to 5.2GHz. There’s also 32GB of RAM and a 1TB hard drive inside the slender sub-2-inches-wide body, along with enough ports so it can easily handle being the centerpiece of your home workstation.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4813/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mini In Name Only</h2>
<p>Dell calls the Optiplex 7020 a “mini PC,” but it’s a weight class or two above the palm-sized PCs that have been all the rage lately. Still, at just 7 inches high and 7 inches long, and just 1.42 inches thick, it definitely qualifies as portable, and can even be mounted on the back of a monitor for ultimate space-saving efficiency. You might have to choose which monitor to mount it behind, though, because the Dell Optiplex 7020 can support up to 3 displays at 4K resolution.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, there’s nothing “mini” about the Optiplex 7020, with all of that memory and Intel processing power driving the pre-installed Windows 11 Professional. The Intel UHD Graphics 770 chip will have all three of those 4K monitors looking crisp, if you so choose, in which case you’ll have plenty of visual real estate to put Microsoft Copilot to work as your AI assistant.</p>



<h2>All Your Hookups</h2>
<p>The HDMI 1.4b and two DisplayPort 1.4a outputs handle the external monitor situation more than amply, and there are also two USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 ports, a USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, and a USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 to satisfy all of your expansion and peripheral needs. The Ethernet RJ-45 port will give you outstanding hardwired internet speed, but it also has Wi-Fi 6 to keep your online work and play moving at a nice clip.</p>
<p>Dell’s foray into the small-PC world originally showed up at Amazon with a bloated $3,399 price tag that we wouldn’t recommend in a million years, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4813/">but with that number slashed down by 71% to just $996</a>, the Optiplex 7020 is a solid buy as a high-powered performance desktop PC that happens to be shrunk down to portable size.</p>
