The segment may have come about from producers reading <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/feb/15/theres-no-stress-gamers-go-offline-in-retro-console-revival&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/feb/15/theres-no-stress-gamers-go-offline-in-retro-console-revival" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">repeated</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/apr/02/why-are-younger-generations-embracing-the-retro-game-revival&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2024/apr/02/why-are-younger-generations-embracing-the-retro-game-revival" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stories</a></span> about the resurgence of retro gaming in <em>The Guardian</em>. Who doesn’t love a nice trip down memory lane back to the ‘80s and ‘90s, when gaming was still a novel escape from the drudgery of life and not associated with the battle cries of the worst people you’ve ever encountered online?</p><p>But the segment went off the rails immediately when the camera zoomed in on the props: a ZX81, a Nintendo Wii, and a SNES with an NES cartridge stuffed into it. There’s no way to harp on this without reinforcing the worst <em>Simpsons</em> comic book guy stereotypes, but, I mean, come on folks. This is like stuffing a VHS tape into a DVD player. I hope anyone planning to get back into retro gaming took it as a helpful warning of what not to do. <br></p><p>“As Nick shared on the programme, it’s no surprise that older titles and classic consoles are back in demand,” UKIE posted on LinkedIn. “Retro gaming taps into a powerful sense of nostalgia and community, offering players a way to reconnect with their past and share the games they loved with a new generation.”</p><p>The organization later denied responsibility for&nbsp;the retro gaming debacle. “For transparency, the studio team set up the in-studio display independently and handled the placement of the consoles—unfortunately, we couldn’t adjust it whilst on air,” a spokesperson <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/i-want-to-report-a-crime-bbc-mocked-for-its-wonky-nintendo-setup/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/i-want-to-report-a-crime-bbc-mocked-for-its-wonky-nintendo-setup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>VGC</em></a></span>.<br></p><p>In fairness, the SNES’s lack of backwards compatibility <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTzyz2TgGls&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTzyz2TgGls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confounded news broadcasters</a></span> back when it came out as well. The fact that it couldn’t “mix-and-match” games with the NES was seen as part of Nintendo’s uphill battle to sell parents on a pricey next-gen upgrade. That’s a problem the Switch 2 doesn’t have. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/bbc-mario-bros-nes-snes-retro-gaming-switch-2-1851786266]]></content:encoded>

In the game’s recreation of <em>THPS 3</em>'s iconic Canada level, someone has been removed: The dude pissing off the edge of the map. I decided to reach out to the developers at Iron Galaxy to get to the bottom of this very important issue. We also talked about other stuff, too, I guess. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197562" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="197562,195618,196358" data-current="197562"><div><p>THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23086.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>First up, I had to know, why did Iron Galaxy remove the pissing man from Canada? Is this some grand conspiracy? What’s going on? Well, according to Iron Galaxy, the pissing man wasn’t removed from <em>THPS 3+4</em>. But he does have better bladder control. </p><p>“Overall, we’ve made a few changes to the game so we could cast skating in a more positive light,” said Kurt Tillmanns, <em>THPS 3+4</em>'s director. “Our old Canadian friend is not gone, he has just learned some much-needed bladder control. There is even a pro goal where you can help him hydrate.” </p><p>When I asked about other changes players have spotted in <em>THPS 3+4</em>, like a ramp being in a different spot or an area being slightly re-themed, Tillmans said that the studio’s main goals for levels are to make something “cooler” and “more fun.” </p><p>“Our goals for environment design are to create a visual spectacle and provide interesting opportunities to skate. Those two motivations inform all our decisions,” said Tillman.</p><h2 id="h301696"><a id=""></a>Missing levels and big changes</h2><p>Speaking of changes, the biggest and most controversial change (besides the ever-important presence of the pissing dude) was to<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-remaster-thps4-original-career-mode-ps5-1851779836&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-remaster-thps4-original-career-mode-ps5-1851779836"> how <em>THPS 4</em>'s levels work in the remake</a></span>. They aren’t open-world anymore and instead work like <em>THPS 3</em>'s levels, with two-minute timers and a list of goals to complete in that time. I asked if there were ever plans to do the <em>THPS 4</em>'s levels as open-world playspaces, but it was never an option. </p><p>“We set out to create a game that joins and embodies the best of what both of the classic games offered. The two-minute timer is the emblematic<em> Tony Hawk</em> gameplay loop,” said Tillman. “Players who aren’t as interested in that can customize the length of the timer, up to an hour. Many goals from <em>THPS 4 </em>return, and we can share goals and gameplay across both titles, bringing gameplay like Skitchin’ and COMBO goals to the <em>THPS 3 </em>parks. We feel that this best-of-both-worlds approach is a benefit to both games.” </p><p>And while the new levels—like Waterpark—in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-photo-mode-option-tool-tony-hawks-pro-skater-1851786140&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-photo-mode-option-tool-tony-hawks-pro-skater-1851786140"><em>THPS 3+4</em></a></span> are good, I had to ask about the missing levels, like<em> THPS4</em>'s Chicago. According to Tillman, they were cut as part of the process for delivering a “unique experience rather than just a predictable remaster.” </p><p>“When it came to rebuilding the parks from the ground up, we prioritized the ones that seemed to be the favorites, according to the community consensus. Passing on Chicago and Carnival freed us up to build Waterpark, Pinball, and Movie Studio, the first brand-new [<em>THPS</em>]<em>&nbsp;</em>parks in over a decade.”</p><p>Oh, and here’s Tillman’s full response about Eric Sparrow appearing in the game for all big fans of Tony Hawk’s Underground. </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Every game needs a villain. We just thought this would be a fun callback to the <em>Underground</em>. A lot of time has passed, so this is a chance to find out the path he has led himself down with his treacherous ways.</p></blockquote><p>Hmmmm.... That’s not confirmation of <em>Underground </em>getting a full remake one day, but at least it’s nice to know the devs behind <em>THPS 3+4</em> know their Tony Hawk lore. Looking forward, Iron Galaxy still has an “opportunity to update the game post-launch.” We know at least one change that will be made in a future update, as the developer confirmed after this interview that it was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-tony-hawk-banjo-guitar-hero-easter-egg-trash-1851786211&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-tony-hawk-banjo-guitar-hero-easter-egg-trash-1851786211">going to remove a joke from the Waterpark level.</a></span>&nbsp;</p><p>“We’re watching like a hawk as players drop back into the parks. We still have an opportunity to update the game post-launch, so we’ll keep an eye on their feedback.”</p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/thps-3-4-remake-peeing-guy-canada-level-removed-censor-1851786232]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I spent about 35 hours in <em>Hitman World of Assassination</em> this past weekend—interrupted mostly by the non-optional need to sleep and occasional concerns over the health of my GPU running for so long in a non-air conditioned apartment room in New York City in the summer. But I was determined to find out if the Agent 47 experience could really satisfy the stealth nerd in me. As it turns out, I’ve been so, <em>so </em>wrong to neglect modern <em>Hitman</em>’s potential as a third-person stealth game; I thought it fell drastically short in that regard, but in fact it’s quite capable of delivering the hide-and-seek thrills I came to love in games like <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196394" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="97" data-playlist="196394,197541,196013" data-current="196394"><div><p>The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21942.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I blame my failure to recognize the freedom to go off-script and sneak around like Sam Fisher on the way the game foregrounds certain specific approaches you can take to each hit, which come with defined objectives that had me waiting around for the right costume to reveal itself, or for some waiter to leave an unattended glass nearby so I could slip some poison into it at just the right time. As I milled around waiting on these narrowly defined opportunities, I found myself wanting to just obsessively crouch-walk around every map, rarely changing outfits, slipping in and out of rooms never to be seen, but always lethally focused on my target. But can <em>Hitman</em> actually be played like this? Yes, I hear the diehard fans screaming right now, you always could just go off-script and do your own thing.</p><p>In my defense, <em>Hitman</em>’s default settings and game modes make it tough to ignore those narrative opportunities at first. These sub-quests are usually triggered by snippets of overheard NPC dialogue, followed by your handler narrating a bit of what’s going on. You’re then treated to a bright bluish-green lightbulb icon you can follow to victory through the whole map. Play the scenario right, and you probably never even have to crouch or stay out of sight. Hell, you could probably just play the game using the mini-map alone at that point. Straying from these narrative moments also results in a serious difficulty spike; guards are quite perceptive on higher difficulties, and there are more enforcers who can see through your disguises. So it’s easy to get discouraged and come to the conclusion that, yes, the easiest way to take out your hit is to wait for that perfect disguise, or that quick turn of a wrench on some piece of machinery that will crush your target. </p><figure id="" data-id="fd717e15f10615e787441aaea327765c" data-recommend-id="image://fd717e15f10615e787441aaea327765c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A person in a mascot outfit leans out from the corner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A person in a mascot outfit leans out from the corner." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->IOI / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd717e15f10615e787441aaea327765c" data-recommend-id="image://fd717e15f10615e787441aaea327765c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A person in a mascot outfit leans out from the corner." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The comically macabre story scenarios are an undeniable part of the theater of <em>Hitman</em>. But once I shut the guides off via Master difficulty, I found a very similar experience to the kinds of stealth games I grew up playing—and, dare I say, <em>Hitman</em> might even offer more interesting stealth opportunities? Before I knew it, I was clearing levels while going almost entirely unseen, rarely changing outfits, and waiting for <em>my</em> opportunity to land the killing shot. While some maps feel very familiar to ones I’ve played in other stealth games, <em>Hitman</em> also excels at providing types of maps that few dedicated stealth games seem willing to experiment with.</p><p>When was the last time Solid Snake had to infiltrate a suburban residential neighborhood? When did Sam Fisher ever have to break into a bank vault in the middle of the day while also assassinating the greedy, evil CEO? Yet here I was, using techniques and instincts baked during my many years spent playing as one of the many Snakes. I was surprised by just how organically it felt to crouch-walk everywhere while timing my takedowns with split-second urgency, instead of waiting for them to line up at just the right moment for me to deliver a low-effort execution by flipping a switch or turning a wrench on faulty equipment.</p><figure id="" data-id="c8dd5fea288e3c25aaec0100794066cb" data-recommend-id="image://c8dd5fea288e3c25aaec0100794066cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Agent 47 waits around a corner to strike his opponent." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Agent 47 waits around a corner to strike his opponent." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->IOI / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c8dd5fea288e3c25aaec0100794066cb" data-recommend-id="image://c8dd5fea288e3c25aaec0100794066cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Agent 47 waits around a corner to strike his opponent." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To be clear, some <em>Hitman</em> levels are easier to play in the style of <em>Metal Gear</em> or <em>Splinter Cell</em> than others. But the variety of environments, from a militia compound to a bougie high-tech hospital in Japan, makes for a nice mix of the familiar with unexpected scenarios that I’d never come across in the standard milsim milieu in which many stealth games operate. And even if I largely opted to ignore the narrative approaches the game offers to its various scenarios, they still exist on the periphery of my playstyle, making the maps feel more alive, sometimes presenting opportunities to get out of a sticky situation. I feel like I’m trespassing into spaces occupied by real people, not just mindless drones endlessly repeating a watch shift. And even when you don’t interact with them, turning a corner to find two NPCs flirting with each other, for example, makes these places feel occupied. You get the sense that you’re intruding not just because the HUD tells you that you’re trespassing, but because you’re clearly spying on or are within earshot of something you’re not supposed to be. </p><p>The narrative moments also helped me survive some failure burnout. As I consider getting spotted a fail state, I have a decades-learned habit of hitting “Restart Mission” every time a wrong move ruins my perfect stealth run. It’s not unusual for me to drill the same part of a mission over and over again until I can slip through, preferably without even firing a shot or taking down a guard. I aim for ghostly runs as often as I can. </p><figure id="" data-id="32d707119da59c088b49adb040cf85bf" data-recommend-id="image://32d707119da59c088b49adb040cf85bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Agent 47 crouches below an office desk to hide from two NPCs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Agent 47 crouches below an office desk to hide from two NPCs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->IOI / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="32d707119da59c088b49adb040cf85bf" data-recommend-id="image://32d707119da59c088b49adb040cf85bf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Agent 47 crouches below an office desk to hide from two NPCs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But stumbling upon a possible narrative opportunity during my stealthy trips around the map can be something of a release valve, helping me let go of the frustration of getting spotted. Or sometimes I’ll give in and disguise myself as a security guard. The fact that the game allows for this versatility is what helped me rack up 35 hours of play this weekend, and it’ll continue to call me back for future missions as well.</p><p>If you, too, have found that <em>Hitman</em> hasn’t been as stealthy as you wish it was, start changing the HUD settings and ramping up the difficulty; you’ll find a sneaking experience that might even make Big Boss sweat a little.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hitman-woa-stealth-metal-gear-splinter-cell-freelancer-1851786255]]></content:encoded>
