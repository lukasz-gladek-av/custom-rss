Sex stuff. Porn. So much of it. Scrolling the new release lists reveals the astonishing number of both crap and quality adult games that are released every day. But on the advent of a new update to the Steamworks Documentation for developers, it appears vast numbers of extreme adult games have been delisted from the service. Which raises a lot of questions. (<strong>Content warning:</strong> This article includes some potentially upsetting game titles.)</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196447" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: January 2024 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="330" data-playlist="196447,196663,195805" data-current="196447"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: January 2024 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196447/196447_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196447/196447_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196447/196447_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196447/196447_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21996.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Steam’s front page does a pretty decent job of curating its content to appeal to logged-in users. If you’ve never shown any interest in sex-themed games, you could be forgiven for not even knowing just how many are available on the store. But, dig a little deeper and it’s boobs all the way down. As someone who regularly scrolls the unfiltered <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/search/?sort_by=Released_DESC&amp;os=win&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?sort_by=Released_DESC&amp;os=win" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New Releases page</a></span> searching for unknown indie games that deserve attention, I’m aware just how ubiquitous such games are. Some look interesting, most look astonishingly dreadful. Some just sound foul.</p><p>What’s allowed, however, has now become extremely confusing, with potential repercussions for developers looking to explore controversial territories. In Steam’s guidance for developers, under <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding?language=english#5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding?language=english#5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“What you shouldn’t publish on Steam,”</a></span> is a list of 15 characteristics a game might have that aren’t wanted on the store. They’re things like “sexually explicit images of real people” and “applications built on blockchain technology that issue or allow exchange of cryptocurrencies or NFTs.” The latest, added only yesterday, reads:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Content that may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers. In particular, certain kinds of adult only content.</p></blockquote><p>It’s a very unclear and difficult-to-interpret statement, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogamer.com/news/new-steam-rules-prohibit-games-that-upset-payment-processors/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/new-steam-rules-prohibit-games-that-upset-payment-processors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as <em>Videogamer</em> points out</a></span>, it follows <em>Nexus Mods</em> similarly restricting certain mods in light of the wildly unhelpful <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eff.org/pages/uk-online-safety-bill-massive-threat-online-privacy-security-and-speech&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eff.org/pages/uk-online-safety-bill-massive-threat-online-privacy-security-and-speech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UK Online Safety Act</a></span> that soon comes into force in the UK. Whether this move is related—if it’s Valve rolling out a new rule for the entire world in order to cover its backs with the implausible restrictions the British government is imposing on websites and banks—is not known. But <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://automaton-media.com/en/news/steam-rules-updated-to-prohibit-content-that-violates-rules-set-forth-by-payment-processors-and-banks/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/steam-rules-updated-to-prohibit-content-that-violates-rules-set-forth-by-payment-processors-and-banks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as <em>Automaton</em> noticed</a></span>, this rule change has coincided with a purge of extreme adult games on Steam, with hundreds <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/history/events/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/history/events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marked as delisted by <em>SteamDB</em></a></span> over the last 24 hours.</p><p>We’re talking about games themed around topics like incest, rape and slavery, titles like <em>Incest Tales: Webcam Daughter</em> and <em>Reincarnation in another world going to rape All NPCs VR</em>. One franchise alone, called <em>Interactive Sex</em>, appears to have had 54 games removed, meaning you can no longer play <em>Incest Daughters Episode 4</em> or <em>Daddy Daughter Incest</em>.</p><p>That latter example (which does not feature children) has been on sale on Steam since February 28 of this year. The <em>Reincarnation</em> rape-themed VR game had been available since March 14. Both are now gone. But it’s important to note this isn’t a banhammer situation. The developer of <em>Daddy Daughter Incest</em>, EroticGamesClub, still has <em>hundreds</em> of porn games on sale on Steam, and more confusingly, these still include incest-themed games, labelled as such on the store. So it’s very hard to understand what’s happening.</p><figure id="" data-id="f17165cf4b907793187752f08b6ff863" data-recommend-id="image://f17165cf4b907793187752f08b6ff863" data-format="jpg" data-width="1016" data-height="571" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A selection of adult games on Steam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A selection of adult games on Steam." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f17165cf4b907793187752f08b6ff863" data-recommend-id="image://f17165cf4b907793187752f08b6ff863" data-format="jpg" data-width="1016" data-height="571" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A selection of adult games on Steam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The vast majority of these games are utterly awful “visual novels,” barely interactive combinations of static images and briefly looped animated models, mostly depicting bog-standard porn-like sex acts. Most are priced at around $5, and have either no reviews or very negative remarks, the shovelware output not worth the wank. And look, I have my own opinions on these games and you have yours. I’m not here to pronounce my own boundaries, and your personal taste or distaste isn’t really relevant. Valve is very clear that it’s happy to host adult content on the store, and it offers options for customers to have all such games hidden from view. That’s why rule #3 on its guidelines says you should not attempt to distribute “Adult content that isn’t appropriately labeled and age-gated.”</p><p>The issues that I see come down to the complete ambiguity with which this new rule has been introduced. How is any developer supposed to be able to divine what might “violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks, or internet network providers”? Should they email Mastercard and T-Mobile to ask the corporations if they’re happy with their sex-themed tile-sliding puzzle game? (Oh god, there are <em>so </em>many sex-themed tile-sliding puzzle games on Steam.) And what are the “certain kinds” of adult content? Does everyone have to guess?</p><p>Honestly, I couldn’t care less about all these dreadful, smutty sims. They’re churned out by content factories, presumably hoping to catch the attention of horny customers, and everyone gets what they deserve when they pay $5 to watch two barely-animated custom nude models rutting back and forth. Whatever. But what concerns me is the collateral damage.</p><p>One of the real positives of Valve’s incredibly liberal approach to what it will sell is that it allows incredibly complex and difficult topics to be explored by brave developers. People regularly interrogate their own traumas through visual novels and interactive fiction, while others explore their sexual kinks via similar mediums. Victims of incest might want to create incredibly challenging games that process such experiences in healthy and productive ways—what happens here if it’s to turn out that “certain kinds” of adult themes includes such topics? And who’s deciding what’s allowed? Valve, or Visa?</p><p>And then what comes next? If we start deciding <em>this</em> is unacceptable, then where does that stop? Of course LGBTQ+ developers will be the most immediately vulnerable to such entirely ambiguous rules, where moral authority appears to have been handed to vast banking corporations.</p><p>So no, yeah, I’m grossed out by <em>Daddy Daughter Incest</em>, and don’t want to play that. (And managed not to for all the months it was available.) But that’s not the point. The point is that rules like this are deeply concerning when they’re so unclear and vague. </p><p>The UK’s Online Safety Act is a terrible, badly-constructed confusion of responsibilities, created with the pretense of protecting children, but its 250 pages are far better suited to enforcing censorship. It’s ambiguous itself, despite its enormous length—something that itself meant most politicians who voted for it had never read it. It moves responsibility for “harmful content” to internet providers and payment processors, without ever being clear what “harmful content” is, nor indeed what anyone is supposed to practically do to prevent it in the real world. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eff.org/pages/uk-online-safety-bill-massive-threat-online-privacy-security-and-speech&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eff.org/pages/uk-online-safety-bill-massive-threat-online-privacy-security-and-speech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can read why it’s so bad here</a></span>. And while we cannot say that this is why Valve has suddenly added this confusing new rule, it’s hard not to draw parallels. And its implications become international when it means companies start trying to crack down in such confused, extreme ways.</p><p>We’ve reached out to Valve to try to get more clarity about these changes, what’s expected of developers, and whether there’s any more clear guidance on what the mysterious “certain kinds” includes. We’ll update if they get back to us.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steam-valve-adult-content-sex-games-online-safety-act-1851786391]]></content:encoded>

It’s entirely possible plans have changed after the creative shakeup, but Bloys says that Druckmann gave the team a “good blueprint” for the rest of the show, even if he’s not working on it himself.</p><p>“Obviously it was great to have Neil involved in the beginning,” Bloys said. “The whole reason that I wanted to do <em>Last of Us</em> is after <em>Chernobyl</em>, I said to Craig, ‘what do you want to do next?’ And <em>Last of Us</em> was what he wanted to do. That’s what was most important to me, Craig’s creative excitement about the show. It was fantastic to have Neil involved. A lot of people don’t realize that Neil has a full-time job creating video games and running Naughty Dog. It’s a really big job that he’s got. So I understand why he needs to focus on that. But I believe he’s given us a good blueprint with the show. And obviously Craig is a pro, so I think we’ll be in excellent shape. I’m not worried at all.”</p><p>Bloys isn’t worried, but I am.

Without spoiling anything, I was stunned at the ingenuity on display as I dove to some of its deeper, late-game layers. There are tons of different material types that make up the world, and there are set rules to how they all interact with each other. A simple example is how throwing ice onto lava creates a hardened rock platform, but the chemistry and interplay between different elements gets more complex as you progress, and learning these relationships and using your knowledge of them to solve increasingly smart puzzles is supremely gratifying. — <strong>Logan Plant</strong> </p></blockquote><h2 id="h4778"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-bananza-review-a-new-start-for-nintendos-first-star/1900-6418382/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/donkey-kong-bananza-review-a-new-start-for-nintendos-first-star/1900-6418382/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GameSpot</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Donkey Kong Bananza offers a new start for Donkey Kong that is distinct from the Donkey Kong Country games. The focus on destructability captures what makes DK different from other platforming characters—his titanic strength—and giving him a cute sidekick grants the game unexpected emotional depth. As part of the launch line-up for the Switch 2, this nicely fills the gap for one of Nintendo’s signature substantial single-player adventures. But more importantly, it’s an excellent game in its own right, and deserves to be mentioned alongside games like Mario Odyssey as among Nintendo’s best recent work. —<strong> Steve Watts</strong></p></blockquote><h2 id="h4779"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananza-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Eurogamer</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> To properly encapsulate how I feel about Donkey Kong Bananza, you almost have to start at the finish. No spoilers here, obviously, but I have to say that I think this game has one of the finest finales of any Nintendo game ever. There’s a delightful build-up of adrenaline as story beats and experimental mechanical evolutions are gleefully layered atop each other. It’s difficult to not have a great big smile on your face as the game hurtles towards its finish. It’s pretty masterfully done. — <strong>Alex Donaldson</strong></p></blockquote><h2 id="h4780"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jul/16/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jul/16/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Guardian</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> The only fumble in these later stages is the overpowered nature of the Bananzas themselves. These animal transformations imbue DK with speed, flight, strength and more, and when contained in the challenges or levels built for them they sing. You are reminded of Mario’s Odyssey possessions and how perfectly realised each of those physical sensations was. But taken out of that context – when returning to earlier stages to mop up collectibles, for example – they become instant win buttons, dulling the ingenuity of Nintendo’s platforming designs. —<strong> Matthew Castle</strong></p></blockquote><h2 id="h4781"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2025/07/16/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2025/07/16/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Washington Post</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“Bananza” is the first Donkey Kong game developed internally by Nintendo in more than two decades, now staffed by the team that created the award-winning 2017 Switch title “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2017/10/30/mario-odyssey-is-a-reminder-of-how-fun-video-games-can-be/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2017/10/30/mario-odyssey-is-a-reminder-of-how-fun-video-games-can-be/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super Mario Odyssey</a></span>.” This game adopts Mario’s trademark powers of transformation. Instead of wearing different superpowered hats, Kong can transform into different animal “bananza” forms that allow him to fly (ostrich), punch through steel (ape) and sprint through thin ice weightlessly (zebra). While these powers run on a limited meter, a few sections allow extended use of them. The game soars when it demands usage of every single form, becoming a symphony of mechanics and player response. —<strong> Gene Park</strong><br>﻿</p></blockquote><h2 id="h4782"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.inverse.com/gaming/donkey-kong-bananza-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/donkey-kong-bananza-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Inverse</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>One moment in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> felt like a revelation – like seeing the image of the Mona Lisa for the first time. I’d simply punched my way straight down a mountain and landed on a Banandium Gem. Sprawled behind me was a lengthy platforming puzzle. My wanton destruction had let me punch my way out of doing an entire puzzle, and now the possibilities seemed endless. —<strong> Hayes Madsen</strong><br></p></blockquote><h2 id="h4783"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/donkey-kong/donkey-kong-bananza-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/donkey-kong/donkey-kong-bananza-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gamesradar</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Smashing things is fun, and Donkey Kong Bananza understands that fact better than any other video game I’ve ever played. Forget about “See that mountain? You can go there.” Now it’s “See that mountain? You can obliterate it.” Bananza’s destruction isn’t just a flashy gimmick for the Minecraft generation, it’s one of the best inventions Nintendo has had in years. — Dustin Bailey</p></blockquote><h2 id="h4784"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Verge</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>Bananza</em> is a dad game the same way <em>The Last of Us</em> is a dad game. Same world-trekking adventure with a big strong dude protecting a powerful little girl. But where <em>TLOU</em> makes you have big sad feelings about all the people the game forces you to kill, <em>Bananza</em> presents you with a slight alternative — what if you could use your powers to fuck shit up and <em>not</em> be a dick about it? DK smiles often. People are happy to see him. That friendly rock I mentioned earlier? When you punch him or any NPC, it turns into a high five. All that destruction is welcome because it’s helping restore the world.  — Ash Parrish</p></blockquote><h2 id="h4785"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRX0Ep7gacQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRX0Ep7gacQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Digital Foundry</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Image quality in handheld is a lot better than what we see in docked mode. But performance is where things get perhaps a little more interesting. So, in the direct for Donkey Kong, we spotted a ton of slowdown. And unfortunately, that has not been fully eliminated, but it is a little bit better than I had hoped. It’s just that the way it manifests is somewhat unusual. You see, most of the time, the drops are not sustained. Rather, they occur only during very specific animations, such as when picking up a banana or on certain camera cuts. It’s a bit distracting, but it doesn’t impede on gameplay that often, which is good. I say that often because there are situations where it can drop pretty hard and stay there, like this boss fight where the frame rate dips down to 30 FPS and sticks there for most of the fight. Something made worse by the somewhat choppy looking destruction effects. —<strong> John Linneman</strong></p></blockquote><h2 id="h4786"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>VGC</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>By the time the credits rolled, the transformations felt like one of numerous ideas introduced in Donkey Kong Bananza that it never truly capitalizes upon. At one point, progression seemingly expands with a branching path, only for it never to be used again. Similarly, other unique ideas are introduced and then never meaningfully fleshed out. Like most of Donkey Kong Bananza, then, if you start digging beneath the surface, you find flaws in its construct. But combined, its foundations form an adventure that’s genuinely greater than the sum of its parts. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t thoroughly enjoy the moment-to-moment of its campaign, even when I kept noticing the parts of its design that could’ve been executed better. —<strong> Andy Robinson</strong></p></blockquote><h2 id="h4787"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/donkey-kong-bananza-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/donkey-kong-bananza-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Gamer</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> It’s worth going back to that Astro Bot comparison, by way of Super Mario Odyssey.
