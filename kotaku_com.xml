The free post-launch patch will include even more powerful monsters for players to hunt, a relief following pre-release worries that the game might be the easiest <em>Monster Hunter</em> yet. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

TU1 will bring with it a monster of formidable strength at a level above Tempered!” Capcom <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/games/2246340/announcements/detail/534343407476147236&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/2246340/announcements/detail/534343407476147236" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed</a></span> on Thursday. <br>“Another challenging monster will also await you!” The leviathan Mizutsune was previously teased as one of the first post-launch beats coming to the game. The publisher also confirmed a social hub for players to meet, communicate, and eat with one another will be added in April and available to players who have completed the game’s main story.</p><p>That’s welcome news considering that there’s currently no place to hang out with other hunters and show off cool armor and gear. The news of stronger bosses on the way is also great, considering <em>Monster Hunter Wilds’ </em>main story can be a cake walk and even some of the post-game content doesn’t feel too difficult if you’re correctly prepared or rolling with a full squad of other players (or AI-controlled NPCs). </p><p>A number of early reviews of the game dinged it for how streamlined it feels compared to past entries in the action-RPG series, with some critics and longtime fans especially concerned about the lack of really challenging content even in high-rank missions. That said, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113">as I wrote in my review earlier this week</a></span>, I’ve still been having a blast with <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> and there’s clearly plenty of room for more challenging content to arrive in the future. Plus series veterans have been through the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1iy9pnh/once_again_the_cycle_repeats_itself/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://kinja.com/embed/inset/iframe&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MHWilds/comments/1iy9pnh/once_again_the_cycle_repeats_itself/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://kinja.com/embed/inset/iframe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">same difficulty debate plenty of times before</a></span>. </p><p>I’m still cleaning up the last of the side quests in the base game and have found myself occasionally getting demolished by a particularly challenging foe like a Tempered Jin Dahaad (it was also late at night and I was starting to fall asleep, which might have been a part of it). And even when <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> isn’t making me sweat, every moment has still been a joy. </p><p>It’s a pretty frictionless experience so far, yes, but also still an incredibly robust, refined, and meaty version of the <em>Monster Hunter </em>experience. It’s easy to see it only getting better with time. A month after launch for the first new bosses might be a long wait for some, but it gives the average player plenty of time to get through everything <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> currently has to show them, which is a lot. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>February 2025's Steam Next Fest  is upon us, which means there are once again hundreds of free demos to checkout for all different kinds of upcoming PC games. The hail from all different genres and teams, and range from very good to absolutely terrible. Steam is normally a mess to browse, and Next Fest is the usual discoverability labyrinth on steroids. So we’ve been playing stuff to see what has that special spark. Here are some of the games we’ve been enjoying and mesmerized by from Steam’s latest free demo bonanza. </p></div><div><p>Kathy Rain is finally back, eight years after her last, fantastic adventure. She’s now working full-time as a PI, but it’s not going well, money is about to run out, and she’s betting everything on solving a series of local murders by a serial killer called The Soothsayer. The demo gives a good chunk of game, and some excellent puzzles. — John Walker </p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBA</p></div><div><p>If you thought Steamboat Willie’s entering the public domain was just going to secure you a few terrible horror movies, think again. It’s also going to score one of the most astonishingly disturbing games I’ve ever played. And I’m pretty sure it’s good? <em>Bad Cheese</em>’s demo is a monstrously upsetting first-person...something, in which you play a bloated, morbidly obese Mickey Mouse, desperately trying to find pills for his mutant dog-like father-creature. Oh god, even the sound effects make me curl up to remember. — John Walker</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBA</p></div><div><p>This twin-stick shooter does more interesting things in its demo than so many games offer in their entirety. It’s a game where your health bars are also your ammo, so attacking makes you vulnerable, and that’s a damned fine idea alone. Then it gets more complicated. — John Walker</p><p><strong>Release:</strong> TBA</p></div><div><p><em>Bad Cheese</em> isn’t the only disturbing black-and-white demo we’ve found this Next Fest. <em>Kiddo</em> is a monochrome point-and-click adventure in which you play a masked figure who lives in disgusting solitude, finally spurred to leave his couch by the disappearance of his dog. In the demo, you’re mostly focused on trying to clean the toilet. And it’s <em>so</em> good. — John Walker</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBA</p></div><div><p>Race around collecting golden gears and other stuff in a beautiful seaside world where you surf around with the flare and ease of an animated ‘90s cereal mascot. <em>Demon Tides</em> is a follow-up to<em> Demon Turf: Neon Splash</em>. There are only about five short levels in the demo so it’s only a taste, but I already want more. I’m cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, I mean <em>Demon Tides</em>.  — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBD 2025</p></div><div><p>Set in Quito, Ecuador in 2001, <em>Despelote</em> is an urban walking sim where you learn about a neighborhood and its residents by kicking a soccer ball around. Its collage art-style is evocative, the music is beautiful, and the dream-like exploration of someone else’s mundane memories is affecting and hard to shake. — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>May 1, 2025</p></div><div><p>Colorful, fast-paced parkour in a whimsical world that’s constantly falling apart around you. That’s <em>Haste: Broken Worlds</em> in a nutshell, a very neat action platformer that can feel like a mashup of <em>Sonic</em> and a Studio Ghibli movie. I love it. One YouTube comment put it best. “They <em>actually</em> made the ‘Awesome Parkour Guy You Watched Out The Back Seat Car Window When You Were a Kid’ game.” — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBD</p></div><div><p><em>Mashina </em>is a stop-motion strategy sim where you play a robot digging through the earth to harvest resources and repair the world around you using machines. Think stripped-down elements of <em>Minecraft</em> and<em> Factorio</em> wrapped around a cute, child-like adventure. The demo is super short and gave me <em>ToeJam &amp; Earl</em> vibes (complimentary), and the mixed-media visual style is top-notch.  — Ethan Gach</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBD 2025</p></div><div><p><em>Is This Seat Taken</em> is the perfect kind of puzzle game. It has a simple setup—sort out differently-shaped people correctly—and so excellently and confidently nails that premise that playing it feels like someone injecting dopamine directly into your brain. I burned through the demo so fast that I was sad I have to now wait to play the full game. — Zack Zwiezen</p><p><strong>Release:</strong> TBA</p></div><div><p>The latest game from <em>XCOM </em>creator Julian Gollop isn’t what you might expect. <em>Chip ‘n Clawz vs. The Brainioids</em> is a third-person shooter tower defense strategy game that features colorful visuals and large open maps to explore. It’s like someone mixed together<em> Ratchet and Clank</em> with <em>Orcs Must Die</em> and added a tactical vision mode, too. Sounds a bit odd, but it’s really fun and feels great even in this unfinished state. — Zack Zwiezen</p><p><strong>Release:</strong> TBA</p></div><div><p><em>TMNT: Tactical Takedown</em> is pitched as a turn-based beat’em up and while that sounded strange, after playing the new demo, I’m totally in. This new <em>TMNT </em>game is turn-based, sure, but moves fast thanks to the fact that every few turns part of the map falls away. So you are forced to keep moving through crowds of enemies and use each turtle’s unique abilities to fight while picking up pizza for health. It’s a little harder than I expected, but I think this is something special. — Zack Zwiezen</p><p><strong>Release: </strong>TBA</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
