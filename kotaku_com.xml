            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Capcom Cup started in 2013 with <i>Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition</i> as the Japanese publisher sought to professionalize and take more direct ownership of its hit fighting franchise’s competitive scene. It expanded into multi-month tours leading up to the big finals, with all of the biggest matches streamed for free online. And it’s continued that way, until now. Capcom announced this week that the 2026 finals for <em>Street Fighter 6</em> will be a pay-per-view event, and fans are not happy. “No one should be deprived of the opportunity to enjoy the pinnacle of <em>Street Fighter</em>,” Evo 2025 winner Saul Leonardo “MenaRD” Mena II <a href="https://x.com/_MenaRD__/status/1972351981147525376">wrote on X</a> in response to the news.</p> <p>The two-time Capcom Cup champion hails from the Dominican Republic and noted, as many pros have, that locking esports behind a paywall particularly impacts fans from regions where the financial barriers are already higher. “I find it hard to accept,” he wrote. “I understand that in Japan, this is considered normal, and fortunately, the community is still able to support each other in this way. However, in many regions, including my own, there is hardly even the leeway to play this game.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">納得しがたいです</p> <p>日本ではこれが普通だと理解していますし、ありがたいことにコミュニティはまだこの方法で支え合えています。</p> <p>しかし、私の地域を含む多くの地域では、このゲームをプレイする余裕すらほとんどない。ストリートファイターの頂点を楽しむ機会を阻まれるべきではない。… <a href="https://t.co/DAVzvxvUWu">https://t.co/DAVzvxvUWu</a></p> <p>— WBG MenaRD🇩🇴 (@_MenaRD__) <a href="https://twitter.com/_MenaRD__/status/1972351981147525376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The <a href="https://sf.esports.capcom.com/capcomcup/cc12/en/">Capcom Cup 12 Finals</a> will take place on March 14, followed by the <em>Street Fighter</em> League World Championship on March 15. Both will take place live at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena in Tokyo, Japan, where front row seats will cost roughly $135. In a major break with the past, however, even virtual viewership will be ticketed this time around. The pay-per-view ticket price will be roughly $40 for both days. Anyone who doesn’t want to pay will have to wait until a week later to stream the matches online for free.</p>

 <p>The move caught many competitive<em> Street Fighter</em> pros by surprise. Next year’s Capcom Cup sports a $1,282,000 prize pool, unchanged from the prior year, despite the new income stream. “If this decision is final, then I hope at the very least a % of the PPV earnings be used to support the prize pool to improve the payout distribution for the players,” Arman “Phenom” Hanjani <a href="https://x.com/PhenomSF/status/1972393910438883538">wrote on X</a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The issue is that while Capcom funds the CC Finals, they absolutely do not pay to run all of the tournaments where people qualify for Capcom Cup. Individual TOs and communities in countries around the world operate those events. Capcom benefits from the hardwork of those TOs and…</p> <p>— 女 Molly_Bee (@MollyAmberBee) <a href="https://twitter.com/MollyAmberBee/status/1972796918666260953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s also unclear how the PPV requirement will impact the rest of the competitive scene’s content creators who traditionally co-stream events. Others have wondered why Capcom doesn’t just try to extract more money through Capcom Cup-specific in-game outfits and other cosmetics. “I don’t know why they’re not doing this anymore. I used to buy the CPT costume pack every year, everyone wins and everyone is happy,” <a href="https://x.com/Bigbird_fgc/status/1972303220908417059">wrote</a> Adel&nbsp;“Big Bird” Anouche.</p>

 <p>Fans are equally bewildered, pointing to all of the local events that feed into the Capcom Pro Tour but aren’t directly financed by the publisher. “I thought Capcom organized this circuit as a marketing tool for the game,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1nss7ou/capcom_announces_that_capcom_cup_12_finals_stream/">wrote</a> on Reddit. “Makes no sense to charge viewers to watch it. And esports is, unfortunately, still way too niche for that to be profitable.”</p> <p>While <em>Street Fighter</em> is massive in Japan, many are worried the move to PPV for such a big event will just end up excluding people in other parts of the world. Does Capcom care? Apparently not.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Celebrities are just like you and me. They enjoy some video games, just like the rest of us. And back in 2002, Sony was thrilled that so many famous people really enjoyed playing the PlayStation 2. Sony was so excited, in fact, that the PlayStation maker compiled a large list of “celebrity testimonies” and shared it with the press via the company’s 2002 E3 Press Kit. And thankfully, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ultrabrilliant.xyz/post/3m22r6klg722i">as spotted by Devolver Digital PR manager Andy Kelly</a>, someone all the way back in 2016 uploaded this <a href="https://archive.org/details/PlayStation2CelebQuotes">press kit to the Internet Archive</a>. Now we can all enjoy it.</p> <p>I’ve formatted all of the testimonials below, with minimal editing or tweaks. Now you can easily enjoy all of these testimonials, some of which don’t seem like something Sony would actually want people to read or share. And yes, some of the people below are not great and are super canceled in 2025. Take a shot for each time that happens. (Don’t do that.)</p>

 <hr> <h2>Matthew Perry, actor, <em>Friends</em></h2> <p>“I used to have a social life, go on dates, go to dinner parties, have a job. Now all I do is sit in a big chair and play PlayStation 2. 1 never leave my house. My friends have wondered what happened to me. Howard Hughes must have had one of these.”</p>

 <h2>Luke Wilson, actor, <em>Charlie’s Angels</em></h2> <p>“Freedom from everyday life can only mean one thing – the arrival of PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Sandra Bullock, actress, <em>Miss Congeniality</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is the only place where I can legally explode things and not harm anyone.”</p>

 <h2>Chris Klein, actor, <em>American Pie II</em></h2> <p>“I’ve been playing game systems for a really long time, but once you go PlayStation 2 you can never go back. . .It’s the best system for sure.”</p> <h2>Jason Biggs, actor, <em>American Pie II</em></h2> <p>“I do play PlayStation. I have a PS2 console and it is awesome…It is amazing. PS one is still great, but the graphics and the concepts on PS2 are incredibly realistic…I had PS2 in my trailer for <em>American Pie II</em>. Me and the rest of the guys would get into some heated games.”</p>

 <h2>Jason Lee, actor, <em>Almost Famous</em></h2> <p>“[PlayStation 2] is the most amazing game I’ve ever played. Amazing graphics, too.

My kids and I play together.”</p> <h2>Snoop Dogg, rapper/actor, <em>The Wash</em></h2> <p>“The rush to get the new PlayStation 2 is more out of control than the Cabbage Patch Kids. I want my music on there – I want it to be Snoop Dogg and PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Nick Carter, singer, Backstreet Boys</h2> <p>“I’ve been playing PlayStation 2 since it came out. I take it out on tour and play on the bus, in my hotel room and backstage before the shows. The graphics are totally awesome, and I like that I can use it to play DVDs, too.”</p> <h2>Vin Diesel, actor,<em> The Fast &amp; The Furious</em></h2> <p>“If I’m not playing Sony PlayStation or rereading a classic or watching a foreign film. . .my friends and I get on the Internet and find out who I’m dating, and it’s always hysterical.”</p>

 <h2>Tara Reid, actress, <em>American Pie II</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation is fun. It’s innocent and fun.

Forget my kids, this is MINE!”</p> <h2>Wayne Brady, comedian/actor, <em>Whose Line Is it Anyway?</em></h2> <p>“I love my PlayStation 2. I’m all over my PS2. . .

The new Madden game sounds insane…I want to play it now. I’m also excited about playing over the Internet. If they make an Olympic game it will be awesome to actually play someone in China. Too much fun.”</p> <h2>Forest Whitaker, actor/director, <em>Waiting To Exhale</em></h2> <p>“I can’t wait to get the PlayStation 2 for my kids. They’re going to love it.”</p>

 <h2>Ashley Angel, singer, O-Town</h2> <p>“It’s midnight in Milwaukee and it’s 20 degrees outside and instead of being in a warm hotel room, Jacob, Erik and I are out playing PS2 in the tour bus.”</p> <h2>Howie Dorough, singer, Backstreet Boys</h2> <p>“We are all fans, but Nikki [Nick Carter] is the biggest. That is why I can’t beat him at <em>Who </em><em>Wants to Be a Millionaire</em> – I am trying to get that thing down.”</p> <h2>Dave Matthews, singer, Dave Mathews Band</h2> <p>“The band is so into PlayStation 2. I can’t imagine being on the road without it. Our lounge on the bus is dedicated to PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Danny Masterson, actor, <em>That 70’s Show</em></h2> <p>“The games are really cool – they’ve got good soundtracks on them and look very, very real…I’m at work and in between scenes we play video games. We should probably read more books, but PlayStation 2 is so darn good.”</p> <h2>Bill Bellamy, MTV VJ/actor,<em> The Brothers</em></h2> <p>“[PlayStation 2] is fascinating to see. The graphics are so incredible, so lifelike — it’s fast, it’s fun, it’s challenging, it brings people together. You feel like you’re really in the game. That’s the part that’s cool and that’s what people get excited about.”</p>

 <h2>Patricia Arquette, actress, <em>Little Nicky</em></h2> <p>“We can’t get enough of PlayStation 2 at our house.”</p> <h2>Lee Ann Rimes, singer</h2> <p>“It’s a total stress-buster at the end of a long day – it’s a lot of fun!”</p> <h2>Marlon Wayans, actor/writer, <em>Scary Movie</em></h2> <p>“It’s the truth. I played John Madden. . .one sack hit me so big, it broke my rib. You really feel like you’re playing the game. It’s the true experience. . .PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, actress,<em> X-Men</em></h2> <p>“When I saw my friend [playing PlayStation 2] I became determined to become as much of an expert as she is.”</p>

 <h2>Tom Arnold, actor, <em>Best Damn Sports Show Period, True Lies</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is so intense that when they play they don’t want to talk to anyone around them.”</p> <h2>Jermaine Dupri, So So Def Founder/Producer/ Recording Artist</h2> <p>“I am a die hard PlayStation 2 fan, I don’t like nothing else. But PlayStation is my favorite. . .You can play music, games, DVDs – there isn’t anything better.”</p> <h2>Billy Campbell, actor, <em>Once and Again</em></h2> <p>“It’s going to be a long time before anybody beats it…”</p> <h2>Brendan Fehr, actor, <em>Roswell</em></h2> <p>“In terms of graphics, it’s far superior to [the original] PlayStation. In between scenes, you see the players come out of dressing rooms, and there are little clips like you’re watching TV. It’s a lot of fun. . . PlayStation 2 is great because it plays both DVDs and games. . . and the graphics are so cool.”</p>

 <h2>Carmen Electra, actress/model,<em> Scary Movie</em></h2> <p>“I grew up playing video games. PlayStation 2 takes it to the next level.”</p> <h2>Jeff Probst, host of TV’s <em>Survivor</em></h2> <p>“When we did the first <em>Survivor</em>, I didn’t realize I’d have some downtime between challenges and Tribal Councils, but for <em>Survivor 2</em>, I was ready. I brought a PlayStation 2 as my luxury item. So, we’d finish Tribal Council, head back to base camp, toss in a game and start jammin’. It was a great way to get your mind out of your work and not a bad way to relieve some tension as well.”</p> <h2>Joey Fatone, singer, NSYNC</h2> <p>“I use PlayStation 2 because it is fun and has good graphics. It gives us something else to do on<br> the bus and helps pass the time while traveling from city to city. Got a PS2 in my car too like Chris [Kirkpatrick], and I play at least four to five hours a day. PS2 is the BOMB!”</p> <h2>Joshua Jackson, actor, <em>Dawson ’s Creek</em></h2> <p>“I can’t go to a [movie] set without my PlayStation 2 ”</p> <h2>Sean Stockton, singer, Boyz II Men</h2> <p>“I am a huge fan of [PlayStation 2’s] <em>Grand Theft Auto.</em> . . for adults like me it is the bomb.”</p> <h2>Donald Faison, actor, <em>Scrubs</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is everywhere – they’re always at the most happening spots. It is the coolest brand.”</p>

 <h2>Drew Lachey, singer, 98 Degrees</h2> <p>“I’m keeping [my PlayStation 2] in my bunk on the tour bus because I’m afraid I’ll play it too much at home and cause fights with my wife.”</p> <h2>Eddie Cibrian, actor, <em>Third Watch</em></h2> <p>“You are talking to a true PlayStation 2 fan. I can’t wait for <em>Tony Hawk 3</em> to come out…I play <em>Madden</em> all day long.”</p> <h2>Bryan McFayden, MTV VJ</h2> <p>“At MTV, a PlayStation 2 is never more than 30 feet away from where we’re taping.”</p> <h2>Erik-Michael Estrada, singer, O-Town</h2> <p>“<em>NCAA Gamebreaker 2001</em> for PS2 is the most incredible college football game ever. Since we’ve gotten the PS2 on the road we have not been getting any sleep on the bus.”</p> <h2>Jason Cerbone, actor, <em>The Sopranos</em></h2> <p>“I have a PlayStation 2 at home and play all the time. I am a big fan.”</p> <h2>Jeff Timmons, singer, 98 Degrees</h2> <p>“We’re going to test out all of the games for Sony and post our recommendations on our website.”</p> <h2>Justin Jaffe, singer, 98 Degrees</h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is going to take over our football lounge on the bus.”</p> <h2>Kevin Richardson, singer, Backstreet Boys</h2> <p>“PlayStation 2’s <em>Madden 2002</em>, I am addicted to that game. I am addicted to football and loved to play in high school, but was not good enough to play college or professional ball. With <em>Madden</em>, I get to live out my fantasies on PlayStation 2.”</p>

 <h2>Lance Bass, singer, NSYNC</h2> <p>“I love my PlayStation 2 because it helps me to get rid of stress on and off the road.”</p> <h2>Michael Rosenbaum, actor, <em>Smallville</em></h2> <p>“The PlayStation 2 is more fun than my blow-up doll.”</p> <h2>Nick Lachey, singer, 98 Degrees</h2> <p>“I know we’re going to bum through the first PlayStation 2 unit on the first leg of the tour.”</p> <h2>Robert Horry, athlete, Los Angeles Lakers</h2> <p>“I am a big PlayStation 2 fan. I went to the launch party last season and it was the best party I went to and I had to come back and check out the anniversary party. I don’t play the basketball games because I get frustrated. The games won’t let me do moves that I know I can do in real life.”</p> <h2>John Salley, former athlete, Los Angeles Lakers</h2> <p>“My daughter and I compete [on PlayStation 2]. Whenever we get in a fight, we say ‘See you on PlayStation.’ It’s better than a spanking. Just spank them on PlayStation.”</p> <h2>Simon Rex, actor, <em>Jack and Jill </em>(2002 TV show)</h2> <p>“Incredible fast graphics that would make Mario run for the hills. If my friends thought I spent a lot of time on PlayStation, just wait until [PlayStation 2] comes out!”</p>

 <h2>Stefan Lessard, bassist, Dave Matthews Band</h2> <p>“People know when they can’t find me, I’m in my bunk playing PlayStation 2. It’s my saving grace on the road – but I love playing it at home too!”</p> <h2>Jimmy Kimmel, host, <em>The Man Show</em></h2> <p>“My son is eight years old and is hooked up like an IV to the PlayStation 2 — it keeps him busy.”</p> <h2>Adrien Brody, actor, <em>Dummy</em></h2> <p>“I don’t even have a TV, but I’m going to get one and go crazy with PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Vincent Pastore, actor, A<em>fter the Storm</em>, <em>The Sopranos</em></h2> <p>“I am a big PlayStation 2 fan. I am into it.”</p> <h2>Tia Carrere, actress, <em>Wayne’s World</em></h2> <p>“Actually, I have to admit to jumping to the head of the line in Canada to get a couple of PlayStation 2s for Christmas — I was part of the craze. Now I want one for me.”</p> <h2>Nick Stahl, actor, <em>The </em><em>Thin Red Line</em></h2> <p>“The PS2’s graphics are amazing. I can’t wait to own one of these. . .I’ll play it all the time.”</p> <h2>Norman Reedus, actor/model,<em> Gossip</em></h2> <p>“I love playing the PlayStation 2. It’s like meditation.”</p> <h2>Vincent Young, actor</h2> <p>“The sports games are addictive. I can’t put <em>Madden Football</em> down once I start playing. The graphics are so realistic – you can even see the hair on the players’ arms move.”</p> <h2>Catherine Bell, actress,<em> Jag</em></h2> <p>“The PlayStation 2 is amazing and it looks really cool. Plus, the graphics are incredible. I love the fighting games, especially <em>Tekken Tag</em>, because I find all these crazy combinations, and when I play against my husband I always win.”</p> <h2>Ashley Poole, singer, Dream</h2> <p>“Me and my dad play PlayStation 2 when I go home — I love it. I love it. Holly and I are the PlayStation 2 babies of Dream. On our bus we have all the games and love to play.”</p> <h2>Daphne Zuniga, actress, <em>Melrose Place</em></h2> <p>“My whole life, I’ve never liked video games, but after playing PlayStation 2, I have to get one…”</p> <h2>Debra Cox, singer</h2> <p>“I am a huge, huge, huge PlayStation fan. They are in every recording studio — how could you not be a fan?”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This 2.5D Love Letter To Chrono Trigger And Other JRPG Classics Couldn’t Look Any More Perfect]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/threads-time-trailer-chrono-trigger-jrpg-sea-stars-2000630296</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-2-5d-love-letter-to-chrono-trigger-and-other-jrpg-classics-couldn%E2%80%99t-look-any-more-perfect.1312867/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Will<em> Threads of Time</em> be <a href="https://kotaku.com/sea-of-stars-game-impressions-review-switch-jrpg-indie-1850854165">the next<em> Sea of</em> <em>Stars</em>,</a> or instead another tedious JRPG homage that emulates the classics without being able to capture what really made them tick? That was my question when it debuted during <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-tgs-2024-tokyo-game-show-final-fantasy-game-pass-1851658415">last year’s Xbox Tokyo Game Show livestream</a>. But every time this indie game has resurfaced since, it’s looked better and better. It returned to TGS 2025 with yet another trailer perfectly calibrated to play on fans’ hopes and dreams for another great 16-bit homage to all-time greats like<em> Chrono Trigger</em>.</p> <p>The turn-based RPG with beautiful pixel art and an amazing 2.5D depth of field is being made by Canada-based Riyo Games and published by Humble Games. There’s a team of over 30 people working on it. We still don’t have a release date but it’s looking in better shape than some flashy projects that dazzle with trailers but fail to actually ship. I hope the team isn’t biting off more than it can chew, especially amid a tough funding environment for smaller indie developers and publishers, because everything in this trailer is exactly what I want from a <em>Chrono Trigger</em> spiritual successor:</p>

  <p>The time-travelling adventure spans millions of years, from a prehistoric past to a cyberpunk future. Turn-based combat takes place in a dynamic view with bespoke attack animations. There’s an overworld map, town hubs, and NPCs to chat up. You’ll recruit characters from different eras and unlock team combos for battle. Why are you doing all this, exactly? It sounds like you’re working for the Order of Time Knights to try and protect the integrity of the timeline or something. Also: cool boss fights.</p> <p><em>Threads of Time</em> is being developed in Unreal Engine 5 with hand-crafted 2D pixel art. I can’t stress enough how great the environments and characters look. If that can hold up over an entire 10-20 hour adventure it will be an impressive achievement, especially for the indie studio’s first project. 2023’s <em>Sea of Stars</em> was the last game to pull this trick off, selling like hotcakes and winning nods at The Game Awards that year (DLC <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sabotagestudio.com/post/3lpmbdqu7w22w">released earlier this year</a>). Before that, there was 2021’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/eastward-the-kotaku-review-1847753920">incredible-looking <em>Eastward</em></a>. I hope <em>Threads of Time</em> can deliver something equally special in the next year or two. It’s currently only confirmed for PC and Xbox.</p>
