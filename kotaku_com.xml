              <p><em>Roblox</em> is possibly the most popular gaming platform on the planet‚Äîfar more popular than you might think. <a href="https://kotaku.com/grow-a-garden-roblox-5-million-active-users-record-pc-1851781824"><em>Grow a Garden</em></a>, a game built within the app, recently had 21.9 million concurrent players, dwarfing the likes of <em>Fortnite</em> and&nbsp;<em>Counter-Strike 2&nbsp;</em>by multiple times. And that‚Äôs despite being an application recently described as <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-hindenburg-report-pedophile-hellscape-for-kids-1851668649">‚Äúa pedophile hellscape for kids.‚Äù</a> Well, it can now add another similar accolade to its collection, as the entire state of Louisiana has announced it‚Äôs suing&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>, calling it ‚Äúa breeding ground for sex predators.‚Äù</p> <p>Louisiana attorney general Liz Murrill announced the action via X, explaining that she‚Äôs coming after the gaming platform due to its ‚Äúlack of safety protocols,‚Äù and the claim that this results in danger for children. Which, in most circumstances, might come across as all-too-familiar hyperbole from a member of government looking for a moral panic to latch onto. It‚Äôs just, in the case of <em>Roblox</em>, it‚Äôs something that‚Äôs been demonstrated to be true <a href="https://kotaku.com/its-shocking-just-how-shady-roblox-actually-is-1847522070">over</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-child-account-safety-settings-danger-1851680045">over again</a>. But no matter the accuracy, the question remains: What is the actual, practical purpose of this suit?</p> <p>‚Äú<em>Roblox</em> is overrun with harmful content and child predators,‚Äù says Murrill, ‚Äúbecause it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety. Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger poised to their children by <em>Roblox</em> so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.‚Äù</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">üö® BREAKING: Today I‚Äôm suing Roblox ‚Äì the #1 gaming site for children and teens ‚Äì and a breeding ground for sex predators.</p> <p>Due to Roblox‚Äôs lack of safety protocols, it endangers the safety of the children of Louisiana. Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators‚Ä¶ <a href="https://t.co/p98Sq8vvMb">pic.twitter.com/p98Sq8vvMb</a></p> <p>‚Äî Attorney General Liz Murrill (@AGLizMurrill) <a href="https://twitter.com/AGLizMurrill/status/1956081394083409932?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://aglizmurrill.com/Article/322">The longer statement</a> goes on to describe the motivation behind the suit.</p> <blockquote><p>‚ÄúBecause there is no age minimum and requirement to verify age or parental permission once you sign-up, users can easily say they are younger or older than their actual age ‚Äì allowing child predators to pose as children and for children to bypass any age requirement.</p> <p>Once registered, users have access to millions of games such as sports, role-playing, naval, fashion, and comedy. Other games which have existed on the platform including Escape to Epstein Island, Diddy Party, and Public Bathroom Simulator Vibe are not as innocent. These games and others are often filled with sexually explicit material and simulated sexual activity such as child gang rape.‚Äù</p></blockquote> <p>Again, every muscle in my body wants to type out why this Republican AG is wrong and how she‚Äôs willfully misinterpreting the facts to condemn a topic she doesn‚Äôt understand‚Ä¶but, well, <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-child-account-safety-settings-danger-1851680045">I‚Äôve tested it all for myself</a>, and it‚Äôs true. You can absolutely sign up as being any age up to 17 without any verification requirements, and passing as over 17 isn‚Äôt a herculean effort. But there‚Äôs little need, since many of the violent and sexual games are simply marked as suitable for teens so there‚Äôs no restrictions to playing them. Oh, and despite my own son not being allowed to use <em>Roblox&nbsp;</em>(I am the&nbsp;<em>meanest</em> father), his friends do and so I get to hear about ‚ÄúDiddy Party‚Äù and the like far more often than anyone could want.</p> <p>Changes were made toward the end of 2024 that added new options for parents, allowing them to prevent their under-13s from being able to use in-game chat features, and that stopped children under 9 from accessing teenage content. However, it‚Äôs more extraordinary that even these most basic levels of protection hadn‚Äôt been included for the app‚Äôs first 18 years. And even in the wake of these changes, there‚Äôs still nothing to stop a 13-year-old from accessing very adult content or having un-monitored text communication with anyone. (As a parent of a 10-year-old who plays <em>Gorilla Tag</em> on his VR, I‚Äôm acutely aware how much more pernicious text chat is than audio.)</p> <p>Teenage privacy and online communication is a massively fraught and complex subject, one for each family to wrestle with among themselves, but it remains the case that <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-hindenburg-report-pedophile-hellscape-for-kids-1851668649">investigations into&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em></a> have found groups ‚Äúopenly trading child pornography and soliciting sexual acts from minors,‚Äù even when signed in using under-13 accounts.</p> <p>Now, obviously the vast majority of the 80 million people who play&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> every day are fine, even if they‚Äôre having their precious youths wasted on <a href="https://kotaku.com/steal-a-brainrot-roblox-empire-review-popular-memes-1851787027">Italian Brainrot memes</a>. I think what most people are after is just more effort on the parts of the owners to better protect young users from the <a href="https://www.wafb.com/2025/04/17/man-accused-kidnapping-10-year-old-he-met-roblox-discord/">very obvious harms that are possible</a>. Although given some of <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-boss-kids-child-labor-exploit-indonesia-slum-1851387795">the awful things those owners are wont to say</a>, hopes for common sense aren‚Äôt high.</p> <p>It‚Äôll be interesting to see what this peculiar lawsuit is intended to achieve. It seems more like attention-seeking noise than anything practical. The article cites the same Hindenburg Research investigation we‚Äôve linked above, and then mentions a recent case in Livingston Parish where a home was raided after someone was trying to lure children via <em>Roblox </em>(we haven‚Äôt been able to verify this, and even <a href="https://aglizmurrill.com/Files/Article/322/Documents/RobloxLawsuit.pdf">the text of the official lawsuit</a> doesn‚Äôt cite any evidence), before stating, ‚ÄúFor these and other reasons,&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> is in violation of Louisiana law.‚Äù</p> <p>Which laws?</p> <p>‚ÄúThe State is seeking permanent injunctive relief and prohibiting them from:</p> <ul> <li>Engaging in any activity in violation of Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act:</li> <li>Representing that Roblox has adequate safety features</li> <li>Restitution to the State of Louisiana</li> <li>Attorney‚Äôs fees</li> <li>All additional civil penalties allowable under law</li> <li>All additional damages allowable under law‚Äù</li> </ul> <p>Presumably there‚Äôs a hope that this will force Roblox, the company, to take its responsibilities more seriously, given it cannot control its distribution on a state-by-state level. However, it seems more likely the kerjillion-dollar company will just settle to make it all go away.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-link-play-multiplayer-switch-2-1851787158"><em>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A</em></a> is the first game in the franchise to move from turn-based battles to real-time combat, and it sounds like it will take some getting used to. The first gameplay was revealed to content creators and critics ahead of the 2025 Pok√©mon World Championships in Anaheim, California, where it became clear developer Game Freak is unafraid <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-switch-trailer-mega-evolution-az-1851766880">to change-up some decades-old formulas</a>.</p> <p>The demos were brief, split between 10 minutes of regular trainer battles and 10 minutes of a raid-like encounter against a Mega Evolution Abso. Unlike <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-arceus-alpha-pokemon-tone-nintendo-swit-1848478468">in 2022‚Äôs<em> Arceus</em></a>, <em>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A</em> has you move around a battle in real-time, telling your Pok√©mon which moves to use or when to get out of the way at will. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/hands-on-pokemon-legends-z-a-proves-legends-is-still-pokemons-most-exciting-series/"><em>VGC</em> noted</a> that you can even sneak up on enemy trainers to get an advantage in battle, while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/759788/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-real-time-preview"><em>The Verge</em> compared</a> the Mega Evolution showdown to ‚Äúa classic 3D&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>boss.‚Äù Your trainer can even take damage herself during these battles.</p> <p>You can see what they‚Äôre describing in some of the hands-on footage from <a href="https://serebii.net/">Serebii <em>Pok√©mon</em> expert</a> Joe Merrick:</p>

This lets you use any attack an unlimited number of times, but only once its meter is full. ‚Äú<em>Legends: Z-A</em> didn‚Äôt feel like a full action game to me, but kind of more like an MMO, with its casting times, cooldowns, and behind-the-scenes math happening,‚Äù writes Casey DeFreitas.</p> <p>Like everyone else, <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-trying-out-real-time-and-mega-evolution-fights/"><em>CNET</em> demoed</a> the game on <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-impressions-launch-games-comparison-1851785748">Switch 2 in docked mode</a> and noticed ‚Äúno performance hiccups.‚Äù Nevertheless, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-with-overhauled-battles-and-denser-exploration-im-shocked-at-how-fundamentally-fresh-this-could-feel/"><em>Gamesradar</em> was</a> underwhelmed by the urban playground <em>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A</em>&nbsp; takes place in ‚ÄúThe streets and rooftops are bare and lack personality and, while appearing to be a bustling metropolis, Lumiose City is strangely quiet. The limited character animations are also quite noticeable,‚Äù writes Michael Leri. ‚ÄúIt does make me wonder if the game is underwhelming in these areas because<em> Z-A</em> is still chained to the archaic original Switch compared to its more powerful successor.‚Äù</p> <p>While <em>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A</em> might still be visually hemmed in by the franchise‚Äôs history, it sounds like the city‚Äôs map still shows it being densely packed with points of interest. Combined with reworked moves to cater to the real-time flow of combat and mechanics like collecting orbs of energy in fights to trigger your own Pok√©mon‚Äôs Mega Evolutions, it feels like at the very least, this year‚Äôs release, the first new one in three years, is taking some fresh risks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Once more unto the breach. Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku‚Äôs</em> daily round-up of news, interesting stuff, and more, is here. This morning we‚Äôre looking at a second screen for the Switch 2 and a wider Steam, we‚Äôve got good news about that new <em>Mafia</em> game, and the devs behind<em> Battlefield 6</em> are making some changes to the beta. Oh, and don‚Äôt worry, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hspBUfY8IKs">we‚Äôre getting a new video game based on <em>Chicken Run</em></a>. I know everyone was waiting for that.</p> <h2><strong>Rush in the <em>BF6</em> open beta isn‚Äôt a great experience</strong></h2> <p>The<a href="https://kotaku.com/oh-thank-god-the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-back-2000617797"><em> Battlefield 6</em> open beta is back for its second and final weekend</a>, and that‚Äôs great. This weekend also sees a new mode join the fun, Rush, which is a classic <em>BF</em> mode. Sadly, Rush in the beta is bad. I played a few matches last night and didn‚Äôt enjoy it. Maps are too small, points are too close, and attackers are at a big disadvantage when trying to blow up the MCOM stations.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">MCOM Timer Changes to Rush</p> <p>We've just made a change to Rush: the MCOM timer is now reduced from 45 to 30 seconds to better the balance between attacking and defending players.</p> <p>We‚Äôll continue to monitor and are ready and able to make further balance adjustments.</p> <p>‚Äî Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1956257348684583143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 15, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>EA seems to get that Rush isn‚Äôt working, and a few hours after the beta went live, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1956257348684583143">the team changed how long it takes to blow up an MCOM station with a bomb</a>. Previously, it took 45 seconds, which gave defenders plenty of time to run in and defuse it. Now it takes 30 seconds, which should help. But if this mode is going to join my rotation in the full game in October, more changes will have to be made.</p>

 <h2><strong>Steam game pages are getting wider&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>Don‚Äôt be alarmed if soon store pages on Steam look a bit wider. <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/532106189043925406">Valve is testing out some new options</a> for developers and publishers that will let them customize and alter how store pages for games look on the popular digital storefront. Valve is also testing out the option to let devs upload high-quality videos to the store page instead of just gifs. Hopefully this makes store pages look nicer and doesn‚Äôt turn Steam into a giant mess.</p> <h2><strong><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> is selling really well</strong></h2> <p>2K‚Äôs linear action game <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-review-is-it-good-worth-playing-2000617529">Mafia: The Old Country</a></em>&nbsp;has received fairly good reviews and seems to be a hit with fans of the franchise. But more importantly for the bean counters at 2K, the new <em>Mafia</em> sequel, which is actually set before all the other games in the series, is selling like hotcakes. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/vginsights_mafiatheoldcountry-hangar13-2k-activity-7361305503299186688-QyHf/">According to some data shared by Sensor Tower</a>, <em>The Old Country</em> has already sold 800,000 units in just two weeks. PS5 and PC are the biggest platforms for the game. Hopefully this is good news for Hangar 13, and they can avoid layoffs.</p> <h2><strong><em>Hardspace: Shipbreaker</em> devs now own the franchise</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1161580/view/836099892906557718?l=english">On August 14</a> Blackbird Interactive, developers behind spaceship salvage sim <em>Hardspace: Shipbreaker,</em> announced that it had bought back the rights to the game and the franchise from publisher Focus Entertainment. The devs also announced that they were now working on multiple projects within the <em>Hardspace</em> universe and promised a small <em>Shipbreaker</em> update in the future that will tweak some things to reflect the new ownership.</p>

 <p>‚ÄúWe‚Äôre eternally grateful for [Focus Entertainment‚Äôs] partnership and willingness to work with us so we could take ownership of the <em>Hardspace</em> IP,‚Äù said Blackbird Interactive.</p> <h2><strong>WNBA stars will be able to play with NBA stars in <em>2K26</em></strong></h2> <p>While women players from the WNBA have been a part of the <em>NBA 2K</em> series for a few years now, the latest game in the franchise will let them compete against NBA stars for the first time ever. <a href="https://nba.2k.com/2k26/courtside-report/myteam/">This will be possible only in <em>NBA 2K‚Äô</em>s popular (and profitable) MyTeam mode</a>. The women players will be available in all MyTeam game modes.</p> <h2><strong>Wait a minute, is that a Switch 2 dual-screen patent?&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p>People have spotted what appears to be a new patent from Nintendo for a dual-screen attachment or accessory for the Nintendo Switch 2. Of course, companies patent all sorts of stuff and then never do anything with it. So don‚Äôt expect Nintendo to announce this tomorrow, next month, or ever. But it is interesting, isn‚Äôt it?</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/finally-we-got-some-new-gameplay-of-that-scary-looking-jurassic-park-game-2000617830">We got some new gameplay of that upcoming <em>Jurassic Park</em> horror game</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-mods-star-wars-genesis-tattooine-mos-eisley-2000617835">Read our interview with a person trying to turn <em>Starfield</em> into a <em>Star Wars</em> game using mods</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-oddball-aspirational-character-hero-design-2000617761"><em>Overwatch 2</em> is moving away from adding more goofball characters</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="It's Time We Talked about Disco Elysium, Again" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lZEAs6M1wts?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-trial-trailer-story-gameplay-voice-2000616929"><span>Wuyang</span></a><span>, the 44th hero in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-oddball-aspirational-character-hero-design-2000617761"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>‚Äôs roster</span></a><span>, isn‚Äôt officially in the game yet, but he‚Äôs already showing a lot of potential. The water-wielding Support character is playable for the next few days as part of a trial period, and after just one day with the hero, players are coming up with some diabolical combos. I played around with him a bit, and I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs my style of Support hero because his low healing output makes him feel a bit too passive for my liking. Despite this, I can see how a skillful player could make the most of his kit by setting up devastating opportunities for teammates. Wuyang feels evocative of the approach to Support hero design from when the first game launched, which was less about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-best-healer-gay-character-support-role-1850071120"><span>healing as the be-all, end-all utility</span></a><span> and more about, well, supporting other players to do their thing. As such, his ultimate, Tidal Blast, isn‚Äôt a big defensive ultimate that outheals incoming waves of damage. Instead, it‚Äôs one of the game‚Äôs new best set-up abilities.</span></p> <p><span>Tidal Blast has two major functions. First, it creates a water-based barrier around either Wuyang himself or an ally. This gives the target a bulky chunk of overhealth that will keep them safe from most incoming attacks. The second thing it does is detonate after a few seconds, doing a little bit of damage to enemies within its radius. However, it also knocks enemies to the ground, similar to Reinhardt‚Äôs Earthshatter ultimate, in a circular radius. This will give you a precious few seconds to follow up and do some real damage to an enemy team while they‚Äôre on the ground. On its own, this is a really solid ability that can take down enemy defenses and give you a window to wreck shop. However, with coordination, it can also be absolutely devastating when paired with characters like Tracer, Junker Queen, and Sombra, who can quickly dive into an enemy backline.</span></p>   <p><span>Coordination will be key in making these combos work. Timing is everything with Tidal Blast, because if your target is seconds early or late into a play, the whole setup can fall apart. </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>players like KarQ have demonstrated a few uses for the ability, like shielding Junker Queen as she heads in with her own ultimate which has her dash forward and inflict Wound damage on enemies, potentially cutting off a group of opponents at the knees and&nbsp; leaving them open for a quick finish. Some characters don‚Äôt even need to be dashing into the backline to get value out of Tidal Blast. Orisa‚Äôs ultimate, which sucks enemies into her position before bringing down a powerful charged strike onto the area around her, can be risky because it‚Äôs somewhat easy to move out of its range if you have a mobility skill. If she goes in covered in a water bubble, however, she can bring enemies into range, then Tidal Blast will knock them down for her to finish them off.

              <p>Super-realistic revenge shooter <em>Better Than Dead</em> has just been announced, along with an intensely violent trailer. The brutal game, in which you play as a Chinese woman who has escaped from slavery and is now exacting revenge on the photo-realistic streets of Hong Kong, is all depicted as if from bodycam footage. And‚Äîwow‚Äîeven the trailer is tough viewing. It looks amazing and terrifyingly real, and I suspect this could become gaming‚Äôs next big controversy.</p> <p>With each new graphical generation over the last 30 years, the FPS genre transformed from the cartoonish arcade styles of&nbsp;<em>Doom</em> to the ultra-realistic visceral depictions of, well, <em>Doom</em>. Along the way, as fidelity improved, the FPS always courted controversy, with mainstream attention grabbed on the advent of games like 1999‚Äôs <em>Kingpin: Life of Crime</em>, 2000‚Äôs&nbsp;<em>Soldier of Fortune</em>, and any number of&nbsp;<em>Call</em>s<em> of Duty</em>. However, the genre has been so damned impressive-looking for so long now, it feels like the corners have rubbed down on the reactions. Attempts at moral panics have more recently focused on subject matter over looks, as we‚Äôve all become inured to hyper-realistically shooting the kneecaps off our enemies. But I wonder whether&nbsp;<em>Better Than Dead</em> might trigger a new wave of concern.</p> <p>As a games critic who‚Äôs been around for the entire evolution of the genre, I think I‚Äôm pretty acclimatized to the whole shebang, and have read enough well-researched studies over the years to know that there‚Äôs never been a proven significant link between video-game violence and real-world violence. Which is my needlessly pompous way of saying: I love a good violent game! Gib me up any time. So it really took me back when I had such a visceral reaction to the trailer for <em>Better Than Dead</em>. It‚Äôs not because of the gun violence, or the blood splatters, or even that the protagonist‚Äôs targets are often running in fear (although it was that a bit); it‚Äôs that it‚Äôs all depicted as the most extraordinarily realistic bodycam footage.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Better Than Dead - MicroProse Publishing Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YqXZ1gPmU2E?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Real-world violence is something I go out of my way to avoid seeing, and when bodycam footage is released of police brutality and unlawful killings, I‚Äôll desperately try to avoid seeing it. Like most people, I‚Äôm very able to separate fantasy and reality, and can enjoy blowing the brains out of perfectly rendered aliens at the same time as being horrified by seeing a living human in pain. But when video game brutality is depicted in such a specific format, complete with the curving of the fish-eye lens and those grainy textures typical of low-grade video recordings, that line for me is incredibly blurred.</p> <p>As a result, the footage of&nbsp;<em>Better Than Dead</em> incessantly swam down the uncanny valley, at times looking completely photo-realistic, and others clearly being video game graphics. What disturbed me more than anything else was not the blood from gunshots‚Äîthat was cartoonish if anything‚Äîbut the <em>walls</em>. I know that sounds silly, but there‚Äôs something about how utterly lifelike they were, the way the surface textures speckled with artifacts just like when you see real bodycam footage. They become the most incredibly convincing aspect of the trailer, selling the perspective such that everything else feels so much more real.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617987" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617987"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617987">¬© Ubisoft / Mobygames</figcaption></figure> <p>The slightly silly perspective from which FPS games have always been viewed gives off the feeling that you‚Äôre a head with a gun jutting out just below your chin. Yes, some let you look down and see your feet, but it‚Äôs always felt far more like you‚Äôre playing a floating camera than a person. But a bodycam‚Äîthat makes sense of the whole format. That <em>is</em> a floating camera, and suddenly the genre is given a pragmatic reality that I‚Äôve found incredibly jarring.</p>

 <p>Then, added to this view, is the fisheye lens and faux-low-grade footage. It‚Äôs really interesting how incredibly effective this is every time the game shows something set outside, and how bizarrely crap it appears when indoors. That‚Äôs largely due to how awful the textures are in the office interior where a weird amount of the footage is set‚Äîthose drink bottles and monitors look like something from the early 2000s, so jarringly different from the moments when it cuts to exterior action and then, good god, it looks like real life. The pixelating of faces, however, works both indoors and out, because oh my goodness that‚Äôs chilling. It all adds to the sense of this being genuine footage, recovered and edited.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617986" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617986"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617986">¬© MicroProse / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Of course, were this idea being used for a game about, I dunno, saving people from danger, it would offer that same down-to-earth naturalism, but perhaps not be quite so disturbing.&nbsp;<em>Better Than Dead</em> is a game about a young woman who has escaped from cruel slavery exacting her murderous revenge on every single person involved‚Äîand from the footage, presumably everyone else nearby as well. According to the press release announcing the game, ‚ÄúIn <em>Better Than Dead</em>, you‚Äôre not just surviving‚Äîyou‚Äôre retaliating. Once held captive and humiliated on film by those who broke her, the protagonist now turns the camera on them. One by one, they‚Äôll fall. Every mission is a ruthless, high-stakes raid through the underbelly of Hong Kong. No remorse. No hesitation. Only vengeance.‚Äù</p>

 <p>The game cites ‚Äúgritty Hong Kong action cinema of the ‚Äô80s and ‚Äô90s‚Äù as its inspiration, although it‚Äôs hard not to think of Park Chan-wook‚Äôs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vengeance_Trilogy">Vengeance Trilogy</a> when it comes to people released from unfair captivity and seeking brutal revenge on their captors. And those films didn‚Äôt exactly land without their share of controversy.</p> <p>Now, there‚Äôs a decent chance the game will be no good. This is being published by one-time PC gaming powerhouse MicroProse, the biggest surprise there being that MicroProse is still a thing. (In fact, I looked it up and it seems to be back in the hands of at least one of the original early-‚Äô80s founders.) Even more strange is that behind <em>Better Than Dead</em> is a solo developer who has previously only released a super-cute vertical FPS called (somehow)&nbsp;<em>Forza Polpo!</em>, and a demo for a chibi cartoon-like non-violent platformer called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2600000/Mountain_Boy/"><em>Mountain Boy</em></a>. This is, er, something of a shift.</p> <p>But of course, it‚Äôs not whether a game‚Äôs good or not that riles the pearl-clutching press who love to pretend to be horrified that games are training your kids for their next high school shooting. And yes, when this is eventually released (there‚Äôs no date yet), it could come and go with no one noticing‚Äîthese things often do. But what remains so interesting to me, as an inoculated player of violent games for 40 years, is how it made me sit back in shock. I can‚Äôt think of a trailer that‚Äôs done that in years, perhaps even not since <em>Soldier of Fortune</em>‚Äòs deeply unpleasant depictions of violence 25 years ago seemed to shock the whole games industry into backing off and focusing on excitement instead of brutality for a good few years after.</p>
