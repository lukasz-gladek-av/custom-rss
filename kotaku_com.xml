              <p><span>Season 6 of </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span> launched last week, finally introducing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-marvel-rivals-role-fourth-wall-break-meta-2000659834"><span>Deadpool</span></a><span> to the hero roster, as well as a new battle pass and various gameplay tweaks. Part of the update includes a major reworking of the hero proficiency system. It added new rewards for players to earn but unintentionally promoted a new epidemic of “lord farming” in the process.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The updated system changes how players earn proficiency. Rather than a tiered system where players earn proficiency through universal and hero-specific challenges, there is now a linear system that players progress through via solely universal challenges, so each hero progresses identically regardless of role. There are now 70 levels for players to progress through, with rewards across various milestones. Players now also earn more proficiency per minute spent playing. You can find a full breakdown of the changes </span><a href="https://www.boostingfactory.com/marvel-rivals/blog/new-marvel-rivals-hero-proficiency-system-explained"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>The overhaul has led to a spike in players farming for cosmetics by staying in spawn and spamming abilities in order to quickly progress through the updated system. Players who engage in this behavior are </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1qgze5x/marvel_rivals_starting_to_take_action_against_afk/"><span>sometimes referred to as</span></a><span> lord farmers, who create deeply unbalanced matches by essentially being AFK the whole time.</span></p>

 <p><span>The phenomenon calls to mind </span><i><span>Civilization </span></i><span>designer Soren Johnson’s </span><a href="https://www.designer-notes.com/game-developer-column-17-water-finds-a-crack/"><span>2011 blog post</span></a><span>, where he writes, “Many players cannot help approaching a game as an optimization puzzle. What gives the most reward for the least risk? What strategy provides the highest chance—or even a guaranteed chance—of success? Given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of a game.”</span></p>

 <h2>A new behavior detection system is on the way</h2> <p><span>Fortunately, NetEase is aware of the behavior and already working to address it. “Recently, we’ve noticed that some players are exploiting matches by remaining stationary and repeatedly farming stats to gain hero proficiency points. This behavior disrupts normal gameplay and seriously affects the match experience of other players,” the </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span> team </span><a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/2013176993383133552"><span>wrote on X</span></a><span> on January 19. “To address this, we are planning to introduce a combat behavior detection system. Players found engaging in such behavior may face penalties including, but not limited to: warnings, short-term suspensions, long-term suspensions, or permanent account bans.”</span></p>

 <p><span>NetEase has not yet stated when the countermeasure will go live, or if any efforts will be made to prevent lord farmers from creating new accounts in the free-to-play game once the old ones are banned. In the meantime, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJsn3W26ghM"><span>some vigilante players are messing with lord farmers</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>While a combat behavior detection system will hopefully help deter lord farming going forward, it doesn’t address the fundamental game design decisions that are encouraging the behavior in the first place. Only time will tell if the hero proficiency system receives additional reworking.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Finally, A Limited Edition DualSense Controller That Actually Looks Cool]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Buried in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-trailer-leak-bungie-2000660975"><em>Marathon</em> launch info dump today</a>, which Bungie rushed out early after it was accidentally leaked over on Xbox, is the news that sci-fi shooter will arrive alongside the latest limited edition PlayStation 5 DualSense controller. And unlike many of the recent ones we’ve gotten, this one actually looks really good.</p> <p>The <em>Marathon</em>-inspired limited edition DualSense controller is $85 and goes up for pre-order on January 29 10:00 a.m. local time at direct.playstation.com. There’s also an accompanying Pulse Elite wireless headset that will go on sale at the same time, though for a much heftier price tag. That accessory will be $170. I’ve never loved the look of the Pulse headset and, frankly, the<em> Marathon</em> aesthetic isn’t changing that.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000660998" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000660998"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000660998">Sony</figcaption></figure> <p>What I love most about the <em>Marathon</em> DualSense, other than the generally subtle design and clean look, is how neatly the typography and icons mesh with the underlying sensibility of the controller. In other words, its a very natural fit unlike some other recent limited edition DualSenses. The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/08/20250508-ds/"><em>Death Stranding 2</em> one</a> wasn’t bad but felt pretty bland and I didn’t dig the giant bronze block over the touch pad. The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/10/first-look-ps5-ghost-of-yotei-limited-edition-console-designs/"><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> one</a>, meanwhile, looked like someone threw up gold dust on it.</p>

 <p>Bonus points to the <em>Marathon</em> controller for keeping the only branded text, the name of the game, hidden in neon on the underside of the controller. Is this controller even better looking than the <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/296678467989"><em>Concord</em> one</a>? I think so. Will it be as rare as that one? Probably! Hopefully, it’s not because<em> Marathon</em> ends up flopping as well.</p>
