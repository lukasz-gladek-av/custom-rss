            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo has revealed the first variant Joy-Con controllers for the Switch 2 and they’re not as colorful as some might have hoped. Still mostly all graphite black, the new Joy-Con sport subtle lines of lily purple and mint green and arrive next month for $100.</p> <p>The new options ship on February 12, the same day as <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em>, though they don’t seem to have any obvious thematic overlap with the Switch 2 sports game or its colors. Like the existing orange and blue Joy-Con, the colors are limited to the inset around the thumbsticks and the sides where they connect magnetically to the console. For anyone playing in handheld mode, most of what’s “new” about these variants won’t even be visible most of the time.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">As you enjoy <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MarioTennisFever?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MarioTennisFever</a>, you’ll also have the opportunity to give your <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoSwitch2</a> a new look! </p> <p>The first new colored Joy-Con 2 controllers—Light Purple and Light Green—also arrive Feb 12. </p> <p>Pre-purchase now: <a href="https://t.co/xoK6jsePMp">https://t.co/xoK6jsePMp</a> <a href="https://t.co/JoE8r4oOQl">pic.twitter.com/JoE8r4oOQl</a></p> <p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2009253320150425831?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Is it a big surprise that Nintendo is, at least for now, sticking with the more sophisticated, less whimsical sensibility of the existing Switch 2 Joy-Con? Not entirely. But it’s definitely a bit deflating for anyone who’s been waiting for something cool to come along before upgrading to a second pair of controllers. You’d get as much difference out of sticking different-colored nubs on the thumbsticks (which you should do anyway because the base ones are no good).</p>

 <p>The first year of the Switch 1 saw multiple new, full-color variants ship alongside games like <em>Arms</em> and <em>Splatoon 2</em>. They were bright, exciting, and fun. One of my favorite things from that console era is now having a drawer full of different colored Joy-Con that looks like someone dumped out a box of oversized crayons. Maybe we’ll get to those eventually. For now, fans will have to settle for “Joy-Con™ 2 (L)/(R) Light Purple / Light Green.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jbl-xtreme-3-is-back-to-its-black-friday-low-as-amazon-clears-out-the-best-selling-portable-speaker-2000658112</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A solid speaker can bring life to any gathering, and even upgrade those solo streaming sessions at night. Hardly any brand does music better than JBL, and today is a great time to grab one of its top-rated speakers for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5961/">Amazon has – quite generously – dropped the price of the JBL Xtreme 3 speaker by 39%.</a> You can now pick it up for $200, after a whopping $130 discount. The offer applies to all three color options, including black, blue, and camo. The deal is open to all shoppers (both Prime and non-Prime members), but we’re expecting it to wrap up soon. If you’ve been looking for an option that lets you enjoy your favorite beats to the fullest, now is the time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5961/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Keeps the Music Going All Night</h2>
<p>The JBL Xtreme 3 is a powerful, yet portable speaker. It comes with a detachable carrying strap that makes the speaker easy to take with you on the go, plus a built-in bottle opener for added convenience, especially when you’re partying in the great outdoors. The overall design is quite sturdy and can handle everyday wear and tear like a champ.</p>
<p>Sound-wise, it’s got four drivers and two JBL Bass Radiators that push deep, rich sound for all your tracks. You’ll also enjoy bold bass for energy-filled songs – the kind that makes everyone want to step on the dance floor and show off some cool moves. Whether you’re just using the speaker to listen to a podcast in your living room or for vibing to the latest Coldplay album, it delivers exceptionally well across all genres and audio types.</p>
<p>Additionally, Xtreme 3 is IP67 waterproof and dustproof, which means you can bring it anywhere without worry. Take it to the beach, by the pool, and even in the shower. Starting to rain in the backyard during a jamming session? That won’t be a problem, either. As for the battery life, it’s better than most options in this range. A single charge gets you up to 15 hours of playtime. That’s more than enough to keep the party going all night, and well into the next day! Plus, recharging doesn’t take forever, either, so even when you’re running low, the speaker should be back up in no time.</p>



<p>Connectivity-wise, the speaker can be paired with up to two smartphones or tablets at the same time. You can connect it to your phone and your friend’s, then easily take turns playing your favorite tracks. The PartyBoost feature deserves a mention, too, here. It allows you to pair two JBL PartyBoost-compatible speakers together for an even bigger, bolder sound when you want to entertain a larger crowd. Just ask a loved one to bring theirs, and have your own private concert with stereo sound at home!</p>
<p>Altogether, the JBL Xtreme 3 delivers powerful sound in a compact build. You will also enjoy a long battery life, plus incredible durability with its IP67 rating. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5961/">On a regular day, you’d pay around $330 to enjoy these features, but the current deal lets you pick the speaker up for just $200.</a> Discounts this good don’t last long, though. It’s best to get your orders in without wasting much time.</p>

              <p>The next major update to&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> is going to make all the baby animals over 2,740 percent cuter. I checked the figures using measurements, and by watching the new trailer for the Spring Drop four times over.</p> <p>It seems that until now,&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> has generated its baby animals by scaling down the body size of their adult forms, but keeping the heads the same. And that’s good. That’s worked. But there was room for improvement. In the next update, due in the spring, all the game’s younger animals will receive bespoke designs, complete with all-new animations, sound effects, and the cutest iddle widdle eyes you’ve ever seen.</p>  <p>Seriously, how are we supposed to even cope with those fuzzy lil’ guys? Those bunnies! The new wolf pups! The way the bunnies tip their heads and twitch their ears?!</p>

 <p>This is also a splendid piece of game promotion, for a game that requires less advertising than oxygen. Mojang’s Agnes Larsson is infectiously and apporiately excited about the new pups, and it compelling portrays&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> as a game that’s interesting far beyond that of the PvP-focused YouTube denizens of LifeSteal or what have you.</p>

 <p>I tested the video to its absolute limits, by this morning showing it to my 11-year-old son who is hellbent on a new, tougher exterior, and he melted before it. There were attempts at somewhat patronizing, “Yeah, that’s sweet,” remarks to placate me until he was caught off guard and let out, “KITTENS!” After that, he was n. Some cool credibility was recovered on the reveal that name tags are soon to be craftable, as he let out a YouTuber’s “Yesssssssss,” and carefully noted the ingredients for the task. After that, his Switch lured him away from the video, as he and fellow classmates rushed to work on a new world on their shared Realm before each player was popped out of existence as they were dragged from screen to school. I happily continued watching yet again, until Larsson was once more scratching a real pig’s belly with a rake.</p>

 <p>I’m a little bit worried about how I’m going to cope <a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-donut-smp-server-farm-notch-2000656412">on returning to Donut SMP</a> to a world that is yet to contain those cuboid little chicks, or baby highland cattle that I need to hug until they pop.</p> <p>All of the above is currently available in Snapshot, Beta and Preview versions of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, although there’s no date for when it will all properly arrive.</p>

<p>If you want a pair of your own right now, you’re in luck. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/">You can get fourth-generation Apple AirPods on Amazon.com for under $100, which represents a savings of $29 compared to their retail price of $129</a>. That’s about 22% off, which is well worth locking in your purchase for.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A pair of one of Apple’s best sets of earbuds</h2>
<p>These AirPods are all about seamless integration, and they do that perfectly.

To start listening to music, podcasts, etc., simply open the AirPod case and put the AirPods in your ears.</p>
<p>In terms of sound quality, the fourth-generation Apple AirPods sound great.

<p>As far as battery life, the fourth-generation Apple AirPods are capable of delivering hours of continuous listening per charge, allowing users to listen to content for extended periods of time. After the battery runs low, the AirPods can be placed back into the charging case for additional power to extend the amount of time available for listening. Users can also recharge the charging case via a cable, eliminating the need to store separate chargers for individual components.</p>
<p>These Apple AirPods build upon the ease-of-use features that were introduced in earlier generations of AirPods and offer you a budget-friendly option to upgrade or acquire a set that improve on Apple’s previous release in just about every way. If you’re interested in grabbing the new AirPods right now, be sure you lock in this deal while it’s still available.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Darth Jar Jar Is Real (Sort Of): LEGO’s Dark Falcon Brings the Wildest Star Wars Fan Theory to Life and Now at Its Lowest Price]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/darth-jar-jar-is-real-sort-of-legos-dark-falcon-brings-the-wildest-star-wars-fan-theory-to-life-and-now-at-its-lowest-price-2000657841</link>
            <guid>1400305</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In the years preceding the release of the sequel trilogy, a quite infamous and entertaining Star Wars fan theory began circulating online. The idea was simple: Jar Jar is Evil. The delightfully wacky Gungan was never meant to be comic relief, but rather the true villain of the prequel trilogy. According to the theory, George Lucas had originally planned to reveal Jar Jar as the saga’s ultimate puppet master, only to abandon the twist after audiences reacted poorly to the character following <em>Episode I: The Phantom Menace</em>. Some fans treated the theory as a genuine missed opportunity, others as a long-running joke—but nearly everyone agreed it was fun to imagine an alternate Star Wars timeline where “Darth Jar Jar” was real.</p>
<p>That alternate timeline now appears to be alive and well—at least in brick form. LEGO has wholeheartedly embraced this playful “what if” scenario with its LEGO Star Wars The Dark Falcon set.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5792/"> As we kick off the new year, Amazon is offering the set at a 17% discount, dropping the price from its usual $180 down to $148,</a> a $32 savings on one of the more unusual and conversation-starting Star Wars builds in recent memory.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5792/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The Dark Falcon exists in a twisted mirror version of the Star Wars universe, where heroes and villains have swapped moral alignments. The iconic Millennium Falcon design is reimagined in sleek jet black with striking red accents, immediately evoking Sith aesthetics rather than Rebel scrappiness. That theme extends to the minifigures as well, each offering a role reversal that ranges from clever to downright absurd.</p>

<h2>Your Favorite Star Wars Characters, But Wrong</h2>
<p>Front and center is the figure fans have joked about for years: Darth Jar Jar. The Naboo native finally gets his moment as a full-fledged Sith, complete with a menacing double-bladed red lightsaber reminiscent of Darth Maul’s. Rey joins him on the dark side, also wielding a double-bladed red saber—though this one runs parallel, like a tuning fork. C-3PO reappears as a bounty hunter, keeping much of his familiar silhouette but taking on a far tougher persona and red-glowing eyes.</p>
<p>On the flip side, classic villains get heroic makeovers. Darth Vader becomes Jedi Vader, dressed in a clean white outfit and wielding a blue lightsaber like he did in his Anakin Skywalker days. Then there’s the most unsettling transformation of all: Luke Skywalker. No longer the noble Jedi, but also not a villain the way you’d expect with this pattern going. Instead, Luke has embraced a bizarre, laid-back beach lifestyle. LEGO’s design makes him look less like a galactic hero and more like The Dude from The Big Lebowski, blue milk in hand and vibes fully off.</p>



<p>Beyond the minifigures, The Dark Falcon is packed with interactive features. The 1,579-piece set measures over 5 inches tall, 7 inches long, and 12.5 inches wide. Flip-up panels reveal a detailed interior, while spring-loaded shooters let you fire off lasers. There’s a removable throne for Darth Jar Jar, a jail cell for Beach Luke, and an opening cockpit that seats two minifigures.</p>
<p>This strange reimagining isn’t tied to traditional Star Wars canon, but instead to LEGO Star Wars: Rebuild the Galaxy, a four-episode animated series that debuted on Disney+ in 2024. Whether you’re a longtime fan of the Darth Jar Jar theory or simply enjoy seeing Star Wars turned upside down, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5792/">The Dark Falcon LEGO set is a standout collector’s piece—especially at $32 off for a limited time.</a></p>
