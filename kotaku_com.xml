            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Julian Gerighty, executive producer on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/tom-clancy-s-the-division"><i><span>Tom Clancy’s The Division</span></i></a><span>, has parted ways with Ubisoft after almost 27 years with the company—and only three months after the French conglomerate denied rumors about the executive’s exit.</span></p> <p><span>The departure was announced by Ubisoft studio Massive Entertainment earlier today. In the announcement, the company wishes Gerighty good luck on his new “adventure” at Battlefield Studios. Moreover, Massive tells fans not to worry, as “our teams who built this world with Julian are still here,” focused on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-2"><i><span>The Division 2</span></i></a><span>, extraction game mode </span><i><span>The Division 2: Survivors,</span></i><span> mobile title</span><i><span> The Division Resurgence</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>The Division 3</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/2012157010784186856"><span>https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/2012157010784186856</span></a></p> <p><span>Rumors about Gerighty leaving Ubisoft began back in mid-October of last year after </span><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/veteran-creative-lead-julian-gerighty-has-left-ubisoft-after-almost-27-years.1328146/"><span>people took notice of</span></a><span> his LinkedIn profile no longer showing his executive producer role as Gerighty’s current job. The next day, Massive </span><a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/1979546362405351487"><span>issued a statement</span></a><span> via social media acknowledging the rumors, and saying they were “far from true.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Julian is still with us as Executive Producer for </span><i><span>The Division</span></i><span> franchise, leading the creative vision for </span><i><span>TCTD2</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Resurgence</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Survivors</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>TCTD3</span></i><span>.&nbsp; We can’t wait to share what’s ahead,” read Massive’s post.</span></p> <p><span>As of now, it’s unclear who will be succeeding Gerighty in his previous role. According to an </span><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/enWR3N37m6wAbtZbV4nuA/the-division-2-survivors-and-the-division-resurgence"><span>update about the upcoming projects</span></a><span> issued in August, Magnus Jansén was appointed as creative director for </span><i><span>The Division 2: Survivors</span></i><span>, but the update didn’t provide leadership details about </span><i><span>Resurgence</span></i><span>. Regarding the upcoming mainline entry, during last week’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-leak-division-3-fable-ps5-2000658489"><span>New Game+ Showcase</span></a><span>, Gerighty said </span><i><span>The Division 3</span></i><span> is “shaping up to be a monster.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Gerighty’s departure is happening mere days after the announcement of a Realism Mode for </span><i><span>The Division 2,</span></i><span> slated to launch in March of this year, as well as a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-layoffs-division-3-massive-tencent-2000659368"><span>round of layoffs</span></a><span> at both Massive and Ubisoft Stockholm, which is expected to impact 55 employees. Moreover, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/division-3-definitive-edition-remaster-destiny-2000658970"><span>marketing for “</span><i><span>The Division: Definitive Edition</span></i><span>” recently appeared in Japan</span></a><span>, suggesting the loot shooter could be getting a remaster or a package including both games.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-is-offering-its-updated-rgbic-smart-lamp-at-a-major-discount-now-cheaper-than-a-standard-lamp-2000660309</link>

              <p>An easy and cost-effective way to upgrade the look and feel of your space is by improving lighting. You don’t need a full-blown overhaul either, as there are plenty of smart lamps that can instantly do the job.</p>
<p>The Govee floor lamp “2” is one such option and it’s going at a discount on Amazon today: This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6763/">lamp would typically cost you around $160, but you can grab it for just $128 today</a>: that’s after a generous, but limited time 20% drop. Additionally, multiple color options, including black, blue, and silver, are discounted. You can pick the one that best suits the aesthetics of your space.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6763/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Preset Scene Modes</h2>
<p>This 60-in floor lamp is made to light up larger areas, such as living rooms and bigger bedrooms. The body illuminates the surroundings, while the base infuses vibrancy for a stunning, eye-catching effect. You’ll enjoy 1725 lm brightness, which is considerably higher than previous models, plus adjustable 2200 K to 6500 K warm/cool whites. The latter offers flexibility, making it easy to switch from cozy setups to bright, focused lighting within seconds.</p>
<p>Color-wise, there’s a lot to discover. The Govee Home app comes packed with over 80 preset scene modes and user-customizable DIY modes. You can choose between effects like Sunset, Night Light, and Rainbow – based on your mood. Maybe go for something a bit on the warmer side while winding down at night, and switch to a brighter light when it’s time to focus on a deadline. Best of all, you can even create your own styles by playing with the gradients in the app!</p>



<p>The lights can be synced to music, too. Hosting a fun party at home? Impress the guest with a personalized light show that reacts to the beats of your favorite tracks. There’s also support for voice assistants built right in, which makes it easy to control the thing without getting up from the couch or using the dedicated app. The floor lamp responds to commands via HomeKit (Requires IPv6 network), Alexa, and Google Assistant. Just say something like “Alexa, dim the lights”, or “Siri, set the floor lamp to 60%,”, and the job will be done within seconds. For an even better hands-free experience, consider setting timers for the lamp. For instance, you can have it switch to warm lights after 6 PM automatically.</p>
<p>The lamp also plays nicely with other Govee lights. You can use it to connect up to 10 Govee lights within a 30 m range and sync music lighting effects together for a larger setup. Setup is quick, so you can start using the lamp almost right away.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Kevin Afghani </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-wonder-charles-martinet-new-voice-actor-switch-1850922124"><span>stepped into the voice role of Mario, Luigi, and Wario in 2023</span></a><span>. He took over the job after Charles Martinet, who voiced the fireball-throwing plumber for decades, was confirmed to be </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-voice-charles-martinet-nintendo-64-galaxy-1850757371"><span>“stepping back”</span></a><span> from voicing him to become a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-ambassador-voice-actor-charles-martinet-nintendo-1850805915"><span>“Mario Ambassador.”</span></a><span> This weekend, Afghani is making his first American convention appearance at Charlie’s Comic Con in Florida, and he did an interview with </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2026/01/14/nintendo-new-mario-kevin-afghani-video-games/88185428007/"><i><span>USA Today</span></i></a> <span>to talk about taking on the job of voicing Nintendo’s mascot. He had a lot of praise for his esteemed predecessor.</span></p> <p><span>“Look, Charles, as far as I’m concerned, </span><i><span>is</span></i><span> Mario,” Afghani told </span><i><span>USA Today</span></i><span>. “He created something that is so unbelievably iconic. And he did it so masterfully. If I wasn’t nervous, then I’m the wrong guy. I’m the second guy who’s doing Mario. Charles is THE guy. There is such an unbelievable respect for Charles. He is amazing.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Afghani says he’s a long-time </span><i><span>Mario </span></i><span>fan who spent a lot of his life “mimicking” Martinet’s Mario and Luigi performances, so these characters are “important” to him, and he views taking on the job as carrying them on so they can “keep being important to other people.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“I couldn’t explain to you how important these characters have been to me my entire life,” he said. “I’m a really jokey person, and I’m a really silly person. But there’s just a part of me that can’t help but get teary-eyed when I talk about this.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Though Martinet’s last credit as Mario was in 2022’s </span><i><span>Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope</span></i><span>, he did have a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-chris-pratt-charles-martinet-cameo-1850307200"><span>small cameo in </span><i><span>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</span></i><span> in 2023</span></a><span> as Mario’s dad. According to Martinet, he’s </span><a href="https://x.com/CharlesMartinet/status/1932458680542474319"><span>allowed to perform Mario’s voice for fans</span></a><span>, but won’t improvise dialogue, so don’t expect him to open up a Cameo to record voice messages for fans as Mario anytime soon.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-goes-after-bose-now-selling-the-bluetooth-micro-speaker-at-a-new-record-low-2000660305</link>

              <p>Good music can instantly lift your mood and the overall vibe of any space. Those shopping for a portable Bluetooth speaker today should consider grabbing the 2nd-generation Bose SoundLink Micro speaker, while it’s going for less than $100 at Amazon.</p>
<p>The retailer is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6762/">currently offering this mini yet mighty device at a 23% discount, which drops its $129 price to just $99</a>. Delivery is free, and the offer applies to all color options. Pick black if you’re looking for something basic, or go for the stunning pink version if you want something that can make a statement! The discount ends soon, though. If you’ve been on the lookout for a solid speaker, we highly recommend acting before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6762/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Packs a Solid Punch</h2>
<p>As the name suggests, this speaker is truly portable. The pocketable size, paired with the upgraded strap, makes it easy to carry around anywhere with ease; slide it into your pocket, attach it to your backpack, or just hold it in your hand as it delivers rich sound. It won’t add unnecessary weight, which is essential if you’re trying to travel light. Durability comes from its rugged design, plus an IP67 design that makes it dust, water, shock, and rust proof. Whether it’s a party on the beach, fun by the poolside, or just a solo session in the rain, the weather conditions won’t interfere with your listening session.</p>



<p>Of course, portability doesn’t mean a compromise on the sound quality. SoundLink Micro Speaker delivers crisp sound and impressive bass for all your tracks, from energy-filled songs to podcasts and even guided meditation sessions. The Bose app takes the experience even further by letting you tweak bass, treble, and mid-level to your liking. The app can also be used to control volume and create shortcuts. What’s more, you’ll also have the option of linking two SoundLink Micro speakers (2nd Gen) together for larger sound, which is great when you want to entertain a crowd. In this setup, you can choose between Stereo mode and Party mode. The former balances out the audio from each speaker, while the latter plays the same sound at once from any paired compatible Bose speaker.</p>
<p>Battery life is another strong selling point here. A single charge gets you up to 12 hours of continuous listening, which is more than enough to keep the party going all night long. Additionally, the extended range of up to 30 feet and increased bandwidth improve connectivity and make it easy to move around freely with your connected device, instead of feeling tied to the speaker.</p>
<p>This speaker normally retails for $129, but you can snap it up for just $99 today. All colors are discounted, so you have options to choose from. Just be sure to grab it as soon as you can, as we’re not expecting the discount to last long.</p>
