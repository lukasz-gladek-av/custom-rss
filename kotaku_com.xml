He is the central figure with which an entire universe revolves around. But, it would be a shame if you watched years of <em>Mission: Impossible</em> films and didn’t realize that it’s truly the cast of characters around Hunt that make him who he is, and thusly, this franchise what it has become.</p><p>Hunt would’ve been dead years ago if Benji Dunn (Simon Pegg) and Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) weren’t opening prison doors we he needed or monitoring the security system inside of the most secure buildings. Beyond their operational importance, villains like Owen Davian (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) and August Walker (Henry Cavill) give powerhouse performances while also pushing Hunt to the edge of his limits. Some of the best lines are uttered by people other than Hunt. And the emotional stakes of each film typically are from these side characters. </p><p>In honor of the unsung heroes, here are the most irreplaceable characters in <em>Mission: Impossible </em>history.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="db148e004c5e185a89089fa396e63785" data-recommend-id="image://db148e004c5e185a89089fa396e63785" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aaron Paul looking confused" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aaron Paul looking confused" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="db148e004c5e185a89089fa396e63785" data-recommend-id="image://db148e004c5e185a89089fa396e63785" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aaron Paul looking confused" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Aaron Paul was in <em>Mission: Impossible</em>? Yes, I’ve seen every movie multiple times and still have that reaction sometimes. A weaselly slacker-looking version of him briefly appears as the brother of Julia Meade-Hunt (Michelle Monaghan) at her engagement party to Hunt. His main contributions are to appear slovenly next to Hunt and unintentionally aid in her kidnapping. The energy that would make him famous as <em>Breaking Bad</em>’s Jesse Pinkman is tightly bottled up and kept under wraps for his few lines of dialogue. -Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2a13d058614da042857ebca5a759a93e" data-recommend-id="image://2a13d058614da042857ebca5a759a93e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="750" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Declan Gormley surveying the field" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Declan Gormley surveying the field" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2a13d058614da042857ebca5a759a93e" data-recommend-id="image://2a13d058614da042857ebca5a759a93e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="750" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Declan Gormley surveying the field" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the biggest missed opportunities of the <em>Mission: Impossible</em> franchise is abandoning Ethan Hunt’s most charismatic teammate ever in Declan Gormley (Jonathan Rhys Meyers). In the underrated <em>Mission: Impossible III, </em>he avoided gunfire and the blades of gigantic wind turbines while piloting a rescue helicopter with the same cool he displays while charming angry drivers in a traffic stop he’s created as a diversion with the smoothest Italian you’ll ever hear in this franchise. Was he memorable? Yes. But, since Ethan and his team went on to thwart bigger threats without him, he wasn’t what you’d call an essential part of the franchise.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7c725ad17532a43da01571a38db97b86" data-recommend-id="image://7c725ad17532a43da01571a38db97b86" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anthony Hopkins looking dazed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Anthony Hopkins looking dazed" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c725ad17532a43da01571a38db97b86" data-recommend-id="image://7c725ad17532a43da01571a38db97b86" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anthony Hopkins looking dazed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>A virtuoso acting talent such as Sir Anthony Hopkins being near the bottom of any movie list has nothing to do with his performance and everything do with his character’s utility. Appearing briefly in <em>Mission: Impossible II </em>as the sly and wise Mission Commander Swanbeck, Hopkins’s standout scene with Cruise is one of the coolest mission briefings in the history of the franchise. You can feel the confidence Swanbeck exhibits when he tells Hunt, a man who previously broke into Langley, “This is not Mission Difficult, Mr. Hunt. It’s Mission: Impossible.” Alas, Hopkins’ talents were wasted on a character so replaceable he was only used for one scene.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f3a346dba2e6469b7740257a81aadac9" data-recommend-id="image://f3a346dba2e6469b7740257a81aadac9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Paula Patton pointing a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Paula Patton pointing a gun" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f3a346dba2e6469b7740257a81aadac9" data-recommend-id="image://f3a346dba2e6469b7740257a81aadac9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Paula Patton pointing a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ditching <em>MI3</em>'s JV squad of expendables, <em>Ghost Protocol</em> put Paula Patton in the shoes of operative Jane Carter, a woman who’s out for revenge against the hitwoman who killed her partner. The movie doesn’t give her a lot to work with but she matches Cruise’s energy with a physical performance that sees her go toe-to-toe with assassin Sabine Moreau (Léa Seydoux) assassin on the 130th floor of Dubai’s Burj Khalifa and seduce  feisty telecoms billionaire Brij Nath (Anil Kapoor). She completed the mission with full marks but failed to leave much of a memorable impression on the series beyond that. - Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="18e011a61efad5565d4a1b931208463c" data-recommend-id="image://18e011a61efad5565d4a1b931208463c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jean Reno looking suspicious " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jean Reno looking suspicious " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="18e011a61efad5565d4a1b931208463c" data-recommend-id="image://18e011a61efad5565d4a1b931208463c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jean Reno looking suspicious " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’ve always felt that any globe-hopping espionage movie that lacks a grizzled Frenchman is missing something, that certain je ne sais quoi. Maybe that’s because I first fell in love with spy movies in the ’90s thanks to the one-two punch of 1996’s <em>Mission: Impossible</em> and 1998’s <em>Ronin</em>. As&nbsp;<em>Mission: Impossible</em>’s Franz Krieger, although we’re initially meant to think he’s a basically good member of Ethan Hunt’s new crackerjack team, he feels like bad news from the beginning and only confirms our suspicions before the end. Reno skillfully gives off just enough of a sleazy vibe to set off our alarm bells, and his presence makes us wary of possible threats to Ethan not just from outside the team, but from within it as well. Most importantly, though, with Reno’s presence in the mix, it gives the film that authentic espionage movie flavor, the stuff of cigarette-smoke-filled safehouses, narrow European streets, and potential treachery lurking around every corner. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0b3f68781f9f988fe291cf3d2fcb9256" data-recommend-id="image://0b3f68781f9f988fe291cf3d2fcb9256" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Max Mitsopolis on the phone" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Max Mitsopolis on the phone" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0b3f68781f9f988fe291cf3d2fcb9256" data-recommend-id="image://0b3f68781f9f988fe291cf3d2fcb9256" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Max Mitsopolis on the phone" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In order to clear his name and identify the real mole in the original <em>Mission: Impossible</em>, Ethan must track down an enigmatic figure known only as Max with whom the mole had dealings. Given that Max is a shadowy and powerful arms dealer, we might be expecting a Keyser Söze type—a menacing, larger-than-life underworld kingpin who you feel would just as soon put a bullet in your head as let you walk away from a meeting alive. So it’s a wonderful surprise when the hood is pulled from Ethan’s head at his first meeting with Max and we instead see the great Vanessa Redgrave, who plays Max as enigmatic, yes, but also effervescent—a woman who can both fix Ethan with a cold intellectual stare as she asks him probing questions and gush about how much she adores his brazen confidence. </p><p>Redgrave gives Max tremendous depth; she’s fiercely intelligent, deeply private (“I don’t have to tell you what a comfort anonymity can be in my profession; it’s like a warm blanket.”), and not without warmth herself. She establishes in that very first film that this franchise’s take on the world of international intrigue won’t just trot out the usual stereotypes for its villains but will offer something smarter and more surprising—figures whose power comes not from their skills with firearms or the ruthless deployment of violence but from their intellect and ability to negotiate with others to secure what they want. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8779d9306c53126da22a737ea505d8e3" data-recommend-id="image://8779d9306c53126da22a737ea505d8e3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="627" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="John Musgrave looking at someone" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="John Musgrave looking at someone" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8779d9306c53126da22a737ea505d8e3" data-recommend-id="image://8779d9306c53126da22a737ea505d8e3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="627" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="John Musgrave looking at someone" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You can usually see a double cross coming a mile away in <em>Mission: Impossible</em>. Not when John Musgrave is silently mouthing instructions only a restrained Hunt can understand, and before he slips him a knife to set himself free. With Phillip Seymour Hoffman’s overwhelmingly dastardly performance as Owen Davian distracting us, and Laurence Fishburne’s ambiguously snarly depiction of IMF director Theodore Brassel misdirecting us, Crudup’s slick performance slipped his nefarious intentions through our detection like a snake in the grass. Without Crudup, <em>Mission: Impossible III </em>is predictably one-dimensional, and the outstanding torture scene fake-out with a captured Hunt and his wife Julia (Michelle Monaghan) has less of a punch. Musgrave is the logic behind the madness, and also an essential part of the film. He just isn’t as integral to the franchise as the 12 characters ahead of him.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="379462ad1245423a278cb80bc8ed78d8" data-recommend-id="image://379462ad1245423a278cb80bc8ed78d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thandie Newton glaring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Thandie Newton glaring" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="379462ad1245423a278cb80bc8ed78d8" data-recommend-id="image://379462ad1245423a278cb80bc8ed78d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Thandie Newton glaring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Mission: Impossible II</em> doesn’t work without Thandie Newton being seductive while maintaining her agency, and being cunning without being unrealistically fearless. As Nyah Nordoff-Hall, she’s a professional thief who carries the emotional weight of a pretty emotionless action flick featuring more gunfire than kisses. Nyah held her own whether she was feigning attraction to a psychopathic capitalist looking to profit off killing people with the Chimera virus, or  she was dangerously flirting with Ethan Hunt by racing cars with him along a cliff. Few characters not named Ethan Hunt mean as much to any <em>Mission: Impossible </em>movie working as Nyah Nordoff-Hall.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="64d95484bd882a18a8ef50c70ed0d2d5" data-recommend-id="image://64d95484bd882a18a8ef50c70ed0d2d5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1404" data-height="790" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Solomon Lane staring on" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Solomon Lane staring on" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="64d95484bd882a18a8ef50c70ed0d2d5" data-recommend-id="image://64d95484bd882a18a8ef50c70ed0d2d5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1404" data-height="790" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Solomon Lane staring on" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Solomon Lane is probably the smartest <em>Mission: Impossible </em>villain ever. The rogue MI6 agent disillusioned with the global power structure was always one step ahead of Ethan Hunt, an agent so capable, he’d previously infiltrated both Langley and the Vatican without being detected. From the moment he appeared onscreen as the man who’s infiltrated Hunt’s mission delivery system and trapped him, we knew we were witnessing a rare villain. He framed the IMF, manipulated CIA double-agent August Walker (Henry Cavill), and formed the shadowy Syndicate of former agents. Beyond <em>being</em> evil, he <em>sounded </em>evil, with a gravelly whisper that made every threat feel like a dark premonition. He was so good at being bad that he was the villain for two separate <em>Mission: Impossible</em> movies, making him one of the most invaluable baddies in the franchise’s history.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="877046cc356108e6e0469117000f02d9" data-recommend-id="image://877046cc356108e6e0469117000f02d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Laurence Fishburne being pissed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Laurence Fishburne being pissed" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="877046cc356108e6e0469117000f02d9" data-recommend-id="image://877046cc356108e6e0469117000f02d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Laurence Fishburne being pissed" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To be honest, IMF director Theodore Brassel would’ve made this list simply for uttering the two coldest sentences I’ve ever heard in a <em>Mission: Impossible</em> movie. With Ethan Hunt strapped to a gurney after being suspected of going rogue and getting IMF agent Lindsey Farris (Keri Russell) killed, Brassel can see the disdain shooting out of Hunt’s eyes and doesn’t blink in the face of it. Instead he tells him, “You can look at me with those judgmental, incriminating eyes all you want. But, I bullshit you not: I will bleed on the flag to make sure the flag stays red.” Even as a one-off in the <em>Mission: Impossible</em> franchise, Fishburne’s incredible performance as Brassel made him a character you could never forget. Without him, <em>Mission Impossible 3</em> wouldn’t be what it was.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e0fe58a8bad0b27acd770b1348f998ee" data-recommend-id="image://e0fe58a8bad0b27acd770b1348f998ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="640" data-height="360" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michelle Monaghan smiling" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Michelle Monaghan smiling" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e0fe58a8bad0b27acd770b1348f998ee" data-recommend-id="image://e0fe58a8bad0b27acd770b1348f998ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="640" data-height="360" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michelle Monaghan smiling" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You can’t possibly think you can replace the only woman to ever make globe-trotting, death-defying secret agent Ethan Hunt settle down for even a second. Julia’s irresistible appeal had a man known for jumping off motorcycles and escaping car explosions helping with a dinner party like a suburban dad with a license to kill. Depending on how you view Ilsa Faust, Julia is arguably the most important woman in Hunt’s life, and thus the most important woman in this male-dominated action film franchise. She’s Hunt’s emotional weak point, one that Owen Davian presses on to bring him out of hiding in <em>Mission: Impossible III</em>, the only person Luther Stickell (Ving Rhames) goes out of his way to train to be a spy, and one of the main reasons the water supply of a third of the world’s population wasn’t poisoned in <em>Fallout. </em>Beyond that, Michelle Monaghan plays her with a grounded realism that makes her the most relatable character in a movie franchise full of people meant to be extraordinary in the best and worst ways. Without Monaghan’s performance as Julia Meade-Hunt, Ethan Hunt would be nothing more than a means to an end for the audience. With her, he’s a fully formed man with stakes beyond the mission he chose to accept.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c3a9ed154bbc0370db987d74004b89d6" data-recommend-id="image://c3a9ed154bbc0370db987d74004b89d6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="600" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eugene Kittridge looking judgmentally " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eugene Kittridge looking judgmentally " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c3a9ed154bbc0370db987d74004b89d6" data-recommend-id="image://c3a9ed154bbc0370db987d74004b89d6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="600" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eugene Kittridge looking judgmentally " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The screenplay for 1996’s <em>Mission: Impossible</em> was co-written by David Koepp and <em>Chinatown </em>scribe Robert Towne, and while I have no way of knowing exactly which elements of the script each was responsible for, I’ve always suspected that it was Towne who made the character of Kittridge so memorable. If any character in <em>Mission: Impossible</em> speaks with the kind of hard-boiled language that made 1974's <em>Chinatown</em> a neo-noir classic, it’s Eugene Kittridge. Kittridge is a higher-up at the IMF who believes Ethan is a mole and a traitor, and he will seemingly do just about anything, including making life much more difficult for Hunt’s family, to get him to surrender. At one point, he coldly tells Ethan that “dying slowly in America can be a very expensive proposition” and later, he pragmatically informs a subordinate that “everybody has pressure points. You find something that’s personally important to him, and you squeeze.” </p><p>But it’s more than the great dialogue he gets to spout that makes Kittridge so compelling; it’s the performance by Henry Czerny, who plays Eugene as a tense, tightly coiled bureaucrat whose ruthless dedication to following the letter of institutional procedure has blinded him to Ethan’s innocence and humanity. After his knockout appearance in the first film, Kittridge disappeared for decades, finally resurfacing in <em>Dead Reckoning</em>, though he didn’t have any moments that reminded us the crackling tension he and Hunt generated when they butted heads way back in 1996. Here’s hoping <em>Final Reckoning </em>rectifies that. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0fc2041401ba9dfabbba94bfd8e21d52" data-recommend-id="image://0fc2041401ba9dfabbba94bfd8e21d52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="William Brandt pointing a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="William Brandt pointing a gun" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0fc2041401ba9dfabbba94bfd8e21d52" data-recommend-id="image://0fc2041401ba9dfabbba94bfd8e21d52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="William Brandt pointing a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Out of everyone who’s been on Ethan Hunt’s team, there have only been two who I felt could match his tactical skills: Ilsa Faust (Rebecca Ferguson) and William Brandt, played by Jeremy Renner. His spy skills are so embedded into the core of who he is that when he was pretending to be an analyst, he instinctively ripped a gun out of Hunt’s hand and pointed it at him quicker than you could sneeze. Without him, Hunt would’ve been captured by the CIA when he was on the run in <em>Rogue Nation </em>and the entire fake meeting to intercept a nuclear launch control codebook would’ve failed in <em>Ghost Protocol</em>. Outside of Hunt, he’s the only person who can both play the bureaucracy game, explaining to the government why the IMF is essential when the need arises, and get his hands dirty by beating up terrorists. To put it plainly, William Brandt isn’t someone you can replace easily.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f3d038d7344b321ce59224feb51e94c7" data-recommend-id="image://f3d038d7344b321ce59224feb51e94c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="600" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Henry Cavill pointing a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Henry Cavill pointing a gun" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f3d038d7344b321ce59224feb51e94c7" data-recommend-id="image://f3d038d7344b321ce59224feb51e94c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="600" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Henry Cavill pointing a gun" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The man jumped out of a plane and got knocked unconscious by a bolt of lightning, all to keep his double agent cover intact. How the hell do you replace someone like that? On the right day, August Walker is the second most villainous character in <em>Mission: Impossible </em>history for his mixture of unflinching stoicism and charismatic yet radicalized ideological thinking. First off, he’s probably the only villain in the entire series that physically pushed Hunt to the limit in a fight across multiple rooftops. Secondly, he fools multiple government officials and agents whose entire jobs are to be intelligent. Lastly, he might be the single most handsome person to ever step foot on a <em>Mission: Impossible</em> set, which makes his dastardly double cross so jarring to some. He’s also the central antagonist in the greatest <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-final-reckoning-tom-cruise-stunts-1851780902&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-final-reckoning-tom-cruise-stunts-1851780902"><em>Mission: Impossible</em> stunt ever</a></span>.

This let the film subvert the expectations of viewers in 1996, who wouldn’t have anticipated that the noble Phelps would be revealed as the double-crossing villain behind the deaths of nearly every member of Ethan’s team. Jon Voight plays both sides of the coin to perfection, believably projecting the seasoned, fatherly veteran in the opening scenes before everything goes sideways, and then making us understand how Phelps could have fallen so far and grown so disillusioned with the institutions to which he’s given so much of his life after Ethan puts the pieces together. Though it’s been nearly 30 years since that fateful betrayal, it remains the most memorable and emotionally affecting plot twist reveal in the entire series. One gets the sense that it haunts Ethan still, that perhaps part of what spurs him on to be such an extraordinary agent is having witnessed firsthand, in the fall of Jim Phelps, what he might become if he were to stop prioritizing other people’s lives over his own. —Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bc4297d4b08e0d6a947d513feb287556" data-recommend-id="image://bc4297d4b08e0d6a947d513feb287556" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ilsa Faust about to fight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ilsa Faust about to fight" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bc4297d4b08e0d6a947d513feb287556" data-recommend-id="image://bc4297d4b08e0d6a947d513feb287556" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="1000" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ilsa Faust about to fight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>No one has provided a better foil for Hunt, or a better match for the gravity well around Cruise’s onscreen presence, than Rebecca Ferguson. Her double-crossing femme fatale Ilsa Faust consistently keeps everyone off balance, bringing an undercurrent of chaos and intrigue to every scene she’s a part of. Ferguson also managed to go three movies without ever fading into the background as simply another prop to assist in Cruise’s one-man action star show. She’s the cold, unbending edge the series sometimes lacks, and the only person who managed to consistently keep up with Cruise and often outpace him. It’s a crime she won’t be back for <em>Final Reckoning</em>. - Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e1f7a31786d689f5ac9933c943fe00b3" data-recommend-id="image://e1f7a31786d689f5ac9933c943fe00b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="701" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Owen Davion looking menacingly " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Owen Davion looking menacingly " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e1f7a31786d689f5ac9933c943fe00b3" data-recommend-id="image://e1f7a31786d689f5ac9933c943fe00b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="701" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Owen Davion looking menacingly " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Let’s get this out of the way: Owen Davian is the greatest villain in <em>Mission: Impossible </em>history, and <em>Mission: Impossible III</em> is criminally underrated. Phillip Seymour Hoffman plays a maniac with an air of inevitability. He rarely gets flustered, and always speaks with the calm, self-assured tone of a doctor that already knows that all of your options for survival are in their hands. The opening scene alone, in which he threatens to shoot Ethan’s wife in front of him and isn’t the least bit persuaded by Hunt’s trained trickery, is the most intense scene in all of <em>Mission: Impossible. </em>He made you believe he was going to find Hunt’s wife and make her bleed. He made you believe he was going to escape seemingly impenetrable law enforcement custody. He made you believe he was real. That is the highest honor any actor can receive. The late Phillip Seymour Hoffman turned <em>Mission: Impossible III </em>into an acting masterclass.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="20bc3b71ff5df5021379f351319ab8c2" data-recommend-id="image://20bc3b71ff5df5021379f351319ab8c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Simon Pegg looking worried" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Simon Pegg looking worried" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="20bc3b71ff5df5021379f351319ab8c2" data-recommend-id="image://20bc3b71ff5df5021379f351319ab8c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Simon Pegg looking worried" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Pegg’s Benji Dunn and his nervous wit feel so integral to the DNA of <em>Mission: Impossible</em> now that it’s hard to believe the character wasn’t even introduced until <em>MI3</em>. From the lab to the field, Pegg’s perfect comedic timing and effortless guilelessness give every increasingly bonkers scheme and highwire stunt the all-important “oh my god I can’t believe we’re doing this!” sidekick energy. He’s the innocent, wide-eyed Kombucha face to Ving Rhames’ exhausted eye-roll and Tom Cruise’s winning smile. From <em>MI5</em>'s “A minute ago you were dead!” to casually telling Hunt to jump off a cliff in <em>Dead Reckoning</em>, Pegg can turn from traumatic shock to deadpan Brit on a dime. No matter how bad the writing gets, it always works when it’s coming out of Pegg’s mouth. - Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="82e64ee7cfcdd914263c61108e9f6907" data-recommend-id="image://82e64ee7cfcdd914263c61108e9f6907" data-format="jpg" data-width="1242" data-height="699" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luther about to smile" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luther about to smile" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="82e64ee7cfcdd914263c61108e9f6907" data-recommend-id="image://82e64ee7cfcdd914263c61108e9f6907" data-format="jpg" data-width="1242" data-height="699" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luther about to smile" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-luther-stickell-ving-rhames-mi8-1851781283&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-luther-stickell-ving-rhames-mi8-1851781283">Luther Stickell</a></span> is the rock-solid and dependable foundation of the <em>Mission Impossibl</em>e franchise, showing up in every film.

It’s clear that Luther deeply trusts Ethan and likewise, Ethan sees Luther as probably his closest ally and confidant. Plus, it’s pretty awesome to be friends with one of the coolest dudes around. -Zack Zwiezen</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
