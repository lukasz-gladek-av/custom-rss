              <p>Budget laptops typically force compromises on storage, RAM, or processor power to hit accessible price points, and leave buyers frustrated with sluggish performance. Dell quietly sidesteps this problem by offloading fully-loaded Inspiron 15-inch laptops through Amazon rather than advertising aggressive discounts on its own website to protect brand perception while clearing inventory.</p>
<p>The Inspiron 3530 with <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5432/">Intel i7 processor, 32GB RAM, and 1TB SSD currently sells for just $939 on Amazon, slashed from its typical $3,599 price tag</a>. Dell’s own site shows no comparable promotion which makes <strong>Amazon the exclusive channel for this 74% discount</strong> that brings professional-grade specs down to consumer pricing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5432/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Dell Loaded This Laptop With Premium Components</h2>
<p>Fantastic performance without the thermal throttling that makes cheaper laptops struggle with demanding workflows comes <strong>with the 13th generation Intel Core i7-1355U processor</strong>. This 10-core chip with 12MB cache revs up as high as 5.0 GHz when needed for responsive computing. Moreover, the integrated graphics in the Intel Iris Xe really push beyond what most mainstream integrated options can provide: This means you’re getting a laptop that will not become obsolete the moment you need to do something more resource-intensive than just basic web browsing and document editing.</p>



<p>Adding 32GB of DDR4 RAM to this machine takes it from merely adequate to truly capable for professional work. Such ample memory allows seamless multitasking among creative applications so you could edit photos in one window, render video in another and monitor your email in a third. For anyone who works with virtual machines, large datasets or memory-intensive development environments, the extra 32GB gives you the headroom that spares you constant application switching and waiting.</p>



<p>This 1TB SSD gives plenty of storage for operating system and personal files without imposing constant cleaning or cloud dependence. Solid-state storage delivers boot times measured in seconds rather than minutes, and applications launch almost instantaneously compared to mechanical hard drives. A PCIe connection provides the drive with the bandwidth needed to operate at maximum speed, meaning large files transfer quickly and the whole system feels responsive.</p>
<p>The anti-glare coating on this 15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen provides excellent visual quality that, during extended work sessions and increases comfort. A 1920×1080 resolution enables one to have sharp rendering of text, which reduces eye strain when working with documents. WVA panel technology assures the viewer of accurate color representation and wide viewing angles.</p>
<p>The options include older legacy USB 2.0 ports for older peripherals, modern USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A and Type-C ports to enable fast data transfer, HDMI 1.4 for external displays, an SD card reader in service of photographers, and a standard headphone jack. WiFi 6 support provides the fastest wireless connectivity currently available, and Bluetooth 5.3 ensures reliable connections to wireless mice, keyboards, and headphones.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 11 Pro includes</strong> additional security features and the ability to join a domain that’s not offered in the home versions, while the<strong> Copilot AI assistant</strong> offers contextual help to make productivity tasks easier.</p>
<p>For $939, this laptop is cheaper than many mid-range machines with half the RAM and storage: <strong>it’s a spectacular value that Dell can’t promote too loudly without undermining its premium brand position</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After a lot of work and years of waiting, Blizzard’s massively popular loot-filled action RPG <em>Diablo 4</em> <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/blizzard-brings-diablo-4-to-china-in-december-after-long-awaited-approval-379129">is&nbsp; officially making its way to China next month</a>. But, due to various regulations in the country regarding the depiction of corpses and supernatural elements, blood and other elements like a big ol’ skeleton boss won’t be featured in the localized version of <em>Diablo 4.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/diablo-4-license-approved-by-chinese-government-377853">In July,</a> <em>Diablo 4</em> was one of the few foreign games officially approved by China’s National Press and Publication Administration for launch in the country. Since then, players have wondered what changes would be made to the game, which features a lot of skeletons, dead bodies, zombies, and gore. Now, via a free early trial available to players who pre-registered to play <em>Diablo 4</em>, we have our first look at some of the changes Blizzard has made to get the game published in China.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/diablo-4s-chinese-servers-will-have-some-cosmetic-differences-for-players-379189">As reported by <em>WOWHead</em> on November 10</a>, one of the biggest and most noticeable changes is that in China, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood_censorship_in_China"><em>Diablo IV</em>&nbsp;doesn’t feature any blood</a>. Instead, blood is replaced with a brown, transparent dust-like effect. In a game where nearly every action against NPCs results in blood splatter or even full-on explosions of sticky red goo, this is a very noticeable difference, especially when fighting large groups of enemies who normally pop like overfilled water balloons when smacked around with a sword.</p>

 <p>Another big change spotted by the outlet is that at least one boss has been changed. In the original version o<em>f Diablo 4</em>, one of the game’s bosses is Wandering Death, a large, ghostly skeleton who players team up to take down. In China, this<em> Diablo 4</em> world boss has been turned into a giant made out of rocks and boulders. While <em>WOWHead</em> wasn’t able to confirm how other skeletons look, it’s believed that, due to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/21/chinas-new-gaming-rules-to-ban-poker-blood-and-imperial-schemes/">China’s strict regulations against depictions of dead bodies and occult-like imagery</a>, other skeleton enemies in the ARPG will likely not look the same. Even some icons in <em>Diablo 4</em> had to be changed to remove skulls.</p> <p>Of course, these changes will let <em>Diablo 4</em> launch in China on December 12, over two years after it launched in the rest of the world. I imagine that, for players who have been patiently waiting to play<em> Diablo 4</em> in China, these changes won’t ruin the fun of killing four million enemies and picking up 400 swords.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>You know what they say: “Rule 34: If it exists, there is porn of it.” This internet rule posits that every fictional character has lewd art of them somewhere online, and there’s a website called Rule 34 that curates it and lets you search by character. But are you internet poisoned enough to be able to guess which characters have the most entries on that site? I thought I was, but I was very wrong.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.rule34dle.org/"><span>Rule34dle</span></a><span> is a browser game that pits two characters or franchises against one another and asks you to guess which of the pair has been the subject of more smutty art on the internet. I figured this would be easy. I know who the sickos are on the internet, and I also know which fandoms have the most artistically inclined community members. Or so I thought. But even after being a fan for nearly 30 years and writing about the series almost every day here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, I underestimated the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-official-forums-moderation-ban-rules-nintendo-1850605719"><span>depravity of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fandom</span></a><span>. What do you mean Snivy, the sassy little snake guy from </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White</span></i><span>,</span> <span>has more entries than Kitana from </span><i><span>Mortal Kombat</span></i><span>?</span></p> <p><span>In just a few minutes of guessing, I was repeatedly taken aback by the gaps between some characters. Sometimes they were as wide as the ocean, and at other times they were too close for comfort. Leavanny from </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>being just a couple of hundred entries away from the frost giant heartthrob Loki? That didn’t sound right, so I went investigating, and lo and behold, it was true. Do with that information what you will.</span></p> <p><span>The surprising answers do make Rule34dle a really fun game to play with friends or on stream. I’ve started seeing streamers play the game, and they’re also shocked at some of the results, so maybe some of us have just never quite peered into the abyss long enough.</span></p>         <p><span>If you want to try it out, none of the NSFW stuff is shown in the game itself, so you’re safe on that front. You can also try </span><a href="https://ao3dle.org/"><span>AO3dle</span></a><span>, which is the same concept but specifically pulling from fanfiction site Archive of Our Own. That one at least offers some plausible deniability because not everything on there is porn.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[World Record Holder Subjects His Body To 144 Straight Hours Of DDR]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ddr-worlds-longest-gaming-marathon-record-grasshoper-2000642566</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’ve had some remarkably long gaming sessions in my time. At least, I thought they were remarkably long. Turns out, I’m an amateur when compared to the likes of Szabolcs Csépe, also known as GrassHopper, a Hungarian gamer who now lays claim to the Guinness World Records’ title of “longest videogame marathon” for playing <i>Dance Dance Revolution</i> for 144 hours, or six straight days.</p>

 <p>Dancing to more than 3,000 songs, and apparently burning 22,000 calories in the process, GrassHopper soared past the previous world record of 138 hours, which was set by Carrie Swidecki in 2015 while playing <i>Just Dance</i> (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/challenging-but-comfortable-hungarian-breaks-game-marathon-world-record-by-playing-ddr-for-144-hours/">h/t <i>VGC</i></a>). In fact, the previous record was an inspiration for GrassHopper who said, “Ever since I learned about [Swidecki’s] achievements in marathon gaming, I often caught myself thinking about how she pulled the all-time longest session off almost a decade ago.</p>

 <p>Though Grasshopper certainly sweated the most and burned the most calories during the six-day marathon, it was a team effort. As Grasshopper said,</p> <p>This attempt was the most physically demanding experience, where the arms and shoulders expressed fatigue for extended hours without stretching. Apart from physically training for marathon gaming sessions, I prepared with the two most important keys to succeed: doing serious practice attempts with a small staff, and also coming up with a plan for supporting your body with sufficient food and water intake.</p>

 <p>This isn’t GrassHopper’s first rodeo when it comes to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/challenging-but-comfortable-hungarian-breaks-game-marathon-world-record-by-playing-ddr-for-144-hours/">marathoning games and setting records</a>. He previously broke the world record for the longest time spent playing a racing game, the game being <i>Gran Turismo 7</i>, and the time being 90 friggin’ hours. He also holds the world record for the longest video game marathon spent playing a puzzle game, with 32 straight hours of <i>Tetris</i>.</p> <p>Well, the next time I’m miserably powering through a metcon, I’ll be sure to remind myself it could be worse; I could be playing <i>DDR</i> for 144 hours. Bravo, sir. Bravo.</p>
