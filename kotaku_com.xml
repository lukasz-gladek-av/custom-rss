It looks like Christopher McQuarrie, who directed <em>Rogue Nation</em> and <em>Fallout</em> as well, had entire portions of the sub’s interior recreated for the scenes. Hopefully, in addition to whatever new ways Cruise finds to make his insurance agents squirm, the sequence doesn’t lean on post-production special effects to make an impact. </p><p>This isn’t <em>Mission: Impossible</em>’s first major water stunt. <em>Rogue Nation</em> saw Cruise <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://screenrant.com/mission-impossible-rogue-nation-tom-cruise-underwater-filmed-how/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://screenrant.com/mission-impossible-rogue-nation-tom-cruise-underwater-filmed-how/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">hold his breath for 6 minutes</a></span> in a scene where his character, Ethan Hunt, had to unlock a hatch while swirling around a giant server-cooling tank. And that scene only came about after Cruise filmed <em>Edge of Tomorrow</em>, for which McQuarrie helped write the script, which ends with his character diving underwater beneath the Louvre Pyramid in Paris to kill a giant alien.</p><p><em>The Final Reckoning </em>hits theaters in just a few weeks on May 23, and brings with it a lot of questions beyond whether Cruise and the franchise still have new tricks up their sleeves. For one, there’s the question of how the movie will make good on the many callbacks to earlier entries in the franchise teased in the trailers, and what it will tell us about how Hunt came to join the IMF in the first place, a plot thread hinted at in <em>Dead Reckoning</em>. The biggest question of all, though, is whether this will be Cruise’s last<em> Mission: Impossible</em> movie. Given his obsession with movies, Hollywood, and his own legacy at the box office, I somehow doubt it. At least as long as<em> Final Reckoning </em>does better than its predecessor. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Yeah, weird stuff. The game got a sequel in 1994, which (spoilers) ended with Ecco getting access to a time machine and leaving for some unknown point in history. While the games were odd, they had a lot of fans and now the creator behind them, Ed Annunziata, has shared that remasters of those games are on the way, along with a new sequel. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/05/xbox-asian-pacific-islander-heritage-month-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a May 5 interview with Xbox</a></span>, Annunziata talked about his inspiration for creating Ecco and then gave a small tease for the future of the franchise, telling fans to “stay tuned” and further explaining: “Me and the entire original team are going to remaster the original <em>Ecco the Dolphin </em>and <em>Tides of Time</em> games. Then we will make a new, third game with contemporary play and GPU sensibilities.”</p><p>In the interview, Annunziata encouraged fans of the franchise to visit <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eccothedolphin.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eccothedolphin.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EccoTheDolphin.​com</a></span>. You might be expecting a teaser or perhaps a bit more info about these upcoming remasters and the next game in the <em>Ecco</em> series. Well,  there’s nothing like that on the site. Instead, if you head over there you’ll be greeted by a countdown clock that won’t hit 0 for another 8,528 hours or about 355 days, also known as basically a full year. </p><p>I’ve seen video game marketing countdown clocks before, but usually they’re for a week or two at the most. More often it’s just for a few days. The idea of doing a one-year countdown clock for remasters of <em>Ecco the Dolphin</em> is wild. I mean, I guess it worked because you’re reading a blog about the countdown clock and the remasters right now. But I’m not sure this fanbase has the energy to be excited for a year. Anyway, hopefully I’ll be back in 350 days or so to share  a cool trailer for <em>Ecco The Dolphin Remastered</em>. See you then! </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Bungie’s extraction shooter didn’t really win me over, but each time I booted it up I was greeted by a PlayStation Studios logo, as the former <em>Halo </em>maker is now owned by PlayStation. This was odd to see on my Xbox, but it didn’t stand out too much. But <em>Gears of War </em>on PlayStation is so bizarre. It’s one of Xbox’s big three:<em> Forza, Halo, Gears</em>. Now only one of them remains truly Xbox only. </p><p><em>Gears </em>on PS5 is the kind of weird idea that, a decade ago or more, you’d hear someone suggest and you’d laugh at. Like some random, clueless analyst pondering when Mario will arrive on Xbox. Never gonna happen dude, don’t you know anything? I remember being a younger lad and being one of the few people at my middle school to own an Xbox. They all had PlayStation 3s. They all were jealous of <em>Gears of War</em>. Some of them would tell me that <em>Gears </em>was coming to PS3 one day. And <em>Halo</em>. I’d shake my head. I knew better. I read all the gaming magazines of the day. I scrolled through gaming forums and consumed <em>GameSpot </em>articles. They were wrong. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-ps3-version-of-gears-of-war-3-is-now-available-1846937357&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-ps3-version-of-gears-of-war-3-is-now-available-1846937357"><em>Gears of War</em> would <em><strong>never </strong></em>be on a PlayStation console</a></span>. Well, turns out they were right, they were just about 18 years ahead of the schedule.</p><p> So while I understand the business reasons for <em>Gears </em>coming to PlayStation and I’ve seen plenty of other Xbox-published games arrive on non-Xbox consoles, it’s all still very weird for me to watch. I’ll probably have to sit down when I see the news of <em>Halo </em>on PS5. At least more people will now have access to more games. That’s cool, even if younger me would never have believed any of this was possible. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, due to some changes HBO has made to the story of <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>in adapting it for television, long-time fans think one character might have successfully evaded the chopping block here after meeting a gruesome end in the game. At least, they’re hoping so.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197551" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Minecraft Movie Song Sets Record as Shortest Track Ever on Billboard Hot 100" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="197551,197550,197547" data-current="197551"><div><p>Minecraft Movie Song Sets Record as Shortest Track Ever on Billboard Hot 100</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197551/197551_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197551/197551_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197551/197551_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23075.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Shimmer is Ellie’s horse in <em>The Last of Us</em>, both in the show and in <em>Part II </em>of the game. The trusty steed helps get our heroine from the small town of Jackson to the warzone of Seattle. However, in one of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>’s most shocking moments, while on horseback the player is forced to accidentally trigger an explosive barricade set up by the W.L.F. A member of the militia is kind enough to put her out of her misery after the blast, but then captures Ellie for questioning. It’s a brutal scene, and it’s even worse when you don’t know it’s coming.</p><p>As such, people watching the <em>Last of Us </em>show after playing the game have been bracing themselves for this week’s episode, as this would have been the one in which Shimmer kicked the bucket in a more faithful retelling. However, as of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-us-season-2-episode-4-dina-ellie-isaac-seraphite-1851779062&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-us-season-2-episode-4-dina-ellie-isaac-seraphite-1851779062">episode four</a></span>, Shimmer is just vibing in an abandoned record shop, presumably safe from any landmines, infected, or any other danger. Homegirl is living her best life free of worry. So is Shimmer safe from the horrors of Ellie’s revenge tour? A lot can happen in the three episodes left of the season, but fans are crossing all their fingers and toes.</p><p>It’s probably not gonna undo the collective trauma of watching Pedro Pascal get murdered via golf club, but hey, we take the wins where we can get them. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But if it’s bad now, just wait until May 30 when Destined Rivals is officially released.</p><p>Journey Together should have been the very exciting return of Trainer Pokémon to the card game but instead proved rather flat, failing to significantly shake up the format. But it seems this was just a tentative toe poked into the waters, because this month we’re getting Destined Rivals, which not only enormously elaborates on the range of Trainer Pokémon, but also reintroduces Team Rocket to the TCG for the first time in 25 years. And yes, that means there’s a Giovanni’s Mewtwo, and yes, it’s already at a colossal price in Japan.</p><p>The full official English-language line-up has yet to be revealed, but The Pokémon Company has shown a fair few, a bunch more have appeared in Spanish, and there are many more we know are coming from the Japanese set. So based on all of this, we’ve put together the most anticipated cards that’ll be included in Destined Rivals (not to be confused with the <em>Black &amp; White: Rival Destinies</em> anime).</p><p>It’s going to be tough to find them on sale, but it’s worth knowing that pre-release events take place  on May 17—definitely check to see if your local specialist store has tickets. Scalpers can’t abuse this, because to get your packs you need to open and play with them!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ab75a1b9c52b396491039bdcea5b11da" data-recommend-id="image://ab75a1b9c52b396491039bdcea5b11da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Ariana" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Ariana" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ab75a1b9c52b396491039bdcea5b11da" data-recommend-id="image://ab75a1b9c52b396491039bdcea5b11da" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Ariana" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While Supporter card Ariana is hardly groundbreaking (it allows you to draw cards until you have five in your hand, or eight if all your benched Pokémon are Team Rocket Pokémon), the art here really is. The Japanese version of the set contains three of these Team Rocket Supporter full-art cards, along with Giovanni and Ethan, and all three look highly collectible, but this Ariana is the sort of profile work you almost never see in the TCG.</p><p>It’s selling for about $35 in Japan, but I suspect the U.S. version will fetch much higher prices.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2d238b62341e7f075b4ea7dd4bd05be4" data-recommend-id="image://2d238b62341e7f075b4ea7dd4bd05be4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Ho-Oh" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Ho-Oh" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2d238b62341e7f075b4ea7dd4bd05be4" data-recommend-id="image://2d238b62341e7f075b4ea7dd4bd05be4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Ho-Oh" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Kotaku</em>’s own Ethan has a high showing in this set, starting off with these two versions of the Ho-Oh ex. Both are absolutely stunning cards in dramatically different ways, and my guess is that the version on the right may fetch around $150 when it launches. There will also be a gold version of this card, and I’ll be curious to see if it generates interest.</p><p>It’s also a hell of a card, given you can use it to load up all your Ethan Pokémon with energy each turn, and  when in the Active Spot it’ll deal out a massive 160 damage, while healing <em>every single one</em> of your Pokémon in play by 50. I think there are going to be a lot of Ethan-based decks coming soon.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3f7c9ff141efeb2b981d2808d9d86910" data-recommend-id="image://3f7c9ff141efeb2b981d2808d9d86910" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3f7c9ff141efeb2b981d2808d9d86910" data-recommend-id="image://3f7c9ff141efeb2b981d2808d9d86910" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Stick Typhlosion in that deck too, and you can deliver two very powerful attacks. Once it’s evolved, it’ll do 40 damage for just one energy, but then add on another 60 damage for every Ethan’s Adventure card in your discard pile.</p><p>But clearly I’m including this one for the <em>spectacular</em> artwork. What an absolute beauty. In Japan, the big money cards are mostly Team Rocket, but I think this looks good enough that it’ll fetch a hefty resell value on its own merits.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="246c8cb36fd34c96e8e482afadf06fc6" data-recommend-id="image://246c8cb36fd34c96e8e482afadf06fc6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Adventure" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Adventure" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="246c8cb36fd34c96e8e482afadf06fc6" data-recommend-id="image://246c8cb36fd34c96e8e482afadf06fc6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Adventure" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Ethan, of course from Gen 2's <em>Pokémon Gold</em> and <em>Silver</em>, has a fair few cards in the set, including starter Cyndaquil, Magcargo, and the mighty Pichu. All three are celebrated in this outlandishly lovely card, Ethan’s Adventure.</p><p>The card itself helps you fetch Ethan’s Pokémon from your deck, of course going into your discard pile at the same time in order to power up Typhlosion.</p><p>But, also, look how flipping cute this is!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="aa1c31e4e0fed45bafcb42b5c811ddf7" data-recommend-id="image://aa1c31e4e0fed45bafcb42b5c811ddf7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Misty’s Pysduck" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Misty’s Pysduck" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aa1c31e4e0fed45bafcb42b5c811ddf7" data-recommend-id="image://aa1c31e4e0fed45bafcb42b5c811ddf7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Misty’s Pysduck" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Cough. Yes, obviously this card’s going to do well. Everyone loves Misty, some rather too much, and here she is in her swimming cozzie. It does help that it’s also a completely lovely piece of art, with Psyduck looking so cute.</p><p>The Japanese version, from Heat Wave Arena, seems to sell for around $26, which is incredibly low. I imagine it’ll be double that in English by this time next month.</p><p>Its ability allows you to discard the bottom card of your deck, and then when done, discard any cards attached to the Psyduck and put the card back on the top of your own deck. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="05c1c24d0e933b357c989ba0f64bc70b" data-recommend-id="image://05c1c24d0e933b357c989ba0f64bc70b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Crobat ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Crobat ex" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="05c1c24d0e933b357c989ba0f64bc70b" data-recommend-id="image://05c1c24d0e933b357c989ba0f64bc70b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Crobat ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Team Rocket and Crobat are old friends, so this is no surprise. But wowsers, what a card. It looks stunning. </p><p>It helps that when you first evolve to it, you can put 20 damage on your opponent’s Stage 2 cards. Then, when you use it to do that 120 attack, you have the option to return it to your hand. Oh, and the 310 HP is ludicrous.</p><p>This is the third-highest-selling card from Japan’s The Glory of Team Rocket set, currently selling for around $120.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="14b162d42a03d11a43a3396ecd588a9c" data-recommend-id="image://14b162d42a03d11a43a3396ecd588a9c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Meowth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Meowth" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="14b162d42a03d11a43a3396ecd588a9c" data-recommend-id="image://14b162d42a03d11a43a3396ecd588a9c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Meowth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Look at Giovanni! He’s so cute! That’s definitely not right. I love it.</p><p>Meowth is, of course, a Team Rocket fixture, and it’s great to see him hanging out with the boss rather than Jessie or James.</p><p>Here, Meowth is his usual mischievous self, the first “attack” letting you pick a card at random from your opponent’s hand, look at it, and then have it shuffled back into their deck.</p><p>The second is a triple-coin toss, with 20 damage per heads flipped.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="60e2b6405fe6c81d9ef930db016714fc" data-recommend-id="image://60e2b6405fe6c81d9ef930db016714fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Moltres ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Moltres ex" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="60e2b6405fe6c81d9ef930db016714fc" data-recommend-id="image://60e2b6405fe6c81d9ef930db016714fc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Moltres ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Moltres is always an incredibly popular card (although it seems to only ever hit the ridiculous money when it also features Zapdos and Articuno, which this does not). Add that to a Team Rocket special, then combine with this astonishing piece of art, and you have a total banger.</p><p>The Japanese version is already fetching $190 for U.S. buyers, so expect this card to go stellar. I wouldn’t be surprised to see $250, unless it ends up being used as a promo. </p><p>That 110 attack also reduces damage from the next incoming attack by 50, but that’s as nothing compared to its four-energy move. Here, if you have a Team Rocket Energy card attached to it, you discard that energy, causing your opponent’s active Pokémon to be instantly discarded too! It’s a one-hit kill, and you can keep the card in play!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ac61be11ab88e94798fe212cddf9b262" data-recommend-id="image://ac61be11ab88e94798fe212cddf9b262" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cynthia’s Garchomp ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cynthia’s Garchomp ex" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ac61be11ab88e94798fe212cddf9b262" data-recommend-id="image://ac61be11ab88e94798fe212cddf9b262" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cynthia’s Garchomp ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>This is the top-selling card in Japan’s Heat Wave Arena, and currently sells in the U.S. for over $230. That seems likely to spike an awful lot higher come June, and given the mediocrity of it as an ex card in play, we can likely put this down to the rarity and the spectacular artwork.</p><p>A 100 damage attack for one energy is amazing, and 260 for two energy is bonkers (even if you do have to discard it all), but given this is a Stage 2 evolution, it’s not going to be super-easy to get into play.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="26d5041beb73ef712e01947e3316fe56" data-recommend-id="image://26d5041beb73ef712e01947e3316fe56" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="26d5041beb73ef712e01947e3316fe56" data-recommend-id="image://26d5041beb73ef712e01947e3316fe56" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>OK, this is the big one. It’s Giovanni, it’s Mewtwo, it’s sending everyone crazy. Prices are still climbing for the Japanese version out of The Glory of Team Rocket, at the time of writing sitting at $435.</p><p>Personally, I’m not a fan  of the art here. Neither the style nor the composition. But then, hey, when I pull it I won’t mind parting with it for the big cash! It’s hard to say how big Destined Rivals is going to be, but if it’s as daft as I’m suspecting, I wouldn’t be surprised to see this hitting $600.</p><p>It’s a tricky card to play, however, with a sort of reverse-ability. An inability, if you will. You need at least three other Team Rocket Pokémon in play to even be able to use its attacks, which means it’s only going to work in decks built around the troublesome gang, and then you’ll depend on the draw.</p><p>However, in return you get a heck of an attack for a Basic card. Mewtwo delivers 160 damage as a base, but that can go up to a whopping 280 if you also discard two energy cards from your benched Pokémon.</p><hr><p>There are a whole bunch of other spectacular pieces of art in our combination of the two Japanese sets (plus some other leftovers), and we’ll properly get into celebrating them once the set’s released and we’ve got all the cards in English.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
