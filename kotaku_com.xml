            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The market for home speakers is full of great options from Sonos, Bose and Samsung – all of them offering solid audio quality and smart features to merit their pricing. However, if you need a high-end speaker that doubles as a conversation piece through distinctive retro aesthetics inspired by classic guitar amplifiers, nobody pulls this vision off better than Marshall.</p>
<p>The iconic brand has successfully translated their <strong>legendary amplifier design language into Bluetooth speakers</strong> that look like miniature versions of the amps that powered rock history.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4526/"> At $179, down from $299, the Acton III has reached an all-time low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday and delivers on that signature Marshall sound that made them legends in professional audio.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4526/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Re-Engineered Soundstage</h2>
<p>The third-generation design expands the <strong>stereo soundstage beyond earlier Acton models</strong> through revised driver placement and acoustic tuning that creates wider sound dispersion throughout your listening space. This engineering delivers immersive audio where instruments and vocals occupy distinct positions across the sound field rather than collapsing into a narrow center channel.</p>
<p>The Marshall signature sound <strong>emphasizes clarity across all frequencies while maintaining the punchy, dynamic character</strong> that made their amplifiers famous among musicians who demanded both power and precision. Rock, jazz, classical, and electronic music all benefit from the balanced frequency response that doesn’t sacrifice detail for overwhelming bass or harsh treble.</p>



<p>Futureproofing is in-built into the speaker <strong>with the next-generation Bluetooth 5.2 implementation</strong>&nbsp;which supports emerging features and codecs the moment they become widely available instead of requiring hardware replacement to access new standards. This forward compatibility matters because Bluetooth audio technology continues evolving with improved codecs, lower latency protocols, and enhanced multi-device handling that will roll out over the useful life of this speaker.</p>
<p>Compared to older versions of Bluetooth, the improved connection stability reduces dropouts and interference from competing wireless signals in crowded home environments full of Wi-Fi routers, smart home devices, and neighboring networks. Traditional <strong>wired connection fallback via 3.5mm auxiliary input is available</strong> for devices without Bluetooth and for situations where you prefer avoiding wireless compression altogether.</p>



<p>It’s a pretty straightforward pairing process that eliminates complicated app requirements or multi-step configuration sequences which frustrate users who want to play music quickly: Press the Bluetooth button, select it from your phone’s Bluetooth menu, and y<strong>ou’re playing audio within seconds of taking it out of the box</strong>. This extends into daily use, where the speaker remembers previously paired devices and automatically reconnects when they come in range, rather than having to repeat the pairing every time you want to listen to something. <strong>The speaker has tactile, analog controls</strong> at the top that allow very satisfying physical interaction when adjusting the volume, bass, and treble-a feeling more engaging than simply tapping on glass touchscreens or issuing voice commands.</p>
<p>The Marshall Acton III brings re-engineered stereo soundstage at $179, a discount of 40% off retail this Black Friday. The competitive home speaker market offers many excellent audio options, but Marshall’s distinctive design and rock heritage create an emotional appeal that technical specifications just can’t provide.</p>

              <p data-start="0" data-end="519">LEGO is a timeless toy that continues to capture the hearts of people of all ages. It’s not just for kids. Anyone with a sense of nostalgia or creativity can dive into the fun. LEGO has a vast array of collaborations with different fandoms, and perhaps one of its most popular partnerships is with Marvel. Among the many sets inspired by the Marvel universe is one based on the most iconic scene from the second film in Sam Raimi’s Spider-Man trilogy, and its now available at a discounted price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5197/">This particular LEGO set of the Spider-Man vs. Doc Ock subway train showdown typically sells for $55, but it’s currently on sale for 20% off, bringing the price down to $44</a>. This price drop makes it a great deal for any LEGO fan or Spider-Man enthusiast looking to recreate one of the most memorable moments from the early 2000s Spider-Man films.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5197/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="519">Most Iconic&nbsp;Spider-Man Moment</h2>
<p data-start="867" data-end="1630">If you were a teenager during the mid-2000s, you probably fondly remember <em data-start="941" data-end="955">Spider-Man 2</em>, the sequel to the 2002 blockbuster. The movie remains a fan favorite and is often cited as the best of the trilogy and even all the Spider-Man film adaptations. Spoilers for <em>Spider-Man 2</em> I guess&nbsp; but, for many, the standout scene from this movie is the subway sequence, where Tobey Maguire’s Spider-Man must save a runaway train from crashing. In this scene, Spider-Man, after losing his mask, uses his webs to slow down the train, and in the end, the New York City passengers agree to keep his identity a secret.</p>
<p data-start="1632" data-end="2357">The LEGO set that pays tribute to this unforgettable scene contains 393 pieces and includes not only a detailed train model but also four minifigures: Spider-Man, Doc Ock, J. Jonah Jameson, and Aunt May. Spider-Man comes with two interchangeable heads—one masked and one unmasked—so you can replicate the scene exactly as it happened. The set also features Doc Ock with his four mechanical arms, which are adjustable and can be posed in a variety of ways. Two of the arms are equipped with laser beams, while the other two can attach to the train to create that intense showdown. Though not actually present during this scene in the movie, J. Jonah Jameson and Aunt May are included just to fill out the set. I guess they’re more recognizable than the kid who returns Peter’s mask.</p>


<p data-start="2359" data-end="2692">The completed set measures over 3 inches high, 9 inches long, and 2 inches wide, making it a perfect size to display once you’ve finished building it. The roof of the train is removable, allowing you to take a closer look at the interior details, which is a nice touch.</p>
<p data-start="3194" data-end="3606" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Whether you’re a Spider-Man fan or simply someone who love to collect LEGO, this set offers a great way to relive a classic moment from the <em data-start="3324" data-end="3338">Spider-Man 2</em> movie. And with the current discount, you can save $11 when bringing home this piece of cinematic history.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Insta360 Shows No Mercy on X5, 360° 8K Action Cam Now Selling for Less Than Basic Action Cams]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/insta360-shows-no-mercy-on-x5-360-8k-action-cam-now-selling-for-less-than-basic-action-cams-2000647178</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/insta360-shows-no-mercy-on-x5-360%C2%B0-8k-action-cam-now-selling-for-less-than-basic-action-cams.1363939/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Insta360 has stolen market share from GoPro and DJI in recent years as it transformed from an upstart challenger into the definitive action camera brand that content creators and adventure people reach for first. It’s been the combination of innovative <strong>360-degree capture, AI-powered editing and useful features</strong> like the invisible selfie stick effect that positioned Insta360 as the company pushing boundaries while established competitors iterated incrementally.</p>
<p>The X5 launched in April as its feature-packed flagship model justifying the premium positioning, but this Black Friday brings the first significant discount: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5767/">At $464, down from $549, this 8K 360-degree camera has hit a record-low price</a> on Amazon and delivers everything that made Insta360 the action camera leader.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5767/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>8K Resolution That Captures Everything</h2>
<p>The dual 1/1.28-inch sensors work together to <strong>capture 8K resolution at 30fps across the full 360-degree field of view</strong> for footage that has incredible detail and survives aggressive cropping and reframing in post with ease. This resolution counts because 360-degree cameras need excess capture area so you can choose your framing after the fact rather than commit to an angle at the time of recording. These larger sensors also improve on low-light performance, color accuracy, and dynamic range compared to the smaller sensors on competing action cameras and turn out footage that looks professional.</p>



<p>This game-changing, t<strong>riple AI chip design distributes processing across specialized silicon for real-time noise reduction, image processing, and AI-assisted features</strong> – all operating concurrently without thermal throttling or performance compromise. But this architecture really lets you fly when shooting in tough low-light conditions that leave competitors’ cameras producing unusable grainy footage, delivering clean video even during those golden hours, indoor scenes, or nighttime adventures. Advanced features such as auto subject-tracking, horizon leveling, and smart reframing-all using AI to analyze 360-degree footage for ideal crop point suggestions that capture the action-are powered by onboard AI processing.</p>
<p>The<strong> invisible selfie stick effect is Insta360’s signature feature</strong> which creates impossible third-person perspectives that make it seem like a drone or cameraman is following you. It captures 360 degrees of everything, including the extended selfie stick, which the stitching algorithm intelligently removes from the final footage via geometric analysis and image processing. That gives you the cinematic shots you dream of: a floating camera tracking your movements in places that feel professionally filmed but are completely self-operated.</p>



<p><em>FlowState</em> stabilization combined with 360-degree Horizon Lock eliminates the need for gimbals through computational stabilization, analyzing motion and then correcting it through post-processing. Stabilization handles aggressive movements, bumps, crashes, and full camera rotations while maintaining level, smooth footage that looks professionally stabilized. The horizon lock specifically ensures the horizon line stays perfectly level regardless of how the camera tumbles or rotates during action sequences, preventing the disorienting tilted footage that ruins otherwise great action shots.</p>
<p>The replaceable lens system is a practical innovation in itself as it protects your investment by allowing quick lens swaps the moment scratches, cracks, or damage occur. Traditional action cameras require expensive repairs or an outright replacement when lenses get damaged in crashes, drops, or impacts that inevitably occur during action sports. The <strong>X5’s lenses detach and replace in mere seconds</strong> without requiring tools, thus enabling one to take spare lenses along on extended trips or adventures where lens damage becomes likely.</p>
<p>The <strong>advanced 4-microphone array</strong> captures clearer audio by first reducing the amount of wind interference that usually ruins action camera soundtracks. It does this through several microphones placed strategically around the camera body, combined with AI processing that identifies and suppresses wind noise while preserving voice and ambient sounds.</p>
<p>At $464, the Insta360 X5 brings 8K 360-degree video, triple AI chip processing, invisible selfie stick compatibility, FlowState stabilization, replaceable lenses, and enhanced wind reduction at 15% off retail this Black Friday. Insta360 remains the market leader over GoPro and DJI not because of incremental spec bumps but rather through relentless innovation in features that actually matter to content creators.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dell Clears Out the 2025 Laptop at 80% Off as Remaining Stock Runs Low, Redragon Wireless Keyboard and Mouse Included]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-shaves-a-whopping-80-off-the-15-inch-dell-inspiron-3530-but-the-discount-ends-soon-2000647081</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell-clears-out-the-2025-laptop-at-80-off-as-remaining-stock-runs-low-redragon-wireless-keyboard-and-mouse-included.1363936/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Now is a great time to upgrade your tech for less. Black Friday is just around the corner, and early deals are coming in hot. Those looking to grab a new laptop this shopping season, whether for themselves or a loved one, should consider bagging the heavily discounted 15-inch Dell Inspiron 3530 at Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5915/">This machine typically retails for around $4,000, but Amazon is offering it at a whopping 80% discount, which brings the down to just $798.</a> And as if that wasn’t enough, the retailer is also throwing in a Redragon keyboard and mouse kit for absolutely nothing. Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, too, so you’re saving on that front as well.</p>
<p>The only catch? This deal, at the time of writing, is only available to Prime members. Non-Prime members will still see it at its normal, not-so-friendly $4,000 tag. That said, if you’re planning to shop heavy during the main event, now is a good time to jump on a Prime membership. It lets you enjoy fast, free shipping with your purchases, access member-only deals, and unlock early discounts. The retailer offers a 30-day free trial to new users. After that, you can expect to pay around $15 a month.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5915/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Complete, Ready-to-Go Setup</h2>
<p>In a fairly minimal design, the laptop offers a 15.6-inch Full HD IPS touchscreen. 220 nits of brightness push clear, vibrant visuals, while the anti-glare coating keeps reflections at bay. Touch support makes navigation a breeze. Not in the mood to use the trackpad or drag the mouse around? Just use your fingers directly on the screen to perform tasks. Pinch for a wider view, stretch to zoom in, swipe away, scroll long documents, or maybe use the on-screen keyboard to take notes; the possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>Just above the screen is a solid 720p HD webcam that makes it easy to catch up with friends and hop on meetings without needing an external camera.</p>
<p>This machine runs on the updated 10-core Intel Core i5-1334U processor, which handles both everyday school and work tasks like a pro. The chip is paired with a massive 32GB DDR4 RAM for snappier multitasking, and a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD for quicker boot times. You’ll be able to perform a whole bunch of tasks (researching, writing, taking video calls) simultaneously without a hint of lag, which makes the laptop ideal for creatives who need to hop through different programs at the same time. The 1TB SSD provides plenty of space to store your important data, whether it’s hundreds of photos, a ton of videos, or unusually large research papers. The capacity should be enough for most users out there, unless you’re looking to house ever-growing libraries of media files without relying on external solutions.</p>



<p>Connectivity options are plenty. You’ll enjoy a stable, wireless connection with WiFi 6 and Bluetooth, plus be able to connect a range of external peripherals using the built-in ports. Speaking of peripherals, the free kit gets you a solid Redragon laptop keyboard and mouse. The former is quite lightweight and comes with detachable keys. The mouse has a sturdy feel, and is quite comfortable to use for longer sessions.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, meaning you don’t have to worry about any complicated installation procedures to get started. Microsoft has loaded the operating system with a bunch of useful productivity and security features that are ideal for remote workers, business owners, creatives, and even students. Just note that Microsoft Office isn’t included, and you will need to purchase it separately later if needed.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5915/">Overall, the Dell Inspiron 15 3530 touchscreen laptop is a great option to consider for both work and play, especially at its current price. You’re saving more than $3,200 on this powerhouse.</a> Grab the deal before it’s too late.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-xm6-headphones-drop-lower-than-expected-for-black-friday-as-amazon-clears-the-warehouse-2000647074</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-xm6-headphones-hit-an-all-time-low-for-black-friday-as-amazon-clears-the-warehouse.1363900/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="304">Music truly comes to life when you experience it with a high-quality pair of headphones. One of the best in the market today is Sony’s flagship noise-canceling model, the WH-1000XM5. Known for their exceptional sound and comfort, these headphones offer a premium listening experience that’s hard to match. Currently, they’re available at a great price as one of Amazon’s early Black Friday deals, with discount of $62 off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/">Normally priced at $460, the platinum silver, black, and midnight blue versions are now reduced by 13%, bringing them down to just $398.</a></p>
<p data-start="685" data-end="1266">I must applaud Sony on what they’ve done here. When we look at the naming schemes for Sony’s competitors in the space, we find products like the Apple AirPods Max or the Samsung Galaxy Buds. These catchy, memorable names tie in neatly with their companies’ broader product lineups.</p>
<p data-start="685" data-end="1266">Then we have Sony. This brand decided to go with the WH-1000XM6. This assortment of letters and numbers give little indication they represent a pair noise-cancelling wireless headphones aside from the WH. This is less a product name and more an internal SKU number, and I find that just beautiful. These headphones don’t need some flashy name. The headphones speak for themselves.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="685" data-end="1266">Cancel Out the World Around You</h2>
<p data-start="1268" data-end="1700">A standout feature of the WH-1000XM6 is their exceptional noise-canceling capabilities. Sony has designed these headphones with advanced processors and twelve microphones that work together to detect and counteract external sounds. This advanced noise-canceling technology creates a completely immersive listening experience, allowing you to enjoy your music, podcast, or audiobook without the distractions of the outside world.</p>
<p data-start="1702" data-end="2038">The noise cancellation is especially noticeable (or maybe unnoticeable?) during phone calls. Thanks to the built-in microphones, your voice is isolated and amplified—even in noisy environments. Whether you’re in a crowded café or a busy office, the person on the other end of the call will hear you clearly, with no background noise to disrupt the conversation.</p>


<p data-start="2040" data-end="2685">In terms of comfort, the WH-1000XM6 excels. The headphones are wrapped in soft, synthetic leather, making them feel plush and comfortable against your ears, even during extended listening sessions. They’re lightweight too, which means you can wear them for hours without feeling fatigued. In fact, with an impressive 30-hour battery life, you can listen to music or take calls throughout the day without worrying about recharging. And if you do forget to charge them, don’t stress. A quick three-minute charge will give you an additional three hours of playback—enough to get you through the rest of your commute or the next leg of your journey.</p>
<p data-start="2687" data-end="3100" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Whether you’re a music lover, a podcast enthusiast, or someone who just wants to enjoy a quiet moment in a noisy world, these headphones are an excellent choice. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5917/">With the current discounts of $62 off, there’s no better time to grab a pair of the Sony WH-1000XM6 headphones and experience their next-level audio quality.</a></p>
