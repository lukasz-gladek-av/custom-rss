              <p>Looking to grab a new laptop, but don‚Äôt want to drain your savings doing it? You‚Äôre in luck because Dell has an incredible deal running on one of its most versatile models right now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4951/">The 15.6-inch Dell Vostro laptop is currently sitting at $600 on Amazon, a massive 70% off its usual price.</a></p>
<p>You‚Äôre saving almost $1,400 on a machine that is powerful enough to handle both work and play well. Of course, deals like this don‚Äôt stick around for long, so we recommend acting fast to get your orders in before it expires or the stock runs out for good.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4951/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Premium Finish, Powerful Specs</h2>
<p>This sleek laptop flaunts a matte finish for that classic, premium look. The screen is a 15.6-inch Full HD display that pushes brilliant, sharp visuals while keeping them easier on the eyes. You‚Äôre getting narrow borders for a larger screen real estate, plus a 120Hz refresh rate that keeps everything smooth, even when you‚Äôre playing fast-paced games. The keyboard is also full-sized, featuring a 10-key numeric keypad. Typing for longer hours is going to be comfortable; just note that it‚Äôs not backlit.</p>
<p>For power, you have a 13th Gen Intel 5-core processor that outperforms older chips like the i5-1145G. It‚Äôs made for resource-intensive tasks, so working with heavier apps and pushing some creative boundaries won‚Äôt be an issue. Pair that with 32GB of DDR4 RAM, and you‚Äôve got yourself a full-fledged multitasking companion that‚Äôs ready to take on your most productive, busiest days. There‚Äôs a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD storage built in. This is enough space to house all your important data, media content, and even games. SSD is also much faster than HDD, so you can expect significantly faster boot times than traditional drives.</p>



<p>Connectivity options include Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, plus a ton of ports to connect all your essentials. These include USB 2.0, USB 3.2 Gen 1, USB 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C (data only), HDMI 1.4, SD 3.0 card slot, headset jack, and a Flip-Down RJ-45 Ethernet port. The machine runs on Windows 11 Pro, which is one of the most user-friendly operating systems out there, whether you‚Äôre planning to use it for work, studies, or streaming.</p>
<p>Altogether, this is a great chance to grab this powerful laptop for significantly less. Just be sure to grab the deal quickly, as it might wrap up soon. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4951/">We don‚Äôt expect to see another one this massive before Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</a></p>

              <p>If you play <i>Counter-Strike 2</i> and enjoy trading skins for financial gain, you‚Äôre either real happy right now or, um, quite the opposite. Valve recently pushed an update to the game‚Äôs controversial marketplace that appears to have wildly shifted the value of some folks‚Äô inventories, gutting the worth of some players‚Äô stockpiles of skins while skyrocketing that of others. It‚Äôs <a href="https://x.com/pricempire/status/1981369304252645391">a dramatic shift</a> triggering a $1.75 billion decrease in value to the market.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The CS2 skins market cap lost $1.75 BILLION following the Knife Trade Up update‚ÄºÔ∏è <a href="https://t.co/wHPCF9wfGq">pic.twitter.com/wHPCF9wfGq</a></p> <p>‚Äî Pricempire.com (@pricempire) <a href="https://twitter.com/pricempire/status/1981296976487452888?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>In an update that makes an otherwise ordinary <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/730/view/516350567072662004?l=english">assortment of tweaks</a>, Valve altered the way <i>Counter-Strike</i>‚Äôs skin game works (<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fps/counter-strike-2-community-left-in-shambles-along-with-steam-marketplace-after-valves-new-trade-up-update-turns-usd10-skins-into-usd1-000-skins-and-vice-versa-this-update-has-made-some-collectors-very-rich/">h/t <i>GamesRadar</i></a>). The update allows folks to ‚Äútrade up‚Äù what were previously seen as borderline worthless cosmetics, referred to as ‚Äúred‚Äù by the community. These skins were previously worth around $10, but as of the new changes, folks can trade them up for skins worth four digits. That‚Äôs quite the shift.</p>

 <p>Turmoil ensued as these changes rocked the skin market. <a href="https://x.com/ThatBoyAqua/status/1981167900900909382">One player lost $1400</a> ‚Äúin the span of 30 minutes‚Äù as the changes mucked up the value of their inventory. Of course, as such things go, others gained a ton of money, <a href="https://x.com/Serifaz_/status/1981167366689222980">sharing screenshots</a> of the massive jump in value of their inventory.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">*formerly $10 skins lmao <a href="https://t.co/XeBcWqJ03O">pic.twitter.com/XeBcWqJ03O</a></p> <p>‚Äî Serifaz üå∏ (@Serifaz_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Serifaz_/status/1981167366689222980?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>‚ÄúAt this point just go and gamble at a casino üòÇ‚Äù reads another post.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-patrick-star-jokes-2000636057"><span>Mega Starmie</span></a><span>, my new sleep paralysis demon, started out as one of the most disappointing Mega Evolutions introduced in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>. The ethereal, alien-like starfish is one of the original 151 Pok√©mon and a longtime favorite among many fans. Folks had been asking Game Freak for a Mega Evolution for years, and numerous cool fan art concepts have been circulating on the internet for a long time, dating back to before </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>was announced. What we got, however, is one of the goofiest-looking new forms in the game, one that many deemed unfitting of the original Pok√©mon‚Äôs mysterious design. However, after a lot of immediate backlash, Mega Starmie has reached the ‚Äúso bad it‚Äôs good‚Äù status that Game Freak probably intended.</span></p>   <p><span>Mega Starmie‚Äôs big change is that it grows in size and its extremities become long enough that it can imitate human movement. So this gorgeous, jewel-wearing starfish turns into a freaky gremlin that runs around the battlefield like it‚Äôs in a Hanna Barbera cartoon. I admit, I hated its design when I first saw it. I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôd say I‚Äôve come around on it, but I can‚Äôt deny that it was an absolute beast during my playthrough that wiped the floor with so many of my foes‚Äô teams. It was helpful that when it underwent this transformation, it was able to use its creepy-crawly legs to get across the battlefield more quickly, since its slow movement speed is one of its standard form‚Äôs weaknesses. And now that the initial shock is wearing off, players are starting to see the absurdity of Mega Starmie as endearing instead. It‚Äôs a meme Pok√©mon, but its human-like proportions have made it easy to graft onto just about anything.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Mega Starmie containment breach<br>made in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/blender?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#blender</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/b3d?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#b3d</a> <a href="https://t.co/AjcGqSD01j">pic.twitter.com/AjcGqSD01j</a></p> <p>‚Äî cgchefs (@cgchefs) <a href="https://twitter.com/cgchefs/status/1979677950598643881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">When the fajitas come out sizzlin <a href="https://t.co/fq3ASwVALs">pic.twitter.com/fq3ASwVALs</a></p> <p>‚Äî DOMROM (@DomRomArt) <a href="https://twitter.com/DomRomArt/status/1980829381846298962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">„ÄåÂæÖ„Å°„Å™„Åï„ÅÅÔΩû„ÅÑÔºÅ„Äç <a href="https://t.co/FRcVlWBiRE">pic.twitter.com/FRcVlWBiRE</a></p> <p>‚Äî „ÅÑ„Å®„Åü (@itota_art) <a href="https://twitter.com/itota_art/status/1980605381534777800?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="und" dir="ltr">Gm! <a href="https://t.co/8fnH1M7heO">pic.twitter.com/8fnH1M7heO</a></p> <p>‚Äî Pok√©mon Daily Postüí´ (@PokeDailyPost) <a href="https://twitter.com/PokeDailyPost/status/1980544589908844591?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>    <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">ÂÖ•Êµ¥‰∏≠„ÅÆ„É°„Ç¨„Çπ„Çø„Éº„Éü„Éº„ÅÆ„É©„ÉÜ„Ç¢„Éº„Éà<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/pokemon_LA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#pokemon_LA</a> <a href="https://t.co/5sZJF12j8R">pic.twitter.com/5sZJF12j8R</a></p> <p>‚Äî „Åò„Çá„Éº„Åò (@george_10g) <a href="https://twitter.com/george_10g/status/1979868926919291357?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>    <p><span>Yeah, it might not be the Mega Evolution anyone expected, but it got people talking, and now Mega Starmie has somehow become a breakout‚Ä¶star‚Ä¶from </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-switch-2-erderee-expansion-open-world-rpg-1851774222">The Switch 2 port of FromSoftware‚Äôs open-world RPG, </a><em>Elden Ring,</em> has been delayed from 2025 until sometime in 2026. In two different statements about the delay, the devs explained that the port needed more time to improve performance. When <em>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition</em> on Switch 2 was first seen by the public, many weren‚Äôt impressed by its frame rate.</p> <p>On October 23, <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1981360180580217143">the official <em>Elden Ring</em> Twitter account announced</a> that<em> Elden Ring</em> on Switch 2 was no longer launching in 2025 and had been delayed into next year to give the devs more time for ‚Äúperformance adjustments.‚Äù</p> <p><span>‚ÄúWhile development on <em>Elden Ring</em></span><span><em> Tarnished Edition</em> continues wholeheartedly toward release,‚Äù posted the<em> Elden Ring</em> account, ‚Äúwe have decided to move the launch to 2026 to allow time for performance adjustments. We apologize to players looking forward to the game and thank you for your patience and support.‚Äù</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://x.com/fromsoftware_pr/status/1981359979119726764">Over on the official FromSoftware Twitter account</a>, the studio shared a lengthier message about the delay. Here‚Äôs the translated version of that statement:</p> <blockquote><p>Regarding the Nintendo Switch 2 <em>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition,</em> which was scheduled for release in 2025, we have determined that additional time is required for game performance adjustments, and we will therefore be changing the release to 2026. We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause to all users who have been looking forward to the release of this title. We will continue to make adjustments to deliver it in the best possible form, so we kindly ask for your understanding. Thank you very much for your patience.</p></blockquote> <p>Both statements make it clear that the open-world RPG, first released on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC in 2022, is struggling to run well on Nintendo‚Äôs Switch 2 console. This was clear when the game was demoed at Gamescom earlier this year, and footage showed it chugging horribly. <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-switch-2-framerate-footage-video-gamescom-2000618923">Bandai Namco reportedly even stopped people from recording footage</a> of the game to avoid it being posted online. <em>Nintendo Life</em> video producer Felix Sanchez, after playing <em>Elden Ring</em> on Switch 2, said: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really bad, and I understand why they don‚Äôt want you to see this, because wowie zowie, it is terrible.‚Äù Looks like FromSoftware and Bandai Namco are going to keep tinkering on the port until next year. Hopefully, that helps it run better when it finally launches.</p>
