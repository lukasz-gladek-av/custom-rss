              <p>You gotta love it when an elite-level laptop processor takes a serious price dive because a new version hits the market. That’s what’s happened with Apple’s M4-powered laptops since the M5 chip dropped last October, and while the M5 models are truly incredible, the M4s still pack a powerful punch, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6716/">you can score a 13-inch 2025 M4 MacBook Air for just $799 at Amazon right now</a>.</p>
<p>Apple’s most recent features and innovations are all packed into the M4 MacBook Air, from Apple Intelligence AI, an 18-hour battery life, and some of the absolute best visuals and sound of any laptop. The M4 MacBooks are a great opportunity for creative pros, Apple fans, and anyone wanting to score a truly great laptop that’s marked down by hundreds of dollars from its original price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6716/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Still Fresh</h2>
<p>Apple’s rapid upgrade schedule from the M2 chip to the M5 — a trek that took only two years — means that the “previous model” MacBooks are actually very,&nbsp;<em>very</em> recent. This 13-inch M4 MacBook Air is less than a year old, which means you won’t have to worry about OS compatibility or falling behind on the latest Apple goodies for years to come, most likely. Since the jump from the M4 to the M5 is a 20% gain in CPU speed and quicker Apple Intelligence, you might not notice the performance difference at all, but you’ll definitely notice the $200 that’s staying in your wallet when you go with the M4 MacBook Air.</p>
<p>The first thing you’ll notice when you fire up the M4 MacBook Air is, of course, Apple’s legendary Liquid Retina display. A billion colors are packed into the 13.6-inch screen to make any picture or static image truly pop, and with a great refresh rate, your videos and streaming will be absolutely peak. The MacBook Air’s 12MP Center Stage camera combines with three built-in mics and four speakers with Spatial Audio to create a perfect multimedia machine for video calls.</p>



<h2>All-Day Intelligence</h2>
<p>Once you dig into the latest iteration of Apple Intelligence, you’ll want to play with it all day. Apple’s AI model is a true boon to anyone needing a hand with writing, creating, research, or anything else you ask of it. Apple’s built market-best privacy protection features into Apple Intelligence, making your searches and activity so secure that even Apple can’t see them. You can indulge in that all-day dive into Apple Intelligence with the 13-inch M4 MacBook Air, because it comes with a robust 18-hour battery life.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6716/">The 20%-off Amazon deal that cuts the price of the 13-inch 2025 M4 MacBook Air by a full $200</a>, down to just $799, is especially noteworthy since Apple’s been historically a little spare with their sale prices. But it’s real, and it’s still live right now for anyone looking to score a top-of-the-line MacBook at a terrific price.</p>
