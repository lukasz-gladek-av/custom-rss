Since then, Valve has slowly built up a ton of lore and history for the characters seen in-game, including the entirety of the Red team’s mercs, like Doctor and Heavy. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Comics&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Comics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A lot of this storytelling has happened in sporadically released comics since 2009</a></span> . For example, Heavy has a sister and she eventually falls in love with Soldier! Anyway suddenly, nearly seven years after issue six, Valve has published the seventh installment in the main <em>TF2</em> comic series and finally revealed Spy’s face. </p><p><strong><em>And uh, yeah, minor spoilers below for issue seven. Take this as your last warning.</em></strong><em> </em></p><p>After 17 years of playing <em>Team Fortress 2</em>, it’s very odd to finally be looking at Spy without his mask on. But that’s what you see below.</p><figure id="" data-id="ed98d661da1a23a78eb78ffc2aa57e4f" data-recommend-id="image://ed98d661da1a23a78eb78ffc2aa57e4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ed98d661da1a23a78eb78ffc2aa57e4f" data-recommend-id="image://ed98d661da1a23a78eb78ffc2aa57e4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> The man in the suit is Spy, sitting on a couch after handing his mask to his young daughter. (Yes, Spy has a daughter and Soldier got married. A lot has happened in the comics!) </p><p>Beyond the reveal of Spy’s face,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.teamfortress.com/tf07_thedayshavewornaway/#f=315&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.teamfortress.com/tf07_thedayshavewornaway/#f=315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> which is a massive moment for <em>TF2 </em>fans</a></span>, this seventh issue also feels like a farewell from Valve. A lot of plot lines are tied up in this issue in a way that’s satisfying, if a bit rushed. </p><p>Still, I’m happy to see Valve finally tying up the <em>TF2</em> comic and its story. Will we get more <em>TF2 </em>comics in the future? Maybe, but as for the main overarching plot of the franchise (yes, it eventually developed one), it seems done. And that’s nice. Maybe now, with this wrapped, Valve can bring closure to&nbsp;another franchise and its plotlines, too. I’m talking about<em> Half-Life 3</em>. I want to play <em>Half-Life 3</em>. Please. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.teamfortress.com/tf07_thedayshavewornaway/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.teamfortress.com/tf07_thedayshavewornaway/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can read the whole comic for free by clicking this link.</a></span> But first, I’d suggest reading the issues that came before it.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
