The new console is set to launch in June and will cost $450. And it will, as previously announced, support most OG Switch games. However, two new compatibility lists from Nintendo seem to indicate that over 100 Switch games will have various issues or just flat-out not work on the upcoming Switch 2.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,195670" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Late last year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatibility-release-date-1851690470&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatibility-release-date-1851690470">during the US presidential election</a></span>, Nintendo quietly confirmed that, yes, many Switch games will be playable and functional on the upcoming Switch 2 console. But the wording used was a bit vague and left some wiggle-room for not everything working or some games having issues. So it’s not surprising that, following Wednesday’s big Switch 2 Direct, Nintendo published two new lists containing over 100 games that won’t properly work on Switch 2. </p><p>The two lists are named: </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-launchable_compatibility_issues_EN.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-launchable_compatibility_issues_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Nintendo Switch games that start up on Nintendo Switch 2, but include some in-game compatibility issues</strong></a></span><strong> </strong></li><li><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-compatibility_issues_EN.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-compatibility_issues_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong> Nintendo Switch games with start up issues on Nintendo Switch 2</strong></a></span></li></ul><p>The wording here is a bit vague and I’ve reached out to Nintendo for clarification. The first list seems to imply that some OG Switch games on the new console will start but will have “in-game compatibility issues,” while the second suggests many more games have “start up issues,” which sounds like they won’t boot up at all? And unfortunately, the longer list is the one featuring games with start up issues.</p><p>Some games on the “start up issues” list include&nbsp;<em>Another Crab’s Treasure, Darksiders Genesis, DOOM: Eternal, Final Fantasy, Pizza Tower, Rocket League, Super Mega Baseball 3, Warframe, </em>and <em>Trove. </em>It seems all first-party Nintendo games will at least boot up and play on Switch 2. </p><p>Some good news! All of the games listed that won’t work properly or even start up on Switch 2, with one exception, are currently “being investigated.” So hopefully before Switch 2's launch or shortly after, many of these games will be updated and will work on the new console. We’ll see about that. </p><p>The one exception, by the way, is <em>Fortnite</em>, which according to Nintendo has some “start up issues” on Switch 2. But Epic isn’t going to fix those, apparently, and instead is planning to launch a Switch 2 version of the free-to-play shooter. </p><hr><p><em>You’re reading part of </em>Kotaku’s <em>ongoing coverage of the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct. </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502?_gl=1*lqzwhi*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzU5ODc5My4yODEuMS4xNzQzNjA5MDcwLjU0LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502?_gl=1*lqzwhi*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzU5ODc5My4yODEuMS4xNzQzNjA5MDcwLjU0LjAuMA.." target="_blank"><em>Check our roundup</em></a></span><em> for more news from the showcase </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200" target="_blank"><em>including launch games</em></a></span><em>, </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502" target="_blank"><em>pricing information, release date, pre-order information</em></a></span><em>, and </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-c-button-voice-game-chat-camera-video-1851774209&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-c-button-voice-game-chat-camera-video-1851774209" target="_blank"><em>what that mysterious C button Nintendo keeps teasing actually does</em></a></span><em>.</em></p><p><em>We’ll be continuing to update stories with news and analysis throughout the day as Nintendo pulls back the curtain on its most anticipated console launch ever.

But they’re uh, pretty restrictive, to the point where even the most dedicated Nintendo fan might not be able to buy directly from the company.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,196143,196447" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Right now, if you want to purchase a Switch 2 through Nintendo in the U.S., you have to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">register interest on the company’s website</a></span> for either the standard $450 system or the $500 <em>Mario Kart World </em>bundle. Nintendo will send the first round of purchase invites on May 8, almost a month after pre-orders go live elsewhere on April 9. The company will roll out more invites before its official pre-orders open to the general public, and if you receive one you’ll have 72 hours to make a purchase. But what makes you eligible? That’s where things get tricky. The priority requirements as listed on Nintendo’s site are:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“As of 4/2/2025, (i) you must have been the one who purchased any Nintendo Switch Online membership, (ii) you must have had any paid Nintendo Switch Online membership for a minimum of 12 months, and (iii) you must have opted in to share gameplay data and have at least 50 hours total gameplay hours.”</p></blockquote><p>Luckily for me, I’ve had an ongoing Nintendo Switch Online membership because I was really into <em>Pokémon Unite </em>for a year then never canceled. But a lot of people are single-player sickos, or primarily play multiplayer games on other platforms, and have no incentive to pay for an online membership. Also, who remembers if they opted to share gameplay data with Nintendo. I probably made that decision years ago and forgot about it? If this is what makes it difficult for me to get my hands on Switch 2 in a timely manner, that’s some bullshit.</p><p>You might have more luck pre-ordering at another store. My one pro tip from years of pre-order consoles is that, if you’re not in a big city, you can probably manage to get an in-store pre-order at your local shop. One of the only things I miss about living in the middle of nowhere is that I was guaranteed a console pre-order if I got to my local GameStop the day pre-orders went live. Good luck to everybody else, I guess. May the odds be ever in your favor.</p><hr><p><em> You’re reading part of </em>Kotaku<em>’s ongoing coverage of the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct. </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502?_gl=1*d7g2e6*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzU5NzQwNy42Ni4xLjE3NDM2MDU5OTAuNTQuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502?_gl=1*d7g2e6*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzU5NzQwNy42Ni4xLjE3NDM2MDU5OTAuNTQuMC4w" target="_blank"><em>Check our roundup</em></a></span><em> for more news from the showcase </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200" target="_blank"><em>including launch games</em></a></span><em>, </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502" target="_blank"><em>pricing information, release date, pre-order information</em></a></span><em>, and </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-c-button-voice-game-chat-camera-video-1851774209&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-c-button-voice-game-chat-camera-video-1851774209" target="_blank"><em>what that mysterious C button Nintendo keeps teasing actually does</em></a></span><em>.</em><br><em>We’ll be continuing to update stories with news and analysis throughout the day as Nintendo pulls back the curtain on its most anticipated console launch ever.
