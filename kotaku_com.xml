Many of the most popular school shooting simulators are created by a group known as Active Shooter Studios or A.S.S. </p><p>A.S.S has reportedly created <em>Roblox </em>maps and online games based on mass shootings like those that have happened at Uvalde, Parkland, and Columbine. One of the studio’s most popular maps is “Carbine,” a <em>Roblox </em>recreation of the 1999 Columbine high school massacre which took the lives of a dozen students and one teacher while injuring many more. In “Carbine” players can take on the role of the shooters themselves and recreate the deadly shooting. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.adl.org/resources/article/dark-side-roblox-active-shooter-studios-create-maps-based-real-life-mass&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.adl.org/resources/article/dark-side-roblox-active-shooter-studios-create-maps-based-real-life-mass" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by the ADL</a></span>, these maps aren’t just simple pieces of geometry that mimic a real world location. Instead they are highly detailed and contain disturbing features. The report says that one <em>Roblox </em>experience created by A.S.S. which recreates the 2022 Uvalde shooting features NPCs that resemble children who will hide under desks and play dead when they hear gunfire.</p><p>Most of the experiences created by the studio reportedly end when the police arrive. Players can then fight to the death or commit suicide. </p><h2 id="h465591"><a id=""></a><em>Roblox</em> removes content, but it keeps coming back</h2><p>A.S.S. has struggled to keep their maps available in <em>Roblox </em>as the company removes them quickly when they are reported or get flagged by internal moderation tools. The studio, which boasts a Discord server containing over 500 members, has resorted to using private <em>Roblox </em>servers to host their games behind a paywall. The idea is that this makes it harder for Roblox Studio to find and remove the games, all of which reportedly break many of <em>Roblox’s </em>community guidelines and rules.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-21/roblox-user-group-re-creates-real-life-mass-shooting-events?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NTI2NTU2MSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ1ODcwMzYxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVVZQOUdEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJGRUIzODlCNUI2ODI0RTY0QjY5MENEODE1RTBDREZGRCJ9.P4kaO2hTr9-7PKAgfwWFdDRJ3hKkYOt2_k7LAjKIfa8&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-21/roblox-user-group-re-creates-real-life-mass-shooting-events?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NTI2NTU2MSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ1ODcwMzYxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVVZQOUdEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJGRUIzODlCNUI2ODI0RTY0QjY5MENEODE1RTBDREZGRCJ9.P4kaO2hTr9-7PKAgfwWFdDRJ3hKkYOt2_k7LAjKIfa8&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Bloomberg </em>reports</a></span> that <em>Roblox </em>has removed one of A.S.S’s groups which contained over 800 players after it was contacted by the ADL.

In some cases, they may also encounter content produced by accelerationist white supremacists, which glorifies these killers and aims to radicalize others to follow in their footsteps.”</p><p><em>Roblox, Discord, </em>and <em>TikTok </em>each told <em>Bloomberg</em> that they actively remove content focused on or glorifying extremists  or violent crimes. Despite that, <em>Kotaku</em> was able to find numerous videos about “Carbine” and other digital recreations of school shootings on these platforms.

Travis Scott was high and giving Rhodes a black eye. Cena being chosen to be the face of the company by the insidious Vince McMahon was brought up, as was Rhodes only being in the position he is because of Cena’s absence and Rhodes copying him. Everything was set. All that was left was for Cena and Rhodes to put on the historic WrestleMania matches they’ve been known to do individually. Boy, did they not.</p><p>After uninspired fisticuffs, the match devolved to simply an exchange of finishing moves before concluding in one of the weakest endings in WrestleMania history. After getting his lick back on Travis Scott by hitting the Cactus Jack rapper with a Cross Rhodes, the champion wouldn’t strike Cena with the championship belt. Why? By the look on his face, it appears he didn’t want to win the wrong way. Well, that Captain America nobility bullshit got him kicked in the groin and knocked out, making him the loser of the match. No surprise interference outside of Travis Scott, no ruthless aggression, no sustained back-and-forth fighting. It was the equivalent of the WWE shoving the full-course meal you ordered in your face and telling you to enjoy what you asked for. At a WrestleMania that featured Seth Rollins’ surprise alliance with Paul Heyman; Iyo Sky, Rhea Ripley, and Bianca Belair putting on an instant classic triple-threat match; and Jey Uso winning the World Heavyweight Championship, Cena’s title match would be an afterthought if not for the history made. </p><p>Even with all of that disappointment, I’m not ready to give up on the WWE’s grand plan. The most promising sign that the WWE has a worthwhile plan which that terrible WrestleMania 41 main event fits into is Cena’s expressed desire to “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2025/4/21/24412828/john-cena-vows-to-ruin-wrestling-after-winning-wwe-title-raw-wrestlemania-cody-rhodes&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2025/4/21/24412828/john-cena-vows-to-ruin-wrestling-after-winning-wwe-title-raw-wrestlemania-cody-rhodes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ruin wrestling</a></span>.” Earlier today on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waEZ5NPjLTo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waEZ5NPjLTo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Pat McAfee Show</em></a></span>, Cena broke down part of his post-WrestleMania plan, and it quite honestly sounds like the WWE’s version of DC Comics’ Crisis on Infinite Earths in which the DC timeline was reset, liberated of its burdensome multiverse.</p><p>“I’m going to make wrestling start over. That championship is coming home with me, and I will be the last undisputed WWE champion, period. They’re going to have to make a new title. They’re going to have to start the over again.”</p><p>Retiring a championship is truly next-level heel shit. Beating someone to a bloody pulp, knocking someone off of a bridge, and nailing the boss’s daughter to a cross to sacrifice her are bad. Having the balls to remove a championship is a seismic change that could be a smart move. Cena delivering a WrestleMania match that felt like a formality more than a fight and robbing fans of the type of five-star match that requires you to put your body on the line could totally be Cena’s way of ruining wrestling. Imagine if the rest of his wrestling career is centered on simply removing everything positive that fans expect every year, and then leaving with a title they have memories attached to. That would be a scorched Earth plan I can get behind.</p><p>Another saving grace for the WWE is time. Cena has already committed to wrestling until the end of December, with another 27-37 matches left to go after originally stipulating he’ll wrestle in 30-40 matches in his final year. So far, he’s only wrestled in Premium Live Events. If he’s going to hit that number of matches, it’s safe to assume we’ll be seeing him wrestle on RAW and Smackdown. With the championship already won, the next eight full months can be a collection of dream matches and title defenses. Maybe Cena can finally beat Roman Reigns in a Singles match after failing the previous two times. Maybe the sleeping giant Randy Orton goes back to his Legend Killer ways and begins his own potential retirement tour by ending Cena’s with a loss. </p><p>We’ll almost certainly get a Cena/Rhodes rematch, or we’ll riot. If Cena and WWE’s plans are for the newly 17-time World Champion to ruin wrestling, they’re off to a great start.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Mario maker wants “to obtain the identity of the Discord user ‘GameFreakOUT,’ who posted infringing content,” wrote one of its lawyers. The filing included a screenshot of the Discord server in question and user GameFreakOUT sharing the file link with the word “enjoy.”</p><p>Game Freak released a statement on October 10 that it had been hacked and over 2,000 pieces of employee data had been subjected to “unauthorized access by a third party.” What it didn’t mention was that a ton of confidential data related to its work on the<em> Pokémon </em>franchise was also seemingly accessed during the breach. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688?_gl=1*1d4uh99*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTI2MzQxNy4xMTkuMS4xNzQ1MjY1NTYwLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688?_gl=1*1d4uh99*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTI2MzQxNy4xMTkuMS4xNzQ1MjY1NTYwLjYwLjAuMA..">That wasn’t revealed until days later</a></span> when unused  Pokémon designs, lore entries, idle developer musings, and more began spreading on Discord, 4chan, Reddit, and eventually the rest of social media.</p><p>One of the biggest discoveries from the leaks was references to Gen 10 <em>Pokémon</em> games for Switch 2 that were reportedly codenamed “Gaia.” But the leak also purportedly contained very sensitive data that wasn’t released by GameFreakOUT, like the alleged source code for the upcoming 2025 Switch 1 game <em>Pokémon</em>&nbsp;<em>Legends: Z-A</em>.
