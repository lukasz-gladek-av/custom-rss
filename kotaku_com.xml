            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After eight long years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-demo-hands-on-price-hollow-knight-pax-west-2000621695"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> has finally arrived</a>. There’s just one small problem: the biggest game release of 2025 is causing all sorts of issues for the Nintendo Switch 2 eShop and Steam store pages. Fans racing to download the highly-anticipated Metroidvania sequel are stuck looking at error screens instead.</p> <p>The PlayStation and Xbox stores are getting hammered too. Here’s what players are seeing:</p>           <p>I’ve been trying to download the game on my Switch 2 and I keep getting kicked out of the eShop. On my most recent attempt I was finally able to load the actual Silksong store listing and hear the music from the auto-playing trailer, nothing else on the page actually populated. After about 20 seconds the store crashed on me again and kicked me back out to the main Switch 2 menu.</p>

 <p>There’s no word yet on whether this is just a momentary issue caused by the sudden surge in traffic or if something else is going on with <em>Silksong</em>‘s launch that could delay it further from i<a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-when-release-live-price-hollow-knight-steam-2000621785">ts originally planned 10:00 a.m. ET debut</a>. Some players do appear to be having success getting the game downloaded, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/botherer.bsky.social/post/3lxzdiekdmk2m">at least on Steam</a>. It’s also available through Game Pass for free for paying members.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">silksong has crashed the entirety of steam and most twitch streamers are having a bad time <a href="https://t.co/IqKxctPA1G">pic.twitter.com/IqKxctPA1G</a></p> <p>— Hayden Schiff (ᵔᴥᵔ) (@HaydenSchiff) <a href="https://twitter.com/HaydenSchiff/status/1963605152163659893?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The game’s arrival has been unique among modern releases, with no advanced code provided to reviewers and everyone getting the chance to jump into the game and play it at the same time. Or at least whenever the eShop, Steam, and other store pages start working again!</p>

 <p><strong>Update 9/4/2025 10:38 a.m. ET:</strong> More and more people are reporting being able to get through the error cycle on their platform of choice and actually download Silksong. According to SteamDB, over 100,000 people are already playing through Valve’s storefront, though I suspect that number is lagging way behind the actual figures.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000623153" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000623153"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000623153">SteamDB / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Can it hit 1 million by lunch time? The all-time peaks are currently held by <em>PUBG</em> (3,257,248 concurrents) and <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>(2,415,714 concurrents).</p> <p><em>Update 9/4/2025 10:23 a.m. ET: Added more information.</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-pro-plus-1tb-microsd-memory-card-with-adapter-is-now-15-cheaper-than-black-friday-pricing-2000622760</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-pro-plus-1tb-microsd-memory-card-with-adapter-is-now-15-cheaper-than-black-friday-pricing.1288731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If there is one thing that anybody with one or several tech devices will never say no to, it’s more storage. Think about it: Everything from your smartphone and tablet to your laptop, digital camera, handheld gaming console — even your drone if you’re an enthusiast (like us) — they’re all just as good as their amount of memory allows them to be. That’s why this limited-time deal at Amazon is so universally appealing: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/">Save 35% off the price of the Samsung PRO Plus microSD 1TB memory card and adapter and boost your storage for just $75.</a></p>
<p>Samsung’s title as the World’s #1 Flash Memory Brand has been going strong for 22 years now, going all the way back to when 8GB thumb drives were&nbsp;<em>the</em> giant-capacity devices to have. This Samsung PRO Plus microSD card is 125 times bigger than that in capacity, and comes in a much smaller package. Times have changed for sure, but Samsung’s reign as the top flash memory brand is still in effect, which makes this Amazon deal even sweeter.</p>

<h2>Blazing Speed</h2>
<p>Throw it back to 2003 again for just a moment and recall what it was like to move huge files onto a portable storage device. You’d drag and drop, and then go make yourself something to eat while periodically checking in on that bar graph window to see how much longer you had to wait. The Samsung PRO Plus microSD card reads data at 180 MB/s and sequentially writes it at 130 MB/s, so make that sandwich to go, because you won’t be waiting long.</p>
<p>As for storage size, just how big is a terabyte? Enough for 47 hours of 4K video, or nearly 160 hours of full-HD video, or 437,298 4K photos, or 654,480 HD photos. Chances are, you may never actually fill this $75 storage beast, but if you do, those read-write speeds will come in incredibly handy. And you can fill, empty, and refill the PRO Plus microSD card over and over again, because despite it’s amazingly minuscule size, it’s built to last. Samsung made it to withstand water, extreme temperatures, magnets, x-rays, and drops, which is why so many photo and video pros swear by them for live outdoor shoots.</p>



<h2>Universal Appeal</h2>
<p>You can take the Samsung PRO Plus microSD out into the wild in a digital camera, GoPro or other action camera, or drone, but it’s certainly just as much at home in your home. Smartphones and tablets, laptops, home security systems, and handheld gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch (not the Switch 2) all benefit from the extra storage of the 1TB microSD card. The format is nearly universal.</p>
<p>Now that we’ve established how far an extra terabyte of memory in a near-universal format goes and in how many devices, this Amazon limited-time deal taking 35% off the price of the 1TB model of the Samsung PRO Plus microSD card looks even better. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/">The Samsung 1TB PRO Plus microSD card is just $75 right now at Amazon, down from its regular price of $115.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/mindseye-hitman-io-interactive-roadmap-update-metacritic-2000623129</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hitman-maker-distances-itself-from-disastrous-mindseye-launch.1288728/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>MindsEye</em> is one of the worst-reviewed games of the year, and IO Interactive published it. In fact, it was the <em>Hitman</em> maker’s first outside publishing deal ever. How did things go so wrong? The studio’s CEO was finally asked to weigh in on the topic and he makes it sound like he doesn’t know either.</p> <p>“The initial talks we had with those guys were to support them,” Hakan Abrak, who’s been in charge of IO for nearly a decade, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch">told <em>IGN</em></a> recently. “We thought they had some great ideas and a great world in the background that they were building, and hopefully they’ll get the opportunity to show more of that in the future. And we just wanted to help them distribute the game.”</p> <p><em>MindsEye</em> had a sound pitch. Developer Build A Rocket Boy, led by ex-<em>Grand Theft Auto</em> producer Leslie Benzies, was making a user-generated-content-based metaverse called Everything, but pivoted to getting a smaller, single-player shooter out the door first. Following an ex-black ops guy with a brain implant that’s turning his world upside down, <em>MindsEye</em> sounded like an old-school action-adventure campaign with some modern AAA gloss.</p>

 <p>What it ended up being instead <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-review-bad-ps5-update-boring-open-world-pc-gta-1851785108">was a confusing and boring mess</a>. It’s one of the lowest-rated games of 2025 on Metacritic and has only 2,000 user reviews on Steam, around 70 percent of which are negative. As far as first-time publishing experiences go, it probably couldn’t have been any worse.</p> <p>“Well, that was definitely tough, right?” Abrak told I<em>GN</em>. “It was a tough reception. It wasn’t what they hoped for, and also what we didn’t hope for at IOI Partners. They’re working hard on turning that around to regain the trust of the gamers out there, and they have tons of potential and content they’re working on. So hopefully they’ll succeed with that in the future.”</p>

 <p>While Build A Rocket Boy has made promises, it’s also been <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-layoffs-refunds-steam-reviews-gta-everywhere-1851784902">undergoing post-launch layoffs</a> and playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/leslie-benzies-ex-gta-producer-mindseye-fail-saboteurs-1851785617">weird blame games</a>. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-devs-uk-workforce-of-around-300-receive-at-risk-emails-as-former-gta-lead-leslie-benzies-finally-addresses-staff"><em>IGN</em> reported</a> that Benzies took the opportunity on a rare video call with staff in July to accuse internal and outside actors of trying to sabotage <em>MindsEye</em>. The studio announced an updated roadmap later that month that includes more fixes to the game and its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1m8ykoy/july_update_from_the_studio/">upcoming <em>Hitman</em> crossover mission</a>.</p> <p>Worth noting is that at no point does Abrak talk about the partnership like it’s still ongoing. He talks about “we” at IO Interactive and “those guys” and “them” at Build A Rocket Boy. Even with the upcoming content you get the distinct feeling the <em>Hitman</em> team is ready to wash its hands of the entire thing and focus exclusively on its <a href="http://i/">upcoming 007 <em>James Bond</em> game</a> moving forward.</p> <p>Does IO plan to publish any other outside games after this? Abrak said, “That remains to be seen.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-buying-a-new-desktop-intel-core-ultra-7-at-its-cheapest-ever-turns-yours-into-a-5-5ghz-beast.1288620/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Would you swap out your car’s motor for a nitro-burning drag engine if you could do it yourself and do it for pennies on the dollar? Of course you would, but unfortunately, unless you’re an automotive expert with a killer garage and a death wish, you can’t. But you can do the PC desktop equivalent of that kind of massive power upgrade — it’s easy, and while <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3896/">Amazon’s selling the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor for just $259 during a limited-time deal, it’s peanuts compared to the price of buying a whole new desktop rig.</a></p>
<p>This is a terrific deal for anyone looking to transform a blah PC desktop into a raging speed demon, but it’s especially great if you’re a gamer looking to upgrade a rig or are thinking about building your own from scratch. With 8 performance cores and 12 efficient cores, and that awesome max clock speed of 5.5GHz, the Intel Core Ultra 7 is begging to be the engine for high-end lag-free PC gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3896/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>More Than Speed</h2>
<p>The Intel Core Ultra 7 processor is compatible with Intel 800 Series Chipset-based motherboards, and supports PCIe 5.0 and 4.0, along with DDR5. It’s clearly a speed demon, with more than enough horsepower to blast your way through the most rugged action games and shooters, but those performance and efficient cores also let your PC run cooler, which means less power consumption and less chance of sustaining overheating-related damage.</p>
<p>There’s a significant brain upgrade with the Intel Core Ultra 7 too, in addition to all that brawn. Intel’s Ultra processor-based AI is the key to better streaming and gaming than ever before, with an NPU that takes on tasks like background removal and auto-framing and applies AI to them to create the smoothest gaming and streaming experience yet.</p>



<h2>Optimization Across the Board</h2>
<p>The Core Ultra 7 processor features Intel’s Application Optimization tech, a customizable way to devote more of the processor’s incredible power to the games and applications you want to give a max boost to. The user interface lets you see which games are optimized, and to turn it on or off for individual games as you see fit. Combined with Ultra processor-based AI, this is future-proofed gaming guaranteed, with the absolute maximum speed and performance always at the ready.</p>
<p>Buying an all-new PC desktop with this much power is an expensive proposition indeed, and now thanks to this limited-time deal at Amazon, it’s one you can skip entirely. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3896/">With the price of the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor slashed by 36%, all the way down to $259</a>, the smart choice is to perform a little DIY brain surgery on your existing PC, or build one around this monster processor.</p>
