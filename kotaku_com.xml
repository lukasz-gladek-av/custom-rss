              <p>Some games start slow, taking their time to teach you the controls and establish the world. <a href="https://kotaku.com/high-on-life-2-trailer-teaser-xbox-game-pass-sgf-2025-1851783996"><em>High On Life 2</em></a> takes a very different approach. It tosses you into the world at 1,000 MPH, cracking jokes and having a blast. And you know what, it’s a great way to start a video game.</p> <p><em>High On Life 2</em> doesn’t assume that you’ve played its <a href="https://kotaku.com/high-on-life-review-rick-and-morty-justin-roiland-1849888587">2022 predecessor</a>. Instead, the intro to this <a href="https://kotaku.com/high-on-life-squanch-games-rick-and-morty-justin-roilan-1849949995">comedy-filled sci-fi FPS</a> about humans being turned into drugs provides a crash course on what happened in the last game. It does this via an intro that is structured as a series of vignettes and moments seamlessly stitched together into one extended opening montage.</p>

 <p>At one point you’re fighting a giant monster, then you’re on a talk show, a second later you’re back in a limo with your mentor-turned-agent from the original game, then back to the monster fight. A quick cut later, you’re doing a commercial, then you’re zipped away to an obstacle course, back to the talk show, and so on.</p> <p>This introduction sequence isn’t just fun and funny; it also does a great job of teaching you the basics of <em>High On Life 2</em>. You know, how to jump, move, shoot, grapple stuff, melee people, etc. Learning how to jump and run on a <em>Wipeout</em>-like televised obstacle course and then seconds later, though possibly years later in-game, using those skills to climb across buildings as you chase a giant monster not only taught me the controls, it also quickly established what the main character has been doing since the first game. On top of that, it’s all technically impressive and fun to behold as the game hops between wildly different scenes in a few frames without hitching up or breaking.</p>

  <p>And yes, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/high-on-life-2-jeffrey-epstein-joke/">as already pointed out by <em>Polygon</em></a>, there is a joke about deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in the intro sequence. It happens during a bit in which you kill a bunch of different targets in a hyper-fast murder montage that teaches you how to melee while also showing how bored the main character has become with their life as a celebrity bounty hunter. You can kill these people instantly, or let them ramble on for a bit and learn more about why they are marked for death. In the case of one character, they trafficked humans, but not for “sex stuff” like Epstein. They just sold humans to be smoked as a drug by aliens. They want to be clear; they are bad, but not as bad as Epstein.</p>

 <p>This is when I’d show you a clip from this awesome intro, but I can’t do that. <em>High On Life 2</em> has a lot of embargoed content that I’m unable to talk about ahead of its February 13 launch. And we aren’t able to share video or record clips of the introduction sequence at all. It’s a shame, because I don’t think it spoils much, and it’s one of the best parts of <em>High On Life 2.&nbsp;</em></p>

              <p><span>Pokémon Day, the series’ annual anniversary celebration that typically includes a live stream about upcoming projects, is just two weeks away. Rumors and leaks are circulating, and while the new </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-gen-10-leak-wind-wave-open-world-images-screens-2000666444"><span>Generation X games seem imminent</span></a><span>, leakers claim that a pair of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-best-worst-games-ranked-red-blue-scarlet-violet-1849984595"><span>old games may also be announced for the Switch 2</span></a><span>&nbsp;on February 27: </span><i><span>Pokémon FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The Game Boy Advance games originally launched in 2004, and are remakes of the </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Green </span></i><span>RPGs on the Game Boy that kickstarted the franchise. The rumor of their impending rerelease began when Khu, a leaker in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community, claimed that the games would “return soon” on </span><a href="https://x.com/Riddler_Khu/status/2021518874785841331"><span>X</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">They will return soon~ <a href="https://t.co/hwB2Ntsn8H">pic.twitter.com/hwB2Ntsn8H</a></p> <p>— Khu Beating Around The Bush (@Riddler_Khu) <a href="https://twitter.com/Riddler_Khu/status/2021518874785841331?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/2021595272967528833?s=20"><span>Centro Leaks</span></a><span>, a prominent leak account, has also posted saying that a separate source tells them these RPGs won’t be part of the Nintendo Switch Online subscription, and will instead be paid games on the eShop. They also claim they will be compatible with </span><i><span>Pokémon Home</span></i><span>, which allows you to transfer your Pokémon to a storage app that can be traded to other games in the series.</span></p> <p><i><span>FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i><span> are easily the best versions of the first-generation games, but fans have gotten a bit weary of going back to the Kanto region after years of perceived favoritism for those original 151 Pokémon. So while there’s plenty of excitement about the possibility, some folks are rolling their eyes at the thought that these games might be ported over while&nbsp; plenty of the other games continue missing from the Switch’s line-up. Especially if they end up being pricey, standalone games.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Big news for Kantoids,” wrote one </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1r1ut4f/khu_hints_pok%C3%A9mon_fire_red_and_leaf_green_will/"><span>Redditor</span></a><span>. “Just give me </span><i><span>HGSS</span></i><span>,” wrote another. “</span><i><span>FireRed</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i><span> will return in </span><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday</span></i><span>,” is the top comment on the GamingLeaksAndRumors subreddit thread about the leak, indicating that a lot of folks feel like they’re being subjected to some MCU-style nostalgia-baiting here and aren’t thrilled at the prospect of going back to Kanto. So some folks might be skipping this if it comes to pass.</span></p>

 <p><span>This is all just a rumor right now, but it would make some sense considering 2026 is </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s 30th anniversary. It doesn’t seem out of the question that The Pokémon Company would want to give folks a way to play that first adventure. The original </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and</span><i><span> Blue</span></i><span> were last available on the 3DS, but now that the eShop on that device has been shut down, you can only download them if you’ve previously purchased them.</span></p> <p><span>For a series with as much continuity as </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> has through intergenerational trading and </span><i><span>Home </span></i><span>support, it’s really shitty that all these games aren’t readily accessible on modern hardware, but Nintendo has a way of making it hard to play old games without some kind of (usually expensive) port or subscription service on its current platforms. So if this does turn out to be true, I wouldn’t be surprised if </span><i><span>FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i><span> end up costing something like $30 a piece. But we’ll know for sure on Pokémon Day.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Resident Evil 4 Remake Slammed On Steam For New DRM That Makes The Game Run Worse]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-remake-pc-drm-denuvo-steam-review-2000668182</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891">The Resident<em> Evil 4</em> remake</a> came out three years ago, so you’d think its performance on PC would be pretty locked in at this point. Instead, Capcom recently swapped out the game’s DRM for new anti-tamper software and the horror shooter is running noticeably worse as a result.</p> <p>The impact of a recent switch from Denuvo DRM to Enigma DRM was recorded last week in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMDx-3PFYgc">one YouTube video</a> published by user ItalicMaze. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/residentevil42023/mods/5667">Using a mod</a> that allows you to restore the game’s previous version, the video compares the two and shows the framerate dropping from over 140 in the earlier version to in the low 90s in the updated release, with both running on similar settings. The drop-off was even worse when Leon was in more action-heavy moments with lots of enemies.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0TTbdff_vE"><em>Digital Foundry</em> circled back</a> on February 11 and posted its own assessment, essentially backing up the preliminary data. Using specific settings to try to isolate the load on the CPU, the outlet found that the new DRM was likely causing increased strain. “In this scenario, an average 1.9ms of CPU time is sucked out of the game-which is pretty shocking,” <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2026/02/tested-resident-evil-4-remakes-new-pc-drm-impacts-cpu-performance">wrote</a> Richard Leadbetter. “Immediately after the intro, we move into gameplay where the deficit shifts to a 20 percent drop in performance.”</p>  <p>He calls the result “not acceptable” and points to a larger issue of publishers treating PC versions of games as “mutable testbeds” they can constantly iterate on, sometimes without regard for how changes will impact the overall user experience. The group also notes that when DRM is used, its resource requirements should be budgeted into the game’s performance targets from the start, rather than being something added on top at the end that leads to a subpar experience.</p>

 <p>Steam users have been venting that exact frustration on the game’s store page with hundreds of negative reviews published over the last week. The <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>remake&nbsp;still has a rating of “Very Positive,” but the mini-protest has already dropped it from a previous peak of 96 percent positive down to 82 percent. A few points more and it’ll drop into the dreaded “yellow” territory of Steam user review ratings.</p>

 <p>With <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> right around the corner, all eyes will be on whether one of the most wishlisted games on Steam can avoid the PC performance debacle of last year’s Capcom blockbuster <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>. That game has finally turned a corner but it took nearly a year to get decent framerates on anything but top-tier rigs.</p>
