But it also leaves plenty of questions. For example, how long does it take to finish <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>? Well, it’s something of a trick question, as the story mode is more of a prologue or tutorial for the grind to come!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,196394,194842" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h582496"><a id=""></a><strong>How long does it take to beat Monster Hunter Wilds?</strong></h2><p>If you’re the type to rush through a game’s story—and in the case of <em>Monster Hunter</em>, I don’t blame you one bit—then you can finish <em>Wilds </em>in approximately <strong>20 to 30 hours</strong>, give or take. That was easy, eh? The whole campaign is split into two parts, each taking 12 to 15 hours to tackle. But again, that’s just the story! It’s just the opening flourish of the game! There’s still a whole expansive world to explore, monsters to hunt, crafting and upgrades to explore, side quests and challenges to tackle, and of course, the ever-present grind the series is known for.</p><p>Then, of course, there are achievements to consider. If you wish to 100 percent the game and show off a shiny Platinum trophy, expect to spend between <strong>60 to 80 hours</strong> to tackle everything <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> offers.</p><h2 id="h582497"><a id=""></a><strong>What about top-level ranking tiers?</strong></h2><p>Once you complete the main story path of the game, you’ll unlock access to High Rank monsters and zones. Here, you can craft some of the game’s most potent weapons and armor sets, allowing you to contend with the more formidable beasts in the desert.</p><p>That’s cool and all, but what about Master Rank? In <em>Monster Hunter World</em> and <em>Rise</em>, Master Rank offered additional challenges that made the game even more of a grind, more difficult to master, but offered players the opportunity to show off their hunting prowess. Currently, Master Rank isn’t available in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, but we won’t say ‘never.’ This top-tier rank didn’t release in the past two titles until post-launch expansions hit the scene. Therefore, we suspect <em>Wilds </em>will follow the same path!</p><hr><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is available now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

That’s part of the reason why every show from <em>The Sopranos </em>and <em>Lost </em>(in the PS2 era) to<em> M*A*S*H </em>(way back on the Atari 2600) have been turned into (mostly pretty lousy) video games. (Of course, it also helps that studios want to milk successful IPs for all they’re worth). <em>The Last of Us </em>is that rare example of a property that is finding great success in both forms: the original games are widely beloved and have millions of fans around the world, and the HBO series is only pulling even more people into the fold. Given the success of the video game adaptation of <em>The Last Of Us </em>(and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-trailer-dina-ellie-dance-1851768672&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-trailer-dina-ellie-dance-1851768672">the impending arrival of its second season</a></span>)<em>, </em>we decided to flip the script and take a deeper look at the TV shows we wish we could play as video games. </p></div><div><p>Over the last 14 years, whenever we hear that an AI chatbot influenced a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/30/tech/teen-suicide-character-ai-lawsuit/index.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/10/30/tech/teen-suicide-character-ai-lawsuit/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">child to commit suicide</a></span>, or a reality TV star becomes President of the United States, or a global pandemic breaks out, at some point many of us think, <em>“</em>Man, this feels like a <em>Black Mirror</em> episode.” The dystopian anthology series has complicated the human experience by placing people in deadly moral quandaries with a level of creativity that would be a thrill to explore further in a video game. There have been episodes in which people are dog-like robotic killers (“Metalhead”), a museum of unethical technological experiments like a brain implant allowing a doctor to feel his patient’s pain is explored (“Black Museum), and the British Prime Minister is blackmailed into having sex with a pig on national television (“The National Anthem”). They’ve also already ventured into the dark world of video games in an episode in which two friends fall in love in a <em>Mortal Kombat</em>-esque VR game (“Striking Vipers”) and one in which a guy tests an augmented reality game implanted in his head where he experiences his worst nightmares (“Playtest”).</p><p>This show would make an excellent video game in which a character is banished to a purgatorial void for some moral infraction, and they can only escape by going through a series of mirrors that are portals into wild scenarios that test their willingness to live. </p></div><div><p>Espionage has been the basis of some of the greatest video game franchises ever, like <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>, <em>Splinter Cell</em>, and <em>Watch Dogs</em>. The cutscene dialogue is usually rich with dramatic doublespeak and societal commentary that excites the inner conspiracy theorist in us. Few shows over the last 25 years have all that and the benefit of two dynamic leads, but <em>The Americans </em>does. The show is centered around two Russian spies posing as a suburban American family in the early 1980s, leaking intel back to their motherland. They and their network of spies have to intercept valuable assets in broad daylight through choreographed distractions, infiltrate a U.S. military project to steal defense communication codes, and bug the FBI office by placing a listening device in a mail robot. </p><p>Even when the series ended, there were  nuances of the show that fans wanted to delve back into, which a video game could help with. Since the show is more about stealth than murder (though there’s a fair amount of that too), it could be a great two-player game in which you and a partner extract intel to send back to Mother Russia, but it presents you both with different paths you must choose from that could ultimately lead you two to hate each other. The world will never get enough of spy games.</p></div><div><p>If guns, drugs, and the occasional wrestler-turned-gangster are what you are into, <em>Snowfall </em>is your show. The final piece of art the late John Singleton gave us is a gripping drama about a young man named Franklin Saint (Damson Idris) who starts selling drugs to get him and his mother out of the ‘hood. That is, until it turns into an empire and he becomes a power addict who destroys everything he loves. Watching Franklin devolve into a prisoner of his power by killing one of his best friends to prevent a gang war and then killing the father of the love of his life to prevent being arrested is truly heartbreaking. There’s also enough drive-by shootings, cocaine smuggling, and sex to make this a great <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>-style<em>&nbsp;</em>video game in which you can either play as Franklin or one of the numerous members of his empire to see where this gangster life will lead you.</p></div><div><p>The show that took <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sterling-k-brown-paradise-season-finale-hulu-season-2-1851767682&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sterling-k-brown-paradise-season-finale-hulu-season-2-1851767682">Sterling K. Brown’s badass levels</a></span> up to 100 has scenes  that I wanted to leap into my TV screen to participate in. Certain members of the U.S. government and private sector build a city inside of a Colorado mountain to escape an extinction-level event they knew was coming. The first season’s penultimate episode is already being hailed as the best TV episode of 2025 so far and contains a tense scene in which the President of the United States needs armed guards to make it out of the White House after he told America that the world is ending, and the government knew about it. In a video game, you could play as Secret Service agent Xavier Collins (Brown) and be tasked with getting the president through a mob of angry government officials without him being shot or assaulted.  Ratcheting up the stakes further, you also have to make sure you don’t lose the “nuclear football,” the briefcase device that allows the president to launch nuclear attacks. That’s just one of the exhilarating and video-game-ready scenarios from a show that has  survivors being killed by mercenaries, the sky itself getting hacked to flash messages, and some of the most emotional scriptwriting of any show this year.</p></div><div><p>Yes, we’re getting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-gameplay-showcase-survival-mmo-1851630351&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-awakening-gamescom-gameplay-showcase-survival-mmo-1851630351"><em>Dune: Awakening</em></a></span> game later this year, but that game won’t be focused on the strongest group of people in the <em>Dune </em>universe: The Bene Gesserit<em>. </em>The sensational HBO series <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-prophecy-finale-recap-desmond-hart-valya-harkonnen-1851727517&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-prophecy-finale-recap-desmond-hart-valya-harkonnen-1851727517"><em>Dune: Prophecy</em></a></span><em> </em>is mostly told from the perspective of this ancient sisterhood that acts as confidants and advisors to royal families while surreptitiously influencing powerful people in a way that keeps their secretive group close to power. We’ve seen them tap their fingers and peer into someone’s soul to see if they’re lying and use a powerful voice technique that can make almost anyone who hears it do what they say. The only person proven capable of withstanding the Voice is a man who was swallowed by a sandworm, operated on by thinking machines, and had devices implanted in his eyeballs that allow him to infect people with an airborne virus that burns them alive. </p><p>This would be the perfect basis for a game in which you choose your member of the Bene Gesserit, each with their unique skillset, and have to make nuanced interpersonal decisions with the intent of finding the messiah. Imagine using your voice to make the prince of the Atreides family marry the princess of the Harkonnen family simply because of their family names, and seeing it result in one of them killing the other because you didn’t spend enough time with them to know that their families have had a secret war going on for generations. This game would be like <em>The Sims </em>in space but with a lot more murder.</p></div><div><p>It’s a bit baffling that Amazon’s violent spin on superheroes isn’t on its third PlayStation game by now. <em>The Boys</em> is a fever dream of a series in which a ragtag anti-superhero militia known as the Boys works to stop the reign of the superhero consortium The Seven. The central appeal of the show is that, even while it’s focused on genetically modified super freaks who can do things no ordinary human being can do, it’s also grounded in human imperfections like jealousy, carnal temptations, and greed. It doesn’t let that humanity get in the way of over-the-top action, though. We’ve seen a protestor get his head lasered off, a man’s body ripped apart by a miniature person who crawled inside of him and then expanded, and a superhero orgy too graphic to even try to describe. With superhero video games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-netease-game-director-layoffs-season-2-1851765290&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-netease-game-director-layoffs-season-2-1851765290"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>popping up every two seconds and making a gazillion dollars, there’s no reason a similar type of game can’t be made within <em>The Boys</em> universe.</p></div><div><p>This should’ve happened a long time ago. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-the-batman-part-ii-questions-connections-1851693100&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-penguin-the-batman-part-ii-questions-connections-1851693100"><em>The Penguin</em></a></span> was one of the best TV shows of 2024 and a true testament to the wealth of possibilities contained within the <em>Batman</em> universe. Set after the events of Matt Reeves’ <em>The Batman</em> film, <em>The Penguin</em> focuses on how people like “Oz” Cobb (Colin Farrell) and Sofia Falcone (Cristin Milioti) try to fill the power gap in Gotham’s underworld left by the death of Carmine Falcone. The show’s titular character is the main star of the action, and we get to see how he’s as strategic as he is ruthless, willing to kill his closest partner so his enemies can’t exploit his love as a weakness. Thus far, whenever video games have let us travel through the seedy underbelly of Gotham it’s been as the Caped Crusader dishing out bone-breaking justice, but it would be just as fun to do so as the nefarious Penguin, trying to take out the crime families standing in his way as he’s determined to be somebody in this world. </p></div><div><p>When I realized the first season of <em>Creature Commandos </em>was done after only seven episodes that were under 30 minutes each, I was legitimately upset. You don’t want to leave a world in which a black ops team composed of non-human inmates from Belle Reve Penitentiary is assembled in an attempt to protect Princess Ilana Rostovic (Maria Bakalova), the rightful heir to the throne of Pokolistan. This ragtag team of misfits includes a radioactive walking skeleton, an undead Bride of Frankenstein, and a Nazi-hating killer robot, and that’s just the start. They’ve torn someone’s head off by punching through their headrest, had their limbs magically turned into balloon animals mid-fight, and had a rabid weasel tear through someone’s flesh. How could we not have fun running through the world with these agents of mayhem in a video game, violently ending more lives than we save?</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s positively massive, and you cannot man the entire vessel solo: even as the coolest yakuza in Hawaii you require a crew. In <em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>, your ship crew is split into two groups: Cannon Squad and Boarding Squad.</p><p>Your Cannon Squad is relatively self-explanatory. It’s the crew working the various cannons and weapons on your ship. However, the Boarding Squad is where running a pirate crew becomes slightly more complex. You see, it’s not a single squad: you have four. Each Boarding Squad consists of four members and a Squad Leader. As a Squad Leader, the assigned crew member has access to a unique ability that enhances their skills and, occasionally, yours.</p><h2 id="h1556013"><a id=""></a><strong>The best Boarding Squad Leader Traits in Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="0882672d979183fa4f45d565200414e9" data-recommend-id="image://0882672d979183fa4f45d565200414e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The mini-boss fight against Jason Rich in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The mini-boss fight against Jason Rich in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0882672d979183fa4f45d565200414e9" data-recommend-id="image://0882672d979183fa4f45d565200414e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The mini-boss fight against Jason Rich in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s a touch of strategy to the over-the-top beat ‘em up <em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>, especially regarding your pirate crew. When assigning Squad Leaders to your Boarding Squad, picking wisely from the roster means the difference between overtaking the competition and succumbing to Davy Jones’ Locker.</p><h3 id="h1556014"><a id=""></a><strong>Nishida: Indomitable Will Bonded</strong></h3><p>You’ll meet Nishida on Nele Island relatively early in the campaign, where he’s actively searching for Majima. Well, he finds the man. As it turns out, Nishida is one of the best healers in the game, thanks to his ability, Indomitable Will. It’s a Squad Leader trait that boosts healing, plus includes Shock Resistance. You’ll deal with Shock frequently during combat, making Nishida a staple for any pirate crew!</p><h3 id="h1556015"><a id=""></a><strong>Misaki: Succession of Will Bonded</strong></h3><p>Misaki, the daughter of Namioka, will join your pirate crew deeper into the game and, as expected, provides a nice buff to your Boarding Squad when assigned as a Squad Leader. Her ability, Succession of Will, boosts Attack Damage and increases the charge rate of the Voltage Gauge, which allows your support units to utilize powerful abilities mid-combat.</p><h3 id="h1556016"><a id=""></a><strong>Masaru Fujita: Marine Cuisine Bonded</strong></h3><p>The first crewmember you’ll recruit in <em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>, Masaru Fujita, is another of the most powerful to assign to your Boarding Squad. His ability, Marine Cuisine, boosts attack power for everyone in his squad and increases Poison Resistance. Now, you won’t deal with Poison frequently, but when you do, it’s a painful, annoying experience that will make you beg for higher resistance!</p><h3 id="h1556017"><a id=""></a><strong>Jason Rich: Hunter’s Knowledge Bonded</strong></h3><p>As one of the first crewmates you’ll unlock, alongside Masaru Fujita, Jason Rich also offers one of the strongest Squad Leader Traits in the game. As you level Jason and his abilities become more powerful, you’ll note that his Squad Leader Trait, Hunter’s Knowledge, is genuinely one of the best in the game. It provides a significant buff to attack and defense, while also boosting firearms resistance to the entire squad.</p><hr><p><em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em> is easily one of the wildest experiences on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2025 so far, so long as you don’t mind the lengthy story and side content!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
