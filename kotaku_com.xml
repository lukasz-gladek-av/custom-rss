              <p>Building a desktop PC from scratch, or upgrading your CPU? We’ve found a deal that lets you pick a strong motherboard without overspending.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6545/">The Asus ROG Strix B550-F Gaming WiFi II – an option that offers exceptional power and great gaming features – is currently available for just $120 at Amazon, down from its usual $180 price.</a> This is one of the lowest we have seen this motherboard drop to, but as you’d expect, the offer wraps up soon. It’s best to get your orders in sooner rather than later, before that happens. Note that the package is likely going to arrive after Christmas. If you were planning to surprise a gamer or a creative in your life with it, keep the shipping timeline in mind.</p>

<h2>Feature-Rich</h2>
<p>This motherboard is an excellent option for AMD Ryzen 3000 and 5000 series, as well as 5000 and 4000 G-series desktop processors. The thoughtful 14-phase VRM design (12 main and 2 auxiliary) lets it handle the powerful options well without overheating, making it great for anyone looking to work with resource-intensive programs and heavier projects frequently. It supports Windows 11, plus allows for up to 128GB of RAM, which is more than enough to handle serious multitasking.</p>
<p>Build quality is just as exceptional, with RGB lighting adding a nice aesthetic touch to the setup. The feature-rich board is also PCIe 4.0-ready, which translates into faster data transfer speeds, especially when paired with a high-end NVMe SSD. You will be able to load games, launch apps, and move files (even the larger ones) around without waiting long. What’s more, WiFi 6E (802.11ax) and Intel 2.5 Gb Ethernet with ASUS LANGuard come together to ensure smooth networking. On the other hand, ports like dual M.2 slots, USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-C, plus HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.2 outputs make it convenient to connect other devices for a fuller, more productive setup.</p>



<p>The box includes the motherboard itself, an ASUS 2×2 dual Wi-Fi antenna, an addressable RGB extension cable, a user manual, a support CD, and an ROG sticker pack. The bundle also includes a 60-day subscription to AIDA64 Extreme.</p>
<p>All things considered, if you’ve been looking for a solid motherboard to add to your setup without breaking the bank, the Asus ROG Strix B550-F Gaming WiFi II is one of the best options to consider. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6545/">We’d highly recommend it at its full $180 price, but the current 33% discount makes it much more affordable and, honestly, a no-brainer.</a> The $120 asking is nothing compared to all the features it’s packed with. Just be sure to snap it up quickly, because the deal is selling out fast. Place your orders before it expires, or before the stock runs out for good.</p>

              <p>If you want to be recognized as a serious creator, it is essential to give your audio the attention it deserves. Whether you’re conducting street interviews or recording reaction videos for platforms like TikTok, your audience will notice the sound quality. Even if it’s on a subconscious level, poor audio can make your content feel low-budget. In fact, I’d argue that audio quality is even more important than video quality in some cases, even though it might sound counterintuitive. Investing in a high-quality wireless lavalier microphone setup can drastically improve the sound in your videos. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6544/">A great option to consider is the DJI Mic 3 kit, which is currently 21% off, bringing the price down from $329 to $259—an impressive $70 discount.</a></p>
<p>The DJI Mic 3 kit includes two transmitters, a wireless receiver, and a charging case. All the components come pre-linked, so they’re ready to use right out of the box. The system is also compatible with USB-C and Lightning adapters, which are included in the package, giving you more connectivity options for various devices. You can clip the transmitter to your shirt, your hat, I suppose just hold it between your fingers which is now becoming the norm on TikTok and Instagram.</p>

<h2>Intelligent Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>These microphones support intelligent noise-canceling, allowing the them to capture clear vocals in detailed 32-bit audio while minimizing unwanted background noise. These mics can handle unpredictable environments like busy streets or crowded convention halls. Plus, the kit comes with two windscreens to further reduce the interference of wind noises when you’re filming outdoors.</p>
<p>The DJI Mic 3 system provides an impressive wireless range of over 1,300 feet, giving you greater freedom to shoot in various locations without worrying about losing signal. This extended range allows you to move around with more flexibility.</p>



<p>Battery life is another major selling point. Both the transmitters and the receiver can operate for up to 28 hours, ensuring you’ll have plenty of power for extended shoots. The included charging case acts as a portable power bank, capable of recharging the mics when you’re on the go. If you’re only using one transmitter at a time, you can keep the second one in the case and swap it in when the first one runs low on battery. The case is compact, fitting all the components neatly together, making it easy to pack up when you’re done filming.</p>
<p>If you’re ready to upgrade from your phone’s built-in microphone to a more professional setup, the DJI Mic 3 lavalier kit is a solid choice. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6544/">For just $259, you’ll get two transmitters, the receiver, a charging case, and other accessories—at a significant discount.</a> Don’t miss out on this opportunity to improve your audio and take your content creation to professional levels.</p>
