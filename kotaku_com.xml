              <p><span>Anime and nerd conventions have plenty of ingrained traditions that transcend any one gathering.

He leads the boy band in a battle for hearts and minds against Huntr/x, but is slowly won over to the light side by his connection to Rumi. Progress isn’t linear, though, as he does end up betraying her in the lead-up to the final showdown and nearly feeds all of Seoul’s kpop fans to Gwi-ma, the demon king. As </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-songs-animal-crossing-youtube-stream-2000618416"><span>Huntr/x</span></a><span> faces the demons in one last musical battle, Gwi-ma nearly defeats Rumi with a massive, soul-powered energy blast, only for Jinu to stand between them and take the blast himself. As he dies, he tells Rumi that she set him free and gave him his soul back, which he leaves to her to finish the fight.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Yeah, redemption arcs are great and all, but my babies didn’t even get to kiss. “Are they lovers?

The anchor of these displays is usually a memorial photo of Jinu, which is then surrounded by offerings such as stickers, notes, and even empty soda cans and bottles as a reference to Saja Boys’ breakout hit “Soda Pop.”&nbsp;</span></p>              <p><span>R.I.P. to a real one, but even as fans mourn Jinu, there’s another subset of them who believe the demon diva may come back in the inevitable sequel, as the film implies his soul lives within Rumi’s sword which she uses to defeat Gwi-ma. But until I see him fully re-materialize and give Rumi a kiss on the forehead, I’d better keep seeing memorials for him at every convention.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-1tb-sandisk-ssd-is-nearly-free-amazon%E2%80%99s-going-crazy-for-back-to-school.1280649/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Having an external SSD on hand to back up important documents or photos is a good idea. With the possibilities of theft or hacking, you can never be too careful. That is why companies such as <em>SanDisk</em> remain a top choice when it comes to reliable storage devices.</p>
<p>If you need an external SSD with excellent performance, the 1TB storage capacity places itself in the sweet spot for most users. And thanks to Amazon’s Back to School sale, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3731/">you can now grab the SanDisk 1TB Extreme Portable SSD at an all-time low of about $99 (down from $129)</a>. Larger models such as the 2TB and 4TB also receive price cuts in the neighborhood of 25/35%.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3731/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>High Speed Storage</h2>
<p>The SanDisk 1TB SSD <strong>boasts up to 1050MB/s read speeds and write speeds that are only a hair behind, at around 1000MB/s</strong>. That kind of speed is ideal for quick transfer of big files. With USB 3.2 Gen 2 interface via USB-C, you can plug this drive directly into newer laptops or even certain tablets and smartphones with ease. The speedy data transfer rate means less waiting about so you can get on with what matters.</p>
<p>This drive carries an IP65 rating so it’s <strong>water and dustproof</strong> to a reasonable extent. That gives you extra confidence if you’re carrying it around in a backpack or briefcase. It may become splashed or dusty but that will not prevent your data from remaining secure. It is also lightweight, measuring approximately 4 inches long and half an inch thick so it will not occupy much space when traveling.</p>



<p>The drive<strong> features 256-bit AES encryption</strong> with password protection which is easily manageable with free SanDisk software. It keeps your files locked down to unauthorized access even if your drive for some reason gets misplaced. All you need to keep in mind is that this security feature functions optimally with Windows and macOS; some phones might not support it totally.</p>
<p>It supports a wide range of operating systems, including Windows 10 and newer, macOS 10.13+, and plenty of USB Type-C capable devices. And in addition, the drive is powered by the bus, which means you won’t need an extra power cable — all you do is plug into the USB port and you’re ready to roll.</p>
<p>The construction is solid without being blocky and <strong>SanDisk offers a five-year limited warranty</strong>. That provides some added peace of mind if you’re planning on relying on this drive as your workday driver, school driver, or personal project driver. Speed, reliability, and resilience all coexist in neat package form in a easily pocketed or bagged form.</p>
<p>Don’t miss your chance to get it here:</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Lenovo Laptop (12GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Office 365) Is 85% Off, Amazon Clears Inventory for Summer’s End]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-lenovo-laptop-12gb-ram-512gb-ssd-office-365-is-85-off-amazon-clears-inventory-for-summers-end-2000620309</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-lenovo-laptop-12gb-ram-512gb-ssd-office-365-is-85-off-amazon-clears-inventory-for-summer%E2%80%99s-end.1280595/</guid>

              <p>With Amazon’s <em>Back to School</em> discounts currently in full swing, there’s one notebook that looks almost too good to be true: the <strong>2025</strong> <strong>Lenovo IdeaPad 15.6″</strong> with a solid mid-range spec (12GB RAM, 512GB SSD, Intel Celeron N4500, Office 365 for one year, Windows 11 Home) for a record low price. Amazon is likely clearing out old inventory, likely without making a single penny in profit, and that makes you the beneficiary of a deal that’s too great to pass up.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3723/">computer usually costs around $2,400 but today Amazon reduced its price to as low as $349</a>: That’s an 85% discount, and<strong> you’ll be saving around two thousand dollars on a brand-new computer</strong>. You’re spending less than most individuals spend on a smartphone at this price point, but you’re receiving a full Windows computer bundled with a one-year subscription of Microsoft Office 365.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3723/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Student Laptop</h2>
<p>Specs do matter, even in a budget-friendly machine, and this Lenovo is far from stripped down: It’s <strong>powered by an Intel Celeron N4500 processor.</strong> Although it’s not for serious gaming, it’s perfectly suited to day-to-day productivity tasks such as word processing, spreadsheets and streaming television shows. The inclusion of 12GB of DDR4 RAM is a difference-maker: multitasking is so much more responsive than the 4GB or 8GB of memory you typically find in this price category.</p>
<p>A fast <strong>512GB PCIe SSD</strong> gives you speed and space which means Windows boots in a flash, programs load in a flash and still having space for a large collection of school work, work documents, or entertainment media. In addition to the SSD, there’s also a <strong>secondary 128GB eMMC</strong> that gives you additional space to work with light files or backups.</p>



<p>The 15.6-inch HD display features anti-glare coating so your eyes don’t get as tired during extended study sessions. Paired with Dolby Audio dual speakers, you’ll enjoy more immersion when streaming or Zoom calls. You even receive a built-in HD 720p camera with a privacy shutter which is surprisingly rare on laptops in this price range.</p>
<p>Connectivity is also a plus point: <strong>USB-C, USB-A, HDMI, an SD card reader, and an audio combo jack</strong> are all present and give you all the ports you’ll need to have accessories and external storage easily attached. <strong>Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2</strong> are integrated within so wireless speed and dependability are on tap for both online classes and easy Netflix streaming.</p>
<p>Discounts this intense rarely stick, and since Amazon is clearly liquidating excess stock, make sure you don’t miss it.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-bose-tv-soundbar-is-40-off-at-a-new-record-low-amazon-goes-nuts-for-labor-day-2000620323</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-bose-tv-soundbar-is-40-off-at-a-new-record-low-amazon-goes-nuts-for-labor-day.1280550/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Soundbars are one of those products that tend to feel too expensive. Most models easily surpass the $500 threshold and even then the sound doesn’t always quite live up to expectations. That’s why Bose has built a lot of trust in this space: the company is able to get people affordable gear with an emphasis on immersive audio.</p>
<p>Right now, their popular Bose TV Speaker is available on Amazon at a price that’s actually a record-breaking one: The current <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/">deal is bringing this model down from $279 to about $163 which is a 41% discount</a> and the cheapest it has ever been according to <em>CamelCamelCamel</em>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Soundbar and TV Speaker</h2>
<p>At slightly over 23 inches wide and just over 2 inches tall, this Bose soundbar is a compact addition that can sit in front of your TV without blocking the screen,or be mounted on a wall if you prefer a streamlined setup. Inside its compact body, it houses two angled full-range drivers that create a wider and more enveloping soundstage than the usual built-in TV speakers can offer.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever struggled to hear mumbling actors or drowned-out lines during action scenes, this speaker directly addresses that with specialized tuning. With the remote supplied, you can go even further and allow dialogue mode, cutting through words spoken even more sharply without boosting everything else. You also get a bass boost button thrown in for a little more low-end oomph when you need it.</p>



<p>Connectivity is simple, you’ll love it: You can pair it with your TV using an optical cable (included in the box) or an HDMI-ARC connection if your TV supports it. Set-up is just minutes without having to wrestle with complicated menus. Then there’s the Bose TV speaker having Bluetooth integrated so you can pair your phone or tablet to stream music and podcasts directly without needing to go near the TV. Three units are provided to be connected through optical, HDMI, and AUX inputs and the system auto-connects to the very first powered-on source.</p>
<p>For $163, this Bose soundbar provides anyone with an easy way to greatly improve TV. That’s why tracking Amazon sales is well worth it—because when something sets an all-time low price, it’s the perfect time to buy.</p>
