              <p>The second-best thing about being a <i>Mario </i>fan is that bad <i>Mario </i>games are exceedingly rare. But the first best thing about being a <i>Mario </i>fan is that <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i> exists. Whew, what a damn game. It’s a franchise entry that manages to be both wondrously inventive and comfortably familiar, setting the bar almost insurmountably high for any platformer that dares to follow it over the next few decades.</p> <p>As of right now, <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i> remains my favorite platformer of all time—and if you’ve played it, there’s a reasonably high chance you already agree. If not, however, you may be looking to see what our favorite plumber’s most ambitious game is all about. And with that comes curiosity about how long it may take to see things through. Well, I’ve got some good news for you: It’s beefy! Let’s take a look at just <i>how</i> beefy. But first, let’s talk about whether or not you can expect a better experience on the newer Switch 2.</p>  <p>We have great news for you if you’re hoping to enjoy <i>Odyssey </i>on the Switch 2. Via a free update for the Switch 2, <i>Odyssey</i> has never looked better. In its original presentation on the first Switch, handheld mode perhaps suffered the worst, with an incredibly low resolution that made for a rough image at times. The stronger hardware of the Switch 2 combined with the new update makes for a dramatically better experience. The framerate is also more reliable in the game’s busier, open-world city environments. Take a look at the game in motion here:</p>

You won’t need to collect all 999 Power Moons or every purple coin in each world to complete <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i>, but it’s all there for you to chase down if you want to. <b>For a basic run-through, though, you’ll only need around 12-14 hours</b>.</p> <p>If you’re like me and need to earn every costume in the game (they’re all awesome) and see that Power Moon counter hit one number below a thousand, you’ve got a whole lot more game to see. <b>Fully completing </b><b><i>Super Mario Odyssey</i></b><b> can take upwards of 40 hours</b>—perhaps even longer for those who take things at a leisurely pace or struggle with some of its more challenging sequences.</p> <p>Whether you just want to check it out casually or take things all the way to 100%, you need to check out <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i> right away. I give it my highest recommendation. And you can trust me. My dad works at Nintendo.</p> <hr> <p><i>Super Mario Odyssey</i> is available now on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

              <p>Oh, thank goodness! <em>Alien: Earth</em>, Disney’s megabucks TV series set just before the events of the original&nbsp;<em>Alien</em> movie, is just brilliant. Showrunner, writer, and director Noah Hawley has created something truly special: a show that feels utterly built from the DNA of Ridley Scott’s earliest vision, but with the non-stop thrills of James Cameron’s <em>Aliens</em> sequel. And crucially, unlike every other film in the franchise since the first two, it remembers that this is a story about the hearts of the characters, rather than just the events happening to them. Here are my thoughts on the first two episodes.</p> <p><em>Alien: Earth</em> makes a very interesting opening decision. You might think, given how the&nbsp;<em>Alien&nbsp;</em>sequels have all flailed under comparisons to the first two films, that Hawley would want to immediately put his own stamp on the show. The creator of the extraordinary TV series <em>Fargo</em> and <em>Legion</em> has a distinct approach, so surely the smart move is to hit that hard as we begin? But no, a far braver choice is made. The opening few minutes of&nbsp;<em>Alien: Earth</em> are an astonishing recreation of Scott’s style, complete with a cynical and tired crew bantering around a table, sniping, mocking, talking over one another. Tensions and relationships are instantly established for the beleaguered crew you already know are about to die as their research vessel containing multiple alien specimens crash-lands onto Earth. It all looks and breathes like a perfect piece of 1970s science fiction. And in achieving this, the show immediately feels <em>right</em>. This is the&nbsp;<em>Alien</em> we love, not the weirdly incongruous blandness of <i>Covenant</i> or the dreadful misfires of <em>Alien 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Alien Resurrection</em>.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617445" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617445"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617445">© FX / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This is then put into stark contrast by the events on Earth. While the crashing ship, the Maginot, is owned and operated by the Weyland-Yutani corporation, it crashes into a towering city owned by another company called Prodigy. Because, as we learn in the show’s opening banter on board the ship, the Earth in 2120 is controlled by four corporations, and it’s soon to be five. We learn that Weyland-Yutani owns North and South America, but we’re yet to be told about the rest–although we’re quickly introduced to the new force to be reckoned with, Prodigy. Created by the youngest-ever trillionaire, Boy Kavalier (Samuel Blenkin), Prodigy owns at least a large city in New Siam and vast research island, and is about to make a major breakthrough regarding synthetics–the androids with the gooey white blood from those first films. Kavalier has developed a way to transfer the consciousness from pre-teen children into the bodies of synths, and as we join the facility on Neverland Island, Kavalier is preparing to try it for the first time, moving the mind of terminal cancer patient Marcy Hermit (Florence Bensberg) into an adult synth body, where she renames herself Wendy (Sydney Chandler).</p>

 <p>And yes, let’s pause to address all this Peter Pan business. Eeehhh, this TV show is about as close to perfect as you could hope for, but if I had to pick at something, it’d be this. It’s wildly heavy-handed (indeed, all the names are pretty painfully on-the-nose–“Kavalier” for our move-fast-break-things trillionaire, “Hermit” for our girl about to be moved into a new shell…), to the point where clips of the Disney cartoon are repeatedly shown and we even get Kavalier reading out loud from the book. She’s Wendy, it’s Neverland… good grief, we get it. They’re children who get to live forever, I guess? Except, of course, the point of the book is they stay children, but here they’re intended to mature into adults. It feels deeply cumbersome. But honestly, that’s my only complaint.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617447" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617447"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617447">© FX / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Prodigy rapidly moves ahead with transferring a bunch of dying kids into adult bodies, all now living under the mentorship of more traditional synthetic Kirsh (Timothy Olyphant), moments before the Maginot crashes into the base of two skyscrapers in Prodigy City. A search and rescue team of Prodigy employees is instantly dispatched, including a medic who happens to be Joe Hermit (Alex Lawther), brother to Wendy. And, of course, the alien specimens got out.</p> <p>What follows is a lot of extremely good, proper&nbsp;<em>Alien</em> business, or terrified humans with guns moving through dimly lit corridors that very probably contain monsters. It’s especially enjoyable here because so much is completely unknown. We know the Maginot was carrying Xenomorphs at many phases, from egg to Facehugger to full-grown Xenomorph XX121s, but we’re also aware there’s some fucking eyeball-with-tentacles thing in there, along with various other alien species we’ve never seen before. And while we’re left in no doubt that the Xeno is still the worst of the bunch, none of them seems vaguely friendly.</p>

 <p>But this is elevated by the show’s central, most abhorrent and chilling aspect: some super-rich 20-something just put a bunch of 10 to 12-year-olds’ minds into super-powered adult bodies, and then sent them into danger.</p>  <p>The body-swap between child and adult is a beloved formula, and almost always played for laughs. From&nbsp;<em>Big</em> to&nbsp;<em>Freaky Friday</em>, the notion is wrung for humor (even if you do get something as deeply troubling as <em>Big</em>‘s 13-year-old boy losing his virginity to an adult woman). So when you first see Marcy become Wendy, there’s that jovial sense to it. Firstly, she’s not going to die as a just-turned-12-year-old any more, and that’s wonderful, but also you’ve got an adult actor acting like a kid. At one point she grabs her boobs and declares how <em>weird</em> they are, how they move around while she’s running. The program is very clearly playing with those body-swap tropes, telling us how jolly this all is. After a bunch of the kids have been put into the adult synth bodies, there’s a wonderful scene in which they’re all sitting around chatting in a common area, a room of adult actors moving and talking like children. Jonathan Ajayi especially shines at this, his leg movements incredibly familiar for anyone with a kid with ADHD, but it’s all delivered without pantomime. It feels wrong, because body-swaps always feel wrong, but we’re being told how right it is throughout.</p>

 <p>But it’s so wrong! This isn’t being done with families around them, or friends from their previous lives, and they certainly don’t have appropriate adult supervision or counselling. They’re experiments, their former terminal diagnoses and separation from their families clearly designed to make them disposable should something go wrong. Wendy’s compulsion to find her older brother once more seems to test the adults, unsure whether to prevent it for the project’s secrecy, but ultimately driven to let it play out purely for the test results. It’s grotesquely mercenary, and the second episode switches to endlessly reminding us of this, as we see these adult shells acting like utterly terrified kids in the face of alien danger.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000617448" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617448"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617448">© FX / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Almost everything is shot perfectly. In fact, <em>Alien: Earth</em> feels like the final obliteration of any difference between film and television, its massive-budget movie quality and ultra-widescreen format giving it the sense of being cinematic at all times. The only sop to traditional television at any point is a peculiar flashback to Marcy’s childhood, which sticks out like a sore thumb among the rest of the format. It would be incredible to be able to go watch these weekly episodes on the big screen, and god knows, movie theaters could use the custom.</p>

 <p>What’s also so exciting is to think where this program could be going next. The claustrophobic events in the ruined ship and destroyed apartments make up most of the second episode, but clearly this is soon to head outside. There’s surely no chance of containing this incident, and it’s going to be extraordinary to see how the corporations address the outbreak. The other aspect to think about is the words from the first episode’s opening text.</p> <p>In the future, the race for immortality will come in 3 guises:</p> <blockquote><p>Cybernetically enhanced humans:&nbsp;<em>Cyborgs</em></p> <p>Artificially intelligent beings:&nbsp;<em>Synths</em></p> <p>and</p> <p>Synthetic beings downloaded with human consciousness:&nbsp;<em>Hybrids</em></p></blockquote> <p>While the program has already featured all three, and we see the terrifying capabilities of Weyland-Yutani cyborg Morrow (Babou Ceesay), there’s yet to be any sense of how the various corporations are looking to ensure their creations become the dominant force. It’s surely to come.</p> <p>In&nbsp;<em>Alien: Earth</em>, Hawley et al have done something that seemed so impossible for the last 40 years–combine the terror of <em>Alien</em> and the thrill of&nbsp;<em>Aliens</em>, while keeping humans as the focus of the story. Not even Ridley Scott could come close in his two glum prequels. But in FX’s TV show, it’s all there, with an amazing eight more hours of it to come.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><em>Grounded 2</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-xboxs-big-summer-2025-showcase-1851784007">arrived in Early Access</a> just three years after the first game hit 1.0. The surprise sequel caught many fans off-guard. Why make a new game instead of just updating the older one? <a href="https://kotaku.com/obsidian-grounded-avowed-outer-worlds-game-pass-xbox-1851760964">And how did Obsidian Entertainment</a> develop <em>Grounded</em> 2 so quickly, launching its Early Access version the same year it will have shipped two massive RPGs in <em>Avowed</em> and <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>? The answer has a lot to do with <em>Deus Ex</em> and <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> maker Eidos Montreal.</p> <p>The veteran AAA studio isn’t just a co-developer on<em> Grounded 2</em>, it turns out. “The majority of the heavy lifting is done in Eidos Montreal,” Obsidian game director Chris Parker <a href="https://www.polygon.com/grounded-2-developer-interview-obsidian-entertainment-eidos-montreal/">recently told <em>Polygon</em></a>. “We have a core group of people here [at Obsidian], primarily the folks that worked on <em>Grounded</em>, of course. And then there’s folks like me, acting as game director, who are working day in and day out with Eidos. The artists and designers and engineers, the vast majority are at Eidos Montreal.”</p> <p>That’s not to say that both teams didn’t work closely together. There was constant cross collaboration according to Eidos creative director Justin Vazquez, including big build reviews every few months and alignment on the sequel’s emphasis on narrative and Early Access scope. “<em>Grounded</em> is Obsidian’s IP,” he told <em>Polygon</em>. “It’s their baby, and we are here to work with them to help grow the franchise together. The point isn’t for us to grab it and just run wild with it, so we collaborate on everything on the highest level of ideas and the lowest level. There isn’t anything that isn’t being touched by both studios to ensure that we are delivering the best experience for our players on&nbsp;<em>Grounded 2</em>.”</p>

 <p>As for why make <em>Grounded 2</em> in the first place, both developers pointed to technical limitations of the Xbox One and the desire to push the ambitiousness of the series following the success of <em>Grounded 1</em>. It’s also clear that, while currently much smaller than the previous game, which hit version 1.4 last year, <em>Grounded 2</em> is a lot more streamlined and approachable. The rough edges have really been sanded down without sacrificing much in the way of RPG crafting depth. It also just looks a lot more detailed and vibrant visually. <em>Grounded 2</em> has already <a href="https://x.com/aarongreenberg/status/1955458077597348194">hit 3 million players</a> across Xbox and PC (it’s available through Game Pass on both).</p> <p>All of that suggests that Microsoft’s gambit of having Obsidian essentially outsource much of the sequel to an outside studio has paid off. It helps that <em>Grounded</em> was made with Unreal Engine rather than a set of in-house proprietary tools. Does this mean that Microsoft can find partnerships to help speed up development of its other franchises as well. The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-6-infinite-unreal-engine-ue5-ce-remake-343-1851666611">revealed last year</a> that <em>Halo</em> would also be moving to UE5, with more information on the future of that series <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-wc-october-remake-remaster-news-trailer-rumor-xbox-1851785384">coming in October</a>. With<a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/bethesda-is-allegedly-working-on-multiple-fallout-games-including-fallout-3-remastered-teases-report/"> rumors also circulating</a> of possibly multiple new <em>Fallout</em> games in development as well, what are the odds that Obsidian or Bethesda could work with an outside studio on one of them next? After Bethesda successfully <a href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remastered-virtuos-layoffs-cyberpunk-patch-1851786435">partnered with Virtuos on the UE5 <em>Oblivion</em>&nbsp;remaster</a>, a similar eventual update to<em> Fallout 3</em> seems all but inevitable.</p> <p>These efforts don’t always bear fruit. Microsoft also <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-reportedly-cancels-that-cool-looking-perfect-dark-1851785531">canceled <em>Perfect Dark</em> this year</a>, which was a collaboration between the smaller first-party team at the now defunct Initiative and Crystal Dynamics. But the pipeline that delivered <em>Grounded 2</em>, at least the Early Access version of it, seems like one that could potentially limit <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-releases-delays-2023-botw2-starfield-suicide-squad-1849840981">some of the ever-lengthening lead times</a> between new games in the increasing number of Microsoft exclusive-franchises that have resulted from industry consolidation.</p>
