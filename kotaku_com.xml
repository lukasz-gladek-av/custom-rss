              <p>Good lighting can really bring your entire gaming and entertainment setup together. If you’re looking to enjoy a more immersive visual experience with your screen, where the entire room lights up during action-packed scenes and settles into a calm vibe when something peaceful is playing, a smart lighting strip is what you need.</p>
<p>Depending on the features you’re after, these can cost a pretty penny, but that changes today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6368/">The 65-inch Philips Hue Play Gradient Smart TV light strip is currently going for just $130 at Amazon, after a whopping 56% or $167 discount.</a> It’s the lowest we have seen these lights drop to in a long, long while, and you’ll also enjoy free shipping with your purchase. These are sure to make holiday movie nights a lot more fun – just be sure to get your orders in before the price goes back up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6368/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Millions of LED Multi-Color Lights</h2>
<p>The box comes with a one White and Color Ambiance 65-inch TV smart LED light strip with mounting brackets. It attaches to the back of your screen (just below the corners) safely using the brackets. This deal applies to the 65-inch version, but you can also get the 55-inch and 75-inch sizes, depending on the size of your TV. Both versions are discounted, going for $142 and $255, respectively. Note that the lighting strips need to be paired with a Hue bridge and sync box (both sold separately) to unlock their full potential. If you don’t have those already, now is a good time to snap them up, too, as several Philips Hue products are going for less at Amazon.</p>



<p>Once everything is up, the strip offers both warm-to-cool white and millions of LED multi-color lights to choose from. The colors blend perfectly into each other, while the 45-degree angle light projector casts the stunning gradient of light onto the wall behind your TV. Of course, syncing abilities are the highlight here, as they make the lights react to whatever’s happening on screen in real time, whether you’re watching a show, playing a game, or just listening to your favorite music. Watching a Stranger Things episode? Expect your living room to light up with some Eleven magic. Thrilling, action-packed games with a shooting sequence are going to put up a light show, while LoFi songs are going to fill the space with calm vibes. It’s great for both solo streaming sessions, movie nights with friends, plus fun New Year’s parties.</p>
<p>Voice control is supported, meaning you won’t always have to adjust settings or manage the lights manually via the dedicated app. It plays nicely with Alexa and Google Assistant, so you can say something like “Hey Alexa, turn the lights on”, or “Hey Alexa, increase the brightness”, and your command will be answered in seconds. The Hue Bridge brings even more convenience by letting you add motion sensors, set routines, create timers, and more. There’s a lot more to like about this smart lighting strip. It does more than adding lights to your setup; it creates a vibe. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6368/">The current deal lets you pick the 65-inch version for $130, after an impressive 56% discount.</a> Other sizes are discounted too, so there are options to choose from. Deals this good tend to wrap up soon, so it’s best to grab yours without wasting a lot of time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-clears-out-elite-series-2-core-gaming-controllers-at-their-lowest-price-to-compete-with-playstation-and-switch-2000653005</link>
            <guid>1381807</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve already bought an Xbox for the holidays, there are a couple of small issues you thankfully still have time to address. One, it comes with one controller, so if you’re in a multi-player home, that’s going to be an issue. Two, that default controller is good — but it’s not&nbsp;<em>great</em>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B07SFKTLZM/?tag=kotaku01-20">The Xbox Elite Series 2 wireless controller that’s on sale for 33% off right now at Amazon?</a> Indisputably great, so you can get that second controller&nbsp;<em>and</em> a pro gaming experience at the same time by taking this $135 deal. The Elite 2 works with Xbox One, Series S, and Series X, and also works for PC gaming.</p>

 <h2>Premium Feel</h2> <p>The upgrade from the default Xbox controller to the Elite 2 is obvious from the second you take it out of the box. It’s slightly thicker and has a heavier feel, but just enough heft that it feels sturdy and well-built. The rubberized grips give you a feeling of secure control, and overall it’s ergonomically outstanding, designed for long sessions.</p>

 <p>The construction already sets the Elite 2 apart from the default Xbox controller and third-party versions, but where it really takes off into the stratosphere is when you get to customize it. The tension on the thumbsticks can be finely adjusted, and the triggers are shorter and faster for an edge in shooters and battle royals. The thumbsticks, d-pads and paddles are all swappable, so it’s as close to custom-designing a controller for yourself as you can find.</p>

 <p>Take the customization further by using the Xbox Accessories app on the console or on a PC to remap buttons, set up multiple profiles and custom stick curves, and even assign macros. The profiles can be stored on the Elite 2 itself so you can change them on the fly, which means you can set up different ones for different games.</p>

 <h2>Endurance Level Battery</h2> <p>Where the default Xbox controller is powered by AA batteries and also somewhat notorious for chewing through them at a rapid rate, the Elite 2 is rechargeable. You get up to 40 hours of gameplay on a single charge, and the USB-C charging dock is included. You can game all day and rest the Elite 2 on its dock by night to ensure you’ll have a full charge every time you fire up the console or PC.</p> <p>The upgrades from the default controller to the Elite 2 are staggering, so much so that it’ll entirely reshape how you play. Even if you’re not in need of a second controller, upgrading to the Elite 2 and keeping the default controller on hand as a backup is a smart move. Now’s the time to make the switch — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B07SFKTLZM/?tag=kotaku01-20">Amazon’s 33% off deal brings the Xbox Elite Series 2 wireless controller with its charger and swappable components down to a very reasonable $135.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[What Did You Think Of The Game Awards 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/what-did-you-think-of-the-game-awards-2025-2000653017</link>
            <guid>1381804</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Another Game Awards showcase <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-the-2025-game-awards-2000652719">has come and gone</a>. What did you think? Did you stay up and watch or just skim the highlights on social media? Did the right games win in the right categories? Did any of the “world premier” trailer reveals make you feel like Geoff Keighley’s event earned its nearly four-hour runtime? Consider this an open thread to chat, joke, and share your thoughts.</p> <p>I’ll start. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">won more awards than any game in TGA history</a>. Personally, while I love the game and think it warrants the hype, that seems a bit overblown. Will it stand the test of time like formative winners including <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Elden Ring</em>, and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>? I suspect not, but maybe not reinventing the wheel shouldn’t be held against it. It’s the game of the moment and this is the awards show for 2025.</p>

 <p>At the very least, it <a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070">shouldn’t have won best indie game</a>. I blame the TGA jury for that one. If one of the goals of the show is to highlight as many of the year’s best games as possible, maybe one game shouldn’t be able to win “best game” across multiple categories. If you picked <em>Clair Obscur</em> for GOTY, it can’t also win “best RPG” or “best debut indie game.” It would prevent sweeps like this, which, even if deserved, end up being kind of boring and leave so many other amazing games underrepresented on the big stage.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Give it up in the chat for Miss Piggy and Rowlf the Dog! 👏👏<a href="https://twitter.com/TheMuppets?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@TheMuppets</a> never let us down! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheGameAwards?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheGameAwards</a> <a href="https://t.co/XY6VxHLiYa">pic.twitter.com/XY6VxHLiYa</a></p> <p>— The Game Awards (@thegameawards) <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/1999322500824445285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>And what about the reveals? Keighley tried to pull another <em>Okami 2</em>-style rabbit out of his hat with <a href="https://kotaku.com/mega-man-dual-override-trailer-capcom-2000652829"><em>Mega Man Dual Overdrive</em></a> (aka<em> Mega Man 12</em>). As someone who grew up on games in the NES-era, <em>Mega Man 3</em> gave me a daily ass-kicking for years, it sort of worked. That game isn’t coming until 2027 though, and didn’t look nearly as solid or revelatory in the gameplay and art than I’d expect for the Blue Bomber’s prodigal return. Insiders promise Capcom is cooking but they have their work cut out for them.</p>

 <p>The show also seemed light on some of those known quantities that bring a special X factor to a showcase like this. No Nintendo wasn’t surprising. Sony showed showed more<em> Saros</em> but that doesn’t quite pop has much as more <em>Wolverine</em> or a new <em>God of War</em> would have. Microsoft, Square Enix, Ubisoft, and the rest of the big publishers were absent too. The big show stoppers, a new&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em> RPG from Larian Studios and a new <em>Star Wars: The Old Republic</em> spin-off from ex-BioWare director Casey Hudson, are games I can’t wait to play but whose reveals were muted a bit by brief cinematic teasers that shared a vibe but not a story.</p> <p>In many ways, this might have been the smoothest and most slickly produced Game Awards yet. It also, for some reason, felt like one of the least memorable. Will see if that gut assessment holds up a couple years from now. What did you think?</p>

              <p>While the main show of The Game Awards featured some big reveals and cinematic extravaganzas, it was during the pre-show that the real star appeared. An action-platform game called <em>Bradley the Badger</em>, that looks to be four-dimensional folding layers of meta about gaming, with multiple jovial jabs taken at names like&nbsp;<em>The Last Of Us</em>,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and&nbsp;<em>Dark Souls</em>.</p> <p>Beginning with the conceit that we’re already big, nostalgic fans of Bradley, a cheerfully-colored mascot platforming character who’d be right at home in the PS2 era, <em>Bradley the Badger</em>‘s trailer sees the titular character enthusiastically setting out on his latest adventure, to discover his house is now inside some sort of grimdark Soulslike. Walls are made of petrified hands, some holding blue-glowing lanterns, and then a title card drops in reading “Badgerborne.” But as Bradley to platform around in this unpleasant reality, he discovers that it’s very much not finished. Art assets are marked as “WAITING FOR REVIEW,” while sticky notes appear all over demanding fixes.</p>

 <p>This, Bradley discovers, means he can start manipulating these unfinished textures and placeholder blocks, such that he can drag and reshape his own platforms, or reprogram the properties of items. And there, there you’ve got a <em>brilliant</em> idea for a game.</p>

 <p>Except it keeps adding. Once Bradley’s in a&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> reality, he’s able to transform himself into untextured items in the world, becoming a trash bin that can roll up walls, or in a&nbsp;<em>The Last Of Us</em> spoof turn into both a pick-up truck and a size-changing apple. This all starts to look really incredible, the game not demanding players learn code (thank god), but rather just having toggles for various settings of each item, explosive or inert, big or small, magnetic or not. And just as you’re getting to grips with what this is all about, Bradley reaches the end of what’s been coded in the game. And wakes up. As a real person, FMV, with filthy human feet and hands, and a dirty, ill-fitting badger hat on his head. He’s in the development studios of Dreamwoods Games, the walls covered in Bradley posters and notes, and at that point I have no idea what this is.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4198090/Bradley_the_Badger/">game’s Steam page</a> makes things a bit clearer. This is, at heart, an action-platformer, but one where you have “game developer powers.” But on top of that, it’s a game about a beloved franchise becoming self-aware, realizing his fictional reality, and fighting against it to try to restore his normality. And then, yes, the story will include live-actions sections too. Which is glorious.</p>

 <p>Evan Peters, the&nbsp;<em>X-Men</em> movies’ Peter Maximoff, plays the real-world version and voice of Bradley, in the first game from Day 4 Night Studios, the first game from team of former AAA devs who have variously worked on games like <em>GTA: San Andreas</em>,&nbsp;<em>Mario + Rabbids</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dead Alliance</em>. One of the co-creators, Christian Cantamessa, calls&nbsp;<em>Bradley the Badger&nbsp;</em>“part love letter to video games and part satire of them.”</p> <p>The game is set for a Steam release in 2026, but will clearly be looking for console releases after its TGA appearance.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[HP Offloads Its 15.6″ Laptop at 72% Off, Margin Clearly Not the Goal on This Windows 11 Pro PC]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-offloads-its-15-6-laptop-at-72-off-margin-clearly-not-the-goal-on-this-windows-11-pro-pc-2000652643</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s no shortage of laptops on the market, but not all of them are worth your money. If you’ve been after a solid option for remote work or studies, the 15.6-inch HP Flagship touchscreen laptop is an excellent option to consider, and right now, you can treat yourself to it without shelling out big bucks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6366/">It’s typically priced at $1,900, but Amazon just took a whopping 72% off it, dropping the machine down to just $540.</a> You’re saving over $1,300 on an option that has enough muscle to handle all your everyday tasks. The retailer is also offering a bunch of freebies with your purchase for absolutely nothing, which adds even more value to the purchase. Grab it before the deal expires, or the stock runs out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6366/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Packed With Useful Features</h2>
<p>This is a decent mid-range laptop that runs on an Intel i3-1315U processor, capable of clocking up to 4.5GHz with Intel Turbo Boost technology. It’s ideal for browsing, streaming your favorite shows, and regular office work, but might struggle to push through heavy gaming or demanding creative tasks. If you’re planning to use it for basic computing, it’s going to be a solid choice. Those looking to game and push creative limits should consider an i5 or i7.</p>
<p>There’s a modest 16 GB RAM to keep things running smoothly, which even lets you multitask on busy days with ease. Again, it’s not massive, but you’ll be able to use a couple of different programs and hop through a range of tabs without experiencing noticeable slowdowns. The 512GB SSD is spacious enough to house all your important media files and work documents, whether you’re looking to store high-resolution photos, videos, research files, or office projects. Additionally, since SSDs are much faster than traditional hard drives, you’ll also experience quicker boot and transfer times when launching the system or moving files around.</p>



<p>The display is a stunning 15.6-inch BrightView touch screen that is virtually borderless for a wide viewing experience. It pushes detailed, brilliant visuals for all that’s playing on the screen, from work presentations to movies and TV shows. Touch support means you won’t have to rely on just the trackpad or the mouse to get things done. Just use your fingers on the screen directly to scroll through pages, swipe images, zoom in on text, and even sign documents. It also comes in handy when two people are using the laptop; your friend won’t have to awkwardly reach for the trackpad/mouse to do something.</p>
<p>Ports include an AC smart pin, USB Type-A, USB Type-C, HDMI, and more. Best of all, Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, which means you’ll have instant access to a bunch of security and productivity features that Microsoft has designed keeping remote workers and professionals in mind. Copilot support lets you use AI to get help with tasks throughout the day. You can use it to find answers to random questions without opening a browser, get help with crafting replies, summarize documents, and even brainstorm ideas.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6366/">Other freebies include a DVD/CD drive, a Redragon mouse, a screen wipe, and a 256GB SD card.</a> This 5-in-1 bundle (including the pre-installed OS) is worth almost $200, but you’re getting it here at no extra cost. We highly recommend grabbing the discount while it’s still live – which might not be for long. You can treat yourself to the laptop, or pick it up as a gift for a loved one this holiday season!</p>
