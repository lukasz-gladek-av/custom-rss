              <p>Over the last few years, it feels like there has been a large increase in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/reeses-peanut-butter-cups-now-with-hard-bits-1776649563">number of limited-time Reese’s Cup variations</a> and gimmicks. Many of these have been bad. But the newest crossover featuring Oreo cookies is the first time I’ve tried one of these oddball concoctions and enjoyed it. But only when RNG was on my side.</p> <p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/reeses/posts/you-asked-we-crushed-it-reeses-oreo-cups-are-coming-this-september/1218885443616524/">Released this month, the new Reese’s Oreo cup</a> isn’t simply a <a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-candy-ranking-worst-best-list-chocolate-bar-1851679251/38">Reese’s cup</a> with some Oreo bits shoved inside. Well, okay, sure, it is mostly that, but the Reese’s cup itself is half milk chocolate and half white chocolate. As someone who is a big fan of the white chocolate Reese’s Cup, I was very happy about this choice. It also makes sense as the Oreo cookie bits, in theory at least, should blend with the white chocolate to create something similar in taste to an actual Oreo cookie.</p> <p>And then you have the classic Reese’s peanut butter filling, which is fine by me as I love that stuff more than real peanut butter. So does this all come together into a winning creation? Well, you know the answer already, I said it in the first paragraph. But yes, it’s pretty dang good!</p>

 <p>The cookie bits add a nice and crunchy texture to each cup, and the darker, more bitter flavor of the Oreo cookie cuts through the peanut butter, so they complement each other in a way that a lot of other gimmicky flavors have been lacking. But that Oreo-ness also doesn’t overpower the entire cup, something that can also happen. (Looking at you, fudge-filled Reese’s Cups.) Instead, the cookie bits and the rest of the cup blend together perfectly. The white chocolate top of the cup also helps add a bit of sweetness and creaminess to the candy, which does sort of recreate the taste of an Oreo that has been dipped in peanut butter. I would know how that tastes, as I’ve done that many times before.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000623478" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000623478"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000623478">©Reese’s / Oreo</figcaption></figure> <p>There is an asterisk, though, next to my “Pretty Dang Good!” appraisal of the new Oreo Reese’s abomination. It all depends on how much Oreo is in your Reese’s Cups. I bought four of the King Size version and three of them had a lot of cookie bits and were fantastic. But one had barely any inside the peanut butter, so you were left with a cup that was just half white chocolate and half milk chocolate. Not a horrible fate, but disappointing if you were expecting some Oreo goodness.</p>

 <p>For those of you out there who miss the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=crunchy+cookie+cup&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS955US955&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8#imgrc=D8sfDROw0w3ReM&amp;imgdii=EKOEBjAnc7XWNM">Crunchy Cookie Reese’s Cup from the ’90s</a>, this might be your best bet for re-experiencing that fan-favorite flavor that is no longer sold by Reese’s. From my memory, it’s not quite the same thing, but it’s awfully close. And in the absence of Reese’s bringing it back, this will do just fine for all of you longing for the sweet return of the Crunchy Cookie cup.</p> <p>One last note: If you do buy some of these, stick ’em in the fridge. The one I stuck in the fridge and tasted a few hours later was even better. I mean, Reese’s Cups in general are better cold, but these in particular taste wonderful. The cold stiffens up the chocolate more and adds even more crunch. It’s nice. I can’t buy any more or I’ll eat them all.</p>

              <p>There are too many devices and not enough outlets in my life. My phone, tablet, headphones, and everything else are in a constant battle to get plugged into my nearest USB-C port. If this is your life too, you need to upgrade from the cube that came with your phone to something much more useful. This UGREEN 65W USB-C charger has multiple ports to plug your stuff into so you can recharge all your devices at once. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3935/">The charger normally goes for $50, but for a limited time, you can scoop one up for 40% off.</a> That discount brings the price down by $20, so you’re only paying $30.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3935/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ultra-Fast Charging</h2>
<p>This UGREEN charger is pretty powerful despite its small size. It’s got two separate USB-C charging ports as well as a USB-a charging port, and can hit a max fast-charging output of 65W. To put some numbers on that, a MacBook Air M2 can go from zero to over 50% in just 30 minutes. The charging block supports Samsung Super Fast Charging 2.0. The S24 Ultra can be brought up to 50% in just 19 minutes. An iPhone 15 Pro will go up to 60% in only 30 minutes.</p>
<p>The charger is about 55% smaller than a MacBook charger, measuring in at only 2.08 inches by 1.57 inches by 1.25 inches. And because it’s so small, it will only take up a single outlet on a power strip. Huge pet peeve whenever manufacturers make their bricks so big they take up two or sometimes even three of them. Not and issue here.</p>



<p>Designed for portability, the prongs of the plug can be folded back into the brick. This let’s you toss it into your bag or pocket without risk of those little bits getting caught on anything or breaking.</p>
<p>USB-C and USB-A are pretty universally compatible at this point. So that means this UGREEN charger can be used with your phone whether it’s an iPhone or an Android from Google, Samsung, and more. It’ll work on a pair of JBL earbuds. It can even charge your Steam Deck or Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>UGREEN designs its charges with safety in mind. The upgraded Thermal Guard protection system can safeguard your devices from overheating or short circuiting. No worry with leaving them plugged in.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3935/">For a limited time, you can grab yourself one of these UGREEN 3-in-1 USB-C and USB-A universal chargers on sale</a>. Amazon’s limited-time discount has shaved 40% off the price, bringing what you pay down to just $30.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-the-office-base-building-settlement-nbc-2000623462</link>

              <p>The grounded, relatable setting of a certain paper distributor in Scranton, Pennsylvania might be the furthest thing one could imagine from the endless, procedurally generated galaxy of <i>No Man’s Sky</i>, but one virtual space explorer has put some serious digital elbow grease into recreating <i>The Office</i>’s iconic setting. It’s a delight to check out for fans of the show or for those who appreciate some solid base building in Hello Games’ massive space sim.</p> <p>The replica’s creator, user Ok_Misterpiece_9363, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n8efk3/welcome_to_the_office/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">showed it off on Reddit</a> where it’s amassed more than 14,000 upvotes and tons of excited comments filled with <i>Office</i> memes from fans impressed by how faithfully the Scranton-based office space and warehouse has been reproduced.</p>   <p>What’s really neat about this office recreation is how much of the building and the experience of traveling through this space it captures. Having visited many Dunder Mifflin recreations in games like <i>VRchat</i> myself, I’m typically used to just seeing the main floor where most of the show’s action takes place. But this <i>NMS</i> version lets you walk in from the ground floor and, with a quick teleport jump, you can then explore the main office suite, the “annex” area, and even take a quick trip down to the warehouse.</p>

 <p>Those who know the fictional office well might be able to spot a few omissions and quirks, however. Intern-turned-fraudster-turned-hipster Ryan is missing his closet office from the later seasons; the conference room leads directly to the warehouse (there’s a corridor behind it instead on the actual set of the show); and speaking of the warehouse, it doesn’t look much like what we’d seen in nine seasons of the celebrated comedy.</p>   <p>These deviations aside, this is an undeniably cute homage to a beloved comedy, filled with references to various memorable moments such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n8efk3/comment/ncfue0a/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Pam and Jim’s rooftop date</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n8efk3/comment/ncftytq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">the speedometer race scene</a> from an episode in season five, and more.</p> <p>If you want to visit galactic Dunder Mifflin yourself, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1n8efk3/comment/ncea34o/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Ok_Misterpiece_9363 has provided the coordinates here</a>.</p>
