              <p>I’ve been using HP laptops for years now, and one reason I haven’t looked elsewhere during upgrades is that I enjoy the balance these offer between performance, reliability, and ease of use. The EliteBook lineup is especially a great option for work professionals, students, and casual users looking for a no-nonsense machine that doesn’t give up on you when things get challenging.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4506/">On a normal day, you can expect to pay a premium for these, but right now, the HP EliteBook 6 G1i is available for $1,119 on Amazon</a>. That’s a massive 63% off, but it’s a limited-time offer. Snag it before the price goes back to an unapproachable $3,000.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4506/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Brilliant Visuals, Comfortable Keyboard</h2>
<p>The overall design is quite minimal, and the device itself is easy to carry around. You’re getting a 16-inch FHD+ anti-glare display that makes both streaming and browsing easy on the eyes. Expect lifelike, vibrant visuals in all lighting conditions. And since it actively reduces blue light, you won’t be left with tired eyes and blurred vision after a long day of work. The full-size keyboard is also quite comfortable to work on, and is even spill-resistant. A few accidental splashes won’t really hurt.</p>
<p>This model runs on a 12-core Intel Core Ultra 7 255U processor that’s built to keep up with even those busiest, most chaotic days. Speeds hit up to 5.2 GHz with Turbo Boost, making it great for enterprise users. The processor is paired with a massive 32GB of DDR5 RAM for better multitasking, plus a 1TB PCIe SSD that ensures fast boot times and offers plenty of space for all your data. Whether you’re looking to store tons of media files, your favorite movies, or resource-heavy applications, it’s all possible.</p>



<p>For video calls, there’s a 5MP IR camera that makes you look your best, and Poly Studio tuned speakers with AI noise reduction to reduce background distractions. Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 for wireless connections, alongside a whole bunch of useful ports like two Thunderbolt 4 ports, HDMI 2.1, RJ-45 Ethernet, and two USB-A ports. The system runs on Windows 11 Pro, which means you will have instant access to a suite of productivity and security features built right in.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more to like about this HP EliteBook. We highly recommend it for anyone looking to upgrade their everyday machine without going over budget.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony’s <em>Horizon</em> legal battle against Tencent could get very messy, very quickly if a court doesn’t grant it an injunction. Also, a former <em>Call of Duty</em> director is worried about the franchise’s future under Microsoft. Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>Have you been watching the latest season of <em>Slow Horses</em> on Apple TV? The British spy thriller is by far one of the best shows on streaming and I can’t believe I never see anyone talking about it. It’s what I wish <em>Watch Dogs Legion</em> had been like. I hope Apple keeps giving Gary Oldman absurd bags of cash to fart and scowl in front of the camera.</p>

 <h2>Sony was in talks with Tencent about a potential <em>Last of Us</em> spin-off</h2> <p>That’s the latest revelation from <a href="https://kotaku.com/light-of-motiram-horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-monopoly-2000626858">an ongoing court battle</a> between the two companies over IP theft, <a href="https://thegamepost.com/tencent-the-last-of-us-game-sony-horizon-rejected/"><em>The Game Post</em> reports</a>. Why didn’t it come to pass? Apparently Tencent was just using the possibility to lure Sony into meetings so it could continually pitch the PS5 maker on <em>Light of Motiram</em>, aka “Project Z,” the <em>Horizon</em>-inspired game&nbsp;that’s at the center of the lawsuit instead.</p>

 <p>“I recall [a] slide [that] featured a female character with costume design resembling <em>Horizon</em>’s mix of tribal clothing and metal armor, and a robot/animal hybrid resembling a <em>Horizon</em> robotic animal,” Olivier Courtemanche, head of mobile for PlayStation, said in court filings. “Now that I have reviewed the promotional materials released for <em>Light of Motiram</em>, I believe that these images contained assets from the <em>Light of Motiram</em> game. I was confused by the slide given that we had rejected a potential <em>Horizon</em> collaboration and thought we were there to discuss&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>, among other opportunities.”</p>

 <h2>The <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> movie is planned for 2027</h2> <p>According to the <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-horizon-zero-dawn-movie-filming-release/">latest lawsuit filings</a>, the movie has a script and is in search of a director, with hopes of filming next year. “We are in development for a film based on <em>Horizon</em> in partnership with Columbia Pictures,” PlayStation entertainment production head Asad Qizilbash said in a filing. “We already have a working script and are actively searching for a director, with the goal of shooting the picture in 2026 and releasing it in 2027. The live-action film follows the recent collaborations between Columbia Pictures and PlayStation Productions on the 2022 film <em>Uncharted</em> and the 2023 film <em>Gran Turismo</em>.”</p>

 <h2>Sony wants a preliminary injunction to halt Tencent’s <em>Light of Motiram</em> development efforts</h2> <p>Okay, so why is Sony telling a court about the <em>Horizon</em> movie? Because it would seemingly come out the same year as <em>Light of Motiram</em>, which is also scheduled to launch in 2027. Sony <a href="https://gamesfray.com/breaking-sony-asks-judge-corley-for-preliminary-injunction-against-tencents-upcoming-light-of-motiram-in-november-or-december/">wants a judge</a> to stop the Chinese conglomerate from moving ahead with this alleged <em>Horizon</em> rip-off even before the court case is settled.</p>

 <p data-cy="paragraph">“The copying was so egregious that numerous journalists and <em>Horizon</em> fans called <em>Light of Motiram</em> ‘a major <em>Horizon</em> rip off,’ ‘an obvious knock off,’ a ‘copycat’ with a main character that ‘resembles Aloy to a tee,’ and ‘extremely similar to <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>‘,” Sony wrote in recent filings, <em><a href="https://thegamepost.com/damage-sony-tencent-nonsense-protect-light-of-motiram-horizon-knock-off-lawsuit/">The Game Post</a></em> reports.</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">The great irony of this case? It’s being overseen by Judge Corley, the same judge who ruled in Microsoft’s favor back in 2023 during the infamous <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-activision-blizzard-call-duty-deal-ftc-1850581517">FTC trial over its acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a>, which Sony desperately sought to prevent.</p>

 <h2 data-cy="paragraph">A former<em> Call of Duty</em> director is worried about the franchise under Microsoft</h2> <p>Glen Schofield was previously creative director at Sledgehammer Games. He says<em> Call of Duty</em> was better when he was there and he’s not sure Microsoft will make it any better.</p> <p>“I worry about it immensely, I really do,” he <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/former-call-of-duty-director-says-hes-immensely-worried-about-the-future-of-the-series-under-xbox/">told <em>VGC</em></a> in a recent interview. “Because what’s happening <em>to Gears of War</em>, where’s <em>Halo</em>…you know what I mean? And you look at EA, you look at these big companies, and I’m like where’s the <em>Strike</em> games? Where’s this game? And there’s so many that just fall by the wayside.”</p> <p>“Unfortunately, once you’re assimilated by one of these companies, I think you take on some of their traits,” he added. “The other thing is, I don’t know, but I would imagine that the <em>Call of Duty</em> bonus system is out, and now you have theirs, and people are going to go ‘that isn’t that.'”</p> <h2 data-cy="paragraph"><em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s latest major balancing patch did not arrive this week as planned</h2> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Quick update that our Day 30 Update, which includes balance adjustments, performance and stability improvements, and some new quality-of-life features, will be hitting early next week!” the developers <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1978859303982485815">announced on Thursday</a>, when the loot shooter gets its usual weekly update.

              <p>We all have our own sets of small inconveniences that make us irrationally angry. Mine is spotty internet, especially when its my own home. Occasionally when I’m in the bathroom, my router will just decide all by itself to cut its range in half, and then I’m left there caught in loop or refreshing before I give up and resort to reading the back of a shampoo bottle like it’s the dark ages. Stop this from happening in your home. Upgrade to a Wi-Fi mesh network to achieve total coverage around every corner. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4837/">Amazon has the TP-Link Deco S4 mesh Wi-Fi system on sale right now. You can save as much as $50 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>The TP-Link Deco S4 mesh Wi-Fi system comes in a few different variants. You can grab the Wi-Fi 5 AC1900 router, a Wi-Fi 6 AX1500 router, or the Wi-Fi 6 AX3000 Pro router with dual 2.5G ports. Each are available as either a lone model or as a two-pack or three-pack. The Wi-Fi 5 AC1900 three-pack is down 25% from $120 to just $90, saving you $30.

              <p>I can’t think of a better pair of brands than Minecraft and LEGO. Minecraft is already comprised of individual blocks so it doesn’t take that much of a stretch of the imagination to adapt the world and it’s inhabitants into LEGO brick form. The two have collaborated, bringing us a whole slew of LEGO Minecraft sets including this one based on the Badlands biome which happens to be on sale.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4835/"> It normally goes for $60, but the discount has it for 27% off for a limited time</a>. That shaves the price down by $17 so you only have to pay $44.</p>
<p>Minecraft has already been sitting comfortably towards the top of the list of the most popular video games of all time. Following the movie this year starring Jack Black, the name has been launched into the stratosphere. So if you’re an aunt or uncle, looking to find a gift this holiday season for a video game-obsessed niece or nephew, chances are they know what a Chicken Jockey is and they’d be more than delighted to receive a LEGO Minecraft set.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4835/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Play and Creativity Set</h2>
<p>The buildable Minecraft set includes a number of minifigures including a Badlands Explorer, a Creeper, cave spiders, a husk, a baby rabbit, a donkey with saddlebags, 2 slimes and a bat. The bat can even hang upside down with its wings folded up. the people-shaped minifigures are kind of genius in their implementation here to achieve the Minecraft look. They use the standard LEGO torso and legs, but then swap out the head for a box. It’s perfect.</p>



<p>The 538-piece LEGO set has interactive elements. You can blast stones across your play area with the TNT to operate the explode function. The set is filled with tools like the coveted diamond pickaxe. You load load up your different tools into the donkey’s satchel too. Your Minecraft explorer has a bed to sleep in and a set of rails to ride in a minecart down. There are different colored bricks representing precious ores like copper, gold, redstone, and amethyst crystals.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4835/">The LEGO Minecraft The Badlands Mineshaft set is only one part of a much larger collection.</a> You can also shop for LEGO versions of a pirate ship voyage, a cherry blossom garden, a wolf stronghold, a windmill farm, as well as the ender dragon and end ship. Right now, the Badlands Mineshaft set is on sale for its lowest price on Amazon yet. That’s just $43, down from $60.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Marvel Rivals</i> is shedding its PvP-only identity this October with a PvE mode in which you and your friends&nbsp; are gonna have to use super powers to mop up a zombie-infested city. The event kicks off later this month as a collaboration with Marvel Animation following the four-episode <i>Marvel Zombies</i> miniseries on Disney+.</p> <p>Developer NetEase shared the news of its upcoming PvE zombies mode this morning <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1979053687340408847">over on X</a> with a post showing off some fun animation and a slice of the gameplay, as well as a few details of how it’ll work. Though you won’t have access to the full roster of heroes available in PvP, you can choose among Thor, Blade, Magik, Jeff the Shark, and the Punisher to sweep through zombie hordes and take on Zombie Namoor and the Queen of the Dead, who serve as bosses. It all launches on October 23, 2025, just in time for Halloween.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The first-ever PvE mode: Marvel Zombies is coming on Oct 23, 2025 UTC. </p> <p>This new mode throws you and your squad into a relentless fight for survival against endless waves of the undead. </p> <p>The city's burning, the infected are rising – and it's up to you to hold the line. <br>Get a… <a href="https://t.co/DodsnAzoRB">pic.twitter.com/DodsnAzoRB</a></p> <p>— Marvel Rivals (@MarvelRivals) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals/status/1979053687340408847?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>These heroes will work a little differently from how they do in the base game, too. Thor, for example, is described in the teaser as having a “persistent awakened state” and Magik has access to an “unlimited Darkchild form.”</p>

 <h2><i>Marvel Rivals</i> could use a Hail Mary</h2> <p>The news follows a pretty significant dip in popularity for the superhero-themed hero shooter. As <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/10/12/marvel-rivals-has-lost-85-of-its-players-in-10-months/">reported by <i>Forbes</i>’ Paul Tassi</a>, the once white-hot shooter has cooled, losing 85 percent of the player base it enjoyed earlier in the year. As Tassi notes, the player count is still quite healthy, with concurrents peaking at 98,000 in recent days. But clearly Marvel Studios could use a bit of a shot in the arm if it wants to reclaim its previous numbers, which saw things top out at 644,000 concurrents.</p> <p>Zombies and horde PvE modes are nothing we haven’t seen before in shooters. The upcoming <i>Black Ops 7</i> this November, for example, continues <i>CoD</i>’s long-running zombies mode alongside its standard multiplayer offerings. That said, <i>Rivals</i>’ PvE gameplay does look pretty fresh in motion. We’ll see if it’s enough to put some spring in <i>Rivals</i>’ step.</p>

Almost exactly a year later, this second wave of information spread, revealing new development footage and design docs for games like </span><i><span>Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave</span></i><span>, a </span><i><span>Legends</span></i><span> game set in the Galar region from </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>, and an MMO-style game that would take place in multiple regions from previous games. Whether or not these leaks shift plans for any of the games Game Freak has coming down the pipeline remains to be seen, but by trying to take these down, The Pokémon Company may have confirmed their legitimacy. We’ve reached out to the company for comment and will update the story if we hear back.</span></p>
