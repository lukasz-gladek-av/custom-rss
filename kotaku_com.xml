              <p><span>The Analogue 3D, a premium gaming console that’s fully compatible with Nintendo 64 games, just got</span> <a href="https://www.analogue.co/editions/3d-prototype"><span>a new line</span></a><span> of translucent colorways replicating five colors that were prototyped for the N64 but never released. The new Analogue 3D: Prototype Editions follow the limited release of Analogue’s Funtastic line, which replicated the N64’s Funtastic colorful translucent shells last December and </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogueInc/comments/1pj8cgh/analogue_3d_limited_editions_what_sold_out_first/"><span>sold out</span></a><span> in less than two hours.</span></p> <p><span>The new limited edition line comes in five colors: Ghost, in sea glass (and the star of the show, in my opinion); Glacier, in milky white; Atomic Purple, in deep plum; Extreme Green, in, you guessed it, neon green; and Ocean, in cobalt.</span></p>   <p><span>“Five colors were officially prototyped for the original Nintendo 64,” the company writes. “Unreleased. Until now. They were real. They were manufactured. They were never released.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The company continues, “Analogue 3D: Prototype Editions finally release these lost colors as limited editions. History, finished. Decades later.”</span></p> <p><span>The unreleased N64 colors were </span><a href="https://consolevariations.com/blog/5-rumored-n64-prototypes-finally-discovered"><span>discovered</span></a><span> in 2019 by Console Variations, after a former Nintendo of Europe employee contacted the site. This little piece of lost video game history will be restored for the lucky customers who manage to get their hands on the new line before it sells out.</span></p> <p><span>The “highly limited” Analogue 3D: Prototype Edition consoles will be available for purchase on Monday, February 9 at 8 a.m. PST, and will ship within 48 hours. They will retail at $299.99.</span></p>

 <p><span>In partnership with Analogue, 8BitDo is releasing a series of matching controllers for the new Prototype console line. The controllers will also be available for preorder on February 9 at 8am PST, though they won’t ship out until April. The controllers will be sold (separately) for $44.99.</span></p>

 <p><span>In addition to the Analogue 3D, the console maker also sells the Analogue Pocket, a handheld compatible with games for the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance (though it’s currently out of stock).&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The Analogue 3D is available in standard Black and White for $269.99, with matching 8BitDo controllers sold separately for $39.99.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[It’s Time To Start Building Your 4K Movie Collection]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/how-to-why-build-4k-uhd-blu-ray-physical-movie-collection-ps5-help-2000666185</link>
            <guid>1428619</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In theory, movies are more accessible than ever before. You are literally reading this on a device that likely has access to a dozen or more streaming video apps and stores, like Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime, Tubi, and Hulu. And yet, in reality, things are dire.<a href="https://deadline.com/2024/02/disney-original-movies-series-content-removal-emea-1235813461/"> Movies can be pulled instantly from a service</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/hbo-rolls-out-the-red-carpet-for-mad-men-by-leaving-the-barf-machine-in-2000649617">bad versions can be uploaded</a> and replace what existed before, and trying to manage multiple apps is expensive and annoying. It all sucks so much.</p> <p>So, I suggest that if you care about movies and want to avoid all of that nonsense and take back control of your media, you <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-ps-plus-disney-netflix-spotify-price-cancel-1850848468">cancel some services</a> and start investing in a physical movie collection. More specifically, I suggest you start building out a 4K UHD library of movies.</p>

 <h2>Why 4K UHD?</h2> <p>There are a few reasons why I think it’s a smart move to start investing in a 4K UHD collection of your favorite films. The biggest being that, at this point, it seems very unlikely that 4K UHD Blu-ray discs will ever be topped. That’s not to say 8K resolution TVs or content aren’t a thing. They are. But the reality is that physical media is no longer king.</p> <p>Digital streaming, even with its flaws, is the popular option. I can’t imagine any of the companies that would need to be invested in such a project actually working to create, promote, distribute, and support a new disc format for movies in the future. I don’t think we’ll get a widely sold, mass-produced, and studio-supported 8K disc or better.</p>

 <p><a href="https://gizmodo.com/sorry-8k-tvs-have-flopped-2000716663">Another wrinkle is that in 2026, only Samsung is even making and selling consumer 8K TVs</a>. And many stores aren’t even selling physical movies anyway. Why would any company invest in a new superior physical format? No. 4K UHD is almost certainly the <a href="https://obsoletesony.substack.com/p/the-last-disc">last and best quality physical format</a> we’ll ever see. A bit depressing, but it does mean that you can invest in a big 4K UHD collection, safe in the knowledge that 10 years from now, 8K discs won’t pop up. Plus, 4k UHD is so damn good already that I’m not even convinced 8K movies are worth it.</p>

 <h2>What do I need to watch 4K movies?</h2> <p>If you own a PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X with a disc drive, you already own a damn fine 4K UHD player. And better yet, the cable that was included with your console, assuming you still have it, is going to be perfect. If you own an Xbox One S, that’ll work, too. And if you really want to, you can buy a 4K UHD player, but just know they get pricey fast. On the other hand, they mostly support Dolby Vision/HDR10+, which, for some reason, none of those consoles do when using physical media. Whatever you settle on, plug it into your 4K TV.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000009435" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000009435"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000009435">©Sony</figcaption></figure> <p>And yeah, you’ll need a 4K TV.&nbsp;If you don’t already own a 4K TV, it’s time to buy one. I mean, if you plan on collecting 4K UHD movies, you should invest in a nice TV to watch them on. Now, you can go wild and buy some incredibly big and expensive set, but there are also plenty of solid, cheaper 4K sets available on the market these days. I’d avoid going below $300 and would also stay away from TCL sets, as I’ve had nothing but trouble with them in the past, as have others. Still, even a cheapo 4K TV can provide a big improvement over an old 1080p set.</p>

 <p>Now, plug your player or console into your 4KTV with a good-quality HDMI cable and take a moment to pat yourself on the back. Good job! Welcome to the future. Or well, 2015. Anyway, with that all out of the way, it is time for the fun part: Actually buying and watching movies!</p> <h2>What movies to buy first and where?</h2> <p>I always recommend that you buy some of your favorite movies, assuming they’ve made the leap to 4K UHD. (More on that later.) This is going to jumpstart your collection with stuff you like, and assuming you’ve watched your favorite films a few times, seeing them in 4K should provide a nice example of the leap in quality over streaming and 1080p Blu-Rays or even lower-quality DVDs.</p> <p>I’d also advise building a list of movies you want to buy and which ones you have bought. This will help a lot when you’re out and about and not near your collection, but spot a good deal on a movie. Check the list to see if you own it, and if not, buy it! It’ll also help you figure out which of your targets have made the leap to 4K UHD. Not every movie has, and while most of the bigger hits and cult classics have been brought over to the 4K format, there are still some odd exceptions and plenty of smaller films left out.</p>

 <p>As to where to buy your 4K UHDs, there are a few different options. Personally, my favorite place to get 4K movies is at a few of my local used game and movie stores. They tend to have good deals, and stumbling through a random assortment of movies not fed to you via an algorithm means you might discover some hidden gem you forgot about. eBay and Mercari are also good options, but just be careful, as always, when using these sites. And be prepared for some problems.</p> <p>Your big box stores, like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy, might not be very useful in your hunt for new 4K UHD flicks. Not all of them have ditched physical movies and games, but some have, and plenty of others are drastically cutting down on how much they keep in stock at their brick-and-mortar stores. A smarter use of your time is to keep an eye out for deals on Amazon and follow Wario64 to find sales on 4K movies on sites like Gruv.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666518" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666518"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666518">©Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>What about Blu-ray and DVD?</h2> <p>As I mentioned already, standard Blu-rays and DVDs don’t offer the same high resolution as 4K UHD. But, sadly, a lot of movies haven’t been converted to 4K UHD and some you may hope to acquire likely haven’t even received Blu-ray releases. In cases like that, you’re going to have to buy non-4K discs to enjoy those hard-to-find films. The good news is that even DVDs still look pretty good thanks to devices like the PS5, which upscale them slightly in a way that looks sharp but not artificial. So don’t feel weird buying a DVD. You’ll still get a nice picture out of it, assuming it was transferred well.</p> <p>And that’s it. I really do think more people should start building up physical movie collections, not just because it lets you take control of your media, but because scrolling through an app or a media server isn’t nearly as fun as flipping through a collection of physical boxes that contain movies. Grabbing one, loading it in, popping the case down, and watching something becomes a production, but in a good way. I find it helps me focus on the film and the act of watching it. I’m no longer passively hitting buttons to watch some random Netflix slop. I’m actively loading up a machine with a movie to enjoy. And I didn’t realize how much I missed that feeling.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Report: MindsEye Boss Claims $1 Million Media Conspiracy To Ruin His Game In Leaked Video]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mindseye-cyber-boi-youtuber-leak-lawsuit-2000666474</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Mark Gerhard, the co-CEO of </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>developer Build a Rocket Boy, has allegedly stated that a “very big American company” called Ritual Network, a YouTube and TikTok management agency which is actually based in the United Kingdom, is behind a more than $1 million campaign to continue smearing the critically panned 2025 open-world flop</span><span>.</span></p> <p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-ceo-alleges-1-million-sabotaging-its-game/"><i><span>Insider Gaming</span></i></a> reports that <span>Gerhard spoke about the alleged conspiracy </span><span>in an internal meeting with other Build a Rocket Boy staff. Per an </span><span>alleged recording of his remarks, Gerhard supposedly referred to Ritual Network as “a bunch of gangsters,” and also directly named YouTuber Cyber Boi as one of the “influencers” involved in the </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>smear campaign. </span></p>

 <p><span>Cyber Boi is the content creator who was recently threatened with a “formal cease and desist demand” by Gerhard, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-ceo-threatens-youtuber-after-epstein-video-2000665097"><span>via the </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>Discord server last week</span></a><span>, following the release of a now-deleted video about ex-Rockstar producer Leslie Benzies and the Epstein files (<a href="https://kotaku.com/leslie-benzies-epstein-allegation-gta-mindseye-2000665340">Benzies stated this week that he’s never met Epstein before</a>). </span><span><em>Kotaku</em> can confirm that an email address recently listed on Cyber Boi’s YouTube channel did belong to Ritual Network.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>However, Gerhard’s reported claim that Ritual Network is a “very big American company” appears to be false, as the company lists Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire as its registered address. It seemingly employs fewer than 20 individuals. Also, Ritual Network’s publicly available tax returns state that its net current assets in February 2025, four months before <em>MindsEye</em>’s June 2025 release, were somewhere around £800,000, or roughly €920,000. That’s 80,000 shy of the 1 million euro sum reportedly alleged in the recording</span><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>According to <em>Insider Gaming</em>, Gerhard stated during the internal meeting that Ritual Network and the content creators they allegedly paid “will all be served in person, criminal complaints, shortly,” for criminal charges including “espionage, sabotage, and criminal interference.” The purported video call also made mention of an “enhanced cybersecurity software” called Teramind, which had been installed on Build a Rocket Boy employees’ work systems without their prior knowledge.</span></p>

 <h2>Turning YouTuber drama into future <em>MindsEye</em> content</h2> <p><span>If true, that sounds an awful lot like the sort of futuristic, dystopian side plot that could be featured within the narrative of </span><i><span>MindsEye</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Funnily enough, Gerhard also apparently stated that he wishes to use the names of those associated with Ritual Network in a <em>MindsEye</em> mission in the future. “Given this has happened to us, I’m gonna own this narrative,” he reportedly said. “We will use these people, these names and these facts for our own fun. We’re gonna put some of these names into our upcoming spy mission.” </span></p> <p><span>In an official statement to </span><i><span>Insider Gaming</span></i><span>, Ritual Network stated that they are “not involved in the matter” and that they are also unaware of “any legitimate legal action involving Ritual Network and have not been provided with any evidence supporting these claims.”</span></p>

 <p>Build a Rocket Boy isn’t backing down from its allegations, however. “Sadly, we do have evidence that there has been a coordinated campaign to purposefully and maliciously damage Build A Rocket Boy’s reputation and undermine confidence in <em>MindsEye</em>,” a spokesperson for the studio told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>. “We are working with our legal team and taking steps to address this.”</p> <p>Build a Rocket Boy is ostensibly in the middle of trying to reboot the failed 2025 blockbuster. <span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-reboot-update-7-leslie-benzies-2000666008">A surprise February 4 update</a> was pitched as part of</span><span> “a reset for the brand and the title” which will kick off the beginning of a “new era” for <em>MindsEye</em>. The shooter still has a less-than-50-percent positive rating on Steam and, at the time of this writing, only 40 concurrent players in the game.&nbsp;</span></p>
