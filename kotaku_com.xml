              <p>We’re now a few days past Amazon’s made up holiday of Prime Big Deals Days. They invented it so we would all have a good reason to buy a bunch of stuff in the sales drought the exists between Labor Day and Black Friday. If you had let this October 7 and October 8 sale pass on by having not grabbed anything for yourself, you’re not out of luck just yet. Amazon still has a number of live deals in which you can save boatloads on cool stuff. Take this Hisense TV for example. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4732/">The 43-inch model already starts at an affordable price of $350. However, during this limited time deal, It’s come down by 31%. That means you only have a pay a measly $250.</a></p>
<p>Hisense is one of those brands that is hands down the best option for your depending on your priorities. This isn’t some expensive OLED TV which can go for multiple thousands of dollars. You can still get a picture that big, displays and 4K, and has a wide color gamut without taking out a second mortgage on your house. This 4K 43-inch TV has support for Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos which can enhance your image quality and sound even further.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>When it comes to video games, the Hisense smart TV employs Game Mode Plus. This allows you to play games with the picture settings prioritizing what matter for gaming. The variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode will reduce input lag so you player character feels snappy and responsive on screen. Otherwise playing on a screen with bad response times can make it feel like you’re moving your guy through mud.</p>
<h2>Fire TV and Alexa-enabled</h2>
<p>This Hisense Smart TV is designed with the Fire TV interface. Download all the streaming apps from Netflix to Disney Plus to Hulu to HBO Max (if that’s what they’re still calling it by the time this gets published).</p>



<p>The remote is built with Alexa voice support. You can just hold the button down and speak into it the title of the movie or TV show you’re looking to watch. It’s much easier to just say “<em>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</em>,” than it is to type out all of that one letter at a time on those on-screen keypads.</p>

              <p>A smart way to seriously level up your aerial photography and filming game is by grabbing a solid drone camera. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4729/">The DJI Mini 3 Fly More Combo with DJI RC does a great job at that, and you can get your hands on this feature-packed bundle for less right now.</a></p>
<p>Amazon has dropped the price by 20%, bringing it down to $575. That’s almost $150 in savings, and you’re quite literally getting everything you need to start – three intelligent flight batteries, a dedicated controller with a built-in screen, a two-way charging hub, a shoulder bag, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4729/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>4K HDR Recording, Plus a Solid Battery Life</h2>
<p>This is a lightweight drone, so it’s easy to carry around in the wild. It records in 4K HDR and supports Dual Native ISO, which means excellent visuals are a given, whether you’re shooting on a bright, sunny day or in the shadows. You can shoot vertically just as well, so it’s also great if you like sharing your stuff on social media and don’t want to bother with editing or cropping. Wind resistance pushes up to 38kph (Level 5), and there’s a 3-axis mechanical gimbal to let you shoot even with the breeze.</p>
<p>You will also be able to explore properly. This is made possible with the 10km max video transmission range that displays a live HD feed with minimal lag on the DJI RC’s built-in 5.5-inch HD screen, regardless of the distance. Then there are a bunch of handy features that make shooting less stressful. For instance, QuickShots take care of camera movements with built-in preset patterns; no need to worry about manual controls.</p>



<p>Of course, there’s nothing more frustrating than an almost-dead battery high up in the air. Here, you’re looking at up to 114 minutes of total flight time with the three included intelligent batteries. Larger areas and longer shoots won’t really be an issue. And since you’re also getting a two-way charging hub thrown in with your purchase, it’s going to be easy to juice everything back up between flights.</p>
<p>Those using a drone camera for the first time will appreciate features like Auto Takeoff, GPS Return to Home, and Precise Hovering. All of this makes it quite easy to get started confidently.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4729/">All in all, this Fly More Combo packs a lot of value for the price. This deal lets you snag it for 20% less than the retail price, but it won’t last too long.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-is-offloading-50-random-pokemon-cards-at-50-off-now-selling-for-mere-pennies-2000634615</link>

              <p>Getting kids started with Pokemon card collecting can get expensive fast when you’re buying individual booster packs at the store for $5 to $7 each with only 10 cards inside. Building up enough cards to actually trade with friends or organize by type requires buying multiple packs and suddenly you’ve dropped $50 without even getting any rare cards.</p>
<p>Amazon just slashed <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/">the price on their 50-card Pokemon bundle from $10 down to just $5, which works out to 10 cents per card</a>. This is the perfect starter pack for kids beginning their collection and (smart) parents are ordering four or five bundles at once to give their kids a substantial trading base right from the start.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Random Pokemon Cards</h2>
<p>The <strong>set includes 50 cards randomly selected from all Pokemon series</strong> from the old beginning of the card game in the original 1999 base set to the new releases. The set will comprise a variety of Pokemon character cards with some old favorites like <em>Pikachu</em> and <em>Charizard</em> to new generations kids are accustomed to from existing games and television programs. The <strong>set includes Energy cards too</strong> which are required to play the game as opposed to collecting the cards.</p>



<p>The random nature of the selection makes each package different and builds anticipation as you open the package because you never quite know what you’ll be receiving. This element of mystery replicates the booster pack buying experience at the market but you’ll be receiving five times the number of cards for the same cost. The randomness keeps kids getting Pokemon from various evolutionary levels, types, and power levels to introduce them to the depth of the Pokemon universe as opposed to receiving multiple copies of the same handful of characters.</p>
<p><strong>Duplicates happen within one set </strong>or across sets if you buy a bunch of sets at one time. This is actually a benefit rather than a flaw for children assembling collections, since replicas become desirable trade material. When your kid has two or three of the same card, they can trade the spares with others who need that particular Pokemon to fill out their set or construct a superior deck. Learn the value of negotiation, social interaction, and value exchange within the context of something enjoyable, not educational.</p>



<p>Each of the Pokemon cards features the character’s hit points (HP), attacks with costs in energies along with values of damage, weaknesses, resistances, and retreat costs. The cards with energies show the single type with the Pokemon energies that the children recognize. The cards are the same size, girth and quality as cards found in booster packs that can be purchased at retailers.</p>
<p>Buying four or five bundles makes economic sense because 50 cards is actually the beginning of a serious collection. Buying four or five bundles puts kids right out of the gate with 200 to 250 cards that instantly put together a substantial-looking collection. They can then construct dozens of finished decks with different Pokemon types, a slew of duplicates with which to trade, yet still retain a display collection of their very favorites. At $5 per pack, buying five packs still costs a grand total of $25, the same as buying five single booster packs at the store that would net you the same 50 cards anyway.</p>
<p>For $5 rather than $10, this is the cheapest Amazon has ever sold this set at.</p>

              <p>This past week, Amazon ran its seasonal Prime Day-adjacent sales event. The October one has been given the clumsy name Prime Big Deals Days, but don’t let that fool you. The deals were quite good, but unfortunately the event has come to a close. If you missed out on grabbing yourself something cool at a discount, no need to worry.
