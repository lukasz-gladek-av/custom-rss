In the stylish trailer we see a woman who seems to be a bounty hunter. She drives a hot red Porsche-branded spaceship that is filled with retro, low-fi technology, including a CD player that she uses later in the video to play some Pet Shop Boys. (Good to see great music lives on in the future.) </p><p>Here’s the official description of the game: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet i</em>s the newest franchise in development for the PlayStation 5 console from Naughty Dog, the studio behind acclaimed series like <em>The</em> <em>Last of Us</em> and <em>UNCHARTED</em>.</p><p>Set thousands of years in the future, Intergalactic puts players into the role of  Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria – a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago. Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit.</p></blockquote><p>According to Geoff, the game has been in development since 2020 and will feature a soundtrack from Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross. Neil Druckmann is directing <em>Intergalactic</em>. The game is being published by PlayStation. </p><p>We knew that Naughty Dog was working on something new.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/neil-druckmann-last-us-part-3-uncharted-naughty-dog-1851698579&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/neil-druckmann-last-us-part-3-uncharted-naughty-dog-1851698579"> In November, Druckmann</a></span>, who directed <em>Last of Us Part II</em> and helped develop the hit HBO TV show adaptation of the first game, confirmed that he had been leading development on a new game since 2020. It seems that he was hinting at <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. </em></p><p><em>&nbsp; .</em><br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And if you were worried that these two incorrigible hecklers would not be allowed to rip apart the show, Geoff, and everything else, don’t be. These two famous <em>Muppet </em>insult comics were on fire tonight and provided the biggest laughs and best moments during this year’s very long Game Awards event. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/EPnU12avcts?t=184&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/EPnU12avcts?t=184" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here is their first appearance early on in the show:</a></span> </p><p>After noticing some empty seats in the theater they had this to say to Geoff: “We heard you always sell out!” </p><p>When talking about how the Game Awards is turning 10 years old, they joked about Geoff hosting it, saying: “How long is this bozo gonna go on? Well that’s what I’ve been asking for 10 years!” </p><p>During another appearance, the two of them begged for all the commercials to stop and asked someone to help them.
