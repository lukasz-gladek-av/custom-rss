              <p>The SHOKZ OpenRun Bone Conduction Headphones give you open-ear wireless sound, allowing you to stay aware of your surroundings while listening to music, podcasts, and taking calls. Unlike regular sealed in-ear headphones that block your ear canals, these bone-conduction headphones sit just in front of your ears with a flexible wraparound frame that stays in place as you move. Vibrations generated by the transducers are transmitted through your cheekbone to your inner ear, letting you keep hearing traffic and nearby conversations. You also get long battery life and a sweat-resistant design, making these a strong option for active use when situational awareness matters.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7051/">Visit Amazon to purchase the SHOKZ OpenRun Bone Conduction Headphones for just $90, which saves you $40 or 31% off the original $130 list price.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7051/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Unique headphones that look and sound great without causing pain</h2>
<p>A lightweight wrap-around band keeps the transducers in place, allowing a full range of motion without large ear cups or tips, so you can listen privately while still hearing conversation around you. The combination of private audio with the ability to hear your surroundings is effective when you are walking in a populated area or using headphones for physical exercise and need to be aware of your environment.</p>
<p>These bone conduction headphones from SHOKZ can withstand a lot of physical activity, poor weather, and perspiration. It has an IP67 rating, which allows it to withstand some rain, and it is also resistant to dust and other contaminants. Moisture detection will alert you if the headphones are so wet that they could be damaged during charging, which can happen after a particularly hard workout. This type of durability means you can put all your energy into your workout without worrying about how much rain or sweat may affect your headphones’ ability to work properly.</p>



<p>Your battery will allow you to complete your day-to-day tasks before needing a recharge. With a single full charge, you can get 8 hours of continuous audio playback. Additionally, with fast charging via the USB-C port, you will receive approximately 1.5 hours of listening time after a 10-minute charge, which may help eliminate lengthy interruptions during prolonged activities like long runs or bike rides.</p>
<p>When you purchase these headphones, you receive a protective carrying case, a USB-C charging cable with a magnetic connector, and a sporty headband for those who want to use them while working out. The headphones have Bluetooth technology, so they can be paired with whatever you are listening to, like a phone, tablet, laptop, or watch, and they have a simple control system that lets you skip tracks, pause/play music, and adjust the volume. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7051/">At $90 instead of $130, the SHOKZ OpenRun Bone Conduction Headphones give you an affordable way to listen while staying aware of what’s happening around you during active use.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The next game in the <em>Horizon</em> franchise, after <em>Horizon Zero Dawn </em>and <em>Horizon Forbidden West,</em> is something very, very different. <em>Horizon Hunters Gathering</em> is a solo or cooperative action-focused hunting game with a vibrant art style and no release date.</p> <p>On February 5, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/05/announcing-horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrillas-new-co-op-action-game/">Sony and <em>Horizon</em> creators Guerrilla Games announced</a> the next entry in the post-apocalyptic open-world robot dinosaur series. However, this time around, players won’t be playing as Aloy and exploring large, photorealistic worlds alone. Instead, <em>Hunters Gathering</em> is a “tactical co-op action game” for up to three players, though it does also support solo play with NPC bots. There is no release date for <em>Hunters Gathering</em>, but it will launch on both PS5 and PC.</p>

 <p>Here’s a new 10-minute trailer from PlayStation about the just-announced game.</p>  <p>In<em> Horizon Hunters Gathering,</em> players go out solo or with up to two other players on “challenging and replayable hunts.”&nbsp; Each person picks a Hunter from a selection of playable characters with different melee and ranged weapons and abilities. There is also a “rogue-lite perk system” to further build out your character during each hunt. Between these hunts, players will return to a large “vibrant” social hub where players can meet up, prep for the next mission, and hang out. You can also customize your Hunters, visit shops, upgrade items, and team up for your next outing at this hub.</p>

 <p><em>Hunters Gathering</em> will feature a narrative campaign which will introduce “new mysteries, characters, and threats” to the world of <em>Horizon</em>. It is also a fully canon story and will be updated post-launch.</p> <p>Guerrilla Games is promising a playtest toward the end of February that will feature two game modes and let folks get their hands on the game ahead of its full launch on PS5 and PC. The game will support crossplay and cross progression across console and PC. <a href="https://www.playstation.com/beta-program-at-playstation/?hr=true&amp;betaId=DEA61B71-0498-4EEB-9EAF-53C71761F968">You can sign up for the early beta here.</a> In the blog post announcing the game, it does sound like this thing is still fairly early on in development, so no idea if it will be out this year.</p>

 <p>“On a personal note, this is both an exciting and daunting step for us,” said Guerrilla game director Arjan Bak. “Multiplayer games have always been part of our studio’s DNA, and it’s where I began my own career. Bringing a co-op hunting experience into the <em>Horizon</em> universe is something we’ve envisioned for a long time, and we’re approaching it with care, ambition, and passion. I hope the coming months give you a sense of the scale and complexity of what we’ve been building – or better yet, let you experience it yourself in a playtest.”</p>

            <guid>1426825</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<article dir="auto" data-turn-id="request-WEB:a27e9b51-0223-42bc-9c27-f84763eca532-1" data-testid="conversation-turn-4" data-scroll-anchor="true" data-turn="assistant">
<div dir="auto" data-message-author-role="assistant" data-message-id="8591b7fa-ce1a-4e70-a7af-ab01f5f500d9" data-message-model-slug="gpt-5-2">
<p data-start="0" data-end="525">Summer might be in the rearview mirror, but outdoor season isn’t too far away. Once these record low temperatures come back up, we’ll be back to spending our time out and about in the great outdoors. From weekend tailgates in packed parking lots to quiet camping trips deep in the woods, having reliable power can turn a good outing into a great one. That’s where a portable power station comes in, and right now BLUETTI’s Elite 100 V2 is an especially tempting option thanks to a massive discount.</p>
<p data-start="527" data-end="833"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7049/">The BLUETTI Elite 100 V2 portable power station is currently marked down by more than half. Normally priced at $799, it’s available for just $395 for a limited time, saving you $404.</a> For anyone who has been considering a serious power solution for outdoor adventures—or even as backup power at home—this deal lowers the barrier in a big way.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7049/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="527" data-end="833">Power 11 Devices at Once</h2>
<p data-start="835" data-end="1300">At the heart of the Elite 100 V2 is a 1,024Wh battery capacity designed to keep essential gear running all day. The power station can handle up to eleven devices at once, making it ideal for group outings or gear-heavy trips. It includes four AC outlets, two USB-A ports, two USB-C ports, and a car port. That setup lets you charge phones, run a portable fridge, power a griddle, or inflate a paddleboard with an electric pump without juggling cables or priorities.</p>
<p data-start="1302" data-end="1807">The unit delivers a standard 1,800W, which covers most everyday appliances. Activating powerlifting mode boosts output to as much as 3,600W for purely resistive loads. That extra headroom makes it possible to run higher-demand devices like kettles or hairdryers, something many portable power stations struggle to handle. Longevity is the name of the game here, with a design rated for more than 4,000 power cycles and backed by a warranty that covers up to five years of use.</p>


<p data-start="1809" data-end="2063">Managing the Elite 100 V2 is straightforward thanks to BLUETTI’s smartphone app. You can check battery levels, monitor performance, and adjust charging or discharging modes remotely, which comes in handy when the unit is tucked away in a tent or vehicle.</p>
<p data-start="2065" data-end="2406">Recharging the power station is impressively fast. Plugged into a wall outlet, it can jump from zero to 80 percent in just 45 minutes, with a full charge taking about 90 minutes. For longer trips, optional solar panels add even more flexibility. BLUETTI offers compatible 100W and 200W solar panels, sold separately, for off-grid recharging.</p>
<p data-start="2408" data-end="2641" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7049/">For those who don’t need solar charging right away, the standalone Elite 100 V2 at $395 still delivers outstanding value</a>. It’s a powerful, versatile companion for outdoor adventures and beyond, made even better by a rare, deep discount.</p>

              <p>In a <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-february-switch-2-oblivion-fallout-2000665999">Nintendo Direct</a> that was filled with years-old ports, <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> fit right in. Of course, this is really only a year old, given it’s Bethesda’s remaster of the 20-year-old original that came out everywhere else in April 2025, now coming to the Switch 2 at some point in 2026.</p> <p>The most recent&nbsp;<em>Elder Scrolls</em> game,&nbsp;<em>Skyrim</em>, saw one of its own seventy-thousand remastered versions (the&nbsp;<em>Anniversary Edition</em>) release on the Switch 2 in December last year.&nbsp;<em>Oblivion</em>, which received a surprise announcement and simultaneous release of its remastered version on April 22, 2025, will now join it on Nintendo’s newer device, although rather shockingly it’s yet to sport a specific release date. Certainly all at <em>Kotaku</em> HQ watched its announcement during the Partner Showcase with the expectation of an “available later today” at the end.</p>

  <p>Perhaps this ambiguity is in part due to how&nbsp;<em>Oblivion Remastered</em> still doesn’t run well on either PS5 or Xbox nearly a year after release (as a lifelong PC player, I do admit to enjoying the schadenfreude of console players getting to properly experience the infernal jankiness of Bethesda games), with the developers perhaps working on fixing ongoing issues before launching it on the even weaker tech of the Switch 2. And it’s fair to say that what was shown of the game today did not exactly look great in places.</p> <p>Still, should it arrive in working order, it’ll be splendid to have this classic and enormous RPG available on the handheld console. Sure, the Oblivion gates were a bit boring, but it remains a fantastic game that’s well worth preserving in as many forms as possible. It’s just a shame we don’t know when it’s coming out!</p>
