Players will now receive $1,500 if they agree to allow their likeness to be used in EA <em>College Football 26.</em> This is more than double the $600 offered last year. </p><p>An EA Sports rep told the outlet that the increase in payments was to “make sure athletes feel recognized for the success of the game.” Players will also still get a free copy of the game, too.</p><p>“From the beginning, we’ve designed our NIL program to be accessible, direct, voluntary and equitable for all, offering the same base-level compensation to every FBS athlete that opts-in using the OneTeam platform and COMPASS NIL app,” an EA Sports exec told <em>The Athletic</em>. </p><p>“This approach empowers each athlete to make their own decision. College sports are growing and changing, and our focus at EA Sports is on continuing to put athletes first as we bring them in the game in <em>College Football 26</em> and beyond.”</p><p>It’s believed that around 11,00o players will allow their likenesses and names to be used in <em>College Football 26</em>, which is roughly the same as last year.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sonic naturally ends up racing alongside The Flash, Tails puts his tech skills to the test in tandem with Cyborg, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560">Shadow</a></span> has a brood-off with Batman. Bruce Wayne and the Ultimate Life Form have more in common beyond their angsty demeanor, of course, both being defined by a traumatic loss. When the crossover was announced, fans wondered if Batman and Shadow might bond over grief, and just one issue in the comic has delivered.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196123" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond The Day Before | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="125" data-playlist="196123,195859,197298" data-current="196123"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond The Day Before | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21655.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Sonic </em>fans will know that Shadow’s villain origin story is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-shadow-maria-death-actor-1851227374&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-shadow-maria-death-actor-1851227374">the death of Maria Robotnik</a></span>, a young girl who he was created to help save from a terminal illness. However, any chance of that was taken away when the government shut down the project and killed her in the process. Batman has experienced a similar loss:, as watching his parents die as a child spurred his whole superhero deal.</p><p>The crossover series has Sonic and the Justice League teaming up to defeat famous DC villain Darkseid, and initially Shadow is uninterested in getting involved. As he begins to leave, Batman tells Superman that he’ll handle the dark, brooding hedgehog and immediately clocks his whole deal. Batman asks Shadow, “Who was it?” This takes Shadow off guard, and then the world’s greatest detective delivers the real gut punch and adds: “The one you couldn’t protect. The one you watched die in front of you.”</p><p>Given their shared trauma, it makes sense that Bruce could sense Shadow carried the same pain. The caped crusader manages to bring Shadow around to the cause, reminding him that they honor those they’ve lost by protecting the world they loved in life.</p><p>Fans are losing it over the interaction. Sometimes crossover events can feel vapid, more like you’re just slamming toys together that didn’t come in the same box.
