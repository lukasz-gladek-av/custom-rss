A premium edition will be available on PS5 and, like its Xbox counterpart, will give players two days of early access. </p><p>While on the surface <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> would seem to have a lot in common with the relic hunting <em>Uncharted</em> games, it’s much more of an immersive stealth game than Sony’s cinematic, setpiece-driven third-person shooter. Plus the bad guys in <em>Great Circle </em>are Nazis which players are encouraged to punch early and often. </p><p><em>Indiana Jones </em>is the latest Xbox first-party release to dispense with console exclusivity. id Software’s upcoming <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, meanwhile, will be day-and-date on both PS5 and Xbox. Rumors have been swirling of <em>Halo:The Master Chief Collection</em> and a<em> Gears of War</em> remaster anthology coming to PS5 this year as well, leaving many fans to suspect that 2023's sprawling sci-fi RPG <em>Starfield </em>can’t be that far behind. </p><p>Microsoft hasn’t completely dispensed with exclusivity yet, however, with action adventure<em>&nbsp;</em>game <em>South of Midnight </em>arriving on Xbox next month from Compulsion Games. The Southern gothic fantasy features platforming, puzzle solving, and magical abilities inspired by Southern folklore, and while we’ll probably see it on PS5 as well at some point, as of yet no date has been confirmed. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While we wait for season three, fans are left to ruminate on the end of season two and they’re very divided, particularly on the finale’s unforgettable last five minutes. The moral conundrum Mark S. (Adam Scott) deals with in those final moments is fascinating to debate, but the reactions to it may also indicate that some people aren’t engaging with the show’s themes, and are instead viewing it through a tunnel-visioned “ship wars” lens.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re just tuning in and want a quick recap as to why your timeline is yelling about some asshole named Mark and him not going home with his wife Gemma (Dichen Lachman), let’s break down the basics of <em>Severance</em>. In this show, people who work at a company called Lumon have their brains bisected so that they have two distinct memory banks. Their “innie” only has memories of their time within their office on the severed floor, while their “outie” doesn’t remember anything from their work day and goes about their life without a care in the world. The show sometimes explores questions about whether or not certain parts of one’s personality or inclinations are innate, but as far as the world of <em>Severance </em>is concerned, these are two individuals who share a body. Innies are only allowed to see or know about the outside world in controlled environments, and the show’s biggest mysteries are born out of this division. When those walls come down and Mark’s innie and outie are able to communicate in “Cold Harbor,” it becomes clear that the two share a body and little else.</p><p>Outie Mark asks his innie to save his wife from the depths of the severed floor’s testing facility, likely leading to the exposure of Lumon’s corruption, the dissolution of the company, and the “deaths” of every innie who works there. Mark tries to soothe his innie self into a sense of security by explaining that he’s in the process of “reintegrating” and combining both their memories, but not only does this sound like a half-measure to someone who wants to be more than a tagalong on someone else’s life, he doesn’t even know if he can trust his outie to finish the process. Throughout their conversation, it’s clear Mark views his innie as a means to an end, rather than as a complete person with his own hopes, dreams, and desires. So when it comes to carrying out the plan, which requires cooperation from both Marks as they move across floors, the innie is conflicted as he weighs whether or not he’s willing to essentially commit suicide, along with killing the rest of the innies, in order to save his outie’s wife and give them a happily ever after.</p><figure id="" data-id="8537ecb12b43aa29a4b629cceb0716e8" data-recommend-id="image://8537ecb12b43aa29a4b629cceb0716e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ms. Casey and Mark S. face each other in an elevator." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ms. Casey and Mark S. face each other in an elevator." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Apple</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8537ecb12b43aa29a4b629cceb0716e8" data-recommend-id="image://8537ecb12b43aa29a4b629cceb0716e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ms. Casey and Mark S. face each other in an elevator." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>All of this builds up to the final moment, in which Gemma has been successfully escorted outside of Lumon and all innie Mark has to do is leave with her and give control back to his outie. But then he hears Helly (Britt Lower) call his name. This is the woman he loves, the one whose name his outie couldn’t even be bothered to get right in their conversation. Why should he give up even a few more moments with her so his outie can have the life he wants? His decision made, Innie Mark goes to Helly and takes her by the hand, and together they run into the depths of the severed floor with no plan beyond fighting for every second they have left with each other. Meanwhile, Gemma cries out to her husband, seemingly unaware that he’s been severed, and begs him to join her on the other side. It is a brutal, tragic, and romantic declaration of the innies’ personhood, separate from their outside world selves.</p><p>It is a tough scenario, and it’s got <em>Severance </em>fans split down the middle. Did Mark S. do the right thing? It’s certainly not the most satisfying conclusion for those who wanted Mark and Gemma to live happily ever after, but it is the most thematically appropriate conclusion for a season focusing on innie autonomy and how outies view their workplace selves as second-class citizens.</p><p>Debating the morality of everyone involved is worthwhile, but what’s surprising is that discussing Mark’s decision has somehow boiled down to a shipping war, with some <em>Severance </em>fans putting on their Team Helly or Team Gemma t-shirts and pitting two women against each other. Friends, it feels like we’ve lost the plot once more. <em>Severance </em>has spent two seasons establishing that innies and outies are different people with separate identities, goals, and lived experiences. The Mark we see make this decision isn’t picking Helly over Gemma, he’s choosing himself over his outie. Gemma is collateral damage, but the Mark who exists inside Lumon isn’t her husband, and she is not his wife. Mark’s inner turmoil is illustrated by these two women on the opposite ends of an office hall, but he’s not literally deciding between them. That hasn’t stopped the debates from becoming ship war fodder, filled with fans who are missing the forest for the trees.</p><p>Yes, Gemma will likely have some more trauma to work through, having watched her long-lost husband walk away with another woman, but boiling down Mark’s decision to “picking one woman over the other” or “abandoning his wife” is both missing the point and shows that some viewers don’t see innies as individuals, but merely parts of someone else. The whole season finale shows innies declaring their autonomy over Lumon and their outies’ wishes. It’s not even subtext. Helly stands on a table and rallies a group of severed workers by saying that they’re only given half a life but it’s one worth fighting for. The notion that Mark is choosing Helly over Gemma is a frustrating reading both because it’s deeply unsympathetic to the plight of an oppressed class, and because it dilutes the season’s complex thesis into a petty love triangle.</p><p><em>Severance</em>’s season finale is not the satisfying conclusion some fans were likely hoping for, one that ended with Mark and Gemma reunited and his outie making a noble sacrifice to ensure it happened. But it was one consistent with everything <em>Severance</em> has ever said about how innies have only ever been tools in the eyes of their outies. You can only be treated as an afterthought by those who brought you into the world for so long before you fight back. And sometimes fighting back is choosing yourself, even for a few moments. That’s a much more interesting lens through which to debate the ending than one that erases all the nuance of the show just to pit two women against each other.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Anyone who’s looked up the best way to make fluffier pancakes or slow roast a brisket will know that instead of just being told how, you’re treated to the author’s entire life story for page after page of utterly pointless text, before eventually reaching an ingredients list just before you’ve scrolled to the core of the Earth. Now imagine that, but the recipe at the end is entirely fictional, the images of the food are imagined into existence by a plagiarism machine, and the method is entirely untested and deeply unlikely to work. Welcome to now!</p><figure id="" data-id="437858c6502ad2565f424876914149dc" data-recommend-id="image://437858c6502ad2565f424876914149dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A plate of sad-looking churros based on an AI recipe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A plate of sad-looking churros based on an AI recipe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->How To Cook That / YouTube / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="437858c6502ad2565f424876914149dc" data-recommend-id="image://437858c6502ad2565f424876914149dc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A plate of sad-looking churros based on an AI recipe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I always feel it’s important to distinguish what sort of AI we’re talking about when it comes to these rants because there’s the very real likelihood that “AI” could be bringing us massive breakthroughs in medicine, given its ability to manage vast amounts of information in ways humans, and even regular computation, cannot, and thus save millions of lives. This, however, is not the sort of “AI” techbros are currently losing their collective minds and wallets over. That’d be Large Language Models, which are fed all of human creativity and then spit out weird, gloopy slop. Whether it be ChatGPT and its incessant outpouring of drivel (if you know anyone who trusts it, get them to ask it to create an anagram), or image creating tools that can’t count to five, or the deeply unsettling sloppy videos in which no one’s face remains the same for more than a few seconds, LLMs are art-in-garbage-out machines, and they’re wrecking <em>everything</em>.</p><p>Including, as the wonderful YouTuber Ann Reardon points out in her latest video, recipes.</p><p>Reardon and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@HowToCookThat&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@HowToCookThat" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">her channel How To Cook That</a></span> is best known for her debunking videos, in which she is alerted to dubious recipes posted to the internet and then attempts to recreate them in her kitchen. It’s always a joy, as she not only demonstrates how content farms and wannabe TikTok influencers alike just make up any old crap they feel like for clicks but also then shows you how to successfully create the same food! But wow is her job about to get harder with the current flooding of socials with AI-created recipes, where every element, from ingredients to method to images, is the delusion of an LLM.</p><p>As Reardon points out, alongside trying to make a couple of the recipes, this is not only a problem social media companies aren’t trying to address, but rather one being actively encouraged! Facebook is working on something called “inverse cooking,” where its AI will “create” a recipe based on a photograph, driving such utter rubbish on its own site.</p><p>It’s worth noting that while there will almost certainly be examples of AI-generated recipes that would create lethal meals, the vast majority of them will be <em>almost</em> right. That’s the magic of plagiarism, as the LLMs have been fed every single legitimate recipe on the internet, and will approximate an average of them all. Ask it how to make pancakes, and via taking everyone else’s efforts without paying for it, it is capable of blindly reproducing an approximated median method for making pancakes. But, given it’s not “intelligence” in any meaning of the word, it’s also not capable of checking for accuracy. Hence the “not quite right” results in Reardon’s video above.</p><p>The issues arise because we now have no means of knowing what’s a legitimate, tested recipe written by a human and what’s an android dream with faked, photorealistic images before pages and pages of machine-generated life story atop a predictive-text recipe. It’ll only be in the act of trying to follow it will we realize we’ve been duped.</p><p>And thus, online recipes—unless posted by a writer you’ve followed for a long time and can trust—are ruined. Googling for the best way to make a butter chicken curry could be gambling with food poisoning, and that might just be the Gemini result it insists on forcing on you before you can click on any of the links. Thank god for actual, physical recipe books, but what a blow for a more recent massive convenience, even if you did wear through the skin on your finger scrolling to find the actual recipe.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
