            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Daft Punk, one of the biggest electronic dance music groups in history, is coming soon to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gaijin-war-thunder-fortnite-the-pit-deal-millions-epic-1851786813"><em>Fortnite</em></a> alongside some classic tracks, Lego skins, new emotes, and also a big confirmation from Epic that, no, they aren’t getting back together. Sorry.</p> <p>On September 22, after some online leaks and teases, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/party-harder-better-faster-stronger-in-fortnite-with-the-daft-punk-experience">Epic officially announced that Daft Punk</a> was coming to <em>Fortnite</em> as part of a large in-game event. The robotic duo will arrive in Epic’s ever-growing battle royale on September 27 as part of something called the “Daft Punk Experience.” This will be an in-game location that players can visit alone or with friends, and it will feature various activities, including the ability to remix Daft Punk’s music, a horde mode featuring robots, and a dance club.</p> <p>But before all that, on September 25, cosmetic items based on the duo will be added to <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-missing-characters-wishlist-grimace-agent-47-weird-al-star-trek-2000617211"><em>Fortnite’s</em> in-game shop</a>. Cosmetics include multiple Daft Punk outfits, emotes, weapon skins, in-game music tracks, and even some adorable Lego minifigs based on the famous robots.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000627583" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627583"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627583">©Epic Games / Daft Punk</figcaption></figure> <p>Now, if you’re a big fan of Daft Punk like me, you might see all this news and start thinking that maybe, just maybe, the duo is about to get back together. Perhaps this is just a tease of something bigger. A new album? A new song? A new tour? Well, bad news: Epic makes it very clear in the post announcing all of the new <em>Fortnite</em> x Daft Punk content that, no, the group is not getting back together. First, Epic starts the post off with a mention of the group being “no longer” around and then, to make it very clear, Epic included this in the event’s FAQ:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><em>Is Daft Punk getting back together?</em></li> <li>No. The Daft Punk Experience is an immersive music experience based on the band’s beloved music. The band is not getting back together.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>So there you go. Sorry about that. Of course, if they wanted it to be a surprise, that’s exactly what they would say. So perhaps there is still a chance… (Editor’s note: It’s not happening, Zack. Move on.)</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>While reports are circulating that Disney-owned ABC and late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-fallon-colbert-stewart-trump-kirk-2000627249"><span>in talks to bring </span><i><span>Jimmy Kimmel Live</span></i></a> <span>back on air after the show was pulled last week, more high-profile names from some of Disney’s biggest franchises have spoken out in protest of the decision. While some, like Aunt May actor Marisa Tomei and She-Hulk actor Tatiana Maslany, have </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney-boycott-marvel-marisa-tomei-2000627135"><span>called for a straight-up boycott</span></a><span> of the company’s services, some other major players in </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>and Marvel are simply voicing their support for Kimmel and condemning ABC and Disney’s decision.</span></p> <p><span>Mark Hamill, who has portrayed original </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>protagonist Luke Skywalker since long before Disney ever got its hands on the franchise, posted on Bluesky that he believes Jimmy Kimmel being pulled from the air in an effort to placate the FCC and the Trump administration will only embolden further attacks on free speech in America, and says that he finds Kimmel “very talented and funny.” This is in reference to comments from ex-Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who expressed similar sentiments </span><a href="https://x.com/Michael_Eisner/status/1969088566098870363"><span>on his X account</span></a><span> and signed off with the same final line.</span></p>   <p><span>Another big </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>name calling out Disney for this move is Dan Gilroy, a writer whose work on the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/andor-season-2-ending-vgchat-star-wars-rogue-one-10-12-1851780720"><span>Disney+ series </span><i><span>Andor</span></i></a><span> earned him an Emmy. Gilroy wrote a guest column on </span><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/andor-dan-gilroy-jimmy-kimmel-commentary-1236549627/"><i><span>Deadline</span></i></a><span> comparing the real-world actions of the Trump administration to events of the show, which focuses on the Galactic Empire’s tyrannical reign.</span></p>

 <p><span>“As one of the writers on the Disney+ drama </span><i><span>Andor</span></i><span>, we spent six years thinking about a fascist takeover of a galaxy far, far away,” Gilroy wrote. “Six years thinking about ordinary beings as an authoritarian regime comes in for the kill. Many people saw parallels between </span><i><span>Andor</span></i><span> and the real world. I see them as well, particularly in the events of the last week.”</span></p>

 <p><span>On the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cinematic-universe-mcu-best-worst-movie-avengers-1851765913"><span>Marvel</span></a><span> side of things, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-anxiety-touch-controversy-1851787007"><span>Pedro Pascal</span></a><span>, who plays Mr. Fantastic in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-movie-marvel-mcu-1851786852"><i><span>Fantastic Four: First Steps</span></i></a> <span>and the upcoming </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-4-cast-announcement-stream-mcu-marvel-1851772474"><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday</span></i></a><span>, posted a photo of himself with Kimmel to his Instagram with the caption “Standing with you @jimmykimmellive Defend #FreeSpeech Defend #DEMOCRACY.” Pascal also <a href="https://kotaku.com/mandalorian-grogu-trailer-disney-boycott-2000627542">plays the Mandalorian in&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em></a>.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>Mark Ruffalo, who plays the Hulk in the MCU, has been vocally supporting Kimmel since the decision was made last week, criticizing the Trump administration </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJewRRfp4K4"><span>during a No Kings stream on September 18</span></a><span>, saying this move was an attack on free speech. After it was reported that Disney’s </span><a href="https://collider.com/disney-stock-nosedive-dis-nyse-drop-boycott-reaction-jimmy-kimmel/"><span>stock had dropped</span></a><span> following the calls for a boycott (though some dispute if this seven-percent drop is anything more than a standard fluctuation), Ruffalo warned </span><a href="https://www.threads.com/@markruffalo/post/DO1CP-Jjtsj"><span>on Threads</span></a><span> that “It’s going to go down a lot further if they cancel his show.”</span></p> <p><span>Disney and Kimmel are reportedly currently in talks, looking for a </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney-late-night-comeback-1236524695/"><span>“compromise” to bring the late-night show back</span></a><span>, but there has been no official word on whether these talks have borne any fruit.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/exclusive-pokemon-30th-anniversary-merch-museum-despite-van-gogh-2000627540</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-pok%C3%A9mon-merch-comes-to-another-museum-despite-van-gogh-debacle.1304367/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Natural History Museum of London is getting a Pokémon pop-up shop experience beginning in early 2026. It’ll have exclusive stuff fans can’t get anywhere else. It’s intended to be part of Pokémon’s 30th anniversary celebration. Why does it seem destined to be yet <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-van-gogh-museum-scalpers-pikachu-card-1850882131">another scalper-infested mess</a>?</p> <p>Fans will need to register for a free ticket to visit the Pokémon x Natural History Museum pop-up store, which will run from 26 January 2026 until 22 March 2026. If you can’t make it to London yourself, the merchandise will be available to buy from the <a href="https://www.nhmshop.co.uk/?srsltid=AfmBOorBseC_DhtYXMqRbGzy3Zxn6ye5OvDqVzxM9dHraX54OsyrcOM7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online Natural History Museum shop</a> as well, according to <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-GB/Go-wild-as-The-Pokemon-Company-International-and-Natural-History-Museu">today’s press release</a>. It’ll include clothing, stationery, accessories, prints, and a brand-new exclusive plush, all of which “are sure to delight fans of all ages.”</p> <p>“The Natural History Museum and Pokémon share a fascination for and focus on the natural world and its creatures, from their evolution to their environment,” reads a press release. “In the Pokémon world, Pokémon can evolve into many forms which allow them to adapt smoothly and perfectly to any environment. Meanwhile, the Natural History Museum’s halls take you on a journey through the evolution and diversity of life on planet earth, from prehistoric dinosaurs to the species we live alongside today.”</p>

 <p>While The Pokémon Company hasn’t teased exactly what the exclusive merch will be, it’s promising “products designed especially for the collaboration.” Whether that’s a fossil-centric approach to the franchise’s creatures or something else thematically appropriate remains to be seen. “Design inspiration has been drawn directly from the Natural History Museum’s iconic building and architecture, as well as the beautiful naturalist sketches that fill the Museum’s archives,” head of Pokémon Europe licensing Mathieu Galante said.</p>

 <p>It certainly can’t go any worse than what transpired in 2023 when Holland’s Van Gogh Museum had its own Pokémon pop-up shop. The frenzy of fans and the race to scalp products online for jacked-up prices left an unfortunate scar on the fandom’s collectors. Have things mellowed out two years later? Hardly. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900">steady growth of Pokémon market speculators</a> and the ongoing scarcity of what The Pokémon Company is able to get manufactured when it comes to cards, plushies, and other rare collectibles <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-plush-scalper-reseller-world-championships-2000618087">has left communities exhausted</a>.</p> <p>It’s not yet clear how The Pokémon Company<em>&nbsp;</em>plans to avoid similar issues with the Natural History Museum collaboration. Hopefully, it’s either produced enough stock to meet at least most of the demand, or found a way to limit what people can buy. The 30th anniversary of Pokémon begins February 27, 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Galaxy Buds 3 FE are a more affordable option to the their Buds 3 Pro counterpart, but what’s the real difference? first up is the drivers. The FE model employ just one 11mm driver in each earbud. With the Pro model, you get a dual-driver setup combining a 10.5mm dynamic driver with a 6.5 planar magnetic driver on each side. So as one would expect, you’ll get better sound on the Buds 3 Pro, but that’s not to say the FE model sound won’t be good.</p>
<p>Both sets of earbuds support active noise cancellation, but that on the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro is more robust—allowing you to fine tune the ANC strength based on environmental factors.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4219/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>SmartTag 2 Included</h2>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4219/">So if those aren’t deal breakers for you, you might as well save some cash. Plus, right now, Amazon is offering the Buds 3 FE for $30 off.</a> The price comes down from $180 to just $150, but that’s not all. Samsung is throwing in a SmartTag 2 free of charge when you order a pair.</p>
<p>These Samsung SmartTags can be a real life saver. We all know how Find My Phone functionality works. If you ever leave your phone behind, it’s not lost forever. You can pinpoint it’s exact location no matter where you are. Well, SmartTags brings that ability to anything you own. Stick it in your wallet or purse so you can always remember where you last set it down. Heck, you can even leave one in your glove compartment so you can always recall what block your parked your car on.</p>



<p>Back to the Galaxy Buds 3 FE, you’re getting a reliable set of earbuds without breaking the bank. This generation Samsung earbuds has an improved design and fit from the previous models. The rounded ear tips help keep them securely in place as you listen all day long.</p>
<p>With ANC turned off, you’ll get up to 8.5 hours of uninterrupted listening time on the earbuds alone. When you add in the charging case’s battery, you can receive up to 30 hours of playtime total.</p>
<p>Connect your Galaxy Buds 3 FE to your multiple devices at once. You can effortlessly switch between your phone, tablet, and PC as your needs change. You could be watching a video on your laptop when a call comes in. Answer it and have the audio come through your earbuds without changing a thing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Like lots of canceled games, the more I hear about <em>Perfect Dark</em>, the cooler it sounds. Also is Tom Holland okay? And which Metal Gear should get the Unreal Engine 5 glow-up next? Face the new week with the latest edition of <em>Kotaku</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/morning-checkpoint">Morning Checkpoint</a> at your side. The daily roundup of gaming news and culture breezes you through some of the biggest headlines going around. I stayed up until 3 a.m. this morning reviewing video games because it’s that time of year. I’m very tired but not too tired to contemplate which movies would <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thegaychingy.bsky.social/post/3lze5vfxclk2q">make Carl’s top five in the Criterion closet</a>.</p> <h2>Some more <em>Perfect Dark</em> reboot details leak</h2> <p>Microsoft’s canceled Xbox exclusive <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-reportedly-cancels-that-cool-looking-perfect-dark-1851785531">might have been originally planned</a> as an episodic release. That’s according to a new <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/gameplay-details-concept-screens-cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot">report by<em> MP1st</em></a>. If accurate, that might have made the espionage shooter’s rollout similar to that of <em>Hitman</em> (2016). According to leaked development materials reviewed by the website, The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics were working on the game’s first robust vertical slice right up until it was canceled this summer.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Perfect Dark | Gameplay Details and Concept Art</p> <p>According to the report, as of April this year, The Initiative was still working on the game's Vertical Slice 1.<a href="https://t.co/mSBXCnflwP">https://t.co/mSBXCnflwP</a> <a href="https://t.co/ToSZNR4dKP">pic.twitter.com/ToSZNR4dKP</a></p> <p>— Klobrille (@klobrille) <a href="https://twitter.com/klobrille/status/1969845612549202200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The report also details a planned Adrenaline System which would be a resource that let players pull off <a href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864"><em>Matrix</em>-like abilities</a> ranging from healing and increased damage to slowing down time for aiming and dodging bullets. Leaked concept art points to an “Eco Sci-Fi” version of Cairo, the setting of an early teaser, as being one of the locations to ship in the first episode of the game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-canceled-take-two-embracer-xbox-crystal-dynamics-2000622400"><em>Bloomberg</em> recently reported</a> that 2K Games was looking to takeover publishing but couldn’t work out a deal with Microsoft and Embracer over rights to the IP.</p>

 <h2>Tom Holland rushed to hospital after botched <em>Spider-Man</em> movie stunt</h2> <p>Tom Holland has been doing <a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-brand-new-day-4-mcu-suit-tom-holland-set-2000616006">cool stunts</a> in London while filming <i>Spider-Man: Brand New Day</i>, Unfortunately at least one of them didn’t go as planned and he’s now recovering. “We were called at 10.30am on Friday to attend to a patient who had sustained an injury at Leavesden Studios in Watford,” an East of England Ambulance Service spokesman told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/36792761/tom-holland-hospital-spider-man-stunt/"><em>The Sun</em></a> yesterday. “An ambulance was sent to the scene, and the patient was transported to hospital for further care.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/tom-holland-hospitalized-spider-man-brand-new-day-1236552019/">According to <em>Deadline</em></a>, Holland suffered a concussion and filming has been paused for a couple of days as a precaution. Hopefully, he can make a speedy recovery even with out the real Spidey’s mutant super healing.</p> <h2>Which <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> should get the remake treatment next?</h2> <p>A poll has been recently <a href="https://x.com/MGSMGN/status/1969354623007014979/photo/2">shared on X</a> which looks to be one Konami intends to send out after a <em>Metal Gear</em>-focused livestream later this week from TGS. The poll asks fans which other <em>Metal Gear </em>games they’d like to see remade, following the recent release of <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>. <em>MGS 2: Sons of Liberty</em> is the obvious choice, though I could see the case for <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> as well.<em> Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</em>, meanwhile, remains trapped on PS3, though fans suspect the <em>Master Collection Vol. 2</em>, whenever it’s ready, will finally port it to modern consoles.</p>

 <h2><em>Nintendo vs. Palworld</em> is currently a debate about mods</h2> <p><a href="https://gamesfray.com/gross-in-palworld-patent-case-nintendo-tells-japanese-judge-mods-should-not-count-as-prior-art-because-they-cant-run-without-underlying-games/">According to <em>Games Fray</em></a>, part of Pocket Pair’s defense in Nintendo’s patent lawsuit is that certain mechanics Nintendo claims as its own were already in use in other games, including versions modded by players. Nintendo is reportedly arguing that mods don’t count as “prior art” because they can’t exist or run separate from the game’s they were made for.</p>

 <h2><em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> nerfs nudity in Japan</h2> <p>The open-world zombie adventure is reportedly censoring certain depictions in Japan. The tweaks include changes to female zombies and the removal of all nudity, according to <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/09/19/157365.html"><em>Game Spark</em></a> (via<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dying-light-the-beast-is-the-latest-game-to-be-censored-in-japan/"><em> VGC</em></a>). “These changes have resulted in an overall tone down on violent scenes, while still allowing Japanese players to enjoy seamless co-op play with friends playing the overseas version.”</p>

 <h2><em>Tomb Raider</em> remaster patches out AI voice performance changes</h2> <p>The French version of <em>Tomb Raider 4-6 Remastered</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/lara-croft-tomb-raider-francoise-cadol-aspyr-remaster-2000624934">was accused</a> of using AI to alter an actor’s performance. Those accusations appear to have been well-founded now, because Aspyr has gone and removed the AI alterations from the game. “We’ve addressed this issue by removing all AI voiceover content, while retaining the improvements made in the previous update,” the studio <a href="https://support.aspyr.com/hc/en-us/articles/39710879443853-Tomb-Raider-IV-VI-Remastered-Hotfix-for-Patch-2">wrote announcing a surprise hotfix update</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-lawsuit-aspyr-patch/"><em>The Gamer</em></a>). “We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

              <div> <p>Chrome Boba Fett and the little baby Yoda are here to help you forget all about Disney’s complicity in <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-fallon-colbert-stewart-trump-kirk-2000627249">a grim attack on free speech</a>. Out in less than nine months, <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu&nbsp;</em>now has its first trailer, and the next<em> Star Wars</em> movie looks both incredibly unnecessary and also lots of fun.</p> </div>  <p>The film stars Pedro Pascal as the Mandalorian bounty hunter, with his Force-sensitive sidekick Grogu looking as adorable as ever. Set after the TV series, the film finds the pair back in the galactic hotseat, navigating post-war tensions between the New Republic (Sigourney Weaver plays a colonel named Ward) and remnants of the Empire (Jonny Coyne plays an imperial warlord). Also Jabba the Hutt’s son Rotta is in the mix too.</p>  <p>Here’s a brief look:</p>   <p>And here’s the official synopsis:</p> <blockquote><p>The evil Empire has fallen, and Imperial warlords remain scattered throughout the galaxy. As the fledgling New Republic works to protect everything the Rebellion fought for, they have enlisted the help of legendary Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin and his young apprentice Grogu.</p></blockquote> <p>The whole 90 seconds flashes by in an instant, but in addition to the aforementioned characters you can also catch a glimpse of some alien guy messing people up with an electrostaff and Grogu speeding around with some other cute god-knows-whats (paging <em>Star Wars</em> lore master Zack Zwiezen). But like I said at the top, it looks fun and not mired down in a bunch of <em>Star Wars</em> naval-gazing mythbuilding, which is a good a thing.</p> <p><em>The Mandalorian and Grogu </em>is directed by Jon Favreau and co-written by Favreau and Dave Filoni, and marks the first in a fresh slate of upcoming<em> Star Wars</em> movies for Disney. With everything else, including a new Jedi-centric tale with <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-new-jedi-order-writer-replaced-rey-delayed-1851747797">Daisy Ridley returning as Rey completely MIA</a>, it’ll either feel like the start of something new or the death knell for the current streaming-wars-burnout incarnation of the franchise. The movie hits theaters on May 22, 2026, and can’t come soon enough for a <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney-boycott-marvel-marisa-tomei-2000627135">company currently facing a boycott</a> from fans and celebrities over the Jimmy Kimmel controversy.</p> <p><em>Update 9/22/2025 10:35 a.m. ET: added more story details.</em></p>
