              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> was, at one point, going to be a free-to-play game that would have been “completely” different than what we got in 2024. And this pivot is part of the reason why <em>Helldivers 2</em> has some nasty performance problems.</p> <p>When <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-update-terminid-2000620349"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> launched on PS5 and PC early last year, it quickly became a massive hit for PlayStation and developers Arrowhead. And since then, the sci-fi co-op shooter has remained popular as more updates have expanded the game, adding new weapons, enemies, locations, and more. But in recent months, players have complained about performance issues and technical problems.&nbsp; <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-new-content-bug-fixes-1851419351">Arrowhead’s CEO, Shams Jorjani,</a> isn’t shying away from these criticisms and is directly addressing them in the official <em>Helldivers 2</em> Discord server. And it’s here that he also revealed that at one point in time, <em>Helldivers 2</em> was a much smaller game that was planned to be free-to-play and not a paid experience.</p> <p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arrowhead-ceo-blames-helldivers-2-performance-issues-on-tech-debt-accumulated-thanks-to-goalposts-being-moved-a-few-times-during-development-the-foundations-of-this-big-tower-were-made-for-a-little-bungalow/">On September 25</a>, while talking to fans about <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-sequel-dei-politics-woke-arrowhead-1851731175">Helldivers 2</a> a</em>nd its ongoing performance issues on console and PC on Discord, Jorjani explained that the shooter had a lot of built-up “tech debt” from various pivots that happened during development.</p> <p>“[<em>Helldivers 2</em>] started as a AA game,” <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102973812179488798/1420832196813389824">said the CEO</a>. “[It] then grew in scope, then pivoted to a launch title for PS5, then pivoted to F2P, then back to premium ( I might have the order messed up) – so the goal posts were moved a few times – so the foundations of this big tower were made for a little bungalow on the beach.”</p>

 <p>As far as I know, this is the first time it’s been officially confirmed by anyone at Arrowhead publicly that <em>Helldivers 2</em> was at one point planned to be free-to-play. It’s interesting to think about now, and according to Jorjani, that version of the game would have had a “completely different content pipeline” and would have likely been a very different game compared to what we actually got.</p>

 <p>“I wasn’t with Arrowhead back then so I don’t know – but the model was always to give away as much nice stuff for free and monetize other things,” said Jorjani. “It would have been a completely different angle. It [would have] required a completely different content pipeline.”</p>

 <p>Making all of these changes and pivots during development led to a lot of tech debt, which the CEO says is a big reason the game’s performance is “so-so.” But they are planning to improve things in the future, with the CEO telling fans in the Discord that improving the game is like cleaning out a garage.</p> <p>“Tech debt is like a garage filled with stuff you just chucked in,” said the CEO. “We really need to put up shelves in the back to get organized.” This isn’t the first time he’s talked about the game’s tech debt causing issues. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-ceo-just-comes-out-and-says-it-the-technical-debt-is-crippling-and-we-didnt-hit-the-mark-with-into-the-unjust-update-so-arrowhead-is-trying-to-get-our-s-in-order/">Earlier this month,</a> he reiterated that<em> Helldivers 2</em> wasn’t in a great place and that the team needed to get their “shit in order” and fix it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Square Enix arguably broke the internet about 10 years ago when it finally revealed it was working on a long-anticipated remake of <i>Final Fantasy 7</i>. Now, in 2025, two parts of this trilogy project have arrived on PlayStation and PC, with ports expected on Switch 2 and Xbox in the near future.</p> <p>Speaking with a number of outlets, <i>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</i>’s director Naoki Hamaguchi shed some light on <i>FF7 Remake</i>’s upcoming arrival on Switch 2 and Xbox, what it took to get the game running on less powerful hardware, how <i>Rebirth</i> is shaping up on Switch 2, and which <i>Final Fantasy</i> he’d be eager to see remade next.</p> <h2>The key to the Switch 2’s <i>FF7R</i> port was nailing the lighting</h2> <p><a href="https://screenrant.com/ff7-remake-director-interview-rebirth-switch-2-confirmed/">Speaking to <i>ScreenRant</i></a>, Hamaguchi zeroed in on “character expressions” and “lighting” as being essential to delivering a quality experience on Nintendo’s hybrid console:</p>

 <blockquote><p>Our aim was to align more towards the lightning we see in the PS5 version, and then we also kind of balance this by aligning more towards the sort of switch to post-effect and fog. And in this way the user is not really able to make out a huge difference</p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-xbox">In an interview with <i>Inverse</i></a>, Hamaguchi said that a Switch 2 port seemed likely early on once “Nintendo first shared with [Square Enix] the new hardware […] the thought came to me that <i>Final Fantasy 7 </i>can likely run on these specs.”</p>

 <p>According to Hamaguchi, the Xbox version was already in the works before the team got their first look at the Switch 2 hardware. And, contrary to what you may think, the underpowered Series S wasn’t much of an issue. Though the team has run into some memory problems on Series S, Hamaguchi still describes Microsoft’s budget console as “quite high in terms of specs.”</p>

 <p><i>FF7 Remake</i> isn’t the only part of the remake project headed to Switch 2. The more graphically ambitious <i>Rebirth</i> is also expected to arrive at some point in the future. Hamaguchi described <i>Rebirth</i> as being in a “working state” on Switch 2. “Our desire was to be able to ultimately offer and serve all of the platforms available,” Hamaguchi told <i>ScreenRant</i>. He declined to say, however, whether or not the third installment will arrive as a multiplatform title on day one.</p>

 <h2>Development on part three of <i>FF7</i> remake’s trilogy is ‘going extremely well’</h2> <p>The <i>FF7 </i>remake project is still ongoing, with a yet-unnamed third entry on the horizon. Hamaguchi describes development as “going extremely well.” “A lot of the content is already playable,” <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-selling-well-no-need-to-worry-about-the-trilogys-finale-director-naoki-hamaguchi-says/">he told <i>Automaton</i></a>, “and the game’s direction and form are firmly set in place. Right now the team is united around refining everything.”</p>

 <p><i>FF7</i>’s remakes have certainly impressed a number of fans, but concerns over the sales of the last entry and the general direction of the various plot changes do remain. For his part, Hamaguchi has described <i>Rebirth</i> as “doing very well on both PS5 and PC” in terms of sales. He also shared with <i>ScreenRant</i> how the recent live-action <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> remake inspired his decisions in reinterpreting <i>FF7</i> for the remake trilogy:</p> <blockquote><p>When development [on <i>FF7 Remake</i>] was happening, the <i>Beauty and the Beast</i> movie remake was released. That movie, the original, was one I watched as a child. And then they now had the live-action that’s a remake…I saw the overall story and the world itself was not altered, but it was completely deconstructed in a way to really entertain today’s viewers, which was deeply satisfying.</p></blockquote> <p>Although <i>FF7</i>’s remake chapters have occupied his time, Hamaguchi has spent some time daydreaming about other possible remakes in the classic JRPG series. <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/final-fantasy-7-director-on-xbox">Speaking to <i>Windows Central</i></a>, the director described <i>FF6</i> as his favorite, saying “That would be very cool to take on as a remake. I’ve put my heart and soul into the <i>Final Fantasy 7 Remake</i> series for over a decade now. Working on something completely new would be quite fun as well.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Vandal Hearts II</em> is an obscure strategy RPG sequel produced by Konami at the end of the PS1’s life. Few played it but many who did will cherish it forever. Now its oldest and weirdest mystery has finally be solved. A reference to Konami’s classic shoot ’em up series <em>Gradius</em> mentioned a special sword in the game’s files that no one could ever get to spawn without hacks. Fans thought up all sorts of wild theories about the “intended” way to unlock the secret, including maybe needing very specific save files from other Konami games like<em> Suikoden</em>. It turns out that they actually needed a super-rare demo disc.</p> <p>The Gradius Sword in <em>Vandal Hearts II</em> isn’t just a fun little Easter egg. The weapon contains a powerful spell called “Ripple Laser” that summons an actual 3D model of <em>Gradius</em>‘ ship, the Vic Viper, to fly across the battlefield and blow up enemies. It’s pretty powerful and has a surprisingly ornate animation for something that no one was ever able to discover in the game naturally. The result has been decades of random threads across <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/199180-vandal-hearts-ii/80436904?page=2">message boards like GameFAQs</a> and elsewhere as fans tried to figure out what you could actually do in the game to trigger the Gradius Sword to appear.</p> <p>Three years ago, the tiny <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXjQ4JRg9fo">YouTube account Dragon Quarter</a> reposted footage of the Ripple Laser skill in action that was originally uploaded in 2010. Then last night, Dragon Quarter returned with a major update. “After getting a tip from a follower (who I realize now got their tip from a recent post on&nbsp;<a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/199180-vandal-hearts-ii/80436904?page=1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">GameFAQs</a>) of Twitch streamer&nbsp;<a href="https://www.twitch.tv/karkalla" target="_blank" rel="nofollow ugc noopener">Karkalla</a>, who is currently playing through <em>Vandal Hearts II</em> for the first time, I have confirmed the Gradius Sword was originally unlocked by downloading a special save data file from Dengeki PlayStation D22 (SLPM-80471), a demo disc included with <em>Dengeki PlayStation Magazine</em> Issue 116 (dated 1999-09-24),” they <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-decades-old-mystery-about-a-hidden-unlockable-gradius-sword-in-vandal-hearts-ii-for-playstation-has-finally-been-figured-out.1309491/">posted</a> on ResetEra on Friday.</p>

  <p>According to GameFAQs user Kern, the discovery came after finding a reference to the demo disc on an older Japanese site. “Someone on a discord who had some old discs found the file on the D22 disc (which you can get from ebay),” they wrote. “I wasn’t able to verify it personally myself but he posted images of the file, and he was able to open the save file on an English copy and the Gradius sword was available for purchase.” Dragon Quarter has since confirmed it as well.</p>

 <p>This is the kind of deep gaming lore I thrive on. For years, random players <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/199180-vandal-hearts-ii/53785268">on forums have claimed</a> to have found the weapon early on in <em>Vandal Hearts II</em> just by chance. Is it possible there’s some one in a million chance for it to just spawn randomly without the demo disc data? Who knows. It seems clear that Konami at least intended for it to be an exclusive bonus for owners of the demo disc, similar to the deluxe edition pre-orders of today that let players begin a game with unique upgrades and gear.</p> <p>The most absurd theory by far was that you needed to have a final Gregminster save point from the original<em> Suikoden</em> on a memory card to get the Gradius Sword to appear in the shop. When that was debunked a couple of years ago, many players had resigned themselves to the weapon only being available via some hacked save file from “Jean” that was uploaded to GameFAQs over a decade ago. Now players can get it the “official” way by downloading a <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/199180-vandal-hearts-ii/saves">copy of the demo disc save</a> and using a PS3 memory card converter to get the data onto a PS1 memory card.</p>

              <p>We can’t blame you if you were planning on keeping your wallet stashed away until Amazon’s Fall Prime Day hits on Oct. 7-8, but the run-up to the big event is often where you can find sneaky-good deals as Amazon looks to clear out the shelves. We found this one today — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/">24% off the price of the Samsung Galaxy Buds3 Pro, which brings their price down to just $190.</a> That’s right in line with Apple’s AirPods 4 and a big drop from the closer-comparison AirPods Pro3.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Buds3 Pro got a full redesign from Samsung before dropping this past July, with an emphasis on comfort for long listening sessions. The sound is, of course, the amazing quality that Samsung’s famous for. And these buds are bolstered by Galaxy AI to enhance the noise cancellation, equalization, and more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Theater of the Mind</h2>
<p>Whether you’re listening to your own playlist or connecting to your tablet or TV via Bluetooth, the surround sound from the Galaxy Buds3 Pro is so good and so immersive it’s like being in the theater, but the sound is all for you. Dual amplifiers and a 2-way speaker in each bud creates a 360-degree effect, and Galaxy AI powers an adaptive equalizer that optimizes the sound specifically for you.</p>
<p>You can disappear into the listening experience of the Galaxy Buds3 Pro regardless of where you are, because the Adaptive Active Noise Cancellation feature, also powered by Galaxy AI, intelligently adjusts the level of noise cancellation based on your surroundings, and changes is as the conditions around you change. You won’t want to put them down, and thanks to the comfort-enhancing redesign and long battery life, you won’t have to.</p>



<h2>Futuristic Features</h2>
<p>One of the most jawdropping features of the Galaxy Buds3 Pro is the real-time interpreter. When your Buds3 Pro are paired with a compatible Galaxy device, your can carry on a conversation with someone speaking a foreign language and hear the translation on your earbuds in real time. All you need is a Samsung account, from which you can download languages for free. (English and Spanish are pre-installed.)</p>
<p>Will there be incredible tech deals dropping during the two-day Fall Prime Day event? Of course. But consider the several days leading into the event a golden opportunity to find those under-the-radar bargains Amazon likes to drop as they get their inventory set for the big rush. This is most definitely one of them — a $60-off deal on Samsung’s newest and best wireless earbuds. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4335/">Get the Galaxy Buds3 Pro for just $190 and beat the Prime Day rush.</a></p>
