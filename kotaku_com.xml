That’s the big question that a lot of game developers, fans, industry analysts, and publishers are wondering right now.

But it ain’t just fans who have been waiting for a decade that are desperate for a <em>GTA 6</em> release date. Studio and publisher execs across the industry as well as smaller devs are watching closely, as nobody wants to release a game too close to <em>GTA 6 </em>and get demolished by it. As a result, everybody seems nervous about announcing a fall release date for their non-<em>GTA </em>games. And investors and analysts are watching to see if Rockstar’s behemoth lands in 2025 or slips into next year, something that would cause a lot of industry chaos.</p><p>Okay, so with seemingly everyone wanting to know when <em>GTA 6</em> will specifically launch, I’m here to provide a date. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/mzAfTmC3It0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/mzAfTmC3It0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A drumroll, please</a></span>...</p><p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>will launch on October 28.</p><p>Probably. Or, like, right around there. Pretty close to that point. I mean I’m fairly certain that if the game doesn’t get delayed into 2026, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-borderlands-4-fall-2025-1851757501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-borderlands-4-fall-2025-1851757501">which Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick doesn’t think will happen</a></span>, <em>GTA 6</em> is arriving <em>sometime </em>in late October. And October 28 is the last Tuesday of the month, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_published_by_Rockstar_Games&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_video_games_published_by_Rockstar_Games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a month in which Rockstar has historically</a></span> released a lot of its biggest games. But this isn’t just a random guess based on the fall 2025 release window and Rockstar’s past game releases. </p><h2 id="h1378154"><a id=""></a><em>Borderlands 4</em> and Take-Two’s CEO</h2><p>Earlier this week, 2K Games and Gearbox announced the release date for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-release-date-state-play-gta-6-fall-2025-1851762044&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-release-date-state-play-gta-6-fall-2025-1851762044"><em>Borderlands 4.</em></a></span> The co-op sci-fi looter shooter is set to arrive on September 23. Why does that matter? Well, Take-Two Interactive is the parent company for both Rockstar and 2K Games. So unless Rockstar Games is completely rogue and never communicates with Take-Two leadership, I’d imagine they know when <em>GTA 6</em> is landing, even if it’s just a rough window. And that would likely help inform when they would choose to launch <em>Borderlands 4. </em></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamefile.news/p/dice-cards-ruler-earthbound-vivrato&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/dice-cards-ruler-earthbound-vivrato" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by Stephen Totilo’s <em>Game File </em>on February 13</a></span>, there was a lot of excitement and chatter at DICE during the week due to the announcement of <em>Borderlands 4</em>'s release date. Totilo reports that a “well-plugged-in attendee” that he spoke to at the industry event explained that “everyone’s waiting for Take-Two and Rockstar” to pick a release day for <em>GTA 6</em>. And <em>Borderlands 4</em> is a signal from Take-Two: September 23 and the weeks immediately before and after it are probably safe.</p><p>Pull out a calendar and that likely means <em>GTA 6</em> isn’t landing in September. Fall starts on September 22 and the next day <em>Borderlands 4</em> launches. So September is out. That leaves October and November. However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://dotesports.com/call-of-duty/news/all-call-of-duty-games-in-release-order&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://dotesports.com/call-of-duty/news/all-call-of-duty-games-in-release-order" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">historically <em>Call of Duty</em> has arrived in November</a></span> and while <em>GTA 6 </em>is likely to outsell this year’s <em>CoD </em>sequel, I doubt Take-Two and Rockstar want that big of a game launching so close to <em>GTA 6. </em></p><p>So with that in mind, and based on Zelnick sounding very committed to a fall release date, I think that points to a late October launch while <em>Call of Duty</em>, which is now owned by Xbox, probably moves into the middle of November. Remember, Xbox wants <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> to be a big hit as it’s a game that will likely sell a ton of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-xbox-series-x-s-performance-mode-1851074000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-xbox-series-x-s-performance-mode-1851074000">Xbox Series S</a></span> consoles. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-xbox-series-s-pc-take-two-boss-worried-rockstar-1851691951?_gl=1*9mbwku*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczOTU2OTQxNy40NDguMC4xNzM5NTY5NDE5LjU4LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-xbox-series-s-pc-take-two-boss-worried-rockstar-1851691951?_gl=1*9mbwku*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczOTU2OTQxNy40NDguMC4xNzM5NTY5NDE5LjU4LjAuMA..">The tiny Xbox is the cheapest way to play the upcoming <em>GTA</em> sequel</a></span>. </p><p>So there you go: <em>GTA 6 </em>is out on October 28. Or maybe Take-Two does an early access period for the game and the “official” release date is the 28th but it really arrives three days early on the 25th. Either way, I’m thinking this Halloween season a lot of people are going to be too busy causing mayhem in Vice City to go to any spooky parties. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Both were in the top five most-played games on the platform, alongside <em>Genshin Impact</em>, <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>, and <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>. The company reported $1.09 billion spent by 295 million PC players on the Epic Games Store last year, but only $255 million of that went to third-party games. For comparison, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/valve-runs-its-massive-pc-gaming-ecosystem-with-only-about-350-employees/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/valve-runs-its-massive-pc-gaming-ecosystem-with-only-about-350-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft estimated Valve’s annual revenue</a></span> at over $6 billion back in 2021.</p><p>So the Epic Games Store is still very much a <em>Fortnite </em>launcher with a ton of other cool stuff grafted onto it, but it’s certainly not <em>just</em> a<em> Fortnite </em>launcher. And with that in mind, the company also signaled what’s ahead for its digital storefront in 2025. The roadmap includes an overhaul of discoverability, new social features, the addition of pre-loading and a new download manager, as well as the ability to finally gift games to other people. </p><p>All of this is being done with the intent to seamlessly integrate it across an Epic Games Store mobile app as the company lobbies regulators the world over to force iOS and Android to play nice with it. We’ll see if, as that grand vision comes closer to being a reality, the Epic Games Store finally becomes a more central force to be reckoned with in PC gaming. For now, it’s still a great place to snag tons of cool games for free. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And if you look at other Xbox studios, things aren’t much better. </p><p>The Coalition hasn’t launched a new <em>Gears </em>game since <em>Gears 5</em> in 2019 and Rare hasn’t made a new game since 2020's <em>Battletoads</em>. (Though the studio does a lot of support on <em>Sea of Thieves</em>.) </p><p>Meanwhile, Obsidian has shipped three games since 2018 under Xbox and has another big RPG landing later this year. And it released<em> Outer Worlds </em>in 2019, a game which started production before the Xbox deal and wasn’t published by Microsoft, but was yet one more big RPG from the company in a relatively short span of time. And there are rumors of the company already working on a new project, too. So how did the studio reach this point? </p><h2 id="h171034"><a id=""></a>How Obsidian became Xbox’s most valuable asset</h2><p> Well,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/obsidian-plans-to-make-rpgs-for-100-years-by-not-trying-to-grow-aggressively-expand-our-team-size-or-make-super-profitable-games/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/obsidian-plans-to-make-rpgs-for-100-years-by-not-trying-to-grow-aggressively-expand-our-team-size-or-make-super-profitable-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> during a talk at DICE Summit earlier this week</a></span>, Obsidian Entertainment VP of operations Marcus Morgan and VP of development Justin Britch talked about the company’s philosophy of staying lean and making smart investments in medium-sized games that don’t take a decade to make. The studio heads also emphasized keeping headcount low and aiming for as little turnover as possible to help the studio gain more institutional knowledge. </p><p>The goal: The duo want Obsidian to last 100 years. Really. When asked about the goal of keeping the studio around for 100 years, long after they are dead, they said: “Are we serious? … Yes.” </p><p>And honestly, I think Obsidian can pull it off. It clearly has a team of people who understand how to build properly scoped games using relatively small teams while managing multiple projects at once. </p><p>In an industry where some studios <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818">lay people off all the time</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamerant.com/gta-6-leaks-development-how-long/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamerant.com/gta-6-leaks-development-how-long/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spend five to seven years working on one game</a></span>, Obsidian has gone a different path. And the end result is one of the most productive and successful studios around. I bet Microsoft is happy they snagged the place up back in 2018. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But while we may love our video game love interests, perhaps it’s worth reflecting on whether or not these relationships would be feasible were they not bound together by a world-ending event like the Blight or the invasion of Corypheus.</p><p>Sure, a romance with Iron Bull in <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em> is undeniably hot, but what happens when the hole in the sky is no longer spitting demons out into the real world and you just have to live with each other? <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>added three new datable dudes to the mix and expanded on two old ones from <em>Inquisition</em>, which means it’s time to re-rank the <em>Dragon Age </em>boyfriends on how much they are actual, real-life boyfriend material. </p><p><strong>Update, 2/14/25, 2:00 p.m. ET: </strong>This piece was originally published on February 14, 2023. It has been updated to account for the release of <em>The Veilguard.</em></p></div></div><div><p> I don’t have to hypothesize as to whether or not Solas would be a good boyfriend in real life because he was already a terrible one in the <em>Dragon Age </em>games. This guy spends the entirety of <em>Inquisition</em> lying to you about the real reason he’s been helping you, which is to help get his world-ending plan back on track after he fucked it up. Even if you’re in a romantic relationship with the guy, this truth doesn’t come to light until after he dips at the end of the game and tells you why he ghosted you in the DLC. Yes, it’s tragic, it’s angsty, and it makes for great drama, but one day you, too, will be old and tired and want someone who’s just gonna be there when you get home from work. This man is too busy trying to destroy the world for a righteous cause to care about seeing you every night. <em>The Veilguard </em>only makes his crimes against humanity more clear and even if he ends up smoothing things over with his girl in the end, you deserve someone who isn’t gonna leave you waiting for 10 years to get his shit together. Worst rl boyfriend, easily.</p></div><div><p>Look, Sebastian sucks. In <em>Dragon Age II</em>, the guy is so beholden to the church that he’s constantly judging people, including you. He’s also a chaste romance, if that’s your thing, but if it’s not, you’re gonna be left wanting at the behest of a god who left you and everyone else behind a long time ago. He’s not trying to destroy the world, so he does get to come out above Solas, but you can do better, friend. We have 11 bachelors yet to go...</p></div><div><p>I love Fenris. He was my romance option every time I’ve played <em>Dragon Age II</em>, and the rival romance between him and a mage Hawke plays out as delicious angst. But as the years have passed, I’ve cooled a lot on the relationship because it just has a lot of abusive undertones. The sex scene is sparked by an argument, then Fenris shoving you into a wall, lit up with his lyrium tattoos ready to reach through your chest and crush your heart. It illustrates the abuse Fenris has gone through, and the scene itself is very earned. It works well in a video game and on An Archive of Our Own, but in the context of a real romance the red flags keep popping up. Yeah, by the end Fenris and Hawke grow and have a better relationship, but if that shit happened once, it can happen again.</p></div><div><p>Cullen is a wildcard because his romance scene in <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition </em>shows he knows how to give you that good good and throws all his shit off his desk to do it. But he also seems like the kind of guy who, after you’d gotten well and settled, would start asking why you haven’t made dinner for when he gets home from work and tell you that your job should be to take care of the children, rather than having a career and life of your own. He seems sweet and chivalrous, but that can also come from some extremely backward views on relationships. So proceed with caution. You know the joke about liberals who look like Republicans? That’s Cullen, and it’s a coin flip for what you’re actually going to get.</p></div><div><p>Look, I know. But please hear me out before you start throwing tomatoes. Anders is possessed by the spirit of Justice, but he’s also possessed by his devotion to his cause. And that devotion extends to you, as well. You want a man who is <em>obsessed </em>with you? That’s Anders. You think a man who blew up a church in an act of terro—uh, revolution is going to ever half-ass your birthday or not appreciate the big moments of your lives together? No, this guy is gonna do something explosive for every life event you there is...so long as he doesn’t spot some great injustice happening elsewhere in the world that might distract him. Good thing the world is a completely just and good place in which no one is being disproportionately harmed by societal structures, right?</p></div><div><p>Blackwall is a liar, and as we established earlier when we talked about Solas—not to mention in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-romance-rank-boyfriend-kaidan-garrus-thane-1850096380&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-romance-rank-boyfriend-kaidan-garrus-thane-1850096380"><em>Mass Effect </em>boyfriend ranking</a></span>—that’s pretty bad. But Blackwall’s lie is a good lie, because he’s trying to keep the legacy of a better man alive while trying to atone for his sins. Unlike Solas and the others, his lie is not selfish. Assuming Blackwall’s identity did allow Thom Rainier to avoid his tortured past, but he owns up to it and then there are no secrets between him and the Inquisitor. Then you just have a guy who is a broody gentleman that will fight and die for you.</p></div><div><p>When you meet Zevran in <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, it’s because he’s trying to kill you. But when you defeat him, the assassin tells you that he’ll turn on his employer in exchange for his life. In the early bits of the relationship, Zevran is out for himself. You overcome that detachment in the romance, until eventually you’re left with a funny, horny goofball who brightens your day with his antics. If you want someone who’s going to turn your frown upside down during the darkest times, you can’t go wrong with this assassin turned golden retriever puppy.<br></p></div><div><p>At a glance, Lucanis looks like he’s a bad boy who would ruin your life for a few weeks. I mean, when you see a man viciously descend upon a target while sporting magic wings, that screams edgelord. But it turns out, this guy’s a big ol’ softy. He’ll remember your favorite snacks, tend to your every whim, and slay your enemies with trained efficiency. Did someone cut you off in traffic? Dead. Was someone in the booth next to you rude to the wait staff? Contract accepted. What possible downside could this short king possibly have? Well, there is that Spite demon that possesses him when he goes to sleep. Unless you’re into that. If not, you’ll at least always have a fresh pot of coffee in the morning as he downs the stuff constantly to keep himself awake.</p></div><div><p>Surely Alistair is the least experienced of the <em>Dragon Age </em>boyfriend pantheon. That means he’s got a lot to learn, but since he’s not been playing the game, you can assume some level of purity in his intentions and willingness to feel the relationship out. Where Cullen feels like a risky proposition because he seems the type to harbor prehistoric views, Alistair seems too naive to want to do anything other than worship the ground you walk on. He’s a doofus, but he’s funny and kind-hearted. Just don’t ask him to take up the responsibility of being a king or he’ll resent you forever.</p></div><div><p>As SZA once said in an SNL sketch, “it’s cuffin’ season, and all the girls are leavin’ to get a big boy.” She was definitely singing about Iron Bull. This qunari giant is all about boundaries and consent, and serving you and your needs both in and out of the bedroom. Iron Bull is the kind of guy who will do anything to protect and serve his mate, and the man will not rest until you are content with every aspect of your life and relationship. Iron Bull won’t give up on you, unless you completely betray his trust and get all his friends killed. Which is valid, because in that case you were the problem in the relationship.</p></div><div><p>Davrin the Grey Warden is the embodiment of positive masculinity. He’s stoic but not emotionally withdrawn, firm but not harsh, and he’s nurturing to those he cares about. It takes a lot of patience to be a griffon dad and also be the protective caretaker of a strapping adventurer who can’t stop getting into trouble. But he also recognizes that your responsibilities weigh heavily on you and doesn’t leave you wondering about the relationship. Davrin is the kind of man who says “yes, I would still love you if you were a worm” without once getting annoyed at the improbable scenario.</p><p>The one lingering question mark comes from him being a Grey Warden. He could be doomed by the narrative, destined to leave you a single parent to a griffon if he hears his Calling and must go down to the Deep Roads to die, or, if some major lore developments happen and he doesn’t have to worry about the Calling, he might suddenly have a lot more road in front of him than he knows what to do with. Dating a Warden is a risk. But with Davrin? It’s one worth taking.</p></div><div><p>Dorian is too much of an idealist to ever want anything other than the best for you. When he’s not being a revolutionary tearing down the corruption of his homeland, Dorian is the kind of man who will come home and worry that you’re running yourself ragged with your own responsibilities. He deflects with humor when you ask him about how he’s doing, but then opens up because he’s just as comfortable with you as you are with him. He’ll have some internalized homophobia to unpack, which comes from growing up with an oppressive, prejudiced upbringing, but once you’ve helped him untangle that abuse, he’ll be your rock, just as you are his. In <em>The Veilguard</em>, Dorian is walking the walk he spent all of <em>Inquisition </em>saying he would. He’s spearheading real change in Tevinter, and if you can get past the probable political assassination attempts, you know he is someone who will come through for you at the hardest of times.</p></div><div><p>If you want a relationship in which you never have to worry your sweet little head about anything ever again, Emmrich is your guy. From the moment I met the necromancer in <em>The Veilguard </em>I was immediately charmed by his kind demeanor and the fact that a youthful whimsy had not left him in his twilight years. This man will wine and dine you without asking you to lift a finger. This man’s love language is acts of service. He likes to take things slow and will treat you with nothing less than the respect you deserve. Emmrich is the kind of guy who, when you take home to meet your mom, she’s happier to see him walk through the door than you are, and they get wine-drunk and cry looking at your baby pictures. You ask him what’s wrong and he tearfully says “I wasn’t there to protect you, darling.” How can you say no to someone who’s that obsessed with you but in a non-toxic way?</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
