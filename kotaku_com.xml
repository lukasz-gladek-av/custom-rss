I prefer to think about what Achilles meant when he encountered Odysseus in the underworld and told him he’d rather have lived a slave than died a hero. I’m not a history buff, but I have a massive affection for ancient Greek history and literature. Christopher Nolan directing an adaptation of <em>The Odyssey </em>should be slam dunk for me. So why am I so worried? </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p> The movie only recently started filming and is still more than a year away, but each little detail that leaks out from the production makes me do a Kombucha meme spit-take. The excellent tactician Odysseus, who famously broke the years-long siege of Troy with a maneuver so brilliant its now a staple of the English language and a famous condom brand, played by Matt “How ‘bout them apples?” Damon? The Bostonian’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOOkaNvDclY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KOOkaNvDclY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">period work has not been encouraging</a></span>. A Bronze Age ostentatious warrior dressed in drab grey and brown garb? Another goddamn Spartan helmet? I mean, come on. </p><p>I’m not nerd who comments in YouTube threads about historical accuracy, but these choices all strike me as ranging from boring to bizarre. The latest of these headscratchers comes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristopherNolan/comments/1ja4vt7/papi/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristopherNolan/comments/1ja4vt7/papi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via leaked set pics</a></span> that show Nolan on board a ship with Tom Holland who looks like he’s ready to throw the One Ring into Mt. Doom. A movie filmed out at sea instead of inside a warehouse in front of a green screen? Yay! A Greek epic taking place onboard a Viking ship? Huh...</p><p>Not to get all “Greek Trireme vs. Viking Longboat” History channel on you, but I have played enough <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> to know the difference. In fact, the boat in question appears to be the Draken Harald Hårfagre, Norway’s largest modern Viking-style ship, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.loopnorth.com/news/viking0220.htm&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.loopnorth.com/news/viking0220.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which reportedly left for Greece earlier this year</a></span>. Look, it’s a cool-looking boat and movies are fake, but even my 37-year-old dad brain that still randomly sends the group chat <em>Inception</em> memes at 7:00 a.m. in the morning is starting to get worried. </p><p>It’s hard not to get the sense that Nolan is playing fast-and-loose with one of the foundational texts of the Western Cannon. And not in a bonkers imaginative way either, but in an, “<em>Oppenheimer</em> made $1 billion and no one is ever telling me what to do again,” kind of way. Or maybe this really is part of some wild reinterpretation of The Odyssey and Odysseus’ son Telemachus, seemingly played by Tom Holland, just happens to run into some Vikings on his quest to find his lost father. Maybe there is time travel. Maybe this whole thing is a meta-commentary on people paying way too much attention to leaked Hollywood set photos. I hope so. I want so bad for <em>The Odyssey</em> to be so good. At least Jon Bernthal <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristopherNolan/comments/1ja9twr/first_image_of_john_bernthal_in_costume_alongside/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristopherNolan/comments/1ja9twr/first_image_of_john_bernthal_in_costume_alongside/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">looks incredible</a></span>.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We expect to take Spectre offline within the next 30 days, but we plan on disabling new purchases and refunding money spent since Season 1 launch via the platforms.”</p><p>Released last September on PC and promoted in association with former <em>Counter-Strike</em> pro and 2019 content creator of the year, Michael “Shroud” Grzesiek, <em>Spectre Divide</em>’s unique twist on the tactical shooter formula was the ability for each player to deploy two fighters onto the battlefield at once and then swap between them while setting or diffusing explosives.</p><p>It was a cool idea with a colorful art style that probably needed more runway to iterate and evolve in response to player feedback.

But as time has gone on, we haven’t seen enough active players and incoming revenue to cover the day-to-day costs of <em>Spectre</em> and the studio.”</p><p>Mountaintop Studios, which boasted veteran talent from Naughty Dog, Respawn Entertainment, and other AAA studios, employed over 70 staff according to LinkedIn. “We pursued every avenue to keep going, including finding a publisher, additional investment, and/or an acquisition,” Mitchell wrote. “In the end, we weren’t able to make it work. The industry is in a tough spot right now.  This is a painful update to share. We love <em>Spectre</em>, and we’re incredibly proud of what we built with this community.”<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
