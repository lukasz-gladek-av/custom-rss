              <p>Ring belongs to Amazon, which gives the retail giant complete freedom to price these video doorbells however aggressively it wants without worrying about profit margins on individual units. Amazon’s strategy focuses on getting Ring devices installed in as many homes as possible and knows that subscription revenue and ecosystem lock-in will pay off long-term even if the hardware sells at cost or below.</p>
<p>The newest<strong> battery doorbell model delivers head-to-toe video coverage with 66% more vertical view</strong> than the previous generation, and captures packages on the ground and tall visitors’ faces in a single frame. This<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/"> latest version currently sells for $49 on Amazon instead of the usual $99</a>&nbsp;which marks a record low price that makes smart doorbell technology accessible to practically anyone with a front door and a WiFi connection.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6333/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Video Coverage That Shows What Really Matters</h2>
<p>The <strong>bigger vertical field of view is a big improvement over older Ring doorbells</strong> which often cut off the tops of tall people’s heads or packages on the ground below the camera’s frame. This full-body coverage gets rid of the annoyance of having to watch footage again and again only to find that important details are missing because they were out of the camera’s view: You can clearly see the faces of delivery drivers while also making sure they really left your package instead of just pretending to deliver it. You can also see people who look suspiciously like they’re casing your property while they think they’re outside the camera’s range.</p>



<p>The<strong> built-in rechargeable battery</strong> means you don’t have to connect the doorbell to your home’s electrical system so renters or anyone who doesn’t want to deal with electrical work can install it. You probably already have cables that work with the USB-C charging port because it uses modern connector standards that are the same as those used by most new phones and tablets. When the battery gets low, just take the doorbell off its mount, plug it into any USB-C charger, and put it back in place after a few hours.</p>
<p>With the <em>Live View</em> feature, <strong>you can use the Ring app on your phone to see what’s going on at your door</strong> at any time, even if no one has pressed the doorbell button or motion detection has been triggered. This is helpful if you’re waiting for a delivery and want to see the driver, if you want to make sure your kids got home from school, or if you just want to see what’s going on outside without having to walk to the door.</p>



<p>When there is movement near your door, <strong>motion detection sends real-time alerts to your phone</strong>. However, the basic notifications only let you know that motion was detected and don’t say what caused it. Ring’s subscription service offers Smart Alerts, which use AI to tell the difference between people, packages, and other moving things like cars or animals. This way, you get more useful notifications that help you decide if something needs your immediate attention.</p>
<p>With Alexa integration, you can stream doorbell video to Echo Show devices all over your house, use Alexa speakers to announce visitors, or use voice commands to control Ring functions. You can ask Alexa to show you the front door, and within seconds, the video feed will appear on compatible Echo displays which lets you check who’s there without having to pull out your phone.</p>
<p>When you consider that smart doorbells from well-known brands usually cost between $150 and $250, spending $49 on a Ring video doorbell with its build quality and features is a great deal. Amazon’s usual price of $99 already made this a good deal compared to other options, but the 50% discount makes it so cheap that it is almost as cheap as regular doorbells from home improvement stores.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-rogue-reaction-vanguard-release-date-tank-2000652174</link>
            <guid>1378543</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Rogue has always been one of my favorite X-Men thanks to the </span><i><span>X-Men Evolution </span></i><span>animated series and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-movies-best-worst-ranked-deadpool-logan-wolverine-1851595435"><span>the Fox movies</span></a><span> I grew up with (justice for Anna Paquin!), and I was curious how </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a> <span>would balance a hero with unlimited possibilities for a competitive game. Now that we’ve finally seen her in action, it’s clear NetEase just made her a comic-accurate powerhouse, and fans are terrified of the power-siphoning hero’s abilities.</span></p>  <p><span>For those not steeped in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-97-disney-plus-premiere-impressions-1851356830"><i><span>X-Men</span></i></a> <span>knowledge, Rogue is a mutant with the ability to absorb people’s memories, personality, and powers at the slightest touch. Typically, this exchange causes a great deal of pain for the affected person, and Rogue can even kill someone through skin-to-skin contact if she hangs on long enough. </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>is implementing this into her kit, as she is able to absorb an ability from nearly every other character in the game. This lets her change her playstyle on the fly; she might take Doctor Strange’s shield to raise team-wide defenses, for instance, or copy Invisible Woman’s crowd-controlling bubbles to move enemies around.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Anyone playing Rogue has to be adaptable, as she can only copy abilities from enemies on the field, rather than just pulling from the roster at her whim. She’s not too dissimilar to Echo from </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>, whose ultimate lets her copy an enemy or ally’s form and kit, but Rogue still maintains her own cooldowns and abilities when she siphons an ability. Even without taking an ability from one of her foes, Rogue is a powerhouse of a tank. Her primary attacks are pretty straightforward, as she punches, kicks, and tosses around enemies like they’re nothing. She also has a block move that minimizes damage as she absorbs all that energy for a more powerful punch.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Rogue looks great for leading the front line and controlling a crowd, and that all comes together in her Ultimate, which creates an area-of-effect that siphons health, ult charge, and some other properties from heroes in her proximity. This gives her a ton of survivability and drains resources from enemies, some of which seems to be based on what enemy classes are in your field. Early footage shows her absorbing what looks to be base health from other Vanguards. The ult charge absorb is the real boon here, as that can undermine some of your opponents’ plays before they even get a chance to fire off their game-changing abilities. As you can expect, fans are both excited to play as this powerhouse and also scared to see her coming out of the enemy spawn.</span></p>         <p><span>All that said, some fans </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1pircv5/rogue_cant_steal_abilities_from_punisher/"><span>think she might have a weakness</span></a><span> when she drops on December 12. Based on the footage we’ve seen of her thus far, it seems like heroes that don’t technically have superpowers may be safe from her ability siphon. Punisher fights with firearms, and doesn’t seem to have the icon that shows Rogue can steal a power from him. So maybe Rogue’s counter is actually just regular guys who shoot at superheroes, like Hawkeye and Black Widow. We’ll know for sure when she launches on Friday.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/genies-avatar-sdk-lets-you-build-customizable-avatars-and-drop-them-straight-into-your-unity-game-2000651849</link>
            <guid>1378540</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Game characters have come a long way in the last few years, but Genies — the company best known for its ultra-stylized digital avatars — is kicking that evolution into high gear. After announcing a partnership with Unity this summer, the company has begun rolling out its first set of tools to developers: the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6338/">Genies Avatar SDK, now available on the Unity Asset Store</a>.</p>
<p>The process is exceptionally easy: Drop this package into your project, and suddenly your game can support high-fidelity, fully customizable player avatars that persist across any game built using the Unity dev engine and that plugs into the same system. The avatars are then available across Unity-based games. The Genies Avatar SDK gives players something games have tried (and often failed) to nail for years — a digital identity that’s entirely theirs, not one feels like a generic character creator pulled from a dropdown menu.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6338/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Genies</a></p>

<h2>Change On the Fly</h2>
<p>The Genies editor lets players tweak body features, facial details, outfits, hairstyles, and accessories with a surprising amount of nuance. There’s a built-in “Closet” with starter clothing, and new outfits will roll out regularly, with developers able to also toss their own designs into the mix. Thanks to the company’s auto-rigging pipeline, custom wearables snap onto any avatar without breaking animations, clipping through bodies, or tanking visual fidelity.</p>
<p>Developers get a flexible avatar framework baked directly into the SDK. It comes with a ready-to-use character controller and can plug into existing animation systems if you already have one. NPCs can be created through the same editor — meaning every character in a world, not just players, can share the same expressive stylization. More importantly, everything persists. If a player unlocks or buys a wearable in one experience, it lives in their inventory everywhere the Genies system is supported.</p>



<h2>Bringing It All Together</h2>
<p data-start="2161" data-end="2490">The Genies SDK also includes a streamlined login flow. Instead of making players juggle passwords or account portals, Genies uses a one-time email code system that carries a user’s avatar and items from game to game. For any developer building a social space, UGC world, or multiplayer hub, that’s the holy grail.</p>
<p data-start="2492" data-end="3028">But Genies is already teasing what comes next — and this is where things get&nbsp;<em>really</em> interesting. The company is developing an AIGC SDK that can generate game-ready 3D assets in minutes, a Smart Avatar SDK that turns NPCs into AI-driven characters capable of learning and adapting to players, and a Genies Party SDK that bundles all of this into a platform for IP-driven experiences. Their stated goal is to turn some of the most tedious parts of development — asset creation, rigging, optimization — into fast, automated workflows.</p>
<p data-start="3030" data-end="3308">Whether this becomes the next big shift in game development or just a very fancy avatar creator remains to be seen. But if you’re curious, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6338/">the Avatar SDK is already live on the Unity Asset Store</a> — and Genies says it’s only the first step in a much cooler, more ambitious plan.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/skyrim-elder-scrolls-switch-2-port-60fps-30fps-compare-price-input-lag-fix-patch-2000652156</link>
            <guid>1378534</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-skyrim-port-switch-2-upgrade-free-release-date-trailer-dlc-2000651683"><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim – Anniversary Edition</em> was shadowdropped</a> onto the Nintendo Switch 2. Bethesda promised this port of the classic 2011 open-world RPG was an improvement on the Switch 1 version. And in some ways, that’s true. But players are disappointed by how it runs and feels, and by all the space it takes up.</p> <p>The original <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch felt like a big deal at the time in 2017. Bethesda getting its ambitious RPG running on Nintendo’s portable hybrid console was wild to see, and it became a solid way to experience <em>Skyrim</em> while on the go. So, when <em>Skyrim</em> made the leap to Switch 2 yesterday, fans were excited to see Bethesda’s aging RPG get a big shot in the arm on the more powerful hardware. And visually, this new version of <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 does look nicer, with many of the enhancements to models and textures found in the other Anniversary Edition ports. So that’s nice!</p>

  <p>However, for some reason, this 2011 game, which runs at 60FPS or more on almost every other platform, remains stuck at 30FPS on Switch 2, as if it were 2017 all over again. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1piid4c/skyrim_swith_2_is_absolutely_terrible/">Across Reddit and social media</a>, fans feel that this 30FPS cap is one of the biggest problems with this new port. As many point out, games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2-2077-switch-2-mouse-mode-greyed-out-turn-on-1851785724"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a> run at 40FPS on Switch 2, yet <em>Skyrim</em> is still stuck at 30? Another annoying issue is that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1piegpl/input_delay_on_skyrim_switch_2_edition_is_terrible/"><em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 seems to have horrendous input lag.</a> Some players are calling it borderline unplayable in handheld mode, and coupled with the 30FPS cap, it adds up to <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 feeling like shit.</p>

 <p>And what’s baffling is that this version of Skyrim takes up 53 GB of space on <em>Switch 2.</em> In comparison, the Special Edition version of <em>Skyrim</em> on PC is 12GB. Add the <em>Anniversary Edition</em> DLC upgrade, and it requires approximately 25 GB of space. Meanwhile, on Xbox Series X/S, <em>Skyrim Anniversary Edition</em> has a digital footprint of 32GB. Why the Switch 2 version is this big is unknown, though some speculate it’s a mistake. Others wonder if it has to do with the Switch 2 hardware itself and how Bethesda’s old tech runs on it. Either way, it’s wild to think that <em>Cyberpunk</em> on Switch 2 is only 10GB bigger, at around 60GB, and looks 10 times better and runs at a higher framerate. Something seems off here.</p> <p>Hopefully, Bethesda does the other thing it’s famous for:<a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-next-gen-update-fix-bethesda-new-patch-xbox-1851469635"> patching its broken games</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4s-10th-anniversary-update-is-a-complete-shit-show-that-nobody-wanted-2000642938">terrible updates</a> to make things more playable. But until then, you might want to hold off on buying <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-led-gaming-light-bars-are-back-to-their-lowest-price-and-work-with-alexa-google-assistant-2000652084</link>
            <guid>1378486</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>So, you’ve invested in a good gaming PC, a high-resolution display, and an immersive sound setup, but the whole thing still feels incomplete? You need good lighting to match your in-game mood and aesthetics. Hardly any brand does smart lighting better than Govee, and we just spotted its gaming light bars going for less at Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6322/">This pair of lightbars, with a smart controller, retails for $90, but you can pick them up for just $55 today, after a sweet 39% discount.</a> There are no coupon codes to enter or long checkout steps to follow; just add the product to your cart, and the discount applies automatically. Both Prime and non-Prime members will also enjoy free shipping with their purchase, which ultimately brings the total cost down even further. Best of all, if you place your orders today, you’re going to get them before Christmas, which is great for anyone looking to host game nights with friends during the holidays. However, considering how this is the lowest price these have dropped to since launch, we’re not expecting the discount (or the stock) to be around for long. If your current play setup is in need of a bit of personality, now is a good time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6322/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Immersive Gaming Experience</h2>
<p>You’re getting a sleek pair that can sit nicely on either side of your desk, and lets you choose from 16.8 million colors for DIY lighting effects for a personalized experience. There are over 60 preset scene modes, as well; basically one for every mood. The dedicated app lets you tweak settings, adjust modes, play around with colors, and more. In fact, the scenes are divided into categories like emotion, games, festival, and funny, which makes the light bars great for year-round use. Go for a brighter setting when you’re feeling a rush of energy inside, a warmer tone during holiday dinners, and maybe switch to something a bit calmer on those slow nights.</p>
<p>The lights are capable of syncing with audio from both your speakers and headphones, a feature that lets them react to whatever’s happening on your computer screen. Expect a cozy setup during those cute Hyun Bin and Son Ye-jin moments in Crash Landing on You, and let the lights go wild when it’s time to take out some bad guys in Valorant. Translation? A much more immersive viewing and gaming experience that makes you feel like a part of the action.</p>



<p>The smart desktop dial takes the experience even further by allowing you to adjust the brightness, change the modes/colors, and turn the light bars on/off without pulling your phone out. Just keep it on your desk, and make necessary adjustments in seconds when needed. Voice control is supported, too, as the lights play nicely with Alexa and Google Assistant. This way, you can simply speak to command; ideal for when you can’t afford to take your hands off the controller or keyboard.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6322/">These smart LED gaming lights are now down to $55, thanks to this 39% discount at Amazon.</a> They not only offer a ton of colors to choose from, but also include preset modes and music syncing capabilities to upgrade the entire vibe of your place. Snap it up quick, though, as the deal could wrap up any moment now.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/magsafe-5000mah-portable-charger-for-iphone-drops-to-all-time-low-but-only-for-prime-members-2000652131</link>
            <guid>1378483</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Fumbling with charging cables while trying to use your phone feels like a problem from the previous decade, and <strong>MagSafe technology finally removes this annoyance by magnetically snapping power banks directly to your iPhone’s back</strong>. This <em>TRKOY</em> wireless charger delivers 5,000mAh of backup power in a slim profile that stays attached while you scroll, call, or photograph without requiring any cables during use. The good news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6331/">Amazon has dropped the price to a record low of $19, down from the usual $32, though you’ll need a Prime membership to access this deal</a> and grab one of the most practical iPhone accessories available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6331/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Magnetic Strength That Stays Strong</h2>
<p>The<strong> 15N magnetic force makes a connection that is strong enough</strong> to keep the power bank attached even when you’re walking, talking on the phone, or taking pictures at weird angles. This magnetic strength is just right because it keeps the charger connected during normal use but lets go easily when you pull it off on purpose. This way, you don’t have to deal with magnets that are either too weak to hold or too strong to separate without a lot of effort. You can answer calls, look at social media, or take selfies while the charger stays perfectly aligned on the back of your phone and this solves the cable management problems that come with regular power banks.</p>



<p>The phone and charger package is easy to handle with one hand because it is <strong>only 11.8 mm thick and weighs 120 grams</strong>: This is not the case with bulky power banks that make your phone feel like a brick and this slim design doesn’t get in the way of your phone’s cameras, so you can take pictures and videos without the charger blocking the lenses or making weird shadows. The design works well for situations where you need power but can’t put your phone down for a long time, like following GPS directions while walking, streaming events live, or keeping video calls going during your commute.</p>
<p>The <strong>5,000mAh capacity gives you enough power to fully charge an iPhone 17 once</strong> but for larger Pro Max models, this means about 50–80% of a full charge, and for standard and Mini models, it means a full charge. This amount of power is a good balance between useful backup power and keeping the charger slim enough to carry every day. However, people who use a lot of power every day might find the capacity limiting.</p>



<p>With dual charging, you can charge your iPhone wirelessly with MagSafe while also charging another device, like AirPods, an Apple Watch, or even an iPad, through the USB-C port at faster wired speeds. You won’t have to carry around a bunch of chargers or decide which device gets power first when you’re away from outlets because of this flexibility. You <strong>can also use the USB-C port to charge the power bank itself</strong>&nbsp;which makes things easier because you can use the same USB-C cable that charges many modern devices.</p>
<p>Comprehensive protection circuitry keeps an eye <strong>on the temperature, voltage, and current during the charging process</strong> to stop overheating, overcharging, and short circuits that could harm your phone’s battery or put your safety at risk. The smart cooling chip controls how heat is released which makes sure the charger stays at safe temperatures even when it’s charging for a long time.</p>
<p>When you compare it to other magnetic chargers from well-known brands that cost $40 to $60 or more, spending $19 on a MagSafe power bank is a great deal. The usual price of $32 already made it competitive with other options, but the 39% discount for Prime members makes it so cheap that people will want to buy it right away because it’s so convenient.</p>

              <p>The <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-leaks-delay-developers-fired-rockstar-games-union-2000641525">recent firings of 34 <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> developers</a> at Rockstar UK have generated a lot of suspicion that the action was <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-union-firing-rockstar-protests-2000646881">a response to these workers being unionized</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-rockstar-fired-union-workers-legal-2000643030">Protests have ensued</a>, and today the topic was raised in the UK’s Parliament, with Prime Minister Keir Starmer describing the situation as “deeply concerning.”</p> <p>The 34 members of the Scottish development team were fired in October based on claims of “gross misconduct” by Rockstar, but this was quickly refuted by the<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) representing unionized developers, saying that it was in fact an act of “union busting.” Rockstar has heavily denied this, but <a href="https://iwgb.org.uk/en/post/iwgb-issues-legal-claims-against-rockstar-over-unfair-dismissal-of-staff/">the IWGB has pressed ahead with a case for unfair dismissal</a>, and the protests continue.</p>

 <p>This furor has now reached the UK government, after the MP for Rockstar’s constituency of Edinburgh East and Musselburgh, Chris Murray, raised the matter during Wednesday’s Prime Minister’s Questions. Asking a question of Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer, Murray raised the claims of union busting, and explained that he had met with Rockstar and that they had “failed to reassure me they are following employment law.”</p>

 <p>“It’s a deeply concerning case,” said Keir Starmer. “Every worker has the right to join a trade union, and we’re determined to strengthen workers’ rights and ensure they don’t face unfair consequences for being part of a union. Ministers will look into the particular case that he raises and keep him updated.”</p>   <p>For context, Prime Minister’s Questions is a weekly event in the UK Parliament that takes place every Wednesday lunchtime, where the leader of the opposition and other members of Parliament are able to put questions to the Prime Minister. This usually begins with a tiresomely performative piece of theater as the two main rival party leaders exchange overly scripted insults designed to win headlines, before it then moves on to a more useful period in which genuine concerns can be raised in the House.</p>

 <p>However, it’s important to note that while opposition questions will usually be loaded with point-scoring, questions coming from the PM’s own party are very rarely combative, and usually pre-planned—the likes of, “Would the Prime Minister agree that we’re all doing a completely splendid job, and the Conservatives were super-extra rubbish?” Murray’s question, while obviously not sycophantic, was certainly planned and Starmer’s reply was pre-written.</p>

 <p>Labour is, in theory, a pro-union party, and has historically been in large part funded by the UK’s various major unions, as opposed to the Conservatives who are mostly funded by big businesses and Satan himself. However, in recent years Labour has betrayed its union roots to the degree that it’s now losing the support of many trade unions. Starmer actually saying something pro-union will be a relief to many, and hopefully put a chill down the spine of many corporations who thought there was no more need to worry about stomping all over their workers.</p> <p>Or it’ll be another lie and nothing will happen. But it’s fun to pretend to have hope.</p>
