This is where their most obvious differences come into play: mobility and defense. The Heavy Bowgun, true to its name,restricts your hunter to pretty slow movement. For the cost of slow movement, however, this weapon lets you guard and even trigger a Power Clash against monster attacks.</p><p>The Light Bowgun doesn’t slow your hunter down and ends up feeling a lot smoother in comparison. It lacks the option to guard, but offsets this with fun movement options such as a sidestep and slide. Rapid Fire Mode expands upon these and incorporates a strafing dodge that lets you keep shooting called Burst Step.</p><p>I’ll also add that both weapons (and in particular the Heavy Bowgun) are great to use on your Seikret. Being limited to only standard fire and Focus Blasts while mounted isn’t that restrictive with so many ammo types.</p><h2 id="h2481"><a id=""></a>Rate of fire and damage</h2><figure id="" data-id="133022d7f7e7b206f4f92ca8d466b98d" data-recommend-id="image://133022d7f7e7b206f4f92ca8d466b98d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Congala is pelted by a Light Bowgun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Congala is pelted by a Light Bowgun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="133022d7f7e7b206f4f92ca8d466b98d" data-recommend-id="image://133022d7f7e7b206f4f92ca8d466b98d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Congala is pelted by a Light Bowgun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Although the standard fire for either weapon can use the same ammo, there are still some important differences. With the Heavy Bowgun, you’ll deal with a slower rate of fire and strong damage numbers. The range for critical damage also tends to be a bit farther away from your targets.</p><p>All of that is naturally reversed with the Light Bowgun. Your shots come out faster, but they won’t hit as hard. I’ve also noticed that the critical damage range is comparatively closer across all ammo types.</p><h2 id="h2482"><a id=""></a>Special modes and ammo</h2><figure id="" data-id="fa5022c41dfaa01b25166c385820dc87" data-recommend-id="image://fa5022c41dfaa01b25166c385820dc87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Customize Bowgun screen, highlighting Special Ammo choices." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Customize Bowgun screen, highlighting Special Ammo choices." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa5022c41dfaa01b25166c385820dc87" data-recommend-id="image://fa5022c41dfaa01b25166c385820dc87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Customize Bowgun screen, highlighting Special Ammo choices." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Each of these has access to a secondary firing mode and choices for Special Ammo.

The following Special Ammo isn’t restricted to Rapid Fire Mode, but they do benefit from being attacked multiple times after:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Adhesive Ammo: Launches a sticky bomb that explodes after a while. Repeatedly shooting it will increase the damage</li><li>Wyvernblast: Places a mine on the ground that lasts for a short duration and can be triggered by attacks from any source.

When it comes to the Bowguns, some ammo types are just a better fit on one or the other. Pierce Ammo is arguably the best ammo type in the game and works well for either weapon. I’ve enjoyed using it on the Heavy Bowgun more, simply due to how much damage it does.</p><p>Ammo associated with elements or status ailments meanwhile shine with the Light Bowgun. Any extra elemental-based damage adds up nicely with all the rounds you shoot off. Similarly, it’s a lot easier to trigger a status effect when you’re constantly hitting a monster with status ailment ammo.</p><p>Both bowguns are fantastic tools that serve as excellent secondary weapons if you prefer having a melee as your primary. There is no shame in having one as your primary either, although I’d recommend <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-crossplay-platform-multiplayer-1851769332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-crossplay-platform-multiplayer-1851769332">playing with a squad online</a></span> if you want to focus on being a ranged threat.</p><hr><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fmonster-hunter-wilds%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fmonster-hunter-wilds%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a></span> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’m 90 percent sure it was just because we could carry him. I was like a 12-year-old Hanzo main who was barely in Silver. He was a Bronze Torbjörn main. He was fucking dogshit. Awful. Like, godawful. So no, I don’t believe the fucking- ‘I am a pro <em>Path of Exile</em> whatever the fuck.’ Like, no the fuck you are not. This is so cringe. Why would you even pretend to be? It’s fine not to be a gamer.”</p><p>The Bronze ranking is funny enough on its own, but the revelation that he was having such a hard time climbing the ranks as Torbjörn, arguably one of the lower-skill heroes on the roster, is also pretty good. However, nothing beats knowing he had to force pre-teens to help him climb out of the Bronze hole into the illustrious ranks of…Silver.</p><p>All of this comes after years of Musk trying to position himself as a pro-level gamer in games like <em>Path of Exile 2 </em>and <em>Diablo IV</em>, seemingly in an attempt to buy credibility in the eyes of nerd followers who will stroke his ego on X and elsewhere. As his business ventures have grown over the years, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-asmongold-poe-2-account-boosting-controversy-1851741223&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-asmongold-poe-2-account-boosting-controversy-1851741223">people have become increasingly skeptical of his claims</a></span> because one person running half a dozen companies likely doesn’t have time to be sinking hundreds of hours into grinding away at video games. Now we have another story to add to the fake gamer saga, and the evidence is really piling up. I don’t care that Musk might not be good at video games, but it’s pretty funny that he’s so desperate for people to think he is.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And <em>Giant Bomb</em>’s Jeff Grubb has repeatedly said <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1678176273594560514&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/JeffGrubb/status/1678176273594560514" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the game is real</a></span>, but will be closer to a <em>Final Fantasy VII: Crisis Core</em> remake than a full-blown overhaul. </p><p><em>Final Fantasy IX</em> has a special place in many fans’ hearts for several reasons. It’s an incredible game for one. It was also the last entry on PS1, and the last before the series moved to a full 3D look and voice acting on the PS2. Most importantly, it was the last produced by creator Hironobu Sakaguchi before he left Square, and harkens back to the franchise’s more traditional, medieval roots. Also it features an adorable black mage named Vivi. </p><p>In the past, <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> producer Naoki Yoshida has been coy about the rumors. “Of course, I do know there are requests for<em> Final Fantasy IX</em> to be made, but when you think about <em>Final Fantasy IX</em>, it’s a game with huge volume,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/yoshi-p-thinks-a-final-fantasy-9-remake-would-take-more-than-one-game&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yoshi-p-thinks-a-final-fantasy-9-remake-would-take-more-than-one-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he said last fall</a></span>, appearing to pour cold water on the rumors. “When you think about all of that volume, I wonder if it’s possible to remake that as a single title. It’s a difficult one. It is a tough question.”</p><p>July 7 will be exactly 25 years since the game shipped and Square Enix hints that fans should expect to hear more announcements leading up to it. Maybe a sneak peek of the game itself at an upcoming PlayStation or Summer Game Fest showcase will be one of them. I hope the game arrives <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-final-fantasy-ixs-strategy-guide-turned-out-so-horr-1834809621&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-final-fantasy-ixs-strategy-guide-turned-out-so-horr-1834809621">alongside a revised strategy guide</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
