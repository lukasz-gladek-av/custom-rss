            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As with many free-to-play games, <em>Splitgate 2</em> offers multiple in-game currencies. Unfortunately, also like other free-to-play games, it’s a little unclear what each currency does. In particular, the purple Proelium is a little vague on its use.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196307" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="10 Minutes From The Last Of Us Part II’s Roguelike Mode " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="657" data-playlist="196307,196918,195891" data-current="196307"><div><p>10 Minutes From The Last Of Us Part II’s Roguelike Mode </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196307/196307_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21857.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>So, what exactly are these upgrade tokens used for? And where can you get them? Here’s what you need to know about using the Proelium in your inventory.</p><h2 id="h377475"><a id=""></a>What is Proelium used for?</h2><p>Proelium is used to purchase additional variants and upgrades for cosmetic skins for both the player and weapons. These purchases can be either variants of a given skin, or additional upgrades that give new effects. At the moment, these seem to be mostly limited to skins of Mythic rarity, with some exceptions at lower rarities. You can see if a skin has variants or upgrades on the purchase screen for the cosmetic, or by going to the edit screen for a skin you already own.</p><h2 id="h377476"><a id=""></a>How do you use Proelium?</h2><figure id="" data-id="aec66e868729c4b9a6697958312c605a" data-recommend-id="image://aec66e868729c4b9a6697958312c605a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a gun skin in a shop.

" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->1047 Games / Parker Johnson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aec66e868729c4b9a6697958312c605a" data-recommend-id="image://aec66e868729c4b9a6697958312c605a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a gun skin in a shop. " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After purchasing a Mythic weapon or character cosmetic, right click or press Y/triangle while selecting it in your loadout menu. Once in here, you’ll be able to see the variants and upgrades you can purchase.</p><p>The best example is a cosmetic from the open beta, the Deadly Harvest Jackhammer skin. Once you purchase this, you also will gain access to three additional variants of the skin, which you can unlock for 10 Proelium each. These don’t change the skin drastically, but give it some new colors as a way to further your own expression–and flex that you spent money to get the Mythic skin.</p><p>In addition to variants, you can get upgrades that heighten the cool factor of your new cosmetic for 20 Proelium each. For instance, with the Jackhammer skin, you can get a new tracer for your gun that gives a unique look and sound to every bullet fired, and a death effect that makes your target vanish when they’re defeated.</p><p>Luckily, getting Proelium is the simplest part about the currency! There are two main ways: directly converting Splitcoin into it, or earning it through a battle pass. The Beta Pass offered 70 Proelium for players to earn, for example, though it’s unclear if this will be the case for future ones as well.</p><p>As for the Splitcoin conversion, you can select one of three options:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>40 Proelium for 1,000 Splitcoin</li><li>100 Proelium for 2,000 Splitcoin</li><li>240 Proelium for 4,000 Splitcoin</li></ul><p>With those rates, if you haven’t exhausted the option yet, you’re better off buying the premium battle pass to get Proelium. And even if you have, you are probably better off waiting for the next battle pass and seeing how much Proelium you can get from it.</p><p><em>Splitgate 2 </em>is currently available on Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/splitgate-2-proelium-uses-worth-it-buy-upgrades-cosmeti-1851785508]]></content:encoded>

One of the best parts of <em>Rune Factory </em>is that you’re able to tackle all of its different game mechanics at your own pace. If you want to focus on tending your farm, you can dedicate as much time as you want without the urgency of continuing story progress.</p><p>As the second <em>Rune Factory</em> game on Switch, <em>Guardians of Azuma</em> performs much better on Nintendo Switch (and Switch 2) than the last game, <em>Rune Factory 5</em>. There aren’t nearly as many debilitating framerate issues this time around, which makes <em>Guardians of Azuma</em> a much smoother experience.</p><h2 id="h461930"><a id=""></a>How long is <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>?</h2><p><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> is as long as you want it to be. Because of its flexible gameplay mechanics, <strong>you can spend dozens of hours simply farming, going out into the wilds, mining resources, and killing monsters for drops without advancing the story all that much.</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="06471aa50c9fa8d41dca10cfb4e57a02" data-recommend-id="image://06471aa50c9fa8d41dca10cfb4e57a02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character builds a well." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character builds a well." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvelous / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="06471aa50c9fa8d41dca10cfb4e57a02" data-recommend-id="image://06471aa50c9fa8d41dca10cfb4e57a02" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character builds a well." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, it’s worth balancing your time between farming and going further into the story as you’ll receive new tools to tend to your farm. These can help expedite your process and make things easier.</p><p><strong>A full playthrough at a normal pace while engaging with the side activities like farming and hanging out with villagers will take about 40 hours to complete.</strong> <em>Guardians of Azuma </em>is a meaty game with plenty of content that rivals modern Japanese RPGs.</p><p>You can also max out the bond levels of your villagers and companions to learn about their various backstories and even romance some of them (there are a total of 16 romanceable characters). Same-sex relationships are supported, too. So whether you choose to play as the female protagonist Kaguya or the male protagonist Subaruru, you’re not short of any options.</p><p>Completionists are looking upwards to more than 120 hours in order to see everything that <em>Guardians of Azuma </em>has to offer.</p><figure id="" data-id="5622d029026e046c61823b5cd1862bcb" data-recommend-id="image://5622d029026e046c61823b5cd1862bcb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A chracter aims a bow and arrow at a monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A chracter aims a bow and arrow at a monster." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvelous / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5622d029026e046c61823b5cd1862bcb" data-recommend-id="image://5622d029026e046c61823b5cd1862bcb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A chracter aims a bow and arrow at a monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma </em>launches on June 5 for the original Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-how-long-story-farming-1851785504]]></content:encoded>
