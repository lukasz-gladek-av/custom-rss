            <link>https://kotaku.com/bg3-swen-vincke-highguard-concord-steam-reviews-metacritic-2000663800</link>
            <guid>1418572</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The launch of <em>Highguard</em> this week has reignited a debate around good manners. Over a hundred people worked for several years on a project they were passionate about. Instead of everyone giving it a fair shake and casually talking about what they did or didn’t like about it, the conversation around the new multiplayer shooter was quickly subsumed by a torrent of knee-jerk negativity. Social media is full of people dunking on the game for clout and Steam reviews are full of users who barely touched it on PC before rushing to grade it almost entirely based on hardware performance.</p> <p>It’s the culmination of an increasingly fractured online ecosystem whose only unifying forces are algorithms that reward rage-bait and endless free content that incentivizes harsh snap judgements in order to sort through it all. If you’re not first, you’re last. If you’re not the best, who cares? The swift, loud, and in many cases overly <a href="https://kotaku.com/geoff-keighley-highguard-game-awards-trailer-hate-2000663574">toxic reaction to <em>Highguard</em></a> has some developers concerned, disgusted, and confused.</p>

 <p>“I don’t like people shitting on things others have created,” <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> director and Larian Studios CEO Swen Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2016281728755576974">wrote on X</a> last night. He spent most of his short “soapbox” speech talking about game reviews, which seem completely tangential to what’s going on with <em>Highguard</em> at the moment. He wants them to be less mean and personal; most fans wants them to feel less inflated and overly deferential to the publishers behind the product. But importantly, almost no one has actually <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/highguard/">even reviewed <em>Highguard</em> yet</a>. Maybe we wait for it to get a Metacritic score before we start assigning one to all of its critics, another one of Vincke’s suggestions.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don’t like people shitting on things others have created. Putting something out into the world makes you vulnerable, and that alone deserves respect, even if you dislike the creation. It’s easy to destroy things, it’s a lot harder to build them. The best critics understand…</p> <p>— Swen Vincke @where? (@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/2016281728755576974?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Nevertheless, the veteran RPG maker ended with <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-gen-ai-larian-bg3-reddit-ama-2000658429">a call for more civility</a>. “It’s been on my mind for a while and just opening my feed today just pushed it all to the surface,” he wrote. “Think of the time you had to recite something in front of the class and how nervous you were. And how much any negative comment hurt.&nbsp;Be nice to one another, be nice to the people creating stuff to entertain you. Treat them like you would like to be treated if you made something.”</p>

 <p>Vincke wasn’t the only one ruffled. “When did it become trendy to hate on a new game?” <a href="https://x.com/therealcliffyb/status/2016245017073877329">wrote</a> Cliff Bleszinski on X. “Been seeing it more and more in recent years. It’s exhausting.” Epic Games co-founder Mark Reign <a href="https://x.com/markrein/status/2016346300367729008">quoted-tweeted him</a>: “It’s downright horrible. Especially a FREE game from a new studio. Just so sad. This is a hobby for people, they should approach with joy not hatred.”</p>

 <p>Remedy Entertainment Communications Director Thomas Puha was disheartened by how player counts have become weaponized against games in recent years. “Tired of seeing headlines of how many players<em> Highguard</em> has lost,” he <a href="https://x.com/riotrmd/status/2016431155524809143">posted</a>. “Like, sure, you can argue that’s putting facts out there, but I cant escape the feeling there’s just this ‘celebration’ of a game doing badly and just putting out negative headlines for the sake of it. Shouldn’t us game devs even try?”</p> <h2>Another hero shooter meltdown</h2> <p>We could try to psychoanalyze why the online gamer id has latched onto these narratives so zealously rather than just, you know, play the games and enjoy them or move on. Part of it is no doubt an ongoing backlash against the very concept of live-service games. Despite being far and away the most played and profitable genre, there’s a certain type of player that resents the gravity well they’ve created. For one swath of YouTube culture war peddlers, <em>Concord</em>‘s failure was celebrated as a defeat for progressive values in the marketplace. But for others it became symbolic vindication that all of these companies pumping resources into microtransaction casinos were idiots to do so.</p>

 <p>Perhaps they’re simply exhausted with the modern live-service game trying to take over their life and their wallet. Once upon a time, the big scandal was publishers using sticks (single-use multiplayer codes) and carrots (bonus DLC) to get people to stop buying used games. Now the sale of most games is inconsequential. The real bucks are made in the in-game shop and the only way to keep making them is to keep people playing as much as possible. For fans of forever games who love hanging out with their friends in them, no harm done. For someone who doesn’t want their hobby to become like a second job, it’s easy to see where burnout and backlash might ensue.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:aa23o5w4w2afknay44oqxqz6/app.bsky.feed.post/3mdhctp2krs27" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreido643tuq2buamxesheusn2qdf6afvac2dbcuhe3mcmtoe6zggxoe"> <p lang="en">Try a couple decades of shitty emails ranging from simple insults all the way up to death threats from idiot fanboys who can't handle you giving a game "only" 8/10 and see which one puts more calluses on your soul, dummy. You'd fold in six months or less.</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:aa23o5w4w2afknay44oqxqz6?ref_src=embed">Jeff Gerstmann (@jeffgerstmann.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:aa23o5w4w2afknay44oqxqz6/post/3mdhctp2krs27?ref_src=embed">2026-01-28T03:18:56.524Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>It does not help that <em>Highguard</em>, despite being inspired by games like <em>Rust</em>, sounds like a knock-off of <em>Overwatch</em> and includes some very generic-looking characters to boot. Made by some of the leads on <em>Apex Legends</em>, the contrast between the launches of those two multiplayer games shows not just a possible increase in live-service fatigue in the intervening years but also the decay of the wider ecosystem where all of those issues get hashed out. “Covid transformed social media into an endless, awful conversation; once you pop, the horrors never stop,” writes <a href="https://aftermath.site/highguard-release-steam-pc-concord-youtube-shadow-drop/">Nathan Grayson at <em>Aftermath</em></a>. He adds, “Recent years have only worsened this dynamic, with short-form video content taking over as the predominant mode of expression and <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-twitchcon-2025-security-emiru-assault-irl-streamers/"><u>giving rise to a generation of caustic clip farmers</u></a> who yank at the udder of any perceived drama of the week until it’s chafed and bone dry. Then they move onto the next thing and deploy the same playbook again.”</p> <p>In this milieu of brainrot it’s harder than ever, but also more urgent, to separate bad-faith trolling, drama-farming, and review-bombing campaigns from genuine dislike and revulsion when a game sucks or, more often, just doesn’t have the juice. “Let people fucking hate shit,” <em>Giant Bomb</em> co-founder Jeff Gerstmann <a href="https://youtu.be/CLJErsnsVwc?t=1391">recently joked on his podcast</a>. “Let people be fucking people! Grow up. It’s okay to criticize things that are fucking dumb.” It was in response to someone calling him out for making fun of people with glass-case gaming PCs that let you see inside the rig, but it applies just as much to an ambient strain in gaming discourse that would prefer people with nothing nice to say to say nothing at all.</p>

 <p>The breakdown of the internet has only made criticism more important, not less, and raised the stakes for doing so responsibly and honestly. That requires an open mind, a generous spirit, and an unflinching commitment to saying what you mean and meaning what you say. Also avoiding Twitter and every other irradiated social media platform as much as humanly possible.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-drops-the-galaxy-smarttag-2-bluetooth-tracker-to-its-lowest-price-after-new-airtag-2-arrives-2000663636</link>
            <guid>1418515</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Got any big travel plans for 2026? I know when I’m traveling, I become weirdly anxious about all my stuff, afraid I might leave something behind somewhere in a hotel room or backseat of an Uber. That’s why it can be a good idea to slip some Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 Bluetooth trackers into your bags. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6920/">Right now, Amazon has the trackers 36% off. Normally, priced at $30, they’ve now each dropped by $10 to just $20 per tag</a>. If you need several, a four-pack is now going for just $62, which ends up working out to just shy of $16 per SmartTag2.</p>
<p>This set of four Samsung Galaxy SmartTag2 Bluetooth trackers comes with two black trackers and two white trackers. If you’re just buying one, the white model is $2 cheaper than the black.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6920/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Keep Track of All Your Crap</h2>
<p>Most of us already rely on GPS to locate our phones if they go missing. SmartTag2 extends that same peace of mind to items that don’t have built-in tracking. Paired with a Samsung Galaxy phone or tablet, the tracker lets you see the last known location of your belongings directly on a map. That can save time and frustration when something isn’t where you expected.</p>
<p data-start="882" data-end="1254">Physically, the SmartTag2 is small, lightweight, and designed with a built-in loop, so attaching it is simple. Clip one to your keys, slide one into a backpack, or loop one onto luggage. Some people even attach them to bikes, camera bags, or in gym lockers to keep tabs on where things are. Once you get used to having trackers around, it’s hard not to find new uses for them.</p>
<p data-start="1639" data-end="1997">If an item is nearby but out of sight, the Search Nearby feature comes into play. It pulls up a compass-style interface that guides you toward the tag’s location. For situations where visual clues aren’t enough, you can trigger an audible alert on the SmartTag2, making it easier to track down something buried under clothes or tucked between couch cushions.</p>


<h2 data-start="1639" data-end="1997">Enhanced Battery Life</h2>
<p data-start="1999" data-end="2281">Battery life is another strong point. Each SmartTag2 can last up to 500 days on a single battery, with Power Saving mode extending that lifespan even further, up to 40% longer. With that enabled, you won’t need to think about replacements very often. Might be useful when you’re using them on items you don’t check daily.</p>
<p data-start="2283" data-end="2620" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">With an IP67 rating, these trackers can handle dust and water exposure without issue. Optional silicone cases add extra protection, better grip, and a carabiner ring for quicker attachment.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PowerA’s Alternative to the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller Is a No Brainer at Less Than Half Its Price]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/poweras-alternative-to-the-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-is-a-no-brainer-at-less-than-half-its-price-2000663633</link>
            <guid>1418470</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>With the release of the Switch 2 last year, Nintendo simultaneously refreshed it’s Pro Controller to release alongside the new console. The aptly-named Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller comes with some big upgrades including a better HD Rumble system, the dedicated C-Button for GameChat, and rear GL/GR buttons that can be mapped to any button you choose. It’s a handy controller to add to your rotation, but it doesn’t come cheap. It’s list price is a whopping $89.</p>
<p>You can get a controller with really everything you actually need for less than half that price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6919/">The PowerA enhanced wireless controller for both the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 normally goes for $70, but has come down to just $40 after a 43% discount.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6919/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>While the PowerA controller doesn’t have the C-button to launch GameChat directly from your gamepad, I also don’t know many players who would even miss that all too much. What the PowerA controller&nbsp;<em>does</em> have is comfortable ergonomics for long game sessions and wireless connectivity. It’s even got motion controls. What more do you need?</p>
<h2>Advanced Gaming Buttons</h2>
<p>The PowerA controller even has the same two customizable back buttons that Nintendo added to its second generation pro controller. The AGR and AGL buttons can be pulled with your trigger fingers to activate a function of your choice. You can map these buttons to mimic any other button on the controller, making it easy to jump or reload without having to take your thumbs off the sticks. These back buttons can even be programmed on the fly, mid game. No backing out of the game into system settings required.</p>



<h2>Never Stop Playing</h2>
<p>The controller is powered by an internal lithium rechargeable 900mAh battery, so you’re not dealing with double-As like you might with some other third party options. The PowerA controller fully charged could last you up to 30 hours on a single charge. Then when the battery does get low, just plug in the included 10-foot USB-C charging cable so it can recharge while you can keep playing.</p>
<p>The PowerA controller can also be way more fun than the first-party option from Nintendo. Along with the standard black version, PowerA has a wide selection of designs featuring artwork of fan favorite characters. Lots of Mario and friends designs as well as some options from Kirby, Metroid, and Zelda. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6919/">Most of which are currently marked down to the same $40 price tag as the standard version.</a> That’s $49 cheaper than the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller.</p>
