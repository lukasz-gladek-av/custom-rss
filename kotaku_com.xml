Early classics included the original PC versions of<em> Resident Evil </em>and <em>Diablo</em>. <em>Warcraft I</em> and <em>II</em> are also part of the DRM-free program, and despite being removed from the storefront later this month, GOG says it will still continue to make sure players’ existing copies are updated moving forward. </p><p>“Once a game joins the Program, we pledge to maintain its compatibility even if it gets delisted from the store,” a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_bundle&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/warcraft_bundle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new announcement</a></span> from the company reads. “This means that owners of those titles can still expect a seamless experience and tech support for those titles. This also considers potential changes in Windows OS that may impact games’ playability.”</p><p><em>Warcraft I</em> and <em>II</em> will both be removed on December 13th “at the publisher’s request,” GOG notes, meaning that Blizzard, now owned by Microsoft, is requesting GOG stop selling the $15 bundle of ‘90s-era strategy games, presumably because it just released its own remasters for $25.

And even though there’s a toggle to switch back to the classic graphics, the visuals look stretched and don’t properly compensate for the change in aspect ratio and display technology. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/i-wish-blizzard-loved-warcraft-as-much-as-i-do-141524674.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/pc/i-wish-blizzard-loved-warcraft-as-much-as-i-do-141524674.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It’s a huge bummer</a></span>. </p><p>GOG is currently giving a $2 discount to anyone who buys the classic versions before they’re delisted. “We are grateful for the opportunity to work with Blizzard on these titles,” the company states. “While the delisting is unfortunate, we assure you that every user who already owns these games on GOG will continue to benefit from our commitment and have access to versions that remain compatible with modern systems, preserving their experience for years to come.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
