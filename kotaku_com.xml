            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-includes-direct-jab-joke-gearbox-former-owner-embracer-bluff-2000624815"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> launches on September 12 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Gearbox’s open-world looter-shooter sequel is a big game with a lot of quests to complete and plenty of endgame content to check out. As such, my review isn’t ready yet. But I’ve played nearly 40 hours so far, and I’ve enjoyed my time. A big reason why is that Gearbox has made some smart changes in <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-finishes-decade-old-quest-pre-sequel-dunks-watson-explained-2000624918"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> that make it easier than ever to manage, sell, and collect loot and get around the world.</p> <p>As a big <em>Borderlands</em> fan who has played all of the games multiple times, I have cataloged a list of changes and improvements in <em>Borderlands 4</em> that I think both longtime fans and newcomers alike are going to be excited about.</p> <h2>Finally, A Weapon Wheel</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624984" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624984"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624984">©Gearbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>For many, many years now, <em>Borderlands</em> fans, myself included, have longed for the franchise to add a real weapon wheel option. Past games have sometimes allowed you to use the d-pad on a controller to hot-swap between four guns, which is fine, I guess. But a true weapon wheel hasn’t been an option until now. <em>Borderlands 4</em> finally adds a real, honest-to-goodness weapon wheel, and it’s so nice. It makes quickly swapping to a gun easier and faster than ever!</p>

 <h2>Mark Loot As Junk When Picking Up</h2> <p>In <em>Borderlands 4</em>, like in past games, you’ll spend a lot of time collecting guns that are bad, or just not what you want. In the past, you’d have to manually sell each of these. And yes, you could mark them as loot in the inventory screen and then sell them all at once. But now, in <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-everything-pre-order-dlc-release-date-time-ps5-switch-2-crossplay-2000624090"><em>Borderlands 4</em>,</a> you can junk loot as you pick it up. This ties into another great change…</p> <h2>Instantly Sell Junk At Vending Machines</h2> <p>All that loot you mark as junk can now be sold at any vending machine just by walking up and hitting a single button. You don’t even have to go into the store screen. It’s so nice, and this change, as well as the last one, has helped keep my inventory mostly empty and ready for more loot.</p>

 <h2>The Lost Loot Menu Is So Much Better</h2> <p>Speaking of loot, in some past <em>Borderlands</em> games, players were able to return to a hub area and activate a “Lost Loot” machine that would spit out some of the guns that dropped out in the world that the player didn’t pick up. This wasn’t a very efficient way to handle the process and made using the Lost Loot option annoying. In <em>Borderlands 4,</em> this is now handled through a menu screen that lets you easily trash stuff you don’t want and take stuff you do want.&nbsp; And you can hit a button to take it all without having to grab each item off the floor.</p> <h2>A Warning When Selling Equipped Gear And Guns</h2> <p>Sometimes, when dealing with lots of loot and similar guns, it’s easy to mark an equipped piece of loot as junk and sell it. This has happened to me in past games. Sure, you could favorite stuff you didn’t want to sell, which is still an option in<em> Borderlands 4,</em> but it was always weird how the games just let you sell equipped gear so easily. Not so in <em>Borderlands 4</em>! Now you get a pop-up warning when trying to sell equipped items marked as junk. Nifty!</p>

 <h2>Legendary Weapons Are Much Rarer To Find, And That’s Good</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624985" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624985"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624985">©Gearbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>One of the biggest problems I had with <em>Borderlands 3</em> was how easily and quickly you found legendary weapons and gear. On a recent playthrough, I was collecting and selling them within a few hours of starting a new character. By the end of the game, I had found well over 100. I lost count, really. This made them feel less special and made non-legendary purple gear less exciting to collect because better stuff was dropping all the time.</p> <p>Thankfully, this isn’t the case in <em>Borderlands 4.</em> After nearly 40 hours with the game, I’ve only collected 7 legendary weapons and items. And one of those I bought from a vending machine, something I’ve only seen once in my time with the game.&nbsp; Unlike in <em>Borderlands 3</em>, when legendaries drop in<em> Borderlands 4,</em> I get genuinely excited! It’s a rare event, and many of the items have been powerful and memorable.</p>

 <h2>Customize Your Character Anywhere And Anytime</h2> <p>In the past, if you wanted to put a new skin or hat on your <em>Borderlands</em> character, you’d have to find a specific machine in-game and use it. This was annoying. Now, you can just open up the customization menu whenever you want and freely change your character’s looks.</p> <h2>Upgrading Your Inventory And Ammo Capacity Isn’t A Boring Money Grind</h2> <p><em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s big open world has a lot of places to explore, things to do, items to collect, and activities to complete. And this time around, Gearbox has decided to tie the open world to upgrading your character. Instead of grinding for money and then going to an in-game store to buy SDU upgrades, which let you carry more stuff and ammo, you now earn SDU credits by exploring and completing activities. And this is all done via a menu that is available at all times. Need more loot space to collect more guns? Well, check to see if you have enough SDU credits to upgrade your inventory space, and if so, do it right then and there. So convenient!</p>

 <h2>An Optional Hologram Path That Helps You Go The Right Way</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624986" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624986"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624986">©Gearbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I spent far too much time in past <em>Borderlands</em> games running around trying to figure out how to get to a specific place or a quest marker. The in-game maps have been helpful, but sometimes you just want someone to draw a line from where you are now to where you need to go. And good news: <em>Borderlands 4</em> does that now! At any point, you can hit a button to get an in-game holographic path showing how to reach your destination, which can be a quest or just a random point you marked on the map.</p> <h2>Repkits Offer Healing When You Need It Most</h2> <p>A new piece of loot introduced in<em> Borderlands 4</em> are repkits. These are small medical devices that players can activate every so often for some instant healing. No more hunting down health drops during tricky boss fights or big skirmishes. Those tiny bits of healing still drop and are still useful, but having a health gun at your side is great. And as with all loot in <em>Borderlands</em>, repkits come in various flavors with all sorts of weird, wacky, and useful bonuses and passive traits. Honestly, going back to any past <em>Borderlands</em> game is going to be hard after getting used to repkits.</p>

 <h2>Spawn Your Vehicle Whenever You Need It</h2> <p>A big theme when it comes to the changes and improvements made in <em>Borderlands 4</em> is convenience. And perhaps the best example of this is the removal of Catch-A-Ride stations, which previously were the only way to spawn in a vehicle. Now, every player has their own personal Digirunner (which are basically Sparrows from <em>Destiny</em>),&nbsp;and they are awesome. They move quickly, feel great to drive, and being able to call one in whenever you want is so handy. Plus, combining Digirunners with the new movement controls, like double jumping and gliding, lets you speed across the world in style.</p> <p><em><strong>And now, some changes that aren’t so good…</strong></em></p> <h2>Menus Feel Dark, Finicky, And Removed From The Game World</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000624987" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000624987"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000624987">©Gearbox / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This is a silly complaint, I’ll admit, but the loading screens in <em>Borderlands 4 a</em>re so boring. In past games, which were filled with loading screens, you’d get these wonderful, colorful posters of the location you were loading into at that moment. In<em> Borderlands 4,</em> which has far fewer loading screens thanks to its (mostly) seamless open world, the screens just look like someone took concept art and tossed the location’s name on it. They seem stale, cold, and drab. Thankfully, stuff loads so quickly that you won’t have to look at them long.</p>

 <p>Something I really loved about the menus in past <em>Borderlands</em> games was how vibrant they all were and how they existed in the world. When you opened your inventory or skills menu in <em>Borderlands 3</em>, you’d see your character standing in the world, and the menu would be hovering next to and behind them. That’s gone in <em>Borderlands 4</em>. Instead, all the menus and inventory screens exist in dark voids that feel disconnected from the world. And some of these menus are tricky to use or feel overly cluttered. The inventory, in particular, isn’t great to navigate when using a controller. This change doesn’t ruin <em>Borderlands 4</em>, but it does make me sad.</p> <h2>Loading Screens Are Dull</h2> <p>This is a silly complaint, I’ll admit, but the loading screens in <em>Borderlands 4 a</em>re so boring. In past games, which were filled with loading screens, you’d get these wonderful, colorful posters of the location you were loading into at that moment. In<em> Borderlands 4,</em> which has far fewer loading screens thanks to its (mostly) seamless open world, the screens just look like someone took concept art and tossed the location’s name on it. They seem stale, cold, and drab. Thankfully, stuff loads so quickly that you won’t have to look at them long.</p>

 <h2>Rewards For Challenges And Quests Are Hidden In Digital Boxes</h2> <p>When you complete a quest in <em>Borderlands 4</em> or when you finish an in-game challenge, you are rewarded with various goodies. But these goodies aren’t delivered directly to your inventory. Instead, you have to go into the character menu and open them up. Thankfully, you can open them all at once, but it’s so odd that this system is even in the game.</p> <p>Sure, it’s nice that guns or loot you earn from a quest aren’t dropped right in your limited inventory. But it’s annoying that cosmetic items are also locked in these chests. The game also does a terrible job of reminding you to check on your rewards. Sometimes I’d open my character screen and see, like, 10 of these chests waiting for me. I’d love an option to get notified every so often when I have more than two or three of these things waiting around to be opened.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-director-teases-naughty-dog%E2%80%99s-most-expensive-game-ever.1295166/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been almost a year since <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-ps5-actors-1851722128">was teased at The Game Awards 2024</a>. Naughty Dog’s upcoming sci-fi adventure doesn’t have a release window yet, much less a trailer showing what players will spend most of the blockbuster doing. But director Neil Druckmann did confirm it will&nbsp;<em>probably&nbsp;</em>be the studio’s most expensive game to date and reflect its growing ambition when it comes to delivering more expansive gameplay. Maybe that’s why had to ditch working on <em>The Last of Us</em> season 3 for HBO alongside his duties at PlayStation.</p> <p>“What can I say and not say?” the veteran developer said, tip-toeing around spoilers and PR guidelines <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/neil-druckmann-last-of-us-exit-intergalactic-video-game-1236514453/">in a new interview with <em>Variety</em></a>. “I can tell you we’re in the thick of it. We’re making it, we’re playing it. We’re firing on all cylinders.” Set in a far-flung, alternate future, <em>Heretic Prophet</em> follows bounty hunter Jordan A. Mun (Tati Gabrielle) who begins unraveling the secrets of a remote planet after becoming stranded there during a mission.</p> <p>“I’ve said this before, but I really mean it, I’m really feeling it right now: It’s the most ambitious game we’ve ever made. It’s the most expansive game we’ve ever made, maybe the most expensive, by the time we finish it. Troy [Baker] is in the game, and it’s been five years since I’ve worked with Troy, and I’ve got to do it again, and it was a lot of fun to be on the stage with him again.”</p>

 <p>While he hedged on the upcoming PS5 exclusive’s budget, it doesn’t seem like a shocker that it will end up costing more than the last new game Naughty Dog shipped, 2019’s <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>. In addition to the rising costs of development on current-gen platforms, a new IP like <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em> will come with a hefty marketing price-tag as Sony tries to sell fans on the next big thing from the studio behind <em>Crash Bandicoot</em>, <em>Jak and Daxter</em>, and <em>Uncharted</em>.</p> <p>Druckmann did give a slight tease in the interview of what we can expect from <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic</em> <em>Prophet</em> in terms of scope. “With <em>The Last of Us</em>, we added some RPG elements, we started playing with wide linear layouts,” he said. “Continue that trajectory forward, add sci-fi and you start to get the sense of what we’re doing, and then we’ve gotten even more ambitious than that. So really looking forward to see how it all comes together. I think you’re all going to be pleasantly surprised by it.”</p>

 <p>While pressing up against the ceiling of vagueness, the comment seems to reaffirm that <em>Heretic</em> <em>Prophet</em> will showcase even more player freedom and agency within its world. Druckmann also confirmed actor Tony Dalton, who appears in the<em> Last of Us</em> TV show (he played Joel’s dad in a season two flashback), will appear in the game too, potentially alongside others from the HBO series (the show is up for three Emmys at this year’s awards ceremony on Sunday).</p> <p>As for what comes after <em>Heretic Prophet</em>, Druckmann is still being cryptic about Naughty Dog’s future and what other projects it has in the works. There was talk of doing <em>The Last of Us Part III</em> after the last game but the team wanted to try something sci-fi instead. “I’m sure if <em>Intergalactic</em> is successful, you will see it again,” he told<em> Variety</em>. “Whether that will be our next game right after that, I can’t say, and I leave that door open. Not to be coy for this particular question, we want to see how we feel once we’re done with it and look at the options in front of us, because we have some other ideas that we’d like to explore as well.”</p>

              <p>You want to buy something in a video game. Maybe it’s a battle pass. <a href="https://twitter.com/Wensoing/status/1965755228424425619?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Maybe it’s a Sonic skin</a>. Maybe it’s the current <em>Halo</em> Master Chief skin. That one costs 1,500 V-Bucks, but V-Bucks only come in packs of 400 or 1,000. You now have 300 leftover V-Bucks and Epic Games has your extra money. It’s scammy and it sucks. Thankfully, it’s also going away.</p> <p>“Starting October 14, we’re adding an Exact Amount&nbsp;offer to the <em>Fortnite</em> V-Bucks purchasing page that lets you ‘top up’ your V-Bucks balance to the exact amount needed for the item you’re trying to buy,” the company announced on Thursday. “Let’s say you want an item that costs 500 V-Bucks but you only have 400 V-Bucks in your account. You’ll be able to buy just the 100 V-Bucks needed.”</p> <p>The improved payment option is coming to <em>Rocket League</em> and <em>Fall Guys</em> as well, and will be available across Xbox, Switch, PC, mobile, and…not PlayStation 4 and PS5? “We will work to make this available everywhere,” the blog post reads. Sony did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p> <p>Forcing players to buy extra currency by mismatching it with microtransaction prices is a tale as old as digital downloads on console. Platforms like Xbox were once infamous for making players buy games with points instead of real currency, a practice <a href="https://tech.yahoo.com/gaming/article/2013-08-26-xbox-live-updated-to-real-people-money.html">that didn’t end until 2013</a>. It was such a big deal when it changed that Microsoft made the announcement at that year’s E3.</p> <p><em>Fortnite</em>‘s “top-up” option comes a couple of years after Epic reached <a href="https://kotaku.com/fornite-refund-check-file-claim-ftc-settlement-deadline-1851717873">a $245 million settlement</a> with the FTC over “dark patterns” that tricked players into unwanted purchases.</p>
