It’s now <strong>available for $1,099 down from $3,699</strong>. Plus, you also get some handy extras included like a wireless mouse, a USB-C hub, and a 128GB flash drive.</p>

<h2>Supercharged HP Laptop</h2>
<p>This HP laptop comes with the latest Intel <strong>13th</strong> <strong>Gen i7-1355U processor (reaching up to 5.0GHz) and with 10 cores and 12 threads</strong>. That simply means it can keep pace with everything you do. It’s paired with Intel Iris Xe Graphics so the visuals are sharp and silky.</p>
<p>With <strong>64GB of DDR4 RAM and a spacious 2TB SSD</strong>, you’ll never be held back by this laptop no matter how many programs you have running or how much data you’re storing.</p>
<p>What’s more, the laptop is only 3.5 pounds and 0.73 inches thick so it won’t smother your bag or take up too much space. The 15.6-inch touchscreen screen is also very comfortable and bright with full HD resolution (1920 by 1080 pixels) and 300 nits of brightness: everything will stand out and look alive.</p>



<p>When it comes to staying in touch, this laptop has it all covered: It has Wi-Fi 6, which keeps the internet fast and consistent, and Bluetooth 5.3 for rapid pairing with your wireless devices. The camera is excellent for work meetings or online lessons, thanks to HP’s True Vision HD Camera that features a Privacy Guard for keeping things safe. The audio system is optimized for crisp and well-balanced sound so calls and video are clear without the use of headphones.</p>
<p>One of the standout features is the <strong>new Copilot key that launches Microsoft’s AI assistant</strong>. You can get help summarizing reports, pulling out insights or automating tedious tasks – all at the touch of a button. Based on Windows 11 Pro, this laptop comes with enhanced security features and tools that business users will appreciate.</p>
<p>Do not delay—September’s the time when it is worth grabbing it before it goes up in price again.</p>
