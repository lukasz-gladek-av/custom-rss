Sometimes they’re bald, gun-toting, and entering their 70s. That surely will be the case for Denzel Washington when we see him in two more upcoming <em>Equalizer</em> films which, he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a62888212/denzel-washington-gladiator-2-interview-2024/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a62888212/denzel-washington-gladiator-2-interview-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revealed to <em>Esquire</em></a></span>, he plans on doing before it’s all said and done.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In the piece, told solely from Washington’s perspective, the legendary actor explains how he still has a few roles he’s planning to do, one being a return to vigilante Robert McCall. “I told them I would do another <em>Equalizer</em>, and we’re doing four and five. More people are happy about that—people love those daggone <em>Equalizers</em>.”</p><p>Yes, we do love those daggone <em>Equalizer</em> films. That’s why each of the three films in the franchise has averaged a hefty $190 million at the box office. Typically, when actors of Washington’s esteemed pedigree do these wildly successful but artistically unchallenging films, it’s to fund projects they actually want to make. Do you think Robert Downey Jr. spent a decade inside a red fake robot suit in hopes of winning an Oscar? Washington subscribed to this same thinking, until he realized the impact of films like <em>The Equalizer</em>.</p><p>“I’ll sometimes say to myself, ‘One’s for me, one’s for them.’ So, for example, <em>Othello</em>: We’re doing it on Broadway and then a movie. That’s for me. But I’ve come to realize that the <em>Equalizer</em> films are for me, too, because they’re for the people,” he explains. “They want me to go get the bad guys. ‘We can’t get them, so you go get them.’ And I say, ‘Okay, I’ll get them! Just wait right there. I’ll be right back!’”</p><p>Is it irrational to have such an emotional attachment to a movie character that you yearn for them to fight bad guys who don’t exist? Sure, somewhat. Is that attachment the core reason why putting moving images on screens is a multi-million dollar business in America? Absolutely! And Denzel understands that.</p><p>This revelation from Washington all but ensures that he’ll be a leading man in an action film in his 70s. It’s not unheard of. Heck, Charles Bronson was 72 years old and still playing a similar vigilante in another long-standing action film franchise when he starred in <em>Death Wish V: The Face of Death</em>. Antoine Fuqua, director of every <em>Equalizer</em> film, even said in 2023 that he’s tossed around the idea of using <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/movies/the-equalizer-3-director-denzel-washington-de-aging-for-origin-story/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/movies/the-equalizer-3-director-denzel-washington-de-aging-for-origin-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">de-aging technology</a></span> on Washington for an <em>Equalizer</em> origin story.</p><p>If these are possibly some of the final action films for Washington, who said he will scale back his output significantly, they should do anything and everything to make sure one of the greatest actors of all time goes out looking like a badass.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The adorable DreamWorks fantasy adventure about Vikings and Pokémon-style pet dragons is being re-shot with actual humans this time around. Based on the first trailer, at least the reptilian star of the movie looks great. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195281" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="11 Minutes With Baldur’s Gate 3’s Character Creator" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="684" data-playlist="195281,195618,197298" data-current="195281"><div><p>11 Minutes With Baldur’s Gate 3’s Character Creator</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195281/195281_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195281/195281_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195281/195281_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195281/195281_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20744.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The movie is about a village chief’s young failson named Hiccup and how he redeems himself through quick wits and a budding but forbidden friendship with a black dragon named Toothless. Gerard Butler is reprising his role as Hiccup’s father but the rest of the cast is completely new, including Mason Thames (<em>The Black Phone</em>) as Hiccup and Nico Parker as fellow village kid Astrid. The remake’s first teaser shows Hiccup refusing to wage war on dragons as his father demands, and his pivotal first meeting with Toothless. </p><p>Toothless, the main draw of the movie, looks excellent. Imagine taking the creature from the original 2010 movie and giving him an Unreal Engine 5 makeover, just without all the uncanny valley stuff. The rest of the movie looks less spectacular, with dense fog and heavy special effects begging the question of why, exactly, you should make a live-action version of a cartoon about epic battles and fantastical creatures in a mythical land untouched by time. </p><p>Profit motive, for one, and a creatively bankrupt Hollywood for another. Even Butler basically just looks like someone cosplaying the CGI version of the character instead of giving audiences something genuinely new and different. Maybe as we get closer to the remake’s release, what Universal shows will get more convincing. At the very least, kids will love another reason to watch Toothless be cute and ferocious in equal measures all over again. </p><p>The live-action <em>How To Train Your Dragon</em> is out on June 13, 2025. In the meantime, the original version—an all-time classic—is streaming on Max, Hulu, and other platforms. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you hired her, she could help out during matches by throwing ice grenades at enemies, but she would often spam them, annoying and hindering even the players she was supposed to be assisting.

Eminem and Snoop Dogg were previously added this month and like Ice Spice, if you found them on the island during a match and defeated them in combat, you could hire them to be your bodyguard/co-op buddy. However, players quickly discovered that Ice Spice loves spamming her chiller grenades—which explode and encase your feet in blocks of ice—the moment an enemy player is nearby, leading to a lot of frustration. </p><p>You can find clips online of the digital rapper freezing people who she is, in theory, supposed to be helping. </p><p>When her ice bombs hit, they freeze your feet and greatly increase your speed, but make it harder to control your direction. Sometimes this is useful, like when you are chasing someone down or trying to escape.</p><p>But other times, when you are trying to hide or stay elevated on a ledge during a fight, it’s very unhelpful. Ice Spice didn’t give a shit, however, and would toss ice bombs with reckless abandon as seen in the clips above. This has led to players not hiring her, and complaining online about all the ice bomb spam. </p><p>On November 18, after a few days of Ice Spice trolling people with dozens of chiller grenades, Epic announced that it was stepping in and taking away her icy explosives.</p><p>“Time to defrost!

The show alternates between that grim reality and the future lives of some of those girls, 25 years later, as they struggle to reconcile what happened in the wilderness and how it continues to haunt them. With an incredible cast including Melanie Lynskey,  Christina Ricci, Tawny Cypress, Lauren Ambrose, Sophie Nélisse, Jasmin Savoy Brown, and Sophie Thatcher, the show was a breakout hit when it debuted in late 2021.</p><p>Season two was a bit disappointing, primarily because the two timelines weren’t always aligned in severity. While the teen timeline depicted harrowing events like a stillborn birth, the first death in their group, and their only shelter burning to the ground, the adult timeline leaned too heavily on a demented cult led by adult Lottie (Simone Kessell) and adult Shauna (Melanie Lynskey) dodging an investigation into her first-season murder of her extramarital fling—an arc that predictably goes nowhere. The show is at its best when all the main characters are confronting their issues together, but the second season spent far too long reuniting the adult timeline’s “gang.”</p><p>By the looks of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/yellowjackets-season-3-first-look-awards-insider?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dhtwitter&amp;utm_content=null&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/yellowjackets-season-3-first-look-awards-insider?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dhtwitter&amp;utm_content=null" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Season 3 promo photos</a></span>, the new season may address this issue. The images depict the adult and teen versions of each main character together—some embracing, others standing as though unaware of one another, and some exchanging glances. Not only does <em>Yellowjackets</em> co-creator Ashley Lyle tell <em>Vanity Fair</em> that these photos hint at character-specific overlaps of timelines in the new season, but she also reveals, “We are going to learn more about what happened in the wilderness that [the adults] are so afraid of coming out.”</p><p>The teaser trailer released today also shows glimpses of the third season’s mayhem. We see what appears to be a few of the teens dressed in animal fur, choking and threatening each other, along with teen Shauna (Sophie Nélisse) once again yelling her heart out into the void. With their cabin being burned down in the middle of winter at the end of the second season, it appears life as  scavengers is turning the girls mad.</p><p>Cuddle up with your valentine this February. We’re going deeper into <em>Yellowjackets </em>mania. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
