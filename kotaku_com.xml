              <p>Finding a laptop that will keep up with your hectic schedule without constantly hunting for an electric outlet is more difficult than it should be: You want one that is built for serious multitasking, video conferencing that won’t make you look like you’re calling from a basement and sufficient battery life to make it through an entire workday plus your nightly Netflix binge.</p>
<p>Microsoft’s latest Surface Laptop meets all these requirements and right now it’s going through an unprecedent price reduction for <em>Prime Big Deal Day</em> on Amazon. The manufacturer just debuted a whopping $400 off its highest-end laptop configuration, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4499/">cutting the cost from $1,399 to just $972</a>. This is the configuration with high-end specs such as <strong>512GB SSD storage and the Snapdragon X Elite processor</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4499/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Copilot+ PC Revolution Now Here</h2>
<p>This is not another Surface Laptop refresh: Microsoft is entering its <strong>second computing epoch with Copilot+ PCs</strong> and this 2024 laptop is its most ambitious yet to date when it comes to integrating AI capabilities. The <strong>Snapdragon X Elite processor is 12-core and incorporates a dedicated NPU</strong> (neural processing unit) that does AI tasks on your device, locally.</p>



<p>The 13.8-inch touchscreen display employs vibrant HDR technology concentrated in an ultra-thin form that ensures screen real estate is maximized and doesn’t increase the laptop’s footprint size. With the touch aspect of the display, it changes your dynamics with your work, and it feels second nature to annotate pages of your document with your hand, navigate through web pages, or zoom in on pictures with fluid gestures. With razor-thin bezels, it gives you more viewing real estate in a small form factor, and it makes a difference if you’re looking at trying to display two documents side by side or if you’re editing a detailed spreadsheet.</p>
<p>Battery life has always been a pain point for Windows laptops, but the Surface Laptop flips that narrative: You’re <strong>getting up to 20 hours of usage on a single charge</strong>, which means you can work through an entire day and still have juice left for streaming or gaming in the evening. This extended battery life comes from the efficiency of the Snapdragon X Elite’s ARM-based architecture, which sips power rather than guzzling it like traditional x86 processors.</p>
<p>The Copilot+ features genuinely change how you work: Windows Studio Effects enhances your video calls by improving lighting conditions, canceling background noise and blurring distracting elements in your environment. If you’ve ever taken a call from a poorly lit room or worried about the mess behind you, these features solve those problems in real time. The Recall feature creates an explorable timeline of everything you’ve done on your PC which makes it easy to retrieve that document you worked on last week or find that website you can’t quite remember. Real-time subtitle translation supports 44 languages during video calls or streaming.</p>
<p>At $972, this Microsoft Surface laptop features high-end specs and <strong>up-to-the-minute AI capabilities</strong> in a package that is affordable for more consumers. With this Prime Big Deal Day offer, it is a unique chance to own Microsoft’s flagship laptop at close to average PC prices.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/now-far-cheaper-than-a-switch-game-this-15-portable-monitor-lets-you-enjoy-big-screen-play-2000631855</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/now-far-cheaper-than-a-switch-game-this-15%E2%80%B3-portable-monitor-lets-you-enjoy-big-screen-play.1317073/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Nintendo Switch became the best-selling console because you can take it anywhere. But here’s the frustration: playing on that small built-in screen, especially when two people are huddled around it, can strain your eyes and diminish the experience. Portable monitors solve this problem by giving you a bigger display that weighs barely more than a notebook: The <em>Forhelp</em> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4202/">15.6-inch portable monitor is now on sale for $59, down from its typical price of $79, during Prime Big Deal Day</a>. This screen lets you display your Switch games on a much larger canvas and makes multiplayer sessions actually enjoyable. The same monitor works with your laptop for dual-screen productivity, your PlayStation or Xbox for gaming sessions without hogging the TV.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4202/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD Display for Everywhere You Go</h2>
<p>The 15.6-inch screen features <strong>1920×1080 Full HD resolution from an innovative IPS matte panel</strong>. This kind of panel technology provides you with a 178-degree viewing angle so colors and contrast do not suffer even if you’re looking at the screen off to the side. This matters if more than one person is looking, or if you’re in a room that doesn’t put you right in front of the screen. This technology produces accurate and vibrant colors that make games and movies appear real life with high detail. The matte finish reduces glare from lights or windows above.</p>



<p>The monitor has various <strong>display modes that adjust to varying circumstances</strong>. Copy mode reflects your main screen, ideal for presentations when you have to display your laptop screen to others in the room during meetings. Extension mode uses the portable monitor as an additional screen, greatly expanding your display real estate for use in productivity activities such as documenting comparisons or having reference materials up and see while you work. HDR mode delivers improved image quality with higher highlights and more natural color reproduction and improves your viewing for video and games.</p>
<p>The screen is equipped with <strong>blue light blocking technology</strong> that eliminates hazardous wavelengths without it having any impact on colors. This is useful in long gaming sessions or if you’re using the screen as another screen for working during the day. Flicker-free tech eliminates the imperceptible screen throb that contributes to eye strain, and you’re able to effortlessly look at content or game for long periods without experiencing that burning, tired feeling that low-end displays create.</p>
<p>Aluminum alloy build is employed for the body that maintains the <strong>overall weight at only 1.52 pounds</strong>. With a measurement of 0.3 inches thin, this screen fits seamlessly in your backpack along with your laptop or Switch. You get to use the magnetic smart cover that does two jobs: it safeguards the screen from scuffs when you’re carrying it and doubles as a stand with two positions for varying the viewing angle. The cover incorporates sturdy PU leather on the outside that gives it that premium look and delivers full coverage protection.</p>



<p>What’s more, there are two full-featured USB-C ports and one mini HDMI port on the monitor. Both video signal and power transmission result from the USB-C connection via a solitary cable and minimize cable mess. You must have equipment that supports Thunderbolt 3.0, Thunderbolt 4.0, or USB 3.1 Type-C with DisplayPort Alt Mode in order for the USB-C connection to function. There is universal compatibility with game consoles, older model laptops and non-USB-C video output equipment on the mini HDMI port.</p>
<p>Dual built-in speakers render the use of external audio redundant when on the move. These speakers handle dialogue well and provide adequate volume for personal use, although hard core gamers might still desire the immersion that only headphones provide. These speakers prove handy when rapidly setting up in the case of a hotel room or even in a coffee shop.</p>
<p>Right now for Prime Day, this transportable display is cheaper than many premium competitors and gives you a full second display outcome.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-wont-admit-it-needs-discounts-so-its-quietly-offloading-macbook-airs-through-amazon-2000631829</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-won%E2%80%99t-admit-it-needs-discounts-so-it%E2%80%99s-quietly-offloading-macbook-airs-through-amazon.1317070/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Here’s something you likely know: <strong>Apple never goes on sale</strong>. The tech giant carefully guards its premium image by refusing to slash prices on its official website or in its retail stores. But here’s the thing—even Apple needs to boost sales, and that’s where authorized retailers like Amazon come in.</p>
<p>For this October’s <em>Prime Big Deal Day</em> (essentially the fall version of Prime Day), Amazon is offering record-low pricing on the 2025 MacBook Air lineup, and these deals are too good to ignore. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">13-inch model with the new M4 chip and 256GB storage has dropped to $897, down from $999</a>, and<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4498/"> the 15-inch 256GB version is available for $1,078, reduced from $1,199</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4498/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See MacBook Air 15″ at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The M4 Chip Changes Everything</h2>
<p>At the heart of this 2025 MacBook is Apple’s M4 chip which represents a significant leap forward in performance and efficiency. The M4 delivers big improvements when you’re juggling multiple applications or running graphics-intensive games. The chip’s architecture allows for seamless multitasking without the fans kicking in (because there aren’t any) and without draining your battery. Speaking of which, you’re getting up to 18 hours of battery life which means you can work through an entire day and well into the evening without hunting for an outlet.</p>



<p>The screen warrants particular admiration: Both t<strong>he 13.6-inch and 15.3-inch Liquid Retina displays handle one billion colors</strong>, translating to extremely lifelike photos, videos bursting with deep contrast and text that’s crisp enough to minimize eye strain when working for long stretches. The larger 15-inch variant provides additional screen real estate for productivity applications such as working on spreadsheets or designing projects in which you desire multiple windows in sight at all times. When it comes to video conferencing and content creation, the 12MP Center Stage camera automatically positions you in the center of the picture when you’re in motion.</p>
<p>Connectivity is another aspect in which the 2025 MacBook Air excels: <strong>You have two Thunderbolt 4 ports</strong> that manage blazing-fast data transfer rates of up to 40Gbps which is ideal for external storage or high-end monitors. There’s the MagSafe power port that ensures you won’t pull your laptop off the desk if you kick your foot against the cable—the cable automatically disconnects magnetically without causing damage. Wi-Fi 6E support prepares you for the newest router tech with increased speeds and less traffic, and Bluetooth 5.3 ensures seamless connections for wireless peripherals. You’re connectable to up to two external displays as well.</p>



<p>Apple Intelligence is the company’s new personal intelligence system and it is baked right into the MacBook Air. This feature helps streamline your writing, creative expression and daily tasks with groundbreaking privacy protections that ensure your data stays yours (even Apple can’t access it). The system integrates with macOS to make common tasks faster and more intuitive. If you’re already in the Apple ecosystem with an iPhone, the integration becomes even more powerful: iPhone Mirroring lets you control your phone directly from your Mac screen, while Universal Clipboard means you can copy text on your iPhone and paste it on your Mac.</p>
<p>The audio system is backed with <strong>six speakers for Spatial Audio and three microphones</strong>, and it produces an immersive listening experience for music, movies, and games. Speakers deliver exceptionally deep bass and crisp highs for such thin case depths. Both models come with 16GB unified memory and 256GB SSD storage in this configuration, and unified memory architecture allows the system to distribute resources back and forth between processor and render tasks dynamically.</p>
<p>At <strong>these all-time-low Prime Big Deal Day prices</strong>, you’re getting the best laptop technology from Apple at a discount that doesn’t originate from an authorized dealer. They won’t stay on sale like this forever.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-fire-tv-sticks-amazon-is-blowing-out-roku-devices-at-their-cheapest-price-ever-2000631824</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-fire-tv-sticks-amazon-is-blowing-out-roku-devices-at-their-cheapest-price-ever.1316863/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cutting the cord on cable TV has never been easier, but choosing the right streaming device can feel overwhelming with so many options flooding the market. Amazon launched its Fire TV Stick lineup years ago to compete directly with established players like Roku and Google’s Chromecast, and the battle for your living room has been fierce ever since.</p>
<p>Here’s the twist: while Amazon’s own <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-just-launched-new-gadgets-yet-the-fire-tv-stick-4k-is-practically-free-at-50-off-2000630324">Fire TV Sticks are hitting record low prices</a> during Prime Big Deal Days, <strong>the retail giant is pushing Roku devices even lower</strong> to clear out remaining inventory from its biggest rival. The Roku Streaming Stick HD has dropped from $29 down to $17, the Streaming Stick 4K fell from $49 to $29, and the Streaming Stick Plus landed at $24 instead of $39.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4493/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See Roku Streaming Stick HD at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Understanding the Differences in Roku’s Lineup of Streaming Sticks</h2>
<p>The <strong>entry-level Roku Streaming Stick HD</strong> is the least costly model at $17, ideal if <strong>you’re working with an older TV that tops off at 1080p resolution</strong> or just don’t worry about 4K content. It streams high-definition content effortlessly on all major platforms such as Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max and thousands of other channels. Its included Roku Voice Remote allows you to search for shows by speaking instead of painstakingly entering using an on-screen keyboard, averting frustration when you’re trying to locate that one film whose name you just couldn’t quite manage to recall. It hooks up via HDMI and is powered from your TV’s USB port or from the included adapter.</p>



<p>Upgrading from the base model to the <strong>Roku Streaming Stick 4K</strong> for $29 unlocks significant visual gains if you own a 4K TV. This model is HDR (High Dynamic Range) and Dolby Vision capable, two technologies that achieve massive picture quality improvements beyond resolution bumps. HDR provides greater dynamic range between blacks and whites which results in more realistic pictures with higher-contrast levels. Dolby Vision does one better and adjusts brightness and colour dynamically on a scene- or even frame-by-frame basis, and it looks fantastic in supported content from services like Apple TV Plus, Netflix, and Disney Plus. Long-range Wi-Fi in the specs means that this stick should maintain stable connections even if your router is in another room or on another floor, reducing infuriating buffering that ruins key narrative points.</p>
<p>The <strong>Streaming Stick Plus</strong> at $24 is a tempting compromise with 4K and HDR support but no support for Dolby Vision, so it is relatively less capable in its ultimate picture quality compared to the Streaming Stick 4K, but importantly still much more capable compared to the HD-only base model. There is only real-world practical differentiation in the non-Dolby Vision versus HDR pictures largely on high-end TVs with excellent panel technology, so if your 4K TV is an economy or mid-range model from several years ago, you’re unlikely to see much differentiation in the pictures versus the Plus model and the full 4K model. The Plus model does, however, come with the Voice Remote and has the same massive library of streaming services, free live TV services in the form of the Roku Channel, and private listening in the form of the Roku smartphone app.</p>
<p>Each of these three models gives you access to the Roku platform which is still one of the best streaming interfaces. Installation takes just a minute or two: <strong>stick the stick in your TV’s HDMI port, connect it to your network and start viewing</strong>. compact size makes these sticks disappear completely behind your television with no apparent clutter.</p>
<p>With these aggressive discounts and the fact that non-Prime members have access to these deals, now is truly the perfect time to upgrade your streaming setup.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-gaming-laptop-40gb-ddr5-ram-ryzen-5-1tb-is-62-off-amazon-is-cleaning-house-like-never-before-2000631818</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo-gaming-laptop-40gb-ddr5-ram-ryzen-5-1tb-is-62-off-amazon-is-cleaning-house-like-never-before.1316851/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gaming laptops usually come at high prices, and for anything decent in the market below $1,500, it’s like looking for a needle in a haystack. These systems have powerful hardware to support demanding games and creative tasks and that’s why they’re normally that costly. But if you need the best of everything without wasting your savings, Amazon’s <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em> is the place to make it happen.</p>
<p>This Lenovo gaming laptop that is equipped with an <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4489/">AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor, 40GB DDR5 RAM, and 1TB PCIe SSD is literally amazing today: It was lowered from its regular price of $1,699 to only $649</a>, translating to a <strong>massive 62% off</strong> and setting an all-time low for the configuration.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4489/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Gaming That Challenges Higher-End Machines in Performance</h2>
<p>The AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS processor is the power behind this laptop’s fantasstic performance. With <strong>6 cores and 12 threads running at 3.3GHz base clocks that turbo up to 4.55GHz</strong>, this chip edges ahead of Intel’s i7-11800H in several use cases. What does it mean for you? High-definition video editing becomes doable instead of infuriating, programming development environments launch and respond quickly even with multiple programs launched at once and tasks such as rendering in interior design or 3D modeling become doable. The 3MB L2 cache and 16MB L3 cache enable the processor to quickly call up frequently used data and minimize lag when you’re in the middle of intense multitasking sessions.</p>



<p>Complementing this processor is <strong>40GB of DDR5 SDRAM</strong> which is a huge improvement from previous DDR4 technology. DDR5 is faster for data transfer and more efficient with power so your laptop stays cooler and more quickly processes information. With 40GB readily available, you can use memory-intensive programs such as <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/adobe-premiere-pro">Adobe Premiere</a>, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/adobe-photoshop">Photoshop</a>, or several virtual machines and never see slowdowns. <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/google-chrome">Chrome</a> users who have dozens of tabs up will love never again confronting that nasty “page unresponsive” message. The <strong>1TB PCIe NVMe SSD is storage that is blazingly fast</strong>, boots Windows in seconds, loads games near-instantly, and leaves you plenty of space for your entire game library.</p>



<p>The 15.3-inch display provides 1920×1200 resolution for a little more vertical screen real estate compared to typical Full HD displays. This additional vertical screen real estate is priceless when editing documents. Color accuracy is ensured from wide viewing angles with the IPS panel and you work just fine in brightly lit rooms or in front of windows due to the 300 nits brightness rating. Eye strain is lessened during long gaming sessions or working marathons with the anti-glare finish. With 45% NTSC color gamut coverage and a refresh rate of 60Hz, the display navigates daily gaming effortlessly. C<strong>asual to intense gaming, esports games, and creative programs are taken in their stride by the built-in AMD Radeon 660M processor</strong>.</p>
<p>Port selection accounts for all contingencies: two USB-A ports functioning at USB 3.2 Gen 1 levels (5Gbps) for the traditional accessories, one USB-C that doubles for both USB Power Delivery 3.0 for fast charging and DisplayPort 1.2 for attaching high-resolution external displays, an HDMI 1.4 for more display connections, a headphone jack for audio equipment and an SD card slot for speedy file imports from cameras.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Professional is backed up by enterprise-grade features such as BitLocker encryption and remote desktop, while the built-in Copilot AI PC feature is your intelligent aide available from its dedicated keyboard shortcut. There is even a 720p HD camera that has a privacy shutter for users who value their security.</p>
<p>With this Prime Day deal on Amazon, you’re getting gaming-level performance at a cost below that of the majority of business budget laptops.</p>
