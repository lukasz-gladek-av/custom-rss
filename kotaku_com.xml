              <p><span>Catch me redownloading </span><i><span>Guilty Gear Strive</span></i><span>, as Lucy from the excellent </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-season-2-netflix-studio-trigger-1851785703"><i><span>Cyberpunk Edgerunners </span></i></a><span>anime is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-2024-guilty-gear-lucy-cyberpunk-tekken-8-heihachi-1851601248"><span>joining the roster as a guest character</span></a><span>. Arc System Works’ anime fighter is releasing its </span><a href="https://www.guiltygear.com/ggst/en/news/post-2559/#p21"><span>1.48 patch tomorrow</span></a><span>, August 21, and not only will it come with the usual balance changes and bug fixes, but it will also bring more </span><i><span>Cyberpunk</span></i><span> content to the game as well. However, there is one downer in the small print.</span></p> <p><span>Lucy is the only </span><i><span>Edgerunners </span></i><span>character joining the roster, but there will be references to others in the 1.48 patch, with avatars based on Lucy, David, and Rebecca from </span><i><span>Edgerunners</span></i><span> being made available. Meanwhile, in one of the crossover’s coolest touches, a selection of tracks from </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span>‘s soundtrack will be available as background music for all your fights, regardless of whether or not you’ve paid to play as Lucy. This includes songs by Johnny Silverhand’s band Samurai, such as the lesser version of </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Igq3d6XA75Y"><span>“Chippin’ In”</span></a><span> (should’ve been </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Ud65jWxMJg"><span>the superior take by my trashbag boyfriend Kerry Eurodyne</span></a><span>), as well as </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AN1RJF55NXI"><span>“Never Fade Away.”</span></a><span> The best song on the list, however, is </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KvMY1uzSC1E"><span>“I Really Want to Stay at Your House” by Rosa Walton</span></a><span>, arguably the most iconic song from the game and anime. The song accompanies some of </span><i><span>Edgerunners’ </span></i><span>best moments, and is used to incredible effect. So if you want to have yearning pop perfection playing in the background as you climb up the ranks, you can do that…but only for a limited time.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>According to the patch notes, “I Really Want to Stay at Your House” will be removed from </span><i><span>Strive </span></i><span>in 2027, and that’s as specific as the notes get. The specific end date will be “announced separately,” and “may be moved up without prior notice.” Bummer. Guess you can always play it through the Spotify app?</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Guilty Gear -Strive- Starter Guide - Lucy" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UT3Q6cAZgYI?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>For more on </span><i><span>Guilty Gear Strive</span></i><span>’s latest update, </span><a href="https://www.guiltygear.com/ggst/en/news/post-2559/#p21"><span>check out the full patch notes</span></a><span>.</span></p>
