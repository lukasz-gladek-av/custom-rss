The way he explains it, the upcoming <em>Death Stranding </em>adaptations will be more inspired by the game, rather than a faithful retelling.</p><p>“When it comes to film adaptations of games,” Kojima told <em>Vogue</em> (via machine translation), “there have been recent [shows] like <em>The Last of Us</em> that keep the plot of the original intact, and films like <em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> that are more like a service to game fans. Each of these works has its own merits, but as a film lover, I want to pursue the expressive potential of cinema.”</p><p>It’s at this point in the interview that Kojima makes the first mention of this anime project. “I am aiming to make <em>Death Stranding</em> in a way that can only be done as a film, and that will win awards at the Cannes Film Festival and the Venice Film Festival. In fact, we are also currently working on an anime adaptation.”</p><p>This isn’t the first time Kojima has brought one his video game properties into the world of anime. <em>Zone of the Enders: Dolores, I </em>was an anime series released from the world of his gorgeous multi-console third-person shooter <em>Zone of the Enders </em>back in 2001. An anime prequel film, <em>Zone of the Enders: 2167 Idolo</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>was released six months prior.</p><p>No release date or timeline has been announced. Still, it’s exhilarating to know that one of the most innovative visual storytellers of our time is continuing to expand his creative horizons.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
