              <p>For decades, TV speakers have disappointed viewers with thin and muddy audio failing to live up to the visual quality of modern displays. Soundbars solve that problem by fitting proper speakers and amplification into a sleek package that fits beneath your TV without taking up space and adding the complexity of full surround sound systems.</p>
<p>The Bose smart Dolby Atmos soundbar brings premium audio technology from one of the most respected names in sound, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5419/">and Amazon just dropped its price to an all-time low of $399 from the standard $499 tag</a>. It puts a Bose soundbar with top-notch features at the same price point as generic mid-range soundbars without the brand reputation or expert audio engineering that Bose brings.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5419/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Immersive Sound Technology</h2>
<p><strong>Dolby Atmos adds a third dimension of height channels</strong> to the traditional surround format, with the ability to place audio objects in space with pinpoint accuracy around and above you, rather than just from the left and right. It’s a spatial audio technology that makes movie soundtracks feel far more realistic, placing the sounds of helicopters passing overhead or rain falling from above in the correct places. To pull off this trick, the Bose soundbar features an acoustic architecture that somehow manages to shoehorn five separate transducers into its compact frame, including two upward-firing speakers that reflect sound off your ceiling to create the illusion of height channels.</p>
<p>TrueSpace technology denotes proprietary Bose processing that works beyond Dolby Atmos content. This intelligent system analyzes whatever audio signal you feed it, be it standard stereo music, older 5.1 surround soundtracks, or streaming content without spatial encoding. The <strong>processing upmixes those conventional formats to create a more enveloping and expansive sound</strong> <strong>experience</strong> from the soundbar’s multi-driver configuration.</p>



<p><em>A.I. Dialogue Mode</em> addresses one of the most common complaints about modern audio mixing: voices getting buried beneath music and effects. This artificial intelligence system continuously monitors the audio stream, and identifies dialogue frequencies and dynamically adjusting the balance to ensure voices remain clear and prominent without completely suppressing the atmospheric sounds that create immersion.</p>



<p>Voice control integration provides hands-free operation thanks to integrated Amazon Alexa functionality. Adjust the volume, change inputs, play music, or even fire up other smart home devices-all are possible with voice commands and no need to pick up a remote. Bose <em>Voice4Video</em> takes it a step further: it allows you to<strong> take control of your TV and either the cable or satellite box through the voice system</strong> of the soundbar, consolidating several devices into one unified voice control interface.</p>
<p>It features just about every major wireless streaming protocol, giving flexibility in the way you send audio to the system. Bluetooth connectivity works with any phone, tablet, or computer for easy wireless streaming. Apple AirPlay 2 offers higher-quality wireless audio for iPhone and Mac users while enabling multi-room audio with other AirPlay speakers. Spotify Connect lets you control playback directly from within the Spotify app with improved stability and quality compared to standard Bluetooth. Chromecast built-in supports casting from thousands of compatible apps on Android devices and computers.</p>
<p>Physical connectivity includes HDMI eARC for easy TV connection and support for all audio formats; optical input is available for older TVs, and USB is for service updates. The HDMI eARC connection carries both standard audio and advanced formats like Dolby Atmos through a single cable while allowing the soundbar to respond to your TV remote’s volume controls.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-mac-mini-m4-opens-black-friday-season-now-selling-at-new-record-low-on-amazon-2000628053</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-mac-mini-m4-opens-black-friday-season-now-selling-at-new-record-low-on-amazon.1353319/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple never discounts its products directly so third-party retailer deals are especially noteworthy for anyone looking to save on premium hardware. Amazon just kicked off Black Friday pricing for several Apple devices including AirTags, MacBook Air models, and the brand-new Mac Mini with M4 chip. The 2024 Mac Mini is Apple’s more affordable desktop computer, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">and the 256GB model is now available for $499 instead of its usual $599 price</a>. That’s a $100 discount and an all-time low for a machine that’s only been on the market for roughly a year now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Desktop Power in a Small Package</h2>
<p>The<strong> M4 is among the latest generations of Apple silicon</strong> and brings impressive boosts in performance from what was a breathtakingly remarkable M2 that powered the last Mac Mini. The processor houses 10 CPU cores-again, a mix of performance and efficiency cores-allowing the system to handle tasks dynamically, depending on their computational demands.</p>
<p>The <strong>GPU here is an integrated 10-core GPU on the same chip as the CPU for all graphical processing</strong>. It does away with discrete graphics cards while still offering high-end visual performance. This unified architecture allows the GPU to share the same 16GB of unified memory as the CPU, meaning that in graphics-intensive applications, data access is way quicker than in systems where the GPU has separate video memory that constantly needs data transfers.</p>



<p>Speaking of memory, <strong>the 16GB of unified RAM is a significant upgrade from the base 8GB configuration Apple used</strong> in previous entry-level Macs. You can run many applications simultaneously without the slowdowns that occur when systems begin swapping data to storage. You can keep dozens of browser tabs open while working in productivity apps, editing photos, and listening to music without the frustrating lag that comes from too little RAM.</p>
<p>The <strong>256GB SSD will provide fast storage for your operating system</strong>, applications, and files. Solid-state drives allow for near-instant boot times and app launches compared to traditional hard drives, while Apple’s custom controllers push read and write speeds even further than standard SSDs. This capacity works well if you primarily use cloud storage services or external drives for large media libraries, though heavy users who store extensive local file collections might want to consider external storage solutions or the higher-capacity models.</p>



<p>The <strong>Gigabit Ethernet is built into the Mac Mini</strong> for wired network connectivity, thus offering more stable and faster internet in many situations than Wi-Fi. It proves very helpful when transferring huge files across your local network, streaming high-bitrate video content, or keeping reliable connections during video calls and remote work. Inclusion of Ethernet at the base price level means you don’t need to purchase adapters or sacrifice USB ports for network connectivity; wired connections eliminate the interference issues that sometimes plague wireless networks.</p>
<p><em>Apple Intelligence</em> offers advanced machine learning on the desktop and automates a range of tasks from intelligent writing assistance and image generation to enhanced Siri capabilities. Because these features are local on the M4 chip and run without using the cloud, execution is faster and more private, since your data never has to leave the device.</p>
<p>Its compact design <strong>measures 5 inches square and 2 inches tall</strong>, and occupies only a minimum of desk space but delivering full desktop performance. That small footprint makes the Mac Mini perfect for tight workspaces, minimal desk sets, or whenever you need powerful computing in a configuration without the bulk of a tower.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-switch-ps5-sequel-2000642061"><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em></a> was released back in 2018 on PS4 and Xbox One. <a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-the-kotaku-review-1829984369">It’s a very good open-world Wild West game</a> developed and published by Rockstar Games. And over six years later, this incredible video game, which got a PC port in 2019, has yet to receive a PS5/Series X update. Meanwhile, Rockstar recently confirmed that 2010’s <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> will, in fact, get a nice upgrade. Life is cruel like that sometimes.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-remaster-ps5-xbox-series-switch-2-2000644016">On November 13, Rockstar Games announced that<em> Red Dead Redemption</em></a> would be ported to phones, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch 2. If you already own the PS4, Switch, or backwards-compatible digital Xbox 360 version of the game, you’ll get the upgrade for free when <em>RDR</em> makes the leap to new consoles <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/258282o585k1ka/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-netflix-ios-android-ps5-xbox-series-and">on December 2.</a> This new version of<em> Red Dead Redemption</em> supports 4K/60, enhanced image quality, and HDR support on PS5/Xbox. Meanwhile, on Nintendo Switch 2, RDR supports DLSS, HDR, mouse controls, and 60FPS gameplay. And, like with 2023’s rerelease on PS4, this new version will include the zombie-infested <em>Undead Nightmare&nbsp;</em>DLC.&nbsp; Awesome stuff! But uh…hey, Rockstar, I think you forgot something.</p>

   <p>Since the launch of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S in 2020, Rockstar fans have been begging the company to update or upgrade<em> Red Dead Redemption 2</em> so that the game can take full advantage of the more powerful machines. Over on PC, <em>RDR 2</em> looks amazing with its high framerates, increased draw distances, and impressive resolutions. That’s not to say <em>RDR 2</em> on PS4 is an ugly game, but it could be so much better. And yet, six years later…nothing. No update. No upgrade. Just rumors and whispers that maybe one day it might happen. But it never does.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-leak-rdr-2-next-gen-red-dead-rockstar-1850852925">Even Xbox thought a modern update was coming</a>, according to leaked court documents from 2023. But alas, nope. Rockstar has seen fit to update and upgrade <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> from PS3 to PS4 to PS5. And it’s now planning to upgrade <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> from last gen to current gen, for free, too. Sadly, <em>RDR 2</em>, for whatever reason, isn’t getting the same treatment, at least not yet.</p> <p>I’ll admit, I laughed when I saw the news that <em>Red Dead Redempti</em>on would get a fancy PS5 upgrade before <em>Red Dead Redemption 2.</em> It’s funny, in a depressing kind of way. Which, for a game as sad as<em> RDR 2</em>, feels like poetry. But I’m not here for amusing parallels between art and real life. I’m here to blast away bandits and lawmen in <em>RDR 2</em> in 4K/60 on PS5 Pro. I guess I’ll just buy a <a href="https://kotaku.com/16-cool-details-valve-new-steam-machine-console-controller-vr-headset-2000643572">Steam Machine next year and play <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> at 60FPS over there.</a> It’s probably the closest to a current-gen port we’ll get anytime soon, as <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> takes away most of Rockstar’s focus and resources.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-guns-for-every-possible-situation-in-arc-raiders.1353289/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> is the kind of game for which establishing strict metas is going to prove difficult. Your objective is to get out alive and with good loot; abstaining from violence is as valid a “strategy” as indulging in it. Is your death-machine build “better” than my stealthy saboteur who can easily outrun you and hide, getting away with all the stuff I collected, thereby “winning”? <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ gameplay has more going on, more varied “win conditions” than just who can kill who faster in a straight shootout.</p> <p>But some weapons do have genuine advantages over others. A strict showdown would reveal whose weapon and build options gave them the clear advantage. But we’re hardly running in perpetual circles shooting at each other all the time in <i>Arc Raiders</i>, nor are we all expected to kill one another until the last person declared standing is the winner. So one’s arsenal can serve many purposes, with a lot of room for stylistic preferences.</p>

 <p>The variety of weapons available in <i>Arc Raiders</i> lets you plan and build several different shooter archetypes, so let’s get into how these guns work.</p> <h2>What kinds of guns are in this game?</h2> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> breaks its weapons down into eight broad categories: Assault Rifles, Battle Rifles, Submachine Guns, Shotguns, Pistols, Light Machineguns, Sniper Rifles, and “Special.”</p>

 <p>The guns in these categories also vary in terms of which of the five ammo types they use (Light, Medium, Heavy, Energy, and Launcher), as well as their firing mode, damage, firing rate, and range.</p> <p>Firing modes in particular are important as they determine the pace at which you can fire. Semi-auto fires with every pull of the trigger, full-auto constantly fires, and the three-round burst is rather self explanatory. Various other guns feature “actions,” meaning your character will have to operate the gun in some way after each shot (this is often distinct from reloading), so your shots will be slow, but usually quite powerful. Perhaps the most common example across a variety of different games is the bolt-action firing mode, which sees your character operating a bolt after each shot (simulating the operation of real-life bolt-action rifles).</p>

 <p>Why is all of this important? Well, if you want to run and gun, something like a Ferro, which is a heavy break-action rifle and requires you to load each round, won’t be as suitable as something like a Stitcher, which is a fully automatic submachine gun. But that Stitcher won’t help you nail a high-powered shot from a great distance; that’s the Ferro’s speciality.</p>

 <p>For each of these broad gun types, there are different rarities too, with rarer items being more powerful: gray is for common guns, green for uncommon, blue for rare, purple for epic, yellow for legendary.</p> <p>And with the exception of legendary guns, all guns can be leveled up three times to a max of level four. Various elements of a firearm improve as you level them up. Some will see increased magazine size and increased durability, others will see increased durability and fire-rate, and so on. I’m finding <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Weapons">this <i>Arc Raiders</i> wiki</a> to be an excellent resource for the raw numbers.</p>

 <p>So let’s sort these guns into some use cases, of which you’ll find there’s some overlap.</p> <h2>The best guns for close-quarters combat</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641794" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641794"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641794">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Shotguns on average promise wild amounts of high damage with exceedingly poor range. Great for times when you’re nervous someone might jump out from a corner mere feet away from you. For those, you get two options:</p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Il Toro:</b> Uncommon shotgun, pump-action (pretty awesome when leveled up and kitted out well)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Vulcano: </b>Epic shotgun, semi-automatic (the one time I had a chance to use this, I gut jumped and barely fired a shot off before it was long gone)</li> </ul> <p>Following that, submachine guns will fare well given their high firing rate comes at the cost of range, but you also don’t need to worry about having pinpoint accuracy.</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Stitcher: </b>Common submachine gun, fully automatic (pretty awesome when fully leveled up and kitted out with good mods)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Bobcat: </b>Epic submachine gun, fully automatic</li> </ul> <p>Finally, assault rifles aren’t terrible in some cases, provided they’re fully automatic (for my playstyle, anyway—if you can accurately place semi-automatic shots while experiencing the panic of a close-quarters gun fight, more power to you). Fully automatic assault rifles include:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Rattler: </b>Common assault rifle (frustrating to use at low levels, in my opinion)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Tempest:</b> Epic assault rifle</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Bettina:</b> Epic assault rifle</li> </ul> <h2>The best guns for medium-range combat</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000644148" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000644148"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000644148">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>These are the situations in which your enemy isn’t so far off you need a scope to see ‘em, but they’re still far enough away to render something like a shotgun pretty pointless. <b>If you can control the recoil well and shoot in controlled bursts, the Rattler, Tempest, and Bettina are good options here too</b>. Otherwise, the following semi-automatic weapons and the lone three-round burst rifle will serve you well:</p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Kettle:</b> Common assault rifle, semi-automatic (I do not get along with this weapon, FWIW)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Arpeggio:</b> Common assault rifle, three-round burst (it’s like the FAMAS from <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> and the battle rifle from <i>Halo 2</i> had a baby)</li> </ul> <h2>The best guns for long-range combat</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000644149" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000644149"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000644149">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>While the assault rifles above can certainly prove useful in some limited long-range situations, you have far better options for delivering high-damage, precision shots from a distance if your marksmanship is up to snuff.</p> <ul> <li><b>Ferro:</b> Common battle rifle, break-action (using this is the best part of losing all the way to subsisting on Common guns)</li> <li><b>Renegade:</b> Rare battle rifle, lever-action (like a faster though slightly weaker Ferro)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Osprey: </b>Rare sniper rifle, bolt-action (for when you want to <a href="https://youtu.be/dAXsSFlu6Ug">be her</a>)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Jupiter:</b> Legendary sniper rifle, bolt-action</li> </ul> <p>Note that the only gun with a scope at all in this game is the Osprey sniper rifle. Even the legendary Jupiter sniper rifle just has the screen zoom in a bit when ADS-ing instead of shifting to a scoped view.</p> <h2>What about those pistols?</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000644150" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000644150"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000644150">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Pistols and handguns are funny things in many shooters. On one hand, they are perhaps most functional as sidearms–perfect for those “oh, shit” moments when you don’t have enough time to reload your main weapon, and so fall back to something a little speedier though less powerful. On the other, they’re often too cool to just be guns you fall back on.</p>

 <p>If you’re after the theater of being <i>that</i> person with the quick trigger finger on a pistol, start with the Burletta for training wheels and graduate to the Venator.</p> <p>These are your four pistol options:&nbsp;<b></b></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Hairpin:</b> Common, slide-action (permanently silenced)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Burletta: </b>Uncommon, semi-automatic (definitely the most side-armed of sidearms)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Anvil: </b>Uncommon, single-action (<i>Arc Raiders</i>’ hand cannon)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Venator</b>: Rare, semi-automatic</li> </ul> <h2>And the toys</h2> <p>Everything above will cover your bases. But if you want to pack a ton of heat to take down the game’s biggest threats or show other players you’re not messing around, here are your options:&nbsp;<b></b></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Torrente: </b>Rare light machine gun, fully automatic (the bullets literally go <i>brrrrrrr</i>)</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Equalizer:</b> Legendary beam rifle, fully automatic</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Hullcracker:</b> Epic armaments launcher, pump-action</li> </ul> <hr> <p>And there ya have it, roughly five different broad shooter archetypes spread out amongst <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ existing arsenal. Naturally, the higher tier of rarity, the better the gun is at the thing it does. Though you still might find, for example, that while the Ferro and Renegade occupy very similar territory, they have some clear differences that might still make the Ferro more appealing for some (namely the higher damage per shot).</p> <p>Also, all of these guns at level four are the best versions of themselves. As for modifications, muzzle attachments, rear stock options, and so forth, those are a subject for another day since they can help guide any one of these guns down a more specialized path.</p>

        <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-episode-1-2-review-aaron-paul-critical-role-2000639678"><i><span>Dispatch</span></i></a><span>, the superhero workplace comedy by AdHoc Studio, oscillates between being a fun, low-stakes romp and the video game equivalent of those obnoxious YouTube brain-rot videos your edgy teen nephew can’t stop watching, and it does so with such whiplash-inducing intensity that there were points when I was genuinely unsure if I even liked the game. Yet, when the week-long gaps between its eight episodes started to close, I was always looking forward to spending time at Robert Robertson III’s desk and sending my team of ex-criminals out to save the day again.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As a video game, </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>is a paper-thin, choice-based adventure game that seems kind of annoyed that I’m even holding a controller while its superpowered dramedy plays out. When it’s being a comedic, playable television show, it has almost as many misses in its jokes as it does belly-laugh-inducing one-liners. Then, as a management sim in which you’re sending heroes out to finish odd jobs, </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span> has all the complexity of your favorite time-killing mobile app. The individual pieces of </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>leave much to be desired, but when it’s all put together, it’s a breezy workplace sitcom that occasionally looks over its shoulder to ask for your input. I play its episodes like I watch </span><i><span>The Office</span></i><span>: I don’t need it to change my life, but its weekly drops were a nice thing to look forward to.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000644111" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000644111"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000644111">© Adhoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Robert Robertson III is the latest in a family line of heroes. He, like his father and grandfather before him, pilots a mech suit under the name Mecha Man. Though he doesn’t have superpowers, his heroics have earned him respect in the local superhero community and the fear and disdain of the villains they take down. However, after a fight against his arch-nemesis, the enigmatic, calculating villain named Shroud, puts his robot out of commission, Robert finds lighter work behind a desk at the Superhero Dispatch Network. Here, he guides the Z-Team, a group of ex-villains looking for a new lease on life.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>These ex-cons are all a bunch of delinquents, but the lovable kind that you want to see succeed. Invisigal, voiced by Laura Bailey, is the game’s de facto leading lady, who hates teamwork and doing good, but volunteered for the SDN’s program. Flambae is the flamboyant, fire-manipulating bastard who doesn’t know that the guy who put him away is leading his team. Then there’s Sonar, the literal batman voiced by YouTuber MoistCr1TiKaL, who transforms between his more reasonable anthropomorphic form and his more unpredictable monstrous one. That’s not even half of the crew, but by the time </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s eight episodes concluded, I was pretty smitten with all of them. Each member has their own strengths, weaknesses, and relationships, and knowing them is what can make one of their episodic dispatch shifts a smooth operation or a managerial disaster.</span></p>

 <p><span>But manning the dispatch desk is only half of the team-building exercises </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>requires of Robert. The other half of the game is made up of mostly non-interactive story segments. Despite all he’s been through, Robert wants to believe in something, and if he can’t believe in himself, maybe he can turn this group of rehabilitated comic book villains into a real team that cares about the city and each other. Aaron Paul gives one of his more reserved performances after years of being synonymous with burnout characters like Jesse from </span><i><span>Breaking Bad </span></i><span>and Todd from </span><i><span>Bojack Horseman</span></i><span>, and while he veers close to monotony at times, he makes a good straight man to the more eccentric heroes he works with.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I really do enjoy the character dynamics of </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>, and when it’s not devolving into toilet humor, it’s got a lot of great gags, endearing relationships, and memorable dramatic moments and action sequences for you to QTE through. My trouble is that despite some entertaining writing and the occasional meaningful choice, </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>feels like it’s railroading you throughout several of its supposedly big decisions. AdHoc is made up of ex-Telltale Games developers, and </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s approach to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-dialogue-options-chair-episode-3-golem-choice-2000640791"><span>time-based decision-making</span></a><span> feels mostly in line with how that studio’s old adventure games handled it. The major exception is that </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>almost never gives you the option to say nothing, like </span><i><span>The Walking Dead </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Tales from the Borderlands </span></i><span>did. If you let decisions time out, </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>will choose one of its (usually binary) dialogue options for Robert to utter, and broadly, the game doesn’t do a great job of masking that it’s forcing you into something, no matter what you do or don’t pick.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000644107" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000644107"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000644107">© Adhoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>For example, </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/devs-dispatch-telltale-superhero-game-cut-sex-scenes-romance-2000643646"><span>two competing romantic subplots</span></a><span> going on. Robert can get with either his subordinate, Invisigal, or his boss, Blonde Blazer. I felt like both of those relationships weren’t right for Robert at this point in his life, so I tried to circumvent romance entirely. However, as the episodes went on, it was clear to me that </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>was going to force me into one romance or the other, so I went with the one that felt less objectionable and wooed my boss. That’s a microcosm of what it usually feels like to make choices in </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>. There are some meaningful ones, like a point at which you choose to fire one person on your team and replace them with a new recruit of your choice, but those are so few and far between that I sometimes wondered if there was any real reason for me to engage with them. </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>has a story it wants to tell, and the real, meaningful impact of your choices is only felt in a few key plot points.</span></p>

 <p><span>By the time I finished the eighth and final episode, I was invested in some of the decisions I’d made and felt like they culminated in a drastically different fate for some of the members of Z-Team, but a lot of them ended up feeling like they were only on the team as props for a few of the others. I rarely felt like I could touch the world of </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span> as a choice-based game, but I still cared about the outcomes, whether I was truly shaping them or not.</span></p> <p><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>was originally conceived as a TV show, so it makes some sense that the best parts of it are the ones that are tailor-made for that medium. Its animation pops, the performances range from alright to pretty damn good, and the actual workplace drama that acts as the foundation for all the management sim mechanics makes for a genuinely compelling adult animation story. You know, when it’s not aiming for the lowest hanging fruit (or testicles) for its jokes.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000644108" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000644108"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000644108">© Adhoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As for its most video-gamey aspect, its management sim segments start pretty rote but become more complex over time. As Robert, you assign different team members to odd jobs around the city in real-time, with each character having different stats, passive abilities, and synergies with other team members. Objectives can time out, people need breaks between jobs, and sending the wrong person can snowball into a larger problem for the team if you just throw people at work at random. The micromanaging nature of </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s assignment systems is the stuff of your least-favorite retail middle manager’s dreams, but hey, at least in this scenario, you’re actually dealing with life-or-death scenarios while watching your workers’ break time whittle down and not being a cog in the machine of a multi-billion-dollar retail chain.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"SDN: when you're here, you're family."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Adhoc Studio</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Superhero management sim with narrative choices.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Good characters, animation, and management elements; funny sometimes.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Aggressively unfunny at other times, choice impact varies, maybe could've just been a TV show.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PC, PS5 (played on)</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>Weekly from October 22, 2025 to November 12, 2025.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played</p>                 <p>~8 hours</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>gradually adds new systems to its calls, such as synergies between different heroes that make them ideal partners and implementing thresholds that can cause you to automatically fail jobs if you overtake certain stat levels, and sometimes it will intentionally overwhelm you with more work than you have people for, so you have to make hard calls as their timers tick down. In between sending people out to do the grunt work, Robert also puts his hacking skills to use for certain jobs, so you’re not just letting everyone else do the hard work while you point and sip your coffee. It’s a simple interface (which is sometimes a pain to navigate on a controller), but it gives you enough moving parts to juggle that some of the latter shifts are a genuinely stressful challenge. </span></p>

 <p><span>Each mission you assign heroes to gives you a breakdown of the situation and a general vibe of what the work entails, and it will often be up to you to discern who you should send to do something based on a job description, rather than hard numbers or required stats. That’s what makes knowing your team so important. I wouldn’t send the rash Invisigal to do PR work when I could send the charismatic Prism, for instance. </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>usually</span> <span>doesn’t tell you who the right person for the job is, but by about the season’s midpoint, I was typically no longer consulting my character sheets because I knew the team’s strengths and weaknesses after working with them for several weeks.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000644110" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000644110"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000644110">© Adhoc Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I tend to really enjoy </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>in the moment when I’m playing it, but when I think about it in hindsight, I recognize that it’s really at its best when it drops the facade of trying to be an interactive narrative adventure and is just a TV show. When I actually received QTE prompts during its action sequences, it was often a genuine surprise; almost as if I’d been watching so much of it unfold without my input that it felt like someone tapping me on the shoulder after I’d zoned out. But the more I think about it, the more I wonder if </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>is worthy of deeper consideration about whether it’s “making the most of the medium” or if it treats the player as too superfluous at times. </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>was a fun time, but I don’t know if it’s a game worth standing on a soapbox about. </span></p> <p><span>No disrespect to anyone who loved or loathed the game, but I’m surprised at the extreme, visceral responses of both love and hate </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>has received, not because I don’t think people are right to feel one way or another, but because it’s such a low-stakes, silly, and often jaunty little thing that I couldn’t imagine feeling </span><i><span>that </span></i><span>strongly about it. In the end, I had a fine time with </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>. I liked it when I was playing it, looked forward to its next episodes when I wasn’t, and most of my biggest complaints with it I express with a shrug. Sometimes your experience with something is not that serious, and it’s nice to be able to leave something behind knowing you’d pick it up again if another pair of episodes dropped next week. And if no future episodes come, that would be okay, too.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dispatch-review-adhoc-studios-all-8-episodes-finale-2000644106]]></content:encoded>
