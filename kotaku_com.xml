            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Yesterday, Nintendo released an animated short called </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-animated-close-to-you-mario-pikmin-theory-2000632576"><span>“Close to You”</span></a><span> on its YouTube and social media channels. The video was posted with no context, no description, and even its comments were turned off, so no one could speculate about its meaning in the comments. Today, Nintendo uploaded an updated version of the short on the Nintendo Today app that sheds some light on the mystery by revealing Pikmin, the titular little plant-like creatures from Nintendo’s strategy game series, were behind the original video’s shenanigans all along.</span></p> <p><span>Some fans clocked this yesterday, as the video had some </span><i><span>Pikmin </span></i><span>musical motifs in its score, and it looked like one of these plant guys was carrying items in the background of one shot. But there was also a fair bit of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-just-shared-a-4-minute-pixar-like-animated-short-with-no-explanation-2000632524"><span>speculation that it could have been a clip from the upcoming </span><i><span>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</span></i></a><span>, depicting what could have been a baby Rosalina taking her first steps. But now we know for sure, because the updated video shows all the weird floating items in the baby’s room were actually being moved by Pikmin the whole time. The video hasn’t been uploaded outside of the Nintendo Today app at the moment, but the updated version is almost exactly the same, but it’s like someone flipped a switch and enabled a whole other layer in the rendering process, showing dozens of Pikmin crawling around the baby’s room. We’ll update this story when the video is uploaded on YouTube or any platform we can actually embed.</span></p> <p><span>The question remains, however: what is this teasing? Is it a new </span><i><span>Pikmin </span></i><span>game? A movie? The return of the </span><a href="https://pikmin.nintendo.com/en/short-movies/"><i><span>Pikmin </span></i><span>short movies</span></a><span>? Maybe we’ll find out more tomorrow if a third version drops? Or maybe it’s just a fun one-off thing some animators wanted to put together? Whatever the case, it’s a cute short. I hope to be able to watch it on something other than my phone before the day’s end.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-is-going-all-in-its-iconic-hair-dryer-is-now-selling-for-a-new-record-low-on-amazon-2000633160</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dyson-is-going-all-in-its-iconic-hair-dryer-is-now-selling-for-a-new-record-low-on-amazon.1319665/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Hair dryers have existed for decades without meaningful innovation, essentially just blowing hot air at varying intensities until your hair eventually dries. Dyson revolutionized this category by applying aerospace engineering principles to airflow dynamics, and created a dryer that uses intelligent heat control and concentrated air velocity rather than extreme temperatures to dry hair faster.</p>
<p>The <em>Supersonic</em> and its sibling the <em>Airwrap</em> (hair dryer and styler) never see discounts throughout the year, with price drops limited exclusively to Prime Day and Black Friday events. Right now, on the final day of Prime Big Deal Day, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4621/">the Supersonic Origin has hit a record low at $299, down from its standard $419 price</a>. This 29% discount represents the <strong>best pricing Prime members will see</strong> on Dyson’s hair dryer until Black Friday arrives months from now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4621/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tech that Changes the Functionality of Drying the Hair</h2>
<p>The Dyson Supersonic addresses the root issue with ordinary dryers: they use intensive heat to break down the water quickly and damage the cuticles on the hair and causing the brittle and fried quality that results from everyday heat styling. Dyson’s design is focused on the V9 digital motor, a very tiny, very powerful motor found in the handle – not the head. It <strong>rotates at as many as 110,000 rpm and creates high-velocity airflow reaching as high as 13 liters per second</strong>. This focused stream of air works through the exterior layers of the hair down into the interior to dry from the inside out, saving time that the hair is exposed to heat.</p>
<p>The air multiplier technology boosts this flow by <strong>sucking up ambient air into the stream, tripling the initial amount</strong> without the need for increased motor power. This produces a high-pressure and high-velocity stream of air that’s robust enough to instantly dry hair and stable enough to style accurately. It is quite a distinct experience compared to the typical dryers that blow out the hot air everywhere on the surface of your skull.</p>



<p>Intelligent heat control is the biggest technological break-through in the history of healthy-looking hair: A glass bead thermistor is located in the airflow stream and senses the temperature of the air every 40 times per second and reporting back to the microprocessor. Heating element output is varied continuously by the system as needed to hold the desired temperature under very tight tolerances and suppresses the temperature glitches that occur in ordinary dryers when airflow diminishes or ceases.</p>



<p>The magnetic attachments also feature a styling concentrator, producing a narrow, focused blade of air that is ideal for precise styling, such as smoothng out areas when blow-drying or making sleek styles. The diffuser gently disperses airflow all around the curls to dry them without breaking curl patterns or causing frizz. They attach magnetically and spin 360 degrees, angling airflow precisely where you want, without the uncomfortable wrist work needed on dryers with stationary attachments.</p>
<p><strong>Three speed settings and four heat settings</strong> provide flexibility for different hair types and styling needs. The cold shot button delivers unheated air to set styles or cool down after drying. Fast drying mode combines maximum airflow with high heat for thick hair that takes forever to dry, while regular drying balances speed with gentler treatment. Styling mode reduces both airflow and heat for detailed work on specific sections.</p>
<p>For just $299, you’re saving $120 on technology that seriously takes care of the health of your hair and still gives you professional-level drying. Deals like these on Prime Big Deal Day are gone after tonight.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Credit-Card Sized, Our Favorite 10,000mAh 45W Power Bank Is Going for Pennies]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/credit-card-sized-our-favorite-10000mah-45w-power-bank-is-going-for-pennies-2000633165</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/credit-card-sized-our-favorite-10-000mah-45w-power-bank-is-going-for-pennies.1319662/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Running out of battery in the middle of your day is one of those modern frustrations that can derail plans or leave you anxiously watching your phone percentage tick down. A portable charger solves that anxiety but most options are bulky bricks that take up valuable bag space. The <em>INIU</em> 10,000mAh power bank breaks that mold as one of the smallest portable chargers on the market and makes it easy to slip into any pocket or bag compartment. During Amazon’s <strong>Prime Big Deal Days</strong>, this model dropped to $21 on day one, but now on the final day, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3991/">there’s an additional coupon bringing it down to $19, down from the original $29</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3991/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The true innovation is INIU’s TinyCell which is <strong>high-density battery cells that cram 10,000mAh of capability into a package that is just 30% smaller and 15% lighter than rival packages</strong> that deliver the same output. That translates to shouldering serious charging capability without the weight and mass that all too frequently accompanies high-capability power banks.</p>

<h2>Speed That Really Saves Your Day</h2>
<p>The 45W Power Delivery chip on board provides truly fast charging times. INIU can <strong>get an iPhone 17 up to 60% in a mere 25 minutes</strong>, the difference between sitting at home waiting on your phone to charge versus walking out the door with enough power left over to get the rest of your day done. That 45W output also translates to being able to support the <strong>more power-hungry devices like iPads or be able, in a pinch, to charge some laptops</strong>, putting this power bank above the abilities of typical 18W or 20W portable chargers.</p>
<p>The <strong>twin USB-C port design</strong> distinguishes this from virtually all other power banks available. Both the USB-C ports are dual-purpose as you can charge the power bank itself via either one and as a second output charge devices via either one as well. This is convenient when one is dealing with multiple USB-C device and doesn’t need separate cables that have separate uses. With the <strong>addition of the USB-A port</strong>, one ends up with three combined outputs that are able to charge the phone, the earbuds, and the smartwatch all at the same time when one is needed.</p>



<p>That <strong>10,000mAh battery is equivalent to approximately two full charges on most smartphones</strong> or one full charge on the larger phones with some juice left over. For tablets such as iPads, you can expect about 70-80% of a full charge on the model dependent. The size is balanced between being portable and useful, enough to get through prolonged airplane days or multiple days away from outlets without being too much on everyday carry.</p>
<p>INIU arrives with protection like <strong>temperature control, surge protection, and short-circuit protection</strong>, aided by their three-year warranty and lifetime tech support. Included is the USB-C to USB-C cable with lanyard, which makes it easy to clip the power bank on packs or have the power bank easily kept close at hand. At $19 after the coupon, this power bank is less expensive than two movie tickets but solves an issue you face every day.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> has now sold over 5 million copies and the developers at Sandfall Interactive are celebrating that milestone by teasing a free new update for the critically acclaimed RPG. When it arrives, the mini-expansion will add new locations and bosses, giving players fresh targets for their increasingly broken builds.</p> <p>Sandfall hasn’t announced a release date yet for the new<em> Clair Obscur</em> content but confirmed it won’t be paid and should be available to players across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC at the same time.&nbsp;Here’s everything fans can expect from the free update:</p>

 <blockquote> <ul> <li>A new, playable environment, taking the characters of<em>&nbsp;Expedition 33</em>&nbsp;to a brand-new location with new enemy encounters and surprises to discover.</li> <li>Challenging, new boss battles for late-game players to overcome.</li> <li>New costumes for each member of the Expedition, giving even more customization options for players throughout their adventure.</li> <li>New text and UI game localizations into Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai and Indonesian, bringing the total number of supported languages to 19.</li> <li>Plus, even more surprises fans can look forward to.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>“The response to our game has been nothing short of incredible,” creative director Guillaume Broche said in a press release. “We spent years working on our dream project, and to know it has resonated with fans around the world in such a powerful way is both wonderful and overwhelming. We’re so grateful to our fans for their love of the world we created, for sharing their own fan art and music covers, for wearing their best Baguette cosplays to conventions, and for being incredibly supportive of our game. We hope the update we’re working on will act as a ‘thank you’ to those fans for their support–please be patient while our team work hard on bringing you something worth the wait.”</p> <p>On many people’s shortlist for GOTY, <em>Clair Obscur</em> arrived with little fanfare back near the start of 2025 and quickly made waves thanks to its great storytelling and excellent twist on traditional turn-based combat. Sandfall Interactive’s developers have been on a victory tour ever since, including visiting a number of top game companies in Japan <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-clair-obscure-expeidition-33-turn-based-1851786927">like Square Enix</a>. In addition to the update, we already know the team is <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sequel-sandfall-interactive-2000620688">planning to work on a sequel</a>. Now all we need is confirmation that it’ll come to Switch 2 at some point.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Last night on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wordle-jimmy-fallon-game-show-host-nbc-savannah-guthrie-2000632667"><i><span>The Tonight Show</span></i></a><span>, the singing voices of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>performed together for the first time. Ejae, Audrey Nuna, and Rei Ami’s voices have been heard by millions of people in the musical and its soundtrack, but other than a brief cameo on last weekend’s </span><i><span>Saturday Night Live</span></i><span>, we hadn’t heard them perform together outside of the studio. While I would have loved for it to be on a stage that wasn’t in proximity to Jimmy “We don’t know what fascism is on this show” Fallon, hearing the voices of Huntr/x absolutely nail the anthemic “Golden” on stage was delightful. What a victory lap.</span></p> <p><span>The performance was set to footage from the movie, including both of the major scenes in which the group sings “Golden” in the musical. It starts with footage from the music video premiere that debuts the song to the public, and ends with Huntr/x’s performance of the song at the Idol Awards in the film’s third act. Catch me feeling sentimental seeing this performance, as it echoes the movie itself, in which fans had to wait for quite some time to hear Huntr/x perform the song live because of all the demon-hunting drama going on behind the scenes. But also, as many fans point out in the comments, this is the first time Ejae, the voice of lead singer Rumi, has performed live in many years. She has primarily worked behind the scenes in the music industry, and now she’s finally getting to sing her #1 song to an audience of millions.</span></p>   <p><span>Elsewhere in the show, Fallon revealed to the group that the </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>soundtrack has gone platinum, having sold one million copies in the U.S. alone. What a special night, and hopefully there are more to come. It would be great to hear more songs from the movie down the line. I’m crossing my fingers for a performance of “What It Sounds Like” with a choir backing the girls up.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO is one of those brands that pretty much anyone can enjoy. Doesn’t matter if you’re just a kid or a kid at heart in an adult-sized body. Building a LEGO set piece by piece is fun, peaceful, and rewarding all at the same time. Plus at the end, you have some sick Marvel or Star Wars toy to play with or display. The only problem is LEGO can be crazy expensive, and the rare times they do go on sale, it’s not that hefty of a discount or sells out in minutes. We’ve been greeted with a rare exception though thanks to Prime Big Deals Days. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4616/">Amazon has the LEGO Star Wars Ahsoka Ghost and Phantom II spaceships for 30% off. The set is normally priced at $160, but that discount brings it down to just $112</a>. You’ll end up saving a whole $48.</p>
<p>The Ghost is the main spaceship helmed by the heroes of the <em>Star Wars Rebels</em> animated series in the Spectres rebel cell’s long fight against the forced of the Galactic Empire. Later, when Disney announced an Ahsoka series, we all knew that would mean seeing more characters and iconography from the animated Star Wars canon. Sure enough, we got the Ghost in live action. And now, in LEGO.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4616/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>2 LEGO Star Wars Ship</h2>
<p>This 1,394-piece set contains both the modified VCX-100 light freighter known as the Ghost and its auxiliary vessel the Phantom II (first one was destroyed at Reklam Station so it does not come in LEGO form).</p>
<p>The Ghost included two lever-activated spring-loaded shooters, a cockpit with a removable front which can fit two minifigure pilots, two hatches that open up, plus a turret with a hood that can fit a minifigure working the gun.</p>
<p>The Phantom II shuttle also has an opening LEGO minifigure cockpit plus a storage compartment. I can even connect to the Ghost freighter.</p>



<p>The full build measures in at over 4.5 inches high, 13.5 inches long ,and 10.5 inches wide. It’s not ginormous like some of the Death Star or Star Destroyer builds but it’s no Happy Meal toy either.</p>
<p>The build becomes easier when using the LEGO Builder app. You can view each step with a 3D digital version to see all those weird angles that don’t print well in the instruction booklet, allowing you to zoom in and rotate the model around. You can even save your progress if you need to walk away from your build partway through.</p>
