The studios involved also explained that this new game will feature the familiar classes and vehicles, used in destructible maps—all hallmarks of the series. And this next <em>Battlefield </em>game, which remains unnamed and doesn’t have a release date, will include a single-player campaign, too.</p><p>The other big news announced today is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Battlefield Labs</a></span>. This program, which players can sign up for now, will let select users join in on early, pre-alpha gameplay tests. </p><p>While this might sound similar to a typical beta test—something EA has done before—the studios involved in this next <em>Battlefield</em> game indicated that Battlefield Labs is different. Players are going to be given more content than before, at an earlier state in development than usual, and will help provide feedback on what’s working and what’s not working. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/faq#:~:text=BATTLEFIELD%20LABS%20%26%20BATTLEFIELD%20STUDIOS%20FAQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/faq#:~:text=BATTLEFIELD%20LABS%20%26%20BATTLEFIELD%20STUDIOS%20FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s how EA describes Labs in a FAQ</a></span> found on the franchise’s website: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>[BF Labs] space for play and exploration; an environment where we can test concepts and mechanics with our players before we release them publicly. Our community is at the heart of <em>Battlefield</em>; their feedback is crucial in helping us know what to prioritize, what to improve and what feels like an authentic <em>Battlefield </em>experience.</p></blockquote><p>It will be interesting to see how BF Labs impacts the development of the game and also how much of the content from the tests leaks online for everyone to see. </p><p>EA is certainly investing a lot of money and resources into getting <em>Battlefield</em> back on track after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-bf2042-season-7-last-ea-motive-future-1851397390&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-bf2042-season-7-last-ea-motive-future-1851397390"><em>2042 </em>and <em>BFV</em></a></span><em> </em>weren’t <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/one-year-later-battlefield-v-still-cant-please-fans-1840664898&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/one-year-later-battlefield-v-still-cant-please-fans-1840664898">huge hits with the community</a></span>. The return to modern-day combat and classic class-based multiplayer sounds promising, and the idea of bringing in player feedback early could help steer the teams in the right direction. For now, we have to wait and see how it all shakes out. </p><p>EA has not revealed a release window or official name for the next game. BF Labs’ FAQ indicates the next game will only available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
