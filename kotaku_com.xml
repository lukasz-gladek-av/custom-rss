On December 25, however, they returned to X (formerly know as Twitter) to do exactly that. “This holiday season, I couldn’t resist sharing this gift with you all,” they <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NextHandheld/status/1871936689721209331&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NextHandheld/status/1871936689721209331" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a></span>. “Some might call it an early reveal… but I call it the best-kept secret of the year.” The message was accompanied by a photo showing a hand holding an alleged Switch 2 sideways in what looked like a hardware testing workroom. </p><p>The ravenous Switch 2 leak community immediately honed in on weird artifacting and mismatching in the image to accuse it of being an AI-generated fake. NextHandheld later followed up with a second post sharing an alleged image of the Switch 2 dock, cheekily writing, “It’s all just AI generated.” There were once again weird anomalies in the background and the outline of the console. Looking more closely at the images shared, believers speculated that the breaks were too clean to be AI-generated and instead indicated that, likely to protect their identity and the location where the photos were taken, NextHandheld had simply used AI to replace everything in the images <em>but</em> the hardware itself.</p><p>One user on the Switch 2 subreddit, DoctorHoneywell, compared various contours and dimensions from a previous alleged Joy-Con leak and found the photos from NextHandheld were a very close match, possibly indicating that both were in fact from a production unit approximating the final build design and shape. “It could be a really high quality resin 3D print with a well done finish, and then custom stickers on it. It could be really good photoshop job over an AI image,” DoctorHoneywell concluded. “But that would mean that I was still right with what I have said every single time I’ve been asked about this before they came out: It’s either real, or a high quality fake.”</p><p>The debate waged throughout Christmas Day, and NextHandheld’s own poll shared on X had 60 percent of roughly 4,000 respondents believing the leaks were legit and the rest thinking they were elaborate fakes. The mysterious leaker is also promising to reveal new details in the days ahead. Other once-prominent Nintendo leakers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-leaks-youtube-pyoro-switch-2-1851563772?_gl=1*1ff5vse*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNTI0MTk1MS4xODEuMS4xNzM1MjQ2NDA2LjM4LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-leaks-youtube-pyoro-switch-2-1851563772?_gl=1*1ff5vse*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNTI0MTk1MS4xODEuMS4xNzM1MjQ2NDA2LjM4LjAuMA..">like Pyoro, who previously confessed</a></span> to having a source with access to Nintendo’s website backend, have also tried to get in on the action, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hirp76/necrolipe_reportedly_says_that_pyoro_liked_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hirp76/necrolipe_reportedly_says_that_pyoro_liked_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but without sharing anything definitive</a></span>. For some, the entire thing is reminiscent of the notorious 2018 “Grinch leak” about <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>’s roster. That one turned out to be a carefully crafted scam. Is NextHandheld pulling a similar trick?</p><p>The stakes around these leaks remain quite low. Unless everything that has so far trickled out has been completely made-up and off-base, all available rumors and reporting point to Nintendo’s next console likely being pretty similar to the existing Switch, just with upgraded specs. Every time it feels like speculation around the Switch 2 might be dying down again, a new data point arises for fans to argue about, and it seems likely that will keep happening until Nintendo finally reveals official information. The company’s promised to do so by April 2025, and the time for its big traditional February Direct is quickly approaching.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The narrative-focused RPG chronicling the struggle of misfit adventurers on a quest to save the world held my attention like little else. Its slow-burn story told through text boxes on pre-rendered backgrounds, all backed by a soaring melodic score, was unlike any piece of media I encountered before. Before the decade was up, <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em> arrived and delivered more of the same for me. In the early 2000s, however, <em>Final Fantasy </em>changed, and I thought I’d never experience <em>that</em> kind of game for the first time again. That is, until I fired up <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em> and was instantly transported back to the late ‘90s. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,195905,196805" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-ff7-review-1997-worth-playing-1851411735&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-ff7-review-1997-worth-playing-1851411735"><em>Final Fantasy VII: </em>The <em>Kotaku</em> Retro Review</a></span></p><p>And if you’re like me and have been craving those original PlayStation <em>Final Fantasy</em> vibes, then you absolutely need to give <em>Fantasian</em> a spin.</p><figure id="" data-id="e38418917088e72b365c642dec8a38ad" data-recommend-id="image://e38418917088e72b365c642dec8a38ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leo stands on the bridge of a ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Leo stands on the bridge of a ship." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mistwalker / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e38418917088e72b365c642dec8a38ad" data-recommend-id="image://e38418917088e72b365c642dec8a38ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leo stands on the bridge of a ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re only now hearing about <em>Fantasian</em>, there’s probably a good reason for that. Developed by Mistwalker and produced by the father of <em>Final Fantasy</em>, Hironobu Sakaguchi, <em>Fantasian</em> was originally locked behind Apple Arcade’s iOS and Mac ecosystem when it launched in April of 2021. Like <em>Final Fantasy </em>titles of the late ‘90s on the original PlayStation, it features a fixed camera perspective and 3D character models animated over pre-made backgrounds. It also features a soundtrack written by legendary <em>Final Fantasy</em> composer Nobuo Uematsu. Three years after its initial release, <em>Fantasian </em>arrives on modern consoles and PC via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-fantasian-neo-dimension-1851712603?rev=1735243042840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-fantasian-neo-dimension-1851712603?rev=1735243042840"><em>Neo Dimension</em></a></span>, an updated version with spruced-up graphics, difficulty adjustments, some tweaks to the gameplay to adapt its mobile origins, and voice acting. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-fantasian-neo-dimension-1851712603?rev=1735243042840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-long-is-fantasian-neo-dimension-1851712603?rev=1735243042840">How Long Is <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em>?</a></span></p><p>While <em>Fantasian</em> is a video game produced in the 21st century for mobile platforms, it is eerily capable of transporting you back to the simpler times of <em>Final Fantasy 7</em>, <em>8</em>, and <em>9</em>. This is especially the case if you mute the new voice acting and just let the text boxes do the dialogue and exposition for you (which, with all due respect to the voice talent that went into bringing the characters to life, I think is the better way to play <em>Fantasian</em>).</p><figure id="" data-id="7a75d88f3226fb23313ada3bd7643ee2" data-recommend-id="image://7a75d88f3226fb23313ada3bd7643ee2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leo, Kina, and Cheryl battle a Mechteria monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Leo, Kina, and Cheryl battle a Mechteria monster." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mistwalker / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7a75d88f3226fb23313ada3bd7643ee2" data-recommend-id="image://7a75d88f3226fb23313ada3bd7643ee2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leo, Kina, and Cheryl battle a Mechteria monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Unlike <em>FF</em> titles of the late ‘90s, however, the backgrounds in <em>Fantasian </em>weren’t created with computer graphics, but instead were produced with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1h46qqt/fantasian_neo_dimension_handmade_diorama/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1h46qqt/fantasian_neo_dimension_handmade_diorama/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">actual physical dioramas</a></span> that were photographed from multiple angles. Though it gives a distinct, and <em>gorgeous</em>, look to <em>Fantasian</em>, the experience in motion is very similar to old-school <em>FF </em>titles. <em>FF7 </em>in particular always had a hand-crafted look to its backgrounds that contributed to its charm. The world feels intentional, with an eye toward making it feel like a memorable place, inspirationally crafted to transport you to a fantasy realm. Toss in some turn-based combat, random encounters, and a hybrid fantasy/science-fiction narrative about an amnesiac protagonist and, well, if you were a <em>Final Fantasy</em> fan in the late ‘90s, this should all sound very familiar. And speaking of sound, oh boy, will <em>Fantasian</em> <em>sound</em> familiar. Just listen to this battle theme:</p><p>And compare it to the melodies in this classic <em>FF</em> jam:</p><p>The soundtrack is filled with moments like this, stirring up our memories of the epic adventures of yesteryear through melodies and motifs that sound familiar to ‘90s-era <em>Final Fantasy</em> tunes or just through Uematsu’s signature melodic and compositional styles. It’s some of his finest work. </p><p>As someone who always felt that a certain charm was lost when <em>Final Fantasy</em> started changing its overall structure in the early 2000s with <em>Final Fantasy X</em>, <em>Fantasian</em> has successfully filled several late evenings for me with a kind of wild neo-nostalgia that I’ve always wanted to experience, but have never expected from modern games. In its presentation and narrative, <em>Fantasian</em> literally feels like a hidden PSX <em>FF</em> title. </p><figure id="" data-id="2f3bdede555862b6f4b11c6a06fe5742" data-recommend-id="image://2f3bdede555862b6f4b11c6a06fe5742" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cheryl stands in the wreckage of the Machine Realm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cheryl stands in the wreckage of the Machine Realm." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mistwalker / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2f3bdede555862b6f4b11c6a06fe5742" data-recommend-id="image://2f3bdede555862b6f4b11c6a06fe5742" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cheryl stands in the wreckage of the Machine Realm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are a few rough edges here and there, and you can sense the mobile origins of the game from time to time via the UI and the fact that the combat wants you to line up targets in a row in a way that would probably feel more natural on a touch screen. And while the story is perfectly entertaining, it’s not hitting the way <em>FF7</em>’s or <em>FF8</em>’s does. (Then again, it also has to compete with the two decades of nostalgia I’ve built up for Cloud and Squall’s tales.)</p><p>But really, those rough spots matter very little as the game nails the overall pacing and tone of storytelling and dialogue that brought late-‘90s <em>Final Fantasy</em> titles to life. I’ve yet to hit the game’s infamous “Part Two,” which I’ve heard comes with a wild difficulty spike (and I’m playing on “Hard” difficulty), but I’ve been spending evenings grinding out my characters in preparation for that…which, honestly, is what I used to do in <em>Final Fantasy 7</em> anyway.</p><figure id="" data-id="b7a280c56f0fc8ca005720f3061b2dd3" data-recommend-id="image://b7a280c56f0fc8ca005720f3061b2dd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leo stands in a town in the mountains." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Leo stands in a town in the mountains." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mistwalker / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b7a280c56f0fc8ca005720f3061b2dd3" data-recommend-id="image://b7a280c56f0fc8ca005720f3061b2dd3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leo stands in a town in the mountains." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Fantasian</em> is shaping up to be one of my favorite games of 2024, even though it’s a psuedo-remaster of a 2021 title. It is the kind of game I’ve been aching to play for nearly 25 years. If you’ve been glancing at screenshots since the game’s original release a few years ago, admiring the dioramas and wondering if it could cast the same spell as those late ‘90s PSX <em>Final Fantasy</em> titles, then wonder no more and give <em>Neo Dimension</em> a try.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
