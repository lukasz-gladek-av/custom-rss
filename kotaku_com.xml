              <p>As much as we all like to joke that “the PS5 has no games,” that’s simply not true. Mine has plenty of PS4 games on it! Ba-dum-tiss. Anyway, there are some awesome PlayStation 5 exclusives. The amazing and cute platformer <em>Astro Bot </em>won Game of the Year last year. <em>Ghost of Yōtei </em>is dropping in under a week. Plus people are still sleeping on 2021’s incredible third-person shooter roguelike <em>Returnal</em>. And then yes of course there really are a bunch of good PS4 games to check if you missed them last generation. A lot of them have great-looking updates too like everything going on with <em>The Last of Us </em>remakes and remasters. Point is there are lots of good games to play, but do you have enough storage space for all of them?</p>
<p>Expand you PS5 storage with the help of Seagate’s officially-licensed game drive for PlayStation consoles. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4328/">This external hard drive connect to your system over USB 3.2 and will&nbsp; let you boost your capacity to store games by a full 2TB</a>. Right now, Amazon has the drive discounted down from $90 to just $80. A $10 savings may not sound like much, but that’s already halfway to getting you <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4328/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The PS5 base model only comes with 800GB of internal space (1TB on the Slim), and some of that isn’t even usable to you as it’s got all the system stuff on it that makes the console work. Really you’re working with roughly. The base model really has about 667GB while the Slim has a bout 842.2GB for you to work with, saving your games. This Seagate drive will more than triple your ability to store your game data. nor more deleting and redownloading.</p>



<h2>One Small Caveat</h2>
<p>There is a catch though. You can’t actually&nbsp;<em>play</em> you games off this external drive. The PS5 requires much faster read/write speeds than this supports. You might be thinking, “Okay, then what the heck is the point?” Well, this drive is still helpful because you can move you games from it to your internal drive when you want to play them. This is a much, much faster process than redownloading a game over the internet. Think of it like the digital version of taking your disc off the shelf and popping it into your console. The good news is you can play your PS4 games directly off of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4328/">Unlike the internal SSDs available to expand your PS5 storage, this drive requires no tools to install as it just connects over USB.</a> That makes it totally portable so you can bring it over to a friend’s house and fire it up on their PS5 if you wish. Have your whole gaming library on the go.</p>

              <p>Will<em> Resident Evil 9</em> struggle on Switch 2? Is the new <em>Borderlands 4</em> patch really broken or do players just need to be better at compiling their shaders? And where the hell is the next <em>Metal Gear Solid Master Collection</em>? Welcome to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. While all the big gaming showcases have wrapped up, there are still a few more days of Tokyo Game Show proper until the last big gaming festival of the year wraps up. Then it’s on to the fall’s next batch of big game releases. Yes, I’m talking about you <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>.</p> <h2>PlayStation boss touts PS5 as Sony’s most lucrative gaming box yet</h2> <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hideaki Nishino was the keynote speaker at Tokyo Game Show 2025 and his topic was the PlayStation Store. Covering its evolution and current financial dominance, he flashed a chart showing how revenues have kept climbing with each new console. What’s interesting is that this is happening despite PS5 sales tracking only slightly ahead of the PS4. So where is the growth coming from? In part its the explosion in microtransactions in free-to-play games like <em>Fortnite</em>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nishino-san says PlayStation 5 is the most successful generation in PlayStation history. <a href="https://t.co/E5feupYHGr">pic.twitter.com/E5feupYHGr</a></p> <p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1971034274536272100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s also the expansion of subscription services like PS Plus. And then there’s the fact that people are still playing on PS4, so even though the install bases are similar, the overall footprint of active PlayStation players spending money is seemingly larger. Plus the consoles keep getting more expensive. With graphs like this, did Sony really need to raise the price of the PS5 another $50 nearly five years after it launched? Either way, it’s an interesting data point amid debates about console makers going platform-agnostic. Will PS6 just be a PC with a PlayStation logo on it, or is Sony, like Nintendo, married to the hardware business long-term?</p>

 <h2><em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> dev’s next 2D action game is out in November</h2>  <p><em>Possessor(s)</em> is Heart Machine’s first stab at the Metroidvania formula and arrives the same year its loot shooter, <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>, entered Early Access. There’s a new trailer showing off more of the game about a high school student who forms a pact with a demon to uncover the mystery behind a catastrophe that’s befallen Sanzu city. It’s out on PS5 and PC on November 11.</p>

 <h2>One of the last significant updates for <em>The Witcher 3</em> has been delayed</h2> <p>CD Projekt Red’s fantasy RPG was supposed to get cross-platform mod support across PC and consoles before the end of the year. The update will <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thewitcher.com/post/3lzochplzqc2h">now arrive in 2026</a>, but with no clear window for when players can expect it. Once it finally arrives, PS5 and Xbox Series X players will finally get to experience all of the extra fan-made content modders created for the PC version.</p>

 <h2>Gearbox has some advice if <em>Borderlands 4</em> is running poorly for you <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-fov-slider-consoles-ps5-update-pc-crashing-patch-performance-2000628823">after the latest patch</a></h2> <p>The studio <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1971285941194195311">blames some initial reports</a> of even worse performance following the new update on shader compilation. Basically, the game has to recompile all of the shaders again, which can mess things up while running in the background. “Stuttering issues should resolve over time as the shaders continue to compile in the background while playing,” the studio wrote on X. “If you’re still experiencing issues after 15 minutes of continuous play, you can also clear your shader cache via your video card manufacturer’s approved method.”</p>

 <p>One fan offered <a href="https://x.com/Ki11ersix/status/1971286391964434615">their own tip</a>: “quit the game once after launching and relaunch it. Now travel into a zone and back out (Idolator Sol’s or a Vault will work) this should compile a BUNCH of shaders and start improving the smoothness.” Big-budget gaming in 2025 folks!</p>

 <h2><em>Resident Evil 9</em> looks pretty decent in first Switch 2 hands-ons</h2>  <p><em>Requiem</em> is the first game in the survival horror series to come day-and-date to a Nintendo platform. Early impressions seem to be that while the game looks and runs best on PC and high-end consoles, the Switch 2 version still performs admirably, especially in hand-held mode. So far both <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> have both been better than expected on Nintendo’s new console. Hopefully other third-party ports can continue the trend.</p> <h2>A <em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em> remaster will arrive eventually</h2> <p>Fans waiting for news on the status of the <em>Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 2</em> got an update via a panel at Tokyo Game Show. According to <a href="https://x.com/Kuwabara357/status/1971126048017322123">a translation by X user Kuwabara357</a><span>, it will still take a little longer for the next batch of games to get ported. “The project is moving forward properly, and we believe it’s shaping up to be something enjoyable really,” Konami producer Noriaki Okamura reportedly said. “So please wait just a bit more, more information is coming.”</span></p> <h2><em>Payday 2</em> dev apologizes for price-gouging fans</h2> <p>The<em> Payday 2</em> Infamous Collection bundle, which contains every piece of DLC the multiplayer heist shooter has ever received, recently jumped in price from $118 to $170. Starbreeze also announced a new $5-a-month subscription option for players to access all of it. Fans obviously thought the timing of this was a bit cynical.</p> <p>“The community has been pretty clear about how it looks next to the subscription launch—and they’re not wrong, it’s terrible timing,” Starbreeze’s Gustav Nisser <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/starbreeze-says-sorry-reverses-price-increase-on-payday-2-dlc-bundle-we-definitely-didnt-handle-this-right/">told <em>PC Gamer</em></a>. “We definitely didn’t handle this right, and we’ll be apologizing to the community. Hopefully there will be at least some acceptance that this was an honest mistake.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/bowser-leaves-nintendo-of-america-2000628868">Nintendo is shaking things up at Nintendo of America with the retirement of Bowser</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-israel-palestine-gaza-phone-calls-xbox-cloud-2000628764">Microsoft has taken the first step toward addressing the Xbox BDS boycott over Israel</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-biggest-map-japan-open-world-size-comparison-2026-ps5-xbox-2000628855"><em>Forza Horizon 6</em>‘s open world take on Japan will be the game’s biggest map yet</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-4-8-star-kingston-ssd-in-all-capacities-at-record-low-cheaper-than-samsung-or-crucial-2000628887</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lots of awesome games came out this year from <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> to <em>Blue Prince</em> to <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. <em>Silent Hill f</em> and <em>Borderlands 4</em> just dropped along with the 1.0 release of <em>Hades 2</em>. If you want to play all of these plus all the other cool stuff that came out in 2025&nbsp;<em>and</em> hang onto all of your other games, you may want to expand your storage. Over the past decade or longer, game file sizes have really started to balloon larger and larger. Some titles even clock in over 100GB. So get yourself a solid internal SSD like the Kingston NV3 drive. It’s available in sizes up to 4TB and is currently on sale.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4323/">Breaking down the different models and discounts, let’s start with the smallest. Kingston has 500GB option for its Gen 4×4 SSD</a>. That one normally goes for $54, but it’s now down to just $39 — saving you $15. Going up, we have the 1TB model. That’s usually $80, but the sale has it to just $58 — a savings of $22. The 2TB is $43 off, bringing it from&nbsp; $158 to just $115. Then lastly we have the massive 4TB model going for $230. That’s a $91 discount off of the starting price of $320. All discounts work out to between 27-28%.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4323/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast Load Times</h2>
<p>The Kingston NV3 SSD has remarkable read and write speeds, coming in at up to 6,000 MB/s for read speeds and up to 5,000 MB/s for write speeds. That means quick load times in all your games. Hope you’re good at them because you’ll have hardly any time to read those quick tips that appear while waiting for levels to load. Those speeds will also help with plenty of non-gaming tasks ranging from video editing to working with large datasets — really any kind of hardware intensive workflow.</p>
<p>Check the specs of what you’re looking to install it on. So long as your laptop, tower, or mini PC has support for PCle 4.0, you’ll be good to go.</p>



<p>If you’re not a PC gamer and are instead looking to expand to storage of your PlayStation 5, it is compatible but with a catch. You will have to separately pick up a heatsink. These little metal casings are used to help dissipate heat to prevent overheating. They’re pretty easy to install into your PS5. You can just follow any number of video tutorials on YouTube.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4323/">For a limited time, you can save up to $91 on this internal SSD from Kingston</a>. Choose between four different capacities, starting at just $39.</p>

              <p>How could a game with a name as fluffy as&nbsp;<em>PuffPals: Island Skies</em> ever do anything wrong? How could a company called Fluffnest be anything other than the cuddliest love-bunnies on the internet? It’s too implausible to even consider. Except… Launched on Kickstarter in April 2022, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies"><em>PuffPals: Island Skies</em></a> promised to bring the experience of a game like&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>to the PC, with the very modest goal of just $75,000. But people were excited, the project got a lot of buzz, and in the end it raised an incredible $2.6 million (kinda). Today, the website for the game is gone, backer refund requests are being ignored, and multiple lawsuits against the company behind the project have been lodged.</p> <p>Two people, David Pentland and artist usLily, started Fluffnest—also via Kickstarter—in 2020. As superbly documented by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZjvRwjxacY">Mujin on YouTube</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/puffpals-island-skies-a-cosy-game-that-earned-usd2-5-million-on-kickstarter-has-been-slammed-with-refund-requests-after-its-website-and-online-store-disappeared/"><em>PCG</em></a>), it became an instant success, creating gorgeous plushies that developed a large fanbase, with hundreds of thousands of followers on social media, and a drop-based store that meant each plush was only available for a limited time. In 2022, the pair began the project to create a game set in the world of their plushies, an <em>Animal Crossing</em>-like cozy game with all the fishing, farming and friendship that cozy gamers crave.</p>  <p>That $75,000 figure may seem like a warning sign from the start. It’s not enough to develop the loading screens, let alone a game. But over the years, that’s kinda how Kickstarter’s become. Projects don’t receive any funds at all if their target isn’t met, so if you put your actual forecast costs, say $5 million, as the target, you’ll almost definitely not raise and it not get a penny. So developers come in very low, ensuring that they get <em>something</em>, with stretch goals in place to encourage more pledges that could actually deliver the game. And that’s obviously a disastrous model, meaning games that need $5m might raise $100,000 and then clearly be unable to deliver, resulting in abandoned projects and furious backers. It happens all the time.</p>

 <p>But in the case of&nbsp;<em>PuffPals</em>, it seemed to work. $75,000 became $2.56 million, more than double their top stretch goal figure. As Mujin reveals, however, a lot of that figure was extremely fudged: You could back the project for $20 to get the game on release, but afterward there were “add-ons,” where you could pay another $40 or so to get a plush toy too, and those plushies were ones that had sold out and were highly sought after by collectors. The money still counted toward the Kickstarter total, but a significant portion of it was going toward the toy and its shipping. Which is to say, that $2.6m figure did not remotely reflect what they actually had to spend on the game.</p>

 <p>The project then began to follow the failing Kickstarter playbook to the letter. Updates started to slow down, promises would be forgotten or explained away, and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies/posts/4309530">wild excuses would be given for why communication had been bad</a>, all always accompanied by <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies/posts/4324878">new promises that all these things would improve</a>. You’ll always get the six-month silence, followed by the “<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies/posts/4163760">Sorry we’ve been so quiet, we’ve been working so hard!</a>” update accompanied by scant few gifs and a bunch of concept art to “prove” it. And then, of course, a promised alpha build will get <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies/posts/4335798">delayed</a> and <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies/posts/4364462">delayed</a>, each missed milestone accompanied by an excuse that contradicts the last. Next you get the heartfelt apologies and promises to improve communication, along with a boast that the build is just moments away, before another stretch of silence ending in claims that the build, due years before, is “on track.” It’s all so painfully common.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000629156" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000629156"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000629156">© Kickstarter / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But the&nbsp;<em>PuffPals</em> debacle took it all to a new level, by seemingly not only messing their Kickstarter backers around, but customers of their main business too.&nbsp;During the waits, Reddit sleuths spotted that <em>PuffPals </em>trademarks had expired a year ago, and that the game was seemingly being entirely created by outsourcing company Room 8, while the plushies side of the business started having its own major troubles, with customers not receiving shipments, claiming they had been overcharged, and delivery prices being almost tripled. It then became apparent the company was being sued for failure to pay back business loans.</p>

 <p>Then things got even worse. Fluffnest was going out of business. Blaming rising shipping costs, the company declared it was coming to an end. And yet even here, in this statement, it said, “<em>Island Skies</em> production is secured and will not be affected.” Which, given it hadn’t given any substantial proof of life in years, and it had already been revealed that the entire game was being created by outsourced companies, was quite the claim.</p>

 <p>The <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/fluffnest/puffpals-island-skies/posts/4390672">last update on <em>PuffPals</em> appeared on May 21 this year</a>, and it was an extraordinary screed of excuses and blame laid at the feet of the company they’d paid (and then not paid) to develop the game. And, of course, every word of it contradicts the promises made in previous posts, even as recently as a month earlier.</p> <p>Today, the game’s pre-order page is an&nbsp;<a href="https://expireddomains.com/domain/fluffnest.games"><em>Expired Domains</em> landing page</a>, the Kickstarter has been abandoned for four months, and people who worked on the game have reported going unpaid. And obviously no one is getting refunds—but it’s important to remember that Kickstarter backing doesn’t guarantee a delivered project, so that’s always murky ground.</p> <p>Various lawsuits reported by Mujin show judgments being made against Fluffnest, ordering the company to repay owed money totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars. Meanwhile, the company hired to actually make the game, Room 8, is now suing Fluffnest and David Pentland for $1.9 million.</p> <p>While the various litigations drag through the courts, it’s impossible to know how a super-cute cozy game became such a multi-million dollar disaster. Was this begun in good faith, before collapsing around their ears? Was it a deliberate scam? Was Alpha 2 ever actually a thing that existed? We don’t know, and given court dates stretch as far away as summer 2027, we likely won’t know for a very long time. Either way, it’s astonishingly unlikely anyone will get any of their money back, whether a backer or a developer hired on the project, or even a bank providing one of the many loans. Meanwhile, people will just have to play one of the other 72,482 cozy village life games on PC instead.</p>
