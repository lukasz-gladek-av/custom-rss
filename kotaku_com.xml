Bleh. </p><p>The latest entry in the long-running golfing series was announced a few weeks back at Sony’s most recent PlayStation State of Play and is coming to PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC on September 4 with a mix of single-player and multiplayer modes. It was a nice surprise for fans of the series, some of whom have been with the series since its PS1 debut. 2005's <em>Everybody’s Golf Portable</em> for the PSP holds a special place in some fans’ hearts. </p><p>Watching the new overview trailer, there are no obvious signs of generative AI in the backgrounds.

She also finds a quirky yet brilliant sidekick to sheepishly help her optimize her Ironheart suit, with an interesting twist. After meeting McGillicuddy (Alden Ehrenreich) and visiting his shady bunker full of black market weapons, Riri gets him to confess that his name is actually Ezekiel Stane. And he has a Ziploc bag full of the ashes of Obadiah Stane—his father!</p><p>Those who have been MCU fans since it began with the first <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mcu-raza-return-wandavision-iron-man-vision-spin-off-tv-1851740404&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mcu-raza-return-wandavision-iron-man-vision-spin-off-tv-1851740404"><em>Iron Man</em> movie</a></span> in 2008 will remember Obadiah (Jeff Bridges) as the ruthless Stark Industries executive who orchestrated Tony’s kidnapping in Afghanistan and horrifyingly pulled the arc reactor out of the Stark Industries founder’s chest. In the show, Ezekiel says he is 36 years old, which would make him roughly 17 when his father was killed by Iron Man. That’s still young enough for him to have developed the sort of trauma that’ll turn someone into the type to hoard weapons of mass destruction as a “hobby.”</p><p>Interestingly enough, Ezekiel tells Riri that he and his father weren’t close (hence the Ziploc bag urn) and references his father’s nefarious Iron Monger alter ego. However, in <em>Iron Man</em>, it’s never publicly revealed that Obadiah was the Iron Monger, which could suggest Ezekiel either had intimate knowledge of his father’s crimes from being involved, or that he was told about them later in life. Either way, <em>Ironheart </em>adds a cool expansion to the MCU history books—without making that the central appeal of an already great show. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ironheart-iron-man-obidiah-stane-ezekiel-stane-disney-1851785091]]></content:encoded>
