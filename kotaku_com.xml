Players step into the space boots of disposable cybernetic bodies called Runners to explore the harsh and mysterious planet of Tau Ceti IV. Outside of it being a PvP extraction shooter (think <em>Escape From Tarkov</em>) with loot and character classes, little else is known about the the next big PS5 live-service game (it’ll be on Xbox Series X/S and PC as well). </p><p>According to a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/is-marathon-an-extraction-shooter-gameplay-details-explained/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-marathon-an-extraction-shooter-gameplay-details-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous report</a></span> by <em>Insider Gaming</em>, Bungie is aiming for near breakneck matchmaking times with<em> Marathon</em> so that players spend as little time waiting around in lobbies a possible. And a key source of tension in matches will apparently arise from limited oxygen supplies which dwindle more quickly as players take damage. It could be a neat mix alongside Bungie’s best-in-class gunplay feel, but a lot will come down to whether <em>Marathon</em>’s world building, gameplay, and player progression can match the intrigue and hype of its eye-catching art. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Bloomberg </em>reported</a></span> last year that former <em>Marathon</em> director and long-time Bungie veteran Chris Barratt had been fired over creepy texts he sent female colleagues (he claims it was because Sony didn’t want to pay him massive stock bonuses and is currently suing, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bungie-ex-marathon-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-texts-1851765546&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-ex-marathon-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-texts-1851765546">but the text messages speak for themselves</a></span>).

Incredibly accurate with no trajectory alterations, even over very long distances. Headshots are your friend, and they’ll help you rack up tons of KOs.</li><li><strong>Goddess of Death (Ultimate):</strong> Only usable in larger areas, this super causes Hela to grow large and take to the sky, throwing directed Nastrond crows that explode to cause heavy damage. The volley can be blocked by shields (including Dr. Strange’s shield, which he can fly up to block with) but deals tons of damage and gives Hela the perfect vantage point to pick off healers and vulnerable DPS characters.</li><li><strong>Piercing Night: </strong>A volley of five exploding daggers that move as projectiles. Much slower than Nightsword Thorns, the Piercing Night also explodes shortly after sticking in a target, dealing extra damage. They explode even if they hit the floor or other surfaces, but the explosion is small, so practice leading targets with this until you can reliably hit them.</li><li><strong>Soul Drainer:</strong> Throw an orb which stuns enemies in a small area, pulling them closer together. Great to use to set up allies for group knockouts.</li><li><strong>Astral Flock: </strong>Hela’s repositioning tool. Transform into a crow and fly in a straight line in the direction you are looking. Cannot be steered after she transforms, so be sure to aim carefully. Haphazard use of this skill will get you killed. It’s best used to fly to the top of buildings and other out:of:reach places to snipe enemies from.</li><li><strong>Nastrond Crowstorm (Passive):</strong> Defeated enemies spawn a crow which explodes shortly after the knockout.</li><li><strong>Hel’s Descent (Passive):</strong> Hold the jump button to fall through the air more slowly. Allows minor repositioning and works well in conjunction with an Astral Flock aimed upwards.</li><li><strong>Queen of Hel (Team-Up Ability): </strong>Teaming up with Thor and Loki unlocks Hela’s power over death, letting her instantly resurrect the Asgardian brothers when she delivers the final blow to an enemy while they are respawning. If they are still alive, they still benefit, getting Bonus Health.</li></ul><hr><p>With this info, you are fully prepared to become the Goddess of Death we always knew you were.
