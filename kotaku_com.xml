              <p>Asymmetric mercenary leaderboards? Co-op heists? A full-blown<em> GTA Online</em>-style live-service component? The multiplayer possibilities for <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2-release-date-witcher-4-rpg-cdpr-1851782750">a <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> sequel</a> are easy to imagine, even if they’re hard to implement. A new job posting at CD Projekt Red suggests the studio is at least flirting with some sort of online component for its next sci-fi open-world RPG. It’s a small and noncommittal data point that’s nevertheless part of a larger trend.</p> <p>“Lead your team to develop and optimize multiplayer systems, including matchmaking, and address challenges related to latency, bandwidth usage, and server performance,” reads <a href="https://www.cdprojektred.com/en/jobs/20217-lead-network-engineer">part of the job description</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-looks-set-to-include-multiplayer-years-after-cyberpunk-2077-online-mode-scrapped">first spotted by <em>IGN,</em></a>&nbsp;for a new engineering role at CDPR’s Boston-based satellite studio leading development on <em>Cyberpunk 2</em>. That ambition gestures toward plans the studio originally had for adding multiplayer to the first game. Plans for that content were later set aside or abandoned as CDPR rushed to prioritize the stability and long-term viability of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> after a disastrous 2020 launch.</p> <p>Will history repeat itself, or is multiplayer coming to the world of <em>Cyberpunk </em>for real this time? With the big-budget blockbuster still in pre-production as CDPR focuses on <em>The Witcher 4</em>, it’s impossible to say. But it’s clear the Poland-based company has been looking to experiment with multiplayer for some time now. CDPR told investors it was looking to bring “online gameplay” to more of its franchises in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIAiGI-v6Y8">strategy briefing</a> four years ago, and co-CEO Michał Nowakowski <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-orion-multiplayer-1851190429#:~:text=Kotaku%20reached%20out%20to%20CDPR%20for%20comment.&amp;text=Badowski%20and%20Nowakowski's%20comments%20on,works%20that%20we%20know%20of.">told<em> Reuters</em> last year</a> the team was “considering” bringing multiplayer to the next <em>Cyberpunk</em>.</p>

 <p>CDPR has also already confirmed at least one multiplayer project: a <em>Witcher</em> spin-off codenamed <em>Project</em> <em>Sirius</em>. That game has been in prolonged development at what used to be called The Molasses Flood, with layoffs, departures, and design pivots reportedly all taking their toll. The studio was officially absorbed into the rest of CDPR earlier this year. “Overall, it shows a very bright future for Project Sirius (aka ‘the multiplayer Witcher game,’ of which I was the Design Director for three years),” Molasses Flood co-founder Damian Isla wrote upon leaving <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/damian-isla-815a46_well-its-the-end-of-an-era-tucked-away-activity-7315404560620044288-Qazy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAoO_OkB-VfPR7dhiZ-PZ-9sf_EfWliEy1k">back in March</a>. “It’s going to be an amazing game, one for the books, and I cannot wait until the rest of the world learns about what we’ve been working on.”</p> <p>One does not simply pivot to making an online multiplayer game any more than one simply walks into Mordor. CDPR’s own struggles with going from the third-person perspective of <em>Witcher 3</em> to the first-person<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> speak to the tech and design difficulties inherent in taking on new development challenges. But it would be cool to see what CDPR can achieve if it takes that next leap. It ultimately worked out in the end for the studio’s last game, even if it took an extra three years after it came out.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-iphone-gimbal-costs-peanuts-amazon-is-clearing-out-djis-budget-model-2000627191</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-iphone-gimbal-costs-peanuts-amazon-is-clearing-out-dji%E2%80%99s-budget-model.1302918/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Smartphones are incredible cameras in our pockets with the capability of capturing crisp snaps and 4K video, but there’s a further issue: <strong>shaky footage</strong>. If you’ve ever tried to film a birthday moment, a journey moment or a TikTok dance, then you’ll know how frustrating shaky video is. So, that’s why gimbals exist.</p>
<p>The DJI Osmo Mobile SE gets rid of that problem and you’re able to turn ordinary recordings into professional-quality videos that look as if they’re shot by pros. And since <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4198/">Amazon has dropped the price to just $58 (down from a previous low of $69)</a> — its lowest price ever — this is the perfect time to pick one up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4198/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Gimbal Is Worth It</h2>
<p>The Osmo Mobile SE is <strong>DJI’s lowest-priced stabilizer</strong> but cheap doesn’t have to mean bare bones. In real life, it’s the category leader simply because it distills pro-level video stabilization into an accessible package. Its folding design means you can shove it neatly into a backpack but when you unfold it and clip your phone onto the magnetic clamp, you’re getting that liquid-smooth footage artists adore right away. It’s <strong>compatible with both iPhones and Androids</strong>, so compatibility issues are out of the question.</p>



<p>One of the real game changers in this regard is ActiveTrack 6.0: In essence, this <strong>permits the gimbal to automatically follow your subject</strong>. If you’re filming your children playing in the park or your dog running around on the beach, the Osmo Mobile SE holds them in frame without you scrambling for controls. It even works well for solo creators: just set the phone up, get in frame and let the gimbal take center stage in your own video. The DJI Mimo app also adds to those capabilities and offers Smart templates and shot ideas that help you get more cinematic with less effort.</p>
<p>Another intelligent aspect is that it allows pairing with an Apple Watch and gives you a remote in your wrist. Tilt, pan, or begin recording without needing to rush back to your phone. For vloggers, that is a real boost for how you record hands‑free. Throw in quick editing using the LightCut app which contains easy-to-use templates and your raw shots start looking like mini-movies to share in minutes.</p>



<p>And then the real magic: <strong>3-axis stabilization</strong>. DJI’s algorithm reacts in real time to eliminate jitters and bumps that ruin handheld video. Walking down urban streets, backpacking a path or merely shooting a travel blog at an airport, the video is stable and watchable. You can even switch between landscape shooting for cinematic use or portrait mode for social media updates with a single click of a button. And if you wish to get creative, the gimbal comes with<strong> various modes including Follow, Tilt Lock, FPV and Spin Shot</strong>&nbsp;which each unlock various artistic possibilities.</p>
<p>For a paltry $58, this deal is hard to hype. Most gimbals with this much stabilization and tracking tech run more, but DJI somehow crammed it all into a lightweight, tiny device for creators. Over 10,000 people bought it last month alone, and <strong>over 10,000 reviewers left it an average 4.5‑star rating</strong>. That should tell you everything you need to know about how dependable and adaptable it is.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The community manager for the popular and controversial online SWAT simulator <em>Ready Or Not </em>was fired after posting in the game’s official Discord server that “nothing of value was lost” following the <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-steam-library-valve-discord-radicalization-2000626897">recent assassination of conservative commentator Charlie Kirk</a>.</p> <p>On or around September 17, <em>Ready Or Not’s</em> community manager, known online as Kaminsky, was asked to add “Charlie Kirk” and a few variations of the name to the server’s list of filtered words. Kaminsky confirmed they had done so, but then shared their own personal thoughts about Kirk, who was murdered at a speaking event on September 10 in Utah. The community manager posted:</p> <blockquote><p>“Funny you mention that because me and my roomate are literally just talking about him getting shot. All I have to say is: Nothing of value was lost.”</p></blockquote> <p>Screenshots and posts of this comment <a href="https://x.com/KayfabeMediaYT/status/1968548146398609603/photo/1">were quickly shared online</a> by fans of Kirk and right-wing content creators, with many demanding that Void Interactive fire the manager.&nbsp; And that’s exactly what Void did.</p>

 <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/airbagged.bsky.social/post/3lz7e5vzadc2w">On Friday</a>, a Void Interactive representative confirmed in<em> Ready Or Not</em>‘s official Discord server that the studio had “ended” its “relationship” with Kaminsky. It’s unclear if the community manager was a full-time employee or a volunteer.&nbsp; Before the news was official, fans had spotted that Kaminisky, often referred to as Kam online, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/airbagged.bsky.social/post/3lz5esqafws2e">was no longer listed</a> as being a part of the server. One Discord user in the game’s server <a href="https://discord.com/channels/310075021882294272/452425840274309120/1418631175823687750">claimed</a> that a sticker emoji featuring Kaminsky had also been removed.</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> reached out to Void Interactive for comment. Kaminsky could not immediately be contacted.</p>

 <p>“To Our <em>Ready or Not</em> Community, We are aware of comments made by our community manager about a recent tragic event,” posted Void Interactive rep Gerby on Discord.&nbsp; “These statements do not reflect our values or represent our company. We have ended our relationship with this individual and reminded our team of the responsibility we all share when communicating on public platforms. Our focus remains on fostering a respectful and professional community around <em>Ready or Not.</em>”</p> <p>This isn’t the first video game industry employee to lose their job after saying the wrong thing about Kirk’s recent murder. Last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478">a developer working on<em> Ghost of Yotei</em> was fired by Sony</a> after making a joke about Kirk’s alleged assassin. <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-discord-politics-helldivers-memes-2000626029">The alleged killer’s connection to video games</a> has become a big part of the story around Kirk’s murder, with reports that some of the assassin’s bullets had messages etched into them <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-helldivers-bullet-engraving-2000625439">referencing <em>Helldivers 2</em>.</a> Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/09/17/charlie-kirk-jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney.html">ABC late-night host Jimmy Kimmel is also facing pressure</a> to apologize after comments he made about Kirk got his show pulled “indefinitely” on Thursday.</p> <p><em><strong>Updated: 9/19/2025, 3:30 p.m. ET:</strong></em>&nbsp;When asked for further comment, Void Interactive PR pointed <em>Kotaku</em> to the studio’s previously mentioned statement, which has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1144200/view/517473296253453455">also been posted on <em>Ready or Not</em>‘s Steam page</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-patch-notes-depth-derank-2000627170</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-nightreign%E2%80%98s-new-hard-mode-is-kicking-players-asses-so-much-they-can-now-demote-themselves-to-a-lower-difficulty.1302813/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s only been a week since <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-hard-mode-time-changes-2000624664">new hard mode was added</a> to the multiplayer roguelike, and FromSoftware is already patching in some relief after even the most stalwart fans found themselves brutally beaten down. The mode has five depths, with the goal being to eventually complete enough successful runs to reach the deepest and most difficult one. Now, however, players will have the option to arbitrarily boot themselves back up to upper levels so they can stop dying and actually have fun again.</p> <p>Depth 1 is straightforward enough. While some <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-libra-nerf-deep-night-2000624624">harder enemies and new item debuffs</a> force players to adapt to the game in new ways, most were able to make short work of it. Then came Depth 2. For my team it was like hitting a brick wall, but others successfully made it to Depth 3. Past that, the game basically becomes a no-hit run mode in disguise. Within a few days some fans were already begging for an option to play on the lower difficulties again just for fun. With a shockingly quick turnaround, FromSoftware has now obliged.</p> <p><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-upcoming-deep-of-night-adjustments">An update that went live today adds</a> “a new feature to voluntarily decrease your Depth ranking by one level.” It also gives loss protection to players at lower Depths, so that your first loss on Depth 3, 4, or 5 won’t immediately lose you points and kick you back to the previous one. This protection even applies if you’re returning to Depth 3 or 4 for the dozenth time. This is mostly for players at the final Depths who lose more points from a loss than they earn for each win.</p>

   <p>“Lets go voluntary derank,” one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1nl4hun/elden_ring_nightreign_upcoming_deep_of_night/">wrote</a> on the subreddit. “This is based,” wrote another. “But we really just need more bosses.”</p> <p>The new system allows more casual players the option to enjoy the mechanics in the new mode without having to run something they just keep dying in. At the same time, some players are wondering why FromSoftware doesn’t just nuke the whole ranking up system altogether and just let players choose which Depth they want to play on from the jump. Some fans were also hoping for <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-deep-night-difficulty-mode-when-2000620989">a true “endless” mode,</a> which was rumored based on original datamines for the Deep of Night update but which appear to have been based on a mistranslation.</p> <p>Deep of Night is cool overall, but the progression system has been a bit of a bust. It’s also not a replacement for new bosses, maps, or random events during runs. The new difficulty mode will need more tweaks if it’s going to keep<em> Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> in the multiplayer rotation for a lot of current players, especially with so many other big games coming out this fall. But in the meantime, at least everyone can go back and farm the broken Deep Relics they need from easier Depths.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review.1302810/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been six years since the last mainline </span><i><span>Borderlands </span></i><span>game. (No, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-borderlands-spinoff-impressions-1848705496"><i><span>Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</span></i></a> <span>doesn’t count.) A lot has changed in the last six years, both in the land of video games and in the real world. Players expect a lot more from co-op shooters. And the people in charge are power-hungry losers. </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>tries to change with the times, with mixed results.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While it’s a damn fine shooter, the best Gearbox has made, and one which lets the franchise now stand comfortably next to genre titans like </span><i><span>Destiny</span></i><span>, its attempts to address life living under a fascist regime don’t work out as well. But you’ll probably be too busy talking and joking with your friends to notice.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span>, in a lot of ways, feels like a soft reboot of the series. The past games still happened and are referenced in big and small ways throughout the story, but the sequel is set on the new planet of Kairos and features new villains, allies, and things to kill. <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-3-the-kotaku-review-1838290570">And unlike </a></span><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-3-the-kotaku-review-1838290570"><i><span>Borderlands 3</span></i></a><span>’s story, which revolved around saving the universe and hopping across the galaxy, </span><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span> is a smaller, more contained yarn mostly focused on what happens when powerful people take control and never let go.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>A New World To Be Saved</b></h2> <p><span>While I won’t spoil any specific details in this review, I’ll let you know ahead of time that if you are coming to </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>to enjoy a satisfying tale of people rising up under fascism to defeat evil, you’ll get that—right up until the end of the main campaign. Then it kind of falls apart.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>A twist in the game’s finale turns its main villain, the Timekeeper, into a far less compelling character. But before that, I really enjoyed the amount of time Gearbox devoted to showing how evil the Timekeeper and his cronies are, and how characters deal with the question of how much they’re willing to sacrifice for freedom. And what happens when some go too far, or not far enough? Don’t expect </span><i><span>Andor</span></i><span>-like depth and writing about genocidal leaders here. Still, I was pleasantly surprised by how often I cared about what was happening to both new and returning characters alike. Gearbox’s writers do a fantastic job of really making you hate the Timekeeper and his various underlings. Don’t get </span><i><span>too </span></i><span>attached to anyone in this story. That’s all I’m saying…&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>Of course, if you play </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>with a group of your rowdy, silly friends, a lot of its writing will get buried under your pals screaming about loot drops or laughing about inside jokes. If you care at all about the tale Gearbox is telling here, do a run through the story by yourself and take your time to interact with characters and listen to audio logs.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Regardless of whether you play alone or with others, to defeat the Timekeeper and break his ironclad hold over Karios and its suffering populace, you’ll need to kill thousands of troopers, aliens, monsters, and robots using some of the billions of guns available to loot in</span><i><span> Borderlands 4.&nbsp;</span></i></p>

 <h2><b>Killin’ In The Name…Of Fun</b></h2> <p><span>What’s going to keep me coming back to </span><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span> for (likely) years is the gunplay and movement. I’ve never outright hated the combat in past </span><i><span>Borderlands</span></i><span> games, but this is the first one where I think Gearbox has truly nailed it. And not just because they tossed in more guns than ever before.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span> lets players double jump, glide, grapple, and wall climb around the open world of Kairos. This, combined with guns that, overall, feel more distinct and punchier, really helps elevate </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>into the upper echelon of first-person shooters.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Further elevating combat in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-finishes-decade-old-quest-pre-sequel-dunks-watson-explained-2000624918"><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i></a><span>are the shooter’s four distinct and new playable Vault Hunters. Each one shakes up how combat encounters play out thanks to their different powers and abilities. Playing alongside a powerful Rafa, a cybersoldier, will lead to combat encounters that feel very different than when you play alone or next to other hunters.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Really, you get like</span><i><span> 12 characters,</span></i><span> because each hunter has three skill trees that each feature mini-skill trees inside. Perhaps you and a pal both play Vex, the new Siren character. Well, you’ll likely be very different versions of Vex by the time you both reach level 50, thanks to all the different skill and ability options available to each of you.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000627162" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627162"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627162">©Gearbox</figcaption></figure> <p><span>As I leveled up, found great guns I liked, and got more comfortable with the new movement options, I would often get into flow states where I’d lost track of time. I’d end up losing 10 minutes to a random encounter on my way to a big quest simply because I just love shooting shit in this game so much.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I did find, though, that </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>has a nasty habit of throwing a few too many waves of enemies at you during a lot of encounters. I’d wipe out the fourth or fifth wave of angry psychos or space buffalo, and then another wave would arrive. And then another. It often felt like too much, and made some missions and activities drag on. Still, I wasn’t too mad because once I’d wiped every enemy out, I was left with piles of loot.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Crappy Green Pistols For As Far As The Eye Can See</b></h2> <p><span>The loot in </span><i><span>Borderlands 4,</span></i><span> like in past games, is the real secret sauce. It’s what keeps you going through a boring mission, or makes it hard to stop playing despite feeling tired and needing to go to bed. That promise that the next gun, shield, or grenade that drops will be better than anything you have.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Sure, most of the time, what drops is garbage you won’t use, but thanks to</span><i><span> Bord</span></i><i><span>e</span></i><i><span>rlands 4</span></i><span>’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-11-best-changes-borderlands-4-junk-loot-menus-legendary-guns-2000624953">improved loot management options</a>, collecting and selling truckloads of terrible rifles and shotguns is easier than ever. And when that amazing piece of loot </span><i><span>does </span></i><span>pop out of a dead enemy or chest with a distinct ping noise, it’s one of the best feelings ever. If I could bottle it and sell it, I’d be a very rich man. It feels even better in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-includes-direct-jab-joke-gearbox-former-owner-embracer-bluff-2000624815"><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i></a><span>because some of the best loot, Legendary guns, are much rarer than in the last game.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>And because nearly everything you do around the open world of Karios rewards you with loot, it can be hard not to just keep playing for hours and hours. Kairos is a big map, chockablock with small activities to complete–like activating a radio tower and defending it from baddies–as well as bigger or sillier side quests, world bosses, collectibles to hunt down, secrets to find, and random events to complete.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box-quote</p>                 <p>"Billions of guns, four friends, one meh ending."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Gearbox</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Xbox Series X/S, PS5, PC (Played on both PS5 and PC) </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>First-person co-op focused sci-fi looter shooter</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Combat better than ever, great traversal options, QoL changes, open world.  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Bugs and performance problems, less-than-satisfying ending, some fights feel too big.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>September 12, 2025 </p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>As a result, the open world of </span><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span> is more active and alive than in any previous entry in the franchise, and all of this content rewards you with more loot. Thank god you can junk most of it in seconds. Otherwise, I’d have drowned in all the green pistols that the game dumped on me over my 60 or so hours with it across PS5 and PC.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Loot also becomes a currency among friends. Get a cool sniper, but you don’t snipe? Drop it for your friend. And then, if they find a badass shield that suits your character build better, they’ll share it with you, or you can at least guilt-trip them into giving it over. And because guns can spawn with all sorts of wild extra parts that turn SMGs into rocket snipers or whatever, hunting for loot and sharing it with pals is more exciting than ever.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Well, assuming you can </span><i><span>see </span></i><span>the guns you have. A nasty bug affected one of my friends and made all his guns invisible. Which leads me to my biggest disappointment with</span><i><span> Borderlands 4: </span></i><span>the technical problems.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Excuse Me, There’s Some Bugs In My Looter Shooter</b></h2> <p><span>On PlayStation 5 Pro, I routinely had to restart the game due to the performance tanking <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">after a few hours of play</a>. I also encountered a few bugged quests that required restarts, too. Over on PC, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">many players and I have experienced optimization and performance problems</a>. Even on my RTX 5080, which can run everything I throw at it, </span><i><span>Borderlands 4 </span></i><span>demands I turn on DLSS and frame gen while also turning down visual settings. And despite getting the game to run at a mostly stable 120FPS, I still encounter microstutters.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>On both platforms, I’ve also found empty vending machines, seen characters hovering off the ground, had animations break, events not start, and encountered audio lines cutting out randomly.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>None of this has completely ruined my enjoyment of </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-patch-console-crash-pitchford-2000626826">Borderlands</a> 4</span></i><span>, and I’ve had some sessions in which it all worked pretty flawlessly, minus some hitches or stutters. But it would be irresponsible not to mention these technical flaws and annoyances in a review o</span><i><span>f Borderlands 4,</span></i><span> as they are just as much a part of the game as the loot, combat, and story. Hopefully, Gearbox can patch the game over the next few weeks and months to create a better experience, and this part of my review will then become a weird artifact from the past.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000627163" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627163"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627163">©Gearbox</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Still, despite some annoying bugs and performance problems, </span><i><span>Borderlands 4,</span></i><span> in many ways, is the best game Gearbox has ever made.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It takes what the studio has learned about creating looter shooters and builds upon that in a way that feels like a big moment for the franchise. A large leap forward in both gameplay and narrative. I joked with colleagues that critics and players would suggest this is where the series “finally grew up,” but really, that’s what it feels like.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The story isn’t as cringeworthy, with far fewer memes, more character-driven jokes, and a sense that you might not get out of this adventure with all your friends in one piece. The combat and movement are more refined and expanded, no longer feeling like an afterthought as was the case in past games. And the world of Kairos is visually varied and packed with good reasons to explore it alone or with friends.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Bugs, performance problems, a less-than-memorable villain, and a grindy endgame are disappointing for sure, but what Gearbox has put together is still a mostly fun, action-packed, and hand-crafted looter shooter that proves once again that this studio is still the best at making these kinds of over-the-top FPS RPGs. </span></p>

              <p><span>There’s a lot to love about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-crossover-review-hatsune-miku-2000626583"><i><span>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</span></i></a><span>. The kart racer is just under a week away from launch, and I’ve been playing it and really enjoying Sonic and friends’ latest run around the racetrack. It’s got a surprising amount of depth with its customizable builds, a wide spread of tracks referencing </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>history, and its races are chaotic, fast-paced fun. But one of the best things the game does happens just before the races. In single-player modes, you’re pitted against a specific Rival racer, and before the first race, they’ll exchange some words with whoever you’re playing as. These brief back-and-forths are absolutely delightful, and show that everyone in the </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>cast is a professional trash talker.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/CNSbEod2FF">pic.twitter.com/CNSbEod2FF</a></p> <p>— Mlick (@Mlickles) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mlickles/status/1968720889840562281?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>When I play </span><i><span>Crossworlds</span></i><span>, I play almost exclusively as Shadow the Hedgehog, so I’ve seen just how vicious Sonic Team has made my boy when talking to pretty much everyone on the roster. Now that reviews are out and more coverage is circulating, I’m seeing a lot more of this banter and realizing that there’s some grade-A smack talk happening in this game. </span><i><span>Crossworlds&nbsp; </span></i><span>doesn’t really have a story like previous </span><i><span>Sonic </span></i><span>racing games, so most of the character interactions come from these pre-race rap battles. Everyone in the roster has a little bit of attitude, and it means that if you put them in a competitive situation, they’re gonna try to rustle their opponents’ feathers.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Not all of these interactions are hostile, though. These races are all in good fun, so if characters who vibe get paired up as rivals, they’re usually pretty chill, and it’s sometimes illuminating to hear them talk, especially if they haven’t really had much screentime together over the years. So sit back and enjoy some of the best exchanges I’ve seen online thus far.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">OMEGA REALLY SAID YOU HAVE  NO MONEY, NO LEADS NO BITCHES</p> <p>OH MY GOD😭😭😭😭😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/n97aAGjRxF">https://t.co/n97aAGjRxF</a></p> <p>— Chonzo (COMMS OPEN) (@chonzodraws) <a href="https://twitter.com/chonzodraws/status/1968712490281287904?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I get the feeling Shadow might not like Charmy.</p> <p>Though to be fair he doesn't seem to like a lot of people. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SonicRacingCrossWorlds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SonicRacingCrossWorlds</a> <a href="https://t.co/ZhyKA60fqu">pic.twitter.com/ZhyKA60fqu</a></p> <p>— The Sonic Stadium ✪ 25 YEARS OF SONIC NEWS (@sonicstadium) <a href="https://twitter.com/sonicstadium/status/1968672404940451959?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don't think you can blame Shadow for this TBH they've barely even interacted beyond that one recent <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/IDWSonic?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#IDWSonic</a> issue. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SonicRacingCrossWorlds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#SonicRacingCrossWorlds</a> <a href="https://t.co/C1ubko6qvn">pic.twitter.com/C1ubko6qvn</a></p> <p>— The Sonic Stadium ✪ 25 YEARS OF SONIC NEWS (@sonicstadium) <a href="https://twitter.com/sonicstadium/status/1968745172587471248?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Damn, Jet is really mad at Big <a href="https://t.co/8u3lIcKwzz">pic.twitter.com/8u3lIcKwzz</a></p> <p>— Funkin 🦉🐓 (@funkin03) <a href="https://twitter.com/funkin03/status/1968711269621383350?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is why Shadow is the best Sonic character.
