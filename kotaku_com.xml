You can tell these were just added as each game’s release date says December 9, 2024. </p><p> Currently, Microsoft doesn’t support Steam and Game Pass account linking, so it would make sense for Microsoft to add <em>CoD </em>and its expansion to its own storefront if it wanted to add them to the PC Game Pass subscription service in the future. </p><p>Originally released in 2003, <em>Call of Duty </em>(and its expansion United Offensive) were never released on consoles. So unless Activision paid a studio to port these classic shooters to console, I doubt they end up on Game Pass for Xbox. However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare-2007/9nfsz9cxljsn?activetab=pivot:overviewtab&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare-2007/9nfsz9cxljsn?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Modern Warfare</em></a></span>, released in 2007, was available on Xbox 360 and is backward compatible on Xbox One and Series X/S consoles, so perhaps it will be added to both Xbox and PC Game Pass. </p><p>Of course, it’s <em>also </em>possible that these games were just added to the PC store because Microsoft wants to bring more of its back catalog to its own platform. We’ll just have to wait and see. The Game Awards are happening later this week, perhaps an announcement will happen there? At this point, only Phil Spencer and Geof Keighley know for sure. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

An approach that leans into what Sam Raimi brought to the character in <em>Spider-Man 2</em> would work, which is to say, making him an aspirational scientist whose ambition goes past his reach, resulting in a flawed yet deeply human character.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="227e1eaf27f0e368f68ab89a39330631" data-recommend-id="image://227e1eaf27f0e368f68ab89a39330631" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Lizard yelling at Spider-Man" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Lizard yelling at Spider-Man" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="227e1eaf27f0e368f68ab89a39330631" data-recommend-id="image://227e1eaf27f0e368f68ab89a39330631" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Lizard yelling at Spider-Man" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Dr. Curt Connors’ story could come across a bit like the plot of <em>Morbius—</em>a tortured scientist is looking to science to fix a tragedy, only to have another tragedy befall him. There’s a way to play the story as a “creature feature” genre piece that mixes horror and pathos by having Connors be both Frankenstein and his misunderstood monster. Either way, it can’t be any worse than <em>Morbius</em>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="37fd90b0dae932b2d6ab271198706b72" data-recommend-id="image://37fd90b0dae932b2d6ab271198706b72" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mister Negative staring menacingly" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mister Negative staring menacingly" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="37fd90b0dae932b2d6ab271198706b72" data-recommend-id="image://37fd90b0dae932b2d6ab271198706b72" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mister Negative staring menacingly" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Not dissimilar to Lizard’s, Mister Negative’s story is a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde situation that would naturally lend itself to a riff on that narrative format. Have Martin Li do good by day as the head of charity org Food, Emergency Aid, Shelter and Training (F.E.A.S.T.), and try to take over New York’s criminal underworld by night. That tension is a tried and true recipe that always works, allowing for a compellingly rich story.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0d6d906520a7f0831e2ae5467b8abc74" data-recommend-id="image://0d6d906520a7f0831e2ae5467b8abc74" data-format="png" data-width="1537" data-height="824" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Cat preparing to strike" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Black Cat preparing to strike" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0d6d906520a7f0831e2ae5467b8abc74" data-recommend-id="image://0d6d906520a7f0831e2ae5467b8abc74" data-format="png" data-width="1537" data-height="824" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Cat preparing to strike" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Look, if Catwoman can get a movie, so can Black Cat. As one of the few female anti-heroes in the Spider-Man rogues’ gallery, this one feels like low-hanging fruit. Think of it now: a charming, roguish young Felicia Hardy is hired to pull off a heist that no one else is capable of doing. It’s <em>Ocean’s Eleven</em> meets cape stuff. Cast a charismatic lead, and it’ll print money.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="478f21546666ccde6894f2932642804b" data-recommend-id="image://478f21546666ccde6894f2932642804b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="967" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Prowler getting ready to attack" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Prowler getting ready to attack" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony Pictures Animation</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="478f21546666ccde6894f2932642804b" data-recommend-id="image://478f21546666ccde6894f2932642804b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1440" data-height="967" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Prowler getting ready to attack" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After the character’s prime appearance in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/beyond-the-spider-verse-generative-ai-art-third-movie-1851515894&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-the-spider-verse-generative-ai-art-third-movie-1851515894"><em>Into the Spider-Verse</em></a></span>, a Prowler movie would do numbers.

But it’s certainly a premise that Sony’s considered for a while now, dating back to threads in <em>The Amazing Spider-Man</em>. There’s also a non-zero chance that Sony is still working on this, albeit with characters like Kraven and Venom teaming up to face down a big threat—so this one may happen sooner rather than later.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="42a96a855822ab97ff4392c887fe95f3" data-recommend-id="image://42a96a855822ab97ff4392c887fe95f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vincent D'Onofrio as Kingpin staring and adjusting" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Vincent D'Onofrio as Kingpin staring and adjusting" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="42a96a855822ab97ff4392c887fe95f3" data-recommend-id="image://42a96a855822ab97ff4392c887fe95f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Vincent D'Onofrio as Kingpin staring and adjusting" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While Kingpin’s certainly getting a lot of airtime as a villain thanks to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/daredevil-born-again-disney-marvel-news-1851714637&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/daredevil-born-again-disney-marvel-news-1851714637"><em>Daredevil</em></a></span> show, he’s also a huge foe for Spider-Man.

Nevertheless, the <em>Daredevil</em> series established quite a path for Wilson Fisk. A solo project could dig into Fisk’s troubled origins while doubling as a modern-day crime epic that sees him come to control New York. Think <em>Godfather</em> <em>II</em> or <em>American Gangster</em>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="33a30e0bac83e1fc4e86066513cde8bd" data-recommend-id="image://33a30e0bac83e1fc4e86066513cde8bd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="563" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Carnage raging " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Carnage raging " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sony Pictures</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="33a30e0bac83e1fc4e86066513cde8bd" data-recommend-id="image://33a30e0bac83e1fc4e86066513cde8bd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="563" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Carnage raging " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Cletus Kasady aka Carnage was already a horrific, sadistic monster before he got hold of a symbiote that supercharged his murderous tendencies. With audiences’ unsettling affinity for serial killer shows like <em>Monster: The Jeffrey Dahmer Story</em>, a deep character study delving into Kasady’s history as well as his bonding with the symbiote could be a darkly delicious project in the vein of something like <em>Longlegs—</em>and a far cry from the campy (yet fun) portrayal of the character that audiences saw from Woody Harrelson in <em>Venom: Let There Be Carnage</em>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3da61181c183cb102e79659a4edda688" data-recommend-id="image://3da61181c183cb102e79659a4edda688" data-format="jpg" data-width="990" data-height="557" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Knull presiding over his empire" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Knull presiding over his empire" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3da61181c183cb102e79659a4edda688" data-recommend-id="image://3da61181c183cb102e79659a4edda688" data-format="jpg" data-width="990" data-height="557" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Knull presiding over his empire" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Audiences who saw <em>Venom: The Last Dance</em> learned a little bit about Knull. But the character is so much more interesting than the film made him seem. An ancient primordial deity, he’s one of Marvel’s most powerful villains, a being of pure evil. <em>Last Dance</em> saw him send some of his monsters after Venom, but what if his solo film focused on the Symbiotes and how they trapped him in the first place? Or an old cosmo society coming across him for the first time and having a horrific, <em>Alien</em>-like experience? Just make it scary as hell, and we’ll be in a good spot.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
