Batman has experienced a similar loss:, as watching his parents die as a child spurred his whole superhero deal.</p><p>The crossover series has Sonic and the Justice League teaming up to defeat famous DC villain Darkseid, and initially Shadow is uninterested in getting involved. As he begins to leave, Batman tells Superman that he’ll handle the dark, brooding hedgehog and immediately clocks his whole deal. Batman asks Shadow, “Who was it?” This takes Shadow off guard, and then the world’s greatest detective delivers the real gut punch and adds: “The one you couldn’t protect. The one you watched die in front of you.”</p><p>Given their shared trauma, it makes sense that Bruce could sense Shadow carried the same pain. The caped crusader manages to bring Shadow around to the cause, reminding him that they honor those they’ve lost by protecting the world they loved in life.</p><p>Fans are losing it over the interaction.
