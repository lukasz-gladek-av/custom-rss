              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>expansion</span></a><span> is a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-research-shiny-charm-2000652209"><span>big ol’ grind</span></a><span>. It’s a fun one, and it paves the way to some really cool reveals and story moments, but it is a lot more time-consuming than fans probably expected. I’ve put about a dozen hours into the DLC’s new roguelike mode, so I’m practically an expert, right? If you’re getting tired of making donuts for the mysterious Pokémon Hoopa and heading into portals to an unknown world when you just want to see one of the new Mega Evolutions, I’ve got a handful of tips to help you make the most of these time-limited expeditions into Hyperspace.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Keep a flying Pokémon on your team</b></h2> <p><span>Now, I don’t mean you need a flying-type Pokémon on your team; I mean a Pokémon capable of flight or quickly moving through the air. Your biggest asset in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s Hyperspace zones is time, and it’s possible to miss out on an objective by literal seconds if you don’t have a Pokémon that can readily reach an object or target on high ground. This is especially important when you’re trying to reach the floating Poke Balls throughout the zone that you’ll often have to destroy as part of a Hyperspace run. If you’ve only got land-based monsters, it will take them longer to reach these objectives, which means precious seconds lost before you’re pulled back to reality. So keep someone on your belt who can fly to harder-to-reach places.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Find moves that don’t take long to cast</b></h2> <p><span>Speaking of saving time, one thing that will help you accomplish more in a Hyperspace run is to make sure your Pokémon have moves that don’t take long to execute. Moves that have to charge up or have phases might be strong, but you’re going to lose more time casting them than you will with a different attack. I tried using my Raichu, who knows the ground-type move Dig, against a long string of fire-type Pokemon weak to that move, but because it requires the mouse to dig into the ground and then sprout up underneath an opponent, I lost time using it that I could have saved by swapping to another monster who has a ground-type move that doesn’t take as long to use. Be mindful of your movesets before you head into Hyperspace so you can take out enemies more quickly.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000652671" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000652671"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000652671">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Get to high ground while searching for the Bonus Ball</b></h2> <p><span>After you complete all the missions in a run, a golden Bonus Ball will spawn somewhere on the map. </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>doesn’t give you any guidance as to where, and you’ll have to find it in whatever time you have left before Hoopa pulls you off the stage with a hook. Your best chance at finding this spherical treasure chest is to get to high ground. Sometimes you’ll be able to get to the top of buildings with a Holovator; other times, you might have to climb scaffolding. This isn’t foolproof because the Bonus Ball might be tucked in a corner on the lower levels of a zone, but it’s a quick way to eliminate some possibilities so you’re not wasting time.</span></p>

 <h2><b>PSA: You can fast-travel to the exit if you’re not in battle, and you should</b></h2> <p><span>If you’ve caught every Pokémon you want in a zone, completed every objective, and found the Bonus Ball, keep in mind you can fast-travel back to the Hyperspace entrance, and this will get you out much faster so you can get to the next run. It’s a small thing, but when you’re grinding runs back to back, every second counts.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Don’t worry about being at or too far above the raised level of a zone</b></h2> <p><span>One of the big changes Game Freak harped on in the lead-up to </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s release</span> <span>was that the roguelike segments would break the series’ level 100 cap. You meet these superpowered monsters where they’re at by feeding Hoopa berry-filled donuts, which it uses to boost your team’s level in the Hyperspace zones. While I understand the instinct to try and be at or above the projected levels of monsters in a zone, in my experience, even if you’re maybe 20 or so below you can reasonably accomplish what you need to on a run. Don’t be reckless, but don’t feel like you’ve gotta waste all your best berries each time you need to make a donut. Do try and have a team of six that is all at a base level of 100 so they can make the most of the donut-based upgrades, though.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000652672" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000652672"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000652672">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>You don’t get experience from Hyperspace battles, so don’t come here to grind levels</b></h2> <p><span>As cool as the thought of fighting superpowered Pokémon and raking in experience sounds, you will not gain any of that in Hyperspace. The rewards you get for running through the bizarro Lumiose City are often very specific to the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span> content, rather than something you can use to grind for other parts of the game. You’ll get a ton of berries and survey points, but not experience that will raise your monsters’ base levels. You might find Exp. Candies sometimes, which will give you experience, but it’s inconsistent.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Don’t haphazardly load up Donuts with whatever Berries you’ve got</b></h2> <p><span>Every Donut Hoopa eats is made up of various Berries you’ll come across throughout Lumiose City. You can mix any combination of them, which each will increase your level in a Hyperspace run, but they also have different perks like stat upgrades, resistance to certain attacks, and maybe even an upgraded Shiny spawn chance. As tempting as it is to just load your best Berries into one pastry, this will come back to bite you, especially in the later story segments when you need to create specific Donuts with a list of high-flavor requirements. You’ll wish you hadn’t wasted some of those rare Berries, and you’ll have to go on runs with your fingers crossed hoping they will spawn in Hyperspace. So bake your Donuts responsibly.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The previously announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musks-favorite-game-is-getting-remastered-25-years-later-2000628283"><em>Deus Ex Remastered</em></a> from Aspyr was set to launch in February of next year. It’s now been indefinitely delayed following a flood of complaints that the new version of the classic PC game looked ugly.</p> <p>During <a href="https://kotaku.com/state-of-play-playstation-5-sony-stream-youtube-twitch-2000628258#:~:text=One%20of%20the,on%20February%205.">Sony’s State of Play event in September</a>, Aspyr revealed <em>Deus Ex Remastered</em>, an “improved” and “better” looking version of the original, a beloved sci-fi immersive sim developed by Ion Storm and released in 2000. Almost immediately, the reaction online turned negative. <a href="https://kotaku.com/deus-ex-remastered-trailer-ugly-bad-comparison-ps5-pc-mods-nightdive-2000628799">People, myself included, weren’t happy about all the textures being replaced</a> with newer, higher-resolution assets. These didn’t mesh well with the old models and geometry that was still left in the game, creating a bizarre effect where it looked even worse than the chunky but charming visuals of the original game.</p> <p>Now, the remaster has been delayed, likely in an attempt to improve how it looks. On December 11, Aspyr announced that it wouldn’t move ahead with releasing <em>Deus Ex Remastered</em> in early 2026, <a href="https://x.com/AspyrMedia/status/1999170679116087572?">posting on X</a>:</p> <blockquote><p>Thank you to the community for your feedback following the reveal of <em>Deus Ex Remastered. </em>We’ve listened to what you said, and in order to better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players,<em> Deus Ex Remastered</em> will no longer launch on Feb. 5, 2026.</p></blockquote> <p>Asypry didn’t provide a new release date or window. The studio behind other remasters, <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-bounty-hunter-remaster-review-is-it-good-ps5-1851610382">like 2024’s </a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-bounty-hunter-remaster-review-is-it-good-ps5-1851610382">Star Wars Bounty Hunter</a>,</em> confirmed all pre-orders would be refunded, which seems to imply the delay won’t be a short one.&nbsp; Aspyr says it looks “forward to sharing more updates” with fans “when the time comes.”</p> <p>Based on how many people didn’t like the trailer and were disappointed with <em>Deus Ex Remastered</em>‘s visuals, I think very few people are going to be upset about this delay. Hopefully, when/if <em>Deus Ex Remastered</em> sees the light of day again, it looks more like the original and less like a bad fan-created Unreal demo.</p>

              <p>As <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">The Game Awards enters its 12th year</a>, it’s worth looking back on some of the highs and lows from TGAs past. Out of the ashes of the Spike VGAs, creator and host Geoff Keighley created an annual gaming staple that highlights some of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-geoff-keighley-tickets-trailers-clair-obscur-2000652243">biggest and best games for millions watching from home</a>. It honors creators and brands, seeking to elevate the craft and art of games while also leaving room for giant walking razor blade sponsorships. Here are 17 of the best and worst Game Awards moments going back to 2014.</p> <h2>“Fuck The Oscars!” – The Game Awards 2017</h2>  <p>Any list of iconic or famous Game Awards moments must legally include what is arguably the show’s most well-known clip: That time <em>Split Ficition</em> and<em> It Takes Two</em> director Josef Fares took control of the show for a few minutes and yelled “Fuck the Oscars!” in front of a visibly confused Geoff. Great stuff. – Zack Zwiezen</p>

 <h2><em>Ark 2</em> starring Vin Diesel is announced – The Game Awards 2020</h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/vin-diesel-is-fighting-dinosaurs-in-ark-2-1845856293">It was funny when Wildcard Studios announced an <em>Ark</em> sequel</a> despite many fans at the time feeling the original game needed more updates. It was even funnier when Vin Diesel appeared in the trailer. And it’s really, really funny that five years later, the game appears to be vaporware and has yet to launch. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/almost-5-years-since-its-reveal-ark-2-devs-admit-the-survival-sequel-was-put-on-hold-a-couple-of-years-ago-but-theyre-hopeful-it-could-release-in-early-access-within-the-next-2-years/">But it might finally see the light of day in 2027.</a> – Zack Zwiezen</p>

 <h2>The leaders of the three console companies share a stage – The Game Awards 2018</h2>  <p>The Game Awards foreshadowed the end of the console wars when Nintendo’s Reggie Fils-Aimé, Xbox’s Phil Spencer, and PlayStation’s Shawn Layden took the stage together at the 2018 ceremony to look beyond old marketing rivalries, exclusivity deals, and platform competition and praise gaming as a medium that transcends studio borders and corporate branding. Two of them are now retired and only Spencer remains at his post, currently overseeing the implementation of a similar philosophy as Microsoft goes multiplatform. – Ethan Gach</p>

 <h2>DrDisrespect wins the Trending Gamer award – The Game Awards 2017</h2>  <p>Herschel “Dr Disrespect” Beahm was crowned the biggest gamer of 2017 back when the Game Awards and the traditional gaming industry was still much more intertwined with the growing creator economy on YouTube and Twitch. Little did we all know that this was the same year in which Beahm would later <a href="https://kotaku.com/dr-disrespect-sexting-twitch-ban-youtube-elden-ring-1851556854">admit to having had</a> “casual, mutual conversations that sometimes leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate” with a female minor. He was later banned from Twitch over it, even though the full incident wouldn’t come to light until 2024. Presciently, the Game Awards never did another Trending Gamer prize again. – Ethan Gach</p>

 <h2>Ken &amp; Roberta Williams win the first Industry Icons Award – The Game Awards 2014</h2>  <p>The very first Game Awards in 2014 was an overly long and very boring show. But even I had to smile when Ken and Roberta Williams, two very important video game pioneers, were given the Industry Icon award. This show should have tons of these kinds of moments; alas, these segments that truly celebrate creators and games are still far too rare. – Zack Zwiezen</p>

 <h2>Ninja showing up – The Game Awards 2018</h2>  <p>In an attempt to professionalize the category, the Game Awards shifted from 2017’s Trending Gamer to “Content Creator of the Year.” While Richard “Ninja” Blevins would go on to win it in 2018, he also just appeared during the show at the height of his electric-blue-haired popularity for a bit with a Muppet that may have been one of the least funny bits to ever appear during the show’s decade-plus run. Ninja may have had the charisma of a plastic “forkknife” but the writers did him no favors here. – Ethan Gach</p>

 <h2>Flute Guy – The Game Awards 2022</h2>  <p>Live concerts have always been a staple of the Game Awards, but they’ve gotten much better with the move away from <em>Rock Band</em>-like cameos and toward orchestral arrangements of actual video game music. No one embodies that more than Venezuelan flautist Pedro Eustache, who became a viral sensation for his passionate and expressive performances across a variety of different instruments at the 2022 show, especially during the <em>Xenoblade Chronicles 3</em> segment. He’s so good <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4sb27LA2n8w">they keep bringing him back</a>. – Ethan Gach</p> <h2><em>Rock Band VR</em> announcement trailer – The Game Awards 2015</h2>  <p>I’m not sure why <em>Rock Band VR</em> was even created or why it was given such a lengthy spotlight at the Game Awards. And perhaps the worst part is that if you watched the show live or were there in person, you had to look at Palmer Luckey’s feet. The VR wunderkind is now a <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/tech-ceo-shares-how-he-early-supporter-trump-running-president-before-his-2016-campaign">right-wing</a> <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/palmer-luckey-ai-powered-autonomous-weapons-future-of-warfare-60-minutes-transcript/">AI weapons dealer</a>, and it makes this already hard-to-watch segment even more unbearable. – Zack Zwiezen</p> <h2>Waldorf and Statler dunk on the event – The Game Awards 2024</h2>  <p>Yes, it’s a bit odd how often Geoff invites Muppets to the Game Awards. But whatever, I don’t care because it means Statler and Waldorf got to occasionally appear and make fun of the show, Geoff, and everything else. It was wonderful. Truly inspired. – Zack Zwiezen</p>

 <h2>Schick Hyrdobot takes it to the next level – The Game Awards 2016</h2>  <p>The early days of the Game Awards are filled with some truly bizarre sponsorship moments and deals. Geoff needed help funding this thing and seemed willing to take any deal he was offered. That is likely how we ended up with Schick Hyrdobot, a horrific razor-robot-man hybrid that appeared periodically throughout the&nbsp; 2016 event. – Zack Zwiezen</p> <h2>Fans boo Konami – The Game Awards 2015</h2>  <p>Number one Keighley best friend Hideo Kojima was not allowed to attend the 2015 show. In an uncharacteristically candid segment, Geoff outlined that Konami’s lawyers were specifically prohibiting the <em>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</em> director from attending despite the game being nominated. “It’s unfathomable to me,” the host said. As the audience booed the publisher, the show commemorated the absence with a special performance of “Quiet Steam” from the game. – Ethan Gach</p>

 <h2>Cutting the GOTY speech short – The Game Awards 2023</h2>  <p>Larian Studios took home the top prize for <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>at the 2023 show but director Swen Vincke only had 60 seconds to speedrun through the team’s acceptance speech. Things were made even worse by a “<a href="https://twitter.com/javierabegazo/status/1732975428237934964?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1732975428237934964%7Ctwgr%5Ef68fd0afd04e064cfcb2ee0dbe53a48fa90d90b0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fbaldur-s-gate-3-game-awards-2023-goty-speech-1851099039">wrap it up</a>” sign that happened to flash right when he was mentioning the colleagues that had been lost along the way during development. Fortunately, the studio head shared <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-game-awards-2023-goty-speech-1851099039">his full speech online</a> after the show, and went on to have one of the best monologues at the following year’s show, in which he predicted <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-game-awards-goty-larian-1851780699">potentially sweeping this year’s awards</a>. – Ethan Gach</p> <h2>Nintendo’s Reggie Fils-Aime remembers Iwata – The Game Awards 2015</h2>  <p>As mentioned already, it’s rare that the Game Awards takes a moment to truly slow down and let someone be human. That makes this moment in 2015 when Geoff and then-Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aimé eulogized and honored the recently passed Satuoru Iwata, all the more special. Geoff literally says that for the next few minutes he’s putting away the trailers, the awards, and the marketing, and seems truly affected by Iwata’s death. Turns out you don’t need big flashy trailers to create a memorable moment. Just some heart. – Zack Zwiezen</p> <h2>Michelle Rodriguez and Vin Diesel end the show awkwardly – The Game Awards 2019</h2>  <p>I think the 2019 Game Awards have the worst and strangest ending in the show’s history. It starts with Michelle Rodriguez revealing the last game of the show, a crappy <em>Fast and Furious</em> game that looked terrible, and evolves into an awkward back-and-forth between her and Vin Diesel about the next <em>F&amp;F</em> movie and video games. It’s rough stuff. Worse, the two were then involved in <a href="https://youtu.be/UOmdhofNzDM">handing out the final award of the night to the Game of the Year winner.</a> Yikes! – Zack Zwiezen</p>

 <h2>Christopher Judge wins and gives a nine-minute speech – The Game Awards 2022</h2>  <p>There’s no <em>God of War</em> reboot without Christopher Judge, and the <em>Stargate</em> veteran went on to win “Best Performance” for <em>Ragnarök</em> in 2022. He gave what must be the longest speech in Game Awards history. It was personal, emotional, and so drawn out that Keighley spent the next few years rushing winners off the stage after 30 seconds to stop the show from going too late into the night. But he earned it after punctuating the 2018 show with the best three words anyone spoke onstage that night: “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uxgaD_0LboI">Read it, boy</a>.” – Ethan Gach</p> <h2>Bill Clinton kid crashes the stage – The Game Awards 2022</h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2022-bill-clinton-infowars-blizzcon-troll-1849877331">Small-time online troll</a> Matan Even snuck on stage at the end of the 2022 ceremony when <em>Elden Ring</em> was crowned Game of the Year. It was confusing and absurd. “I want to nominate this award to my reformed Orthodox Rabbi Bill Clinton,” he said after speeches from the actual developers. The incident’s legacy as the most “this thing is happening live” moment in TGA history was only trumped by just how dumb it turned out to be. Keighley has tightened security in the years since. – Ethan Gach</p> <h2><em>Alan Wake 2</em> dance – The Game Awards 2023</h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-ii-2-herald-of-darkness-music-video-musical-1851024833">Recreating the best moment from </a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-ii-2-herald-of-darkness-music-video-musical-1851024833">Alan Wake 2</a>,</em> one of the best games of 2023, live on stage was such a brilliant and fun idea that I almost believe Geoff wasn’t involved in that meeting. However this came about, I don’t care, because the end result is <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-game-awards-alan-wake-2-herald-of-darkness-1851085691">arguably the most joyful moment in the history of the Game Awards</a>. More of this and honoring creators, and less random celebrities and bad jokes, please! – Zack Zwiezen</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/time-person-of-the-year-ai-musk-altman-kalshi-bet-lost-millions-angry-2000652622</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Time Magazine</em> revealed its Person of the Year for 2025. It wasn’t one person, but many different people who are all at the helm of pushing AI technology. This has caused some prediction market gamblers who had bet on AI itself earning the distinction to start yelling a lot online. It’s very funny, but also a horrible glimpse at our bet-on-everything future.</p> <p>On December 11, <a href="https://time.com/7339685/person-of-the-year-2025-ai-architects/"><em>Time Magazine</em> revealed its annual Person of the Year cover</a>. The long-running magazine, whose readership at this point is made up mostly of bored people in waiting rooms, revealed that there wasn’t just one person of the year in 2025, but seven different individuals. <em>Time Magazine</em> refers to these people as the “Architects of AI,” and they include names like Elon Musk, Nvidia’s Jensen Huang, and OpenAI boss Sam Altman. Normally, I’d think about who <em>Time</em> picked as the Person of the Year for about 10 seconds and then move on with my life. But this time, who they picked, and the <a href="https://time.com/7339703/ai-architects-person-of-the-year-2025/">use of two different covers,</a> have caused chaos among people who love to bet on everything.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">2025 was the year when artificial intelligence’s full potential roared into view, and when it became clear that there will be no turning back.</p> <p>For delivering the age of thinking machines, for wowing and worrying humanity, for transforming the present and transcending the… <a href="https://t.co/mEIKRiZfLo">pic.twitter.com/mEIKRiZfLo</a></p> <p>— TIME (@TIME) <a href="https://twitter.com/TIME/status/1999097617633189955?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>On the prediction market website Kalshi, <a href="https://kalshi.com/markets/kxtime/times-person-of-the-year/kxtime-25">nearly $20 million worth of betting</a> happened over who would be <em>Time</em>‘s Person of the Year. One popular option that many bet on was AI. So when Kalshi called the bet and listed the specific people the magazine had named as the “Architects of AI” as the winners, but not AI itself, a lot of people were angry. They believed that AI was also the winner as it was named directly. Making things more confusing, <em>Time Magazine</em> ran two covers for the Person of the Year issue this year, one featuring the architects, with the other featuring “AI” in massive letters, though the words “The Architects of AI” are still present in the cover’s corner. Still, this cover is more evidence, according to those who bet on AI, that it, too, should be considered a winning outcome in one of the site’s biggest bets of the year.</p>

 <p>“ITS THE ARCHITECTS OF AI THISNIS LITTERALY THE BET FUCK KALSHI,” <a href="https://kalshi.com/ideas/posts/9914a9da-54dc-4447-b104-825713e9dff4">posted one angry gambler</a> who bet on AI and lost. “This is actually so freaking stupid,” said <a href="https://kalshi.com/ideas/posts/0deb1354-478d-4bca-8538-c6e4ce282413">another user</a>.</p> <p>“This pretty clearly should’ve resolved to yes,” <a href="https://kalshi.com/ideas/posts/601174f7-f82e-484a-8955-e3e68fd75032">said another upset AI better</a>. “If you bought AI, reach out to Kalshi support because ‘AI’ is literally on the cover and in the title, ‘Architects of AI.’ They’re not going to change anything unless they hear from people.”</p>

 <p>“The cover literally says ‘AI” right on the front. This is insane,” <a href="https://kalshi.com/ideas/posts/151a0fb2-e8ef-4964-96ed-5627f7cf1820">said another upset gambler.</a> “fr bro we got screwed,” replied someone else.</p> <p>While I am definitely laughing at how many people lost money betting on <em>Time</em>‘s Person of the Year, I’m also aware that this is our future. This bet-on-everything shit is growing quickly. Sites like Kalshi and Polymarket are letting people gamble on literally anything. And this is just the start. <a href="https://kotaku.com/finance-bro-thinks-it-would-be-cool-to-turn-your-entire-life-into-the-stock-market-2000650201">The CEO of Kalshi recently explained</a> that he wants to “financialize everything and create a tradable asset out of any difference of opinion.” In other words, every part of our humanity<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->what we love, believe in, cherish, hope for, fear, etc.<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->in the near future will be something to bet on. That’s only going to make it easier for the <a href="https://pausebeforeyouplay.org/2025/06/online-gambling-is-likely-on-the-rise-at-a-high-school-near-you/">growing number of young people addicted to online gambling</a> to lose even more money. <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/volodymyr-zelensky-suit-polymarket-rebellion/">And the arbiters of how these bets are settled and who wins will be tech bros</a>.</p> <p>Good luck, everyone. I place our odds of making it through the AI-powered online gambling future ahead of us pretty low. I’m not taking that bet.</p>
