In 2017, <em>Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony </em>seemingly ended Spike Chunsoft’s murder mystery series with a decisive metacommentary about letting art die with dignity. Four years later, after creative director Kazutaka Kodaka left the company, Spike Chunsoft released the obvious cash grab <em>Danganronpa S: Ultimate Summer Camp</em>, a gacha game universally maligned for stomping all over the series’ legacy (and for being a mediocre video game). Since then, the series has mostly gone away, with Kodaka releasing several <em>Danganronpa</em>-like projects over at his new studio, Too Kyo Games, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/master-detective-archives-switch-review-danganronpa-1850592843&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/master-detective-archives-switch-review-danganronpa-1850592843"><em>Master Detective Archives: Rain Code</em></a></span><em> </em>and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-steam-switch-reviews-1851781786&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-steam-switch-reviews-1851781786"><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em></a></span>. For years, it seemed like <em>Danganronpa </em>might be well and truly dead, until last night when one of the stars of the series’ English dubs posted a cryptic tweet that has put the community in a tizzy.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196646" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="137" data-playlist="196646,196215,197544" data-current="196646"><div><p>Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22202.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Brian Beacock, the English voice behind Monokuma, the series’ masochistic teddy bear villain, posted a tweet of the evil animatronic bear laughing, with the caption “11.25.2025.” There’s no other context for this in the post, so fans have a lot of empty space in which to speculate. Could this be a tease for something new in the <em>Danganronpa </em>series after nearly a decade without a mainline entry?</p><p>Notably, November 25 will be the 15th anniversary of the release of the original <em>Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc</em> on the PlayStation Portable way back in 2010. It’s entirely possible this might not be a new game, but some kind of event commemorating the anniversary. There’s really nothing to go on here, so fans are running wild and theorizing everything from a remake of the original game to a <em>Dead by Daylight </em>crossover.</p><p>While some think a new game may be coming, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/danganronpa/comments/1luagnj/brian_beacock_the_voice_of_monokuma/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/danganronpa/comments/1luagnj/brian_beacock_the_voice_of_monokuma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">others are a bit more skeptical</a></span>. If a new <em>Danganronpa </em>game were coming, it seems unlikely that the first tease would be from one of the English voice actors, rather than some kind of worldwide, coordinated effort from Spike Chunsoft. Whatever it is, we will only have to wait four long months to find out. Need something to do in the meantime? Play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review-danganronpa-1851777031&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review-danganronpa-1851777031"><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em></a></span>. Sure, it’s not a murder mystery, but it’s still one of Kodaka’s most ambitious works, and it deserves more attention as we head into Game of the Year season in December. </p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/new-danganronpa-4-brian-beacock-monokuma-tease-dbd-1851785794]]></content:encoded>

Some Catholics believe in first, second, and third class relics, just like the Ghostbusters’ numbering system for haunted artifacts, but it’s hard to find strict, codified definitions by the Church. Because the cards don’t belong to Pope Leo XIV and aren’t regularly used by him, but have come into contact with his hands, they might count as third class relics. It’s unclear if that means they’re banned at official tournaments. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pope-leo-xiv-pokemon-card-autograph-popplio-meme-1851785788]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Commanders, prepare for deployment. <em>Girls’ Frontline 2: Exilium</em> is rolling out a series of updates to help bolster your squad, vanquish enemies, and purify contaminated zones.</p><p>For the uninitiated,<em> GFL2</em> is a 3D strategy RPG available on PC, iOS, and Android. You take on the role of Commander, leading Tactical Dolls (T-Dolls) — stylish androids modeled after real-world weapons — through turn-based battles, exploration, and an unfolding post-apocalyptic storyline.</p><p>From July 3 - 23, a Targeted Procurement Event will feature three elite T-Dolls: Springfield, Peri, and Mechty. Springfield is a brand-new character addition, while Mechty is a valuable re-release for players who missed out on pulling her previously.</p><p>New elite weapons will be introduced to the banner pool as well, with each tailored to their wielder’s distinctive strengths and personas.</p><p>Inspired by the M1903 and enhanced for futuristic combat, Springfield’s “Radiance”—its name reflecting the holder’s warm, maternal nature—boasts improved maneuverability and firing speed. With its combination of power and velocity, the rifle complements Springfield’s versatility as a fighter and supporter on the battlefield.</p><p>Beneath the alluring exterior of Peri’s “Amanita” lies devastating power. Based on the MP5H1, the submachine gun features enhanced internals that boost its stopping power significantly and, in effect, compromise enemies quickly. It’s an ideal match for Peri’s quiet charm and deadly cunning.</p><p>The “Hestia” is compact but lethal. Modeled after the CZ75, the handgun is an extension of Faye’s fiery nature; a force to be reckoned with in close combat.</p><p>Speaking of Faye, she’ll also be available to acquire during this time frame via an updated Standard Procurement Banner for free. If you’re a new player or someone looking to round out their T-Doll roster, you can nab Faye for free by completing a handful of in-game tasks.</p><figure id="" data-id="9b6d090ea30380c7f5f24aa68e95e957" data-recommend-id="image://9b6d090ea30380c7f5f24aa68e95e957" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->SUNBORN</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9b6d090ea30380c7f5f24aa68e95e957" data-recommend-id="image://9b6d090ea30380c7f5f24aa68e95e957" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For those interested in upping their style game, all previous skins will return with limited-time discounts, as well as new outfits and weapon skins.</p><p>Springfield’s “Queen in Radiance” navy blue dress looks the part, but it also happens to be the game’s first outfit to feature a 3D main screen wallpaper, on which Commanders can interact and dance with Springfield.</p><p>Faye’s Flurry-Crimson outfit matches her temperament to a tee, tailored for silent efficiency. Meanwhile, you can add a touch of artistry to your firepower with the Midnight Waltz and Dawn Sentry weapon skins. The former gives Wednesday Addams vibes with its blueish-purple stock and black barrel. The haunting skin is fitting for Commanders who look to strike in Night Battle Missions. Its counterpart, the Dawn Sentry, has a yellowish-gold action that reflects the ultimate mission of the game: fight for a new, brighter day.</p><p>The outfits and skins will be sold at a discount at the Payment Center. You just need a Sunborn Account to purchase them.</p><p>This past holiday weekend, for fans of the 3D strategy game, the action didn’t stop with their adventures on the small screen. The MICA team brought the excitement of <em>Girls’ Frontline 2: Exilium</em> to life at the 2025 Anime Expo at the Los Angeles Convention Center.</p><figure id="" data-id="b991f0ef966a00543a5985ff48208e1d" data-recommend-id="image://b991f0ef966a00543a5985ff48208e1d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1366" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->SUNBORN</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b991f0ef966a00543a5985ff48208e1d" data-recommend-id="image://b991f0ef966a00543a5985ff48208e1d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1366" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>From July 3 - 6, <em>GFL2</em> welcomed Commanders to their booth, which was designed after the fan-favorite Zucchero Cafe—the new Doll Spring field is the manager. Cosplayers dressed as four characters—Springfield, Makiatto, Centaureissi, and Sharkry—were on-site to interact with convention-goers, make and sell drinks, and unlock rewards.</p><p>At the Training Range, Commanders squared off in a one-on-one target battle, while the Café Life Interaction Zone offered attendees the opportunity to earn a Zucchero Cookie Badge and a Lucky Draw Coupon. One Lucky Draw was held per day at the activation, giving fans the chance to win Acrylic Shikishis, Figures, Leva Acrylic Blocks, Perpetual Calendar Phone Stands, and other prizes.</p><p><br>The T-Doll and weaponry rate drops, outfits, and skins are only sticking around for a limited time (July 3 - 23), so get your hands on the loot while you can. And if you’re in the L.A. area over July 4 weekend, experience the world of <em>Girls’ Frontline 2: Exilium</em> IRL and snag that exclusive merch. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/girls-frontline-2-exilium-anime-expo-limited-drop-1851785787]]></content:encoded>
