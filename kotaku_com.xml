              <p>We’re getting more <em>Halo</em> games, but which ones?&nbsp; Can <em>Battlefield</em> really threaten <em>Call of Duty</em> for the military shooter crown? And is the future of OpenAI really a porn bot service? Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming culture and news. I’m getting this one out extra early to make up for yesterday. <em>Tron: Ares</em> bombed at the box office with a $33 million debut that Hollywood insiders <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/jared-leto-tron-ares-box-office-1236401068/">believe will doom Jared Leto and the franchise</a>. That’s a shame because I saw it last night and it didn’t suck nearly as much as I expected. I would even say the first half of it was pretty great!</p> <h2>OpenAI is getting ready to unleash “erotica for verified adults”</h2> <p>A big sexting update is coming to ChatGPT in December, Sam Altman <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1978129344598827128">teased on X</a> this week. “We made ChatGPT pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues,” he wrote. “We realize this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right.”</p> <p>Having unfurled the aircraft carrier “Mission Accomplished!” sign despite <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/family-teenager-died-suicide-alleges-openais-chatgpt-blame-rcna226147">ongoing wrongful death lawsuits</a>, Altman says it’s time to embrace easily outmaneuvered age-verification tools and treat people like grownups. “In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our ‘treat adult users like adults’ principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults,” he concluded. It sounds like the trillion-dollar bubble is going back to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/sam-altman-chatgpt-openai-gpt-5-world-warcraft-destiny-2000616944">chattier and more sycophantic version</a> of ChatGPT that paying users got hooked on earlier in the year.</p> <h2>Master Chief’s voice is teasing a big <em>Halo</em> announcement</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Repped for our girl, <a href="https://twitter.com/jentaylortown?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jentaylortown</a>, in Chicago this past weekend!

              <p>Halloween is just around the corner, and if you’re looking to host a spooky party or just shopping ahead for the upcoming holiday season, having a solid party speaker is a must to entertain yourself and your guests. Good speakers bring in good vibes, and hardly any brand does sound better than JBL.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4784/">The good news is, we’ve just spotted the JBL PartyBox Stage 320 going for $450 on Amazon, after a $150 drop from its $600 price.</a> This deal is available on the black color option. The white version is discounted too, but it’s going for $600 after a $30 discount on its retail price of $630. Regardless of the color, both discounts are only around for a short time, so grab yourself a speaker before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4784/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Party on Wheels, Literally</h2>
<p>JBL took “bring the party home” quite seriously with this one. This portable speaker looks like a rolling suitcase with a telescopic handle and durable wheels to take it around wherever the party goes. You’re getting two 6.5-inch woofers and a pair of 25mm dome tweeters that deliver deep, rich bass even when you have the volume turned all the way up. Music won’t distort at higher levels, meaning you can go all out with your favorite tracks, among your favorite people.</p>
<p>The speaker also gets you a futuristic light show with your beats defining the rhythm of the lights. And since it’s also IPX4 splashproof, you won’t have to worry if things get a bit messy. Place it by the pool or take it to the beach; it can handle a few splashes and spills without throwing a fit.</p>



<p>Battery-wise, you’re looking at up to 18 hours of continuous listening on a full charge, which is more than enough for an entire night of fun. Recharging the speaker won’t take forever either, and it will be up and running again in no time. There are also some handy connectivity options, such as the dual microphone inputs and guitar input for live performances. On top of that, the PartyBox Stage 320 supports Auracast, so you can link it with other JBL speakers for even bigger sound.</p>
<p>Overall, if you’re looking for a music solution that can bring life to any party and is easy to carry around, the JBL PartyBox Stage 320 speaker is one of the best options out there.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4784/"> It now costs $150 less than its usual price, so grab it before it’s too late.</a></p>

              <p>Recording your adventures is a great way to revisit and relive them later, or even share them with the world. But your smartphone camera or traditional options can only take you so far. To get those professional results in all lighting and weather conditions, you might want to consider investing in a DJI action camera, and now is a great time to grab one without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4783/">Amazon has dropped the price of the DJI Osmo Action 5 Pro essential combo to $269, giving you 21% off on one of the best action cameras out there.</a> The deal won’t be around for too long, so we highly recommend getting your orders in sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4783/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stunning Visuals On the Go</h2>
<p>The Action 5 Pro camera comes with all the essential features you need for a minimal yet powerful setup. You’re getting the all-new 1/1.3-inch sensor paired with a 13.5-stop dynamic range for clear images in both bright and dim settings. It shoots 4K video at up to 120fps, and the advanced 4nm chip makes sure the subject stays in focus even during motion in both horizontal (16:9) and vertical (9:16) formats. There’s a built-in color temperature sensor to automatically adjust white balance for lifelike results, as well.</p>
<p>Then you’ve got front and rear ultra-bright OLED touchscreens to capture moments without a lot of fumbling around. You can frame and check your shots on the go within seconds. And for when you don’t want to bother with buttons, there’s voice support with always-on recognition to control the camera hands-free within a one-meter range. The camera also plays nicely with the DJI Mic 2 and Mic Mini, so you will also enjoy crisp, clear audio without needing a separate receiver.</p>



<p>The built-in 1950mAh battery can last up to 4 hours on a full charge, while a quick 15-minute top-up can get you an additional 2 hours of filming. Plus, the camera is IP68-rated waterproof up to 20 meters, and can even handle extreme cold (as low as -20 degrees) quite well.</p>
<p>All things considered, this action camera can be a great investment for all the outdoor enthusiasts looking to film their adventures in the wild. You’re not just getting a solid visual quality but also a reliable battery life, handy touchscreens, easy controls, and much more. Grab it for less while it’s still discounted.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>So much of the crap we own is beholden to a long cable and fat adapter to make it work. Our phones, our headphones, even our watches now all have a lithium battery that needs to be charged on the regular. When you need to plug in more than one device at a time, suddenly you space feels like a cobweb of cables running all directions, creating a tangled mess. Or worse, they don’t all fit. So now you’re on the hunt for multiple free wall outlets to get your AirPods up and running again just so you can relisten to the&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> soundtrack while you work. Thankfully, you can take control of your stress and clutter with a good charging station. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4161/">Baseus has a 10-in-1 desktop charge of which Amazon knocked 40% off the price</a>. The charger normally goes for $50, but the discount ends up saving you an even $20. That means you only have to pay $30 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4161/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multi-Device Charging</h2>
<p>This all-in-one charging block combines 10 different ports so you can charge up as many as 10 devices simultaneously. Between them all, you get six AC outlets, three USB-C ports, and one standard USB-A port. With a wide spread of options, you shouldn’t have any issue charging your various devices without the need for a unique charging block. You can just plug your device directly into the unit. In the event you still end up needing to plug an adapter into the AC outlet, you shouldn’t have that common problem of the block taking up multiple slots on the power strip. On the Baseus charger, each outlet faces a different direction to allow for better flexibility.</p>



<p>Designed for desktops and nightstands, the Baseus charging station comes with an adhesive strip for the bottom of the unit. This was it can stand firmly in place to the side of your desk, out of the way, but always where you want it to be.</p>
<p>Whether you’re charging your phone, earbuds, a MacBook, or all three at once, you can expect them to charge up quickly. The Baseus power station is able to deliver a maximum output of 67W. As a point of reference, the USB-C adapter that comes with iPhones nowadays is only 20W. And with GaN6 technology, you can trust your devices will stay safe and cool while charing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4161/">For a limited time, you can secure yourself this versatile 10-in-1 Baseus charging station for $20 off. Get it now for just $30.</a></p>
