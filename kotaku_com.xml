It’s cool to see him zipping through the sky, avoiding bomber jets and generally annoying Wilson with his assertions that he looks better in the Falcon suit than the new Captain America did. There’s also a moment showing the pair out of their super suits, seemingly lurking around to ascertain information about whatever evil doing is being perpetrated by villain Samuel Sterns (Tim Blake Nelson), who we still haven’t seen outside of the shadows.</p><p>Torres, who previously starred in <em>Top Gun: Maverick,</em> first appeared in the <em>Captain America </em>universe as Joaquin Torres in 2021's Disney+ series <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-marvel-tv-shows-disney-netflix-mcu-1851173236?_gl=1*1tgz03t*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDEyMTg2NS4xMjYuMC4xNzM0MTIxODY4LjU3LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-marvel-tv-shows-disney-netflix-mcu-1851173236?_gl=1*1tgz03t*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDEyMTg2NS4xMjYuMC4xNzM0MTIxODY4LjU3LjAuMA.."><em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em></a></span><em>. </em>At San Diego Comic Con 2024, Ramirez <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/D-tvfekY0x4?si=2CACPhdNM2xSZkeX&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/D-tvfekY0x4?si=2CACPhdNM2xSZkeX" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">explained to <em>Phase Zero</em></a></span> that he didn’t even fully know what the Falcon suit would look like until they started shooting. “It was months of developing it. As we were doing the run-up to the film, it was like, ‘Alright, Danny, try this on. Alright, try this on.’ At the same time, I was training. So the suit kept changing and changing. By the time it was ready for me to wear on set, I remember looking at it and being like, ‘Oh, that’s it. Holy shit!’”</p><p>I think we all had the same reaction as Ramirez after watching the latest trailer. Now, we just have to wait until February 14 to see the Falcon fully in action. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The studio that created <em>Crash Bandicoot </em>isn’t a stranger to spending a lot of time with one franchise, having spent full console generations on <em>Crash</em> and <em>Jak &amp; Daxter</em> before pivoting into <em>Uncharted </em>during the PS3 era.

Even as the series won awards and drew in millions of viewers, there was an overarching sense that people are tired of <em>The Last of Us</em>. It doesn’t help that for the last few years, the series has been prominently sticking around without giving us anything new to talk about, as every new project has been a remake or recreation of what’s already come before. So even as a third game is apparently lurking in some office drawer at Naughty Dog, we haven’t anything truly new to talk about in years. <em>Part II</em> is an all-time top-five game for me, and even I’m tired of retreading it, though I’ll have to do it again when the second season of the show arrives next year. So yeah, let’s finally get Naughty Dog into a fresh new universe, and not one that it’s been taking us back to for the past two or three generations.</p><p><em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em> is a new science fiction game in which space travel had advanced significantly by the mid-‘80s. Director Neil Druckmann has cited sci-fi anime like <em>Akira </em>and <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> as inspirations, and you can see that in just the brief glimpse we’ve gotten into the game thus far. There’s a retrofuturistic aesthetic to the first trailer, seen in details such as bounty hunter protagonist Jordan listening to compact discs and using CRT TVs in her spaceship. The game’s tone and subject matter look to be a far cry from the swashbuckling treasure-hunting and grim zombie-killing the studio has been focused on for so many years. Druckmann says it’s a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/arts/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-druckmann.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/arts/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-druckmann.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“return” to the studio’s action-adventure roots</a></span> which date back to the <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> series, though <em>Intergalactic </em>is clearly maintaining some of the cinematic prestige television aspirations of Naughty Dog’s recent projects. It’s exciting to see a studio of talented people getting to flex on something wholly original for the first time in so long.</p><p>Druckmann told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/arts/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-druckmann.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/arts/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-druckmann.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The New York Times</em></a></span> that the studio had “earned” the space to make something new after the success of <em>Uncharted </em>and <em>The Last of Us</em>, both of which have gone on to become multimedia franchises Sony has pushed into other mediums. I’m not thrilled to hear that Naughty Dog is seemingly attaching the same aspirations to <em>Intergalactic</em>, as Druckmann says that the studio is now primed to be “an I.P. powerhouse.” I could see it becoming tethered to this game just as it has been to <em>Uncharted </em>and <em>The Last of Us</em>. After the end of <em>Uncharted 4</em>, that series could (and should) go away, but if it’s just going to be replaced by another decades-long franchise that Naughty Dog returns to every other game, I hope it doesn’t also mean the studio won’t be free to explore its next big idea for another console generation or two. It seems safe returns to profitable franchises that are harvested again and again for every drop of profit that can be extracted is all big companies want right now, though</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280"><em>Astro Bot</em></a></span><em> </em>launched this year, and despite being a tribute to PlayStation history, was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150">notably lacking in PS5 games</a></span> to celebrate.

Here’s that trailer, which you might have missed if you were watching as it got somewhat buried under all the <em>other </em>big reveals of the night. </p><p>If you’re a <em>Turok</em> fan like me, after watching this trailer your probably had a similar question: Wait, this is a third-person shooter? And yes, it is. In a new post on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/13/turok-origins-announced-for-ps5-first-gameplay-details/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/12/13/turok-origins-announced-for-ps5-first-gameplay-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Official PlayStation Blog</a></span>, Saber Interactive game director Jesus Iglesias explained why they made the shift to third-person, considering the classic franchise is mostly known as an FPS series. </p><p>“We’re all big fans of the previous games and the franchise overall,” said Iglesias. “But ultimately we wanted to explore a different direction from the previous <em>Turok </em>titles.”</p><p>“Saber has a rich history of making third-person shooters and our experience in that space gives us a unique opportunity to evolve the franchise while keeping familiar elements that make for a great <em>Turok </em>experience. We’ve created a fresh take on the classic <em>Turok </em>franchise that fans both old and new will enjoy.”</p><p>I guess it does make sense that Saber Interactive, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/world-war-z-is-almost-the-left-4-dead-successor-ive-wan-1834174006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/world-war-z-is-almost-the-left-4-dead-successor-ive-wan-1834174006">who previously developed <em>World War Z </em></a></span>and this year’s well-reviewed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fwarhammer-40000-space-marine-2%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fwarhammer-40000-space-marine-2%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Space Marine 2</em></a></span><em> </em>(both third-person shooters), would go that direction with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fturok%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fturok%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Turok</em></a></span>, but it still seems odd to me. However, I loved <em>Space Marine 2</em>, so I’m still excited to play <em>Turok: Origins</em>. </p><p>As for just how this latest <em>Turok </em>ties into the bigger franchise, Saber Interactive isn’t ready to say, but does suggest it will have some connections. Iglesias also confirmed that while <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://turokorigins.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://turokorigins.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Turok: Origins</em></a></span><em> </em>supports co-op, like <em>Space Marine 2</em>, it can be played solo as well. </p><p>The shift to third-person is unexpected, but I suspect fans will be more open to this entry in the series than the last new release, which was 2019's cuddly isometric action game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/G2rJYBOIAxo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/G2rJYBOIAxo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Turok: Escape from Lost Valley.</em></a></span><em> </em></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
