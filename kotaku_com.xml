The show doesn’t directly follow the plot of the novels, but does reunite the cast of the 2010 live-action adaptation to voice their movie characters in the series. <em>Kotaku</em>’s Kenneth Shepard called it a  “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/scott-pilgrim-takes-off-netflix-ramona-backlash-1851043407&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/scott-pilgrim-takes-off-netflix-ramona-backlash-1851043407">hilarious blend of the [franchise’s] quick wit and well-measured pop culture references</a></span>.” But sadly, the series won’t be getting a second season. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859334007319822535&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859334007319822535" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On November 20</a></span>, to mark the one-year anniversary of the premiere of <em>Scott Pilgrim Takes Off</em>, series creator O’Malley tweeted that it was “an honor to work with all of the cast &amp; staff around the world”  and called the series “a one of a kind miracle.” The creator also confirmed that Netflix had recently passed on a second season of the animated adaption. </p><p>“Anyway, we were recently informed that the show will not return,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859336990405296142&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859336990405296142" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said O’Malley</a></span>. “As you know, we only intended one season, and called in a lot of favors to make it happen, so making more would have been nearly impossible. Still, I know some of you have been holding out hope.” </p><p>“Sorry to all Matthew fans and Gideon fans, I know you will suffer the most,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859337323307262361&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/bryanleeomalley/status/1859337323307262361" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added O’Malley in a follow-up</a></span> to the tweet confirming the news that there would be no second season. </p><p>While some fans were upset with the Netflix show and how much it deviated from the original graphic novels, many others were happy to get a new story featuring these characters. For now, it seems that’s the end of this chapter of the franchise, despite a post-credits scene included in the final episode of <em>Scott Pilgrim Takes Off. </em></p><p><em>&nbsp;.</em><br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While no one associated with the episode explicitly tells us what happens that makes it so bloody, the descriptions we have gotten may be enough to give us a hint. Executive producer Dave Wilson says, “Pac-Man is Joe Pesci and the swordsman is Guy Pearce in <em>Memento.” </em>Seeing how Pesci almost exclusively plays homicidal hotheads, and Guy Pearce strangles a man to death in <em>Memento</em>, the 10-minute <em>Pac-Man</em> episode may just live up to its bloody hype if that comparison holds true. </p><p>As surprised as you may feel about a violent <em>Pac-Man</em> story, the people behind it point out how the original game isn’t all that innocent. JT Petty, teleplay writer of the <em>Pac-Man</em> episode, describes the game as essentially “eating pills in a labyrinth while you’re being chased by ghosts,” in a world where the ghosts’ eyes return to the center of the game to regenerate and repeat the destructive cycle. </p><p>When you look at <em>Pac-Man</em> that way, you can see how there could be a darker side to it; a darker side we’ll have our still-attached-to-our-heads eyes glued to when the episode releases in December.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The final mission, called Here Lies the Abyss, ends with a big decision between leaving Hawke or a Grey Warden ally in the spirit realm called the Fade to fight a demon as the rest of the team escapes. Depending on choices made in <em>Dragon Age: Origins</em>, that ally can potentially be <em>Origins</em> party member Alistair, <em>Origins </em>villain Loghain, or Stroud, a supporting character from <em>Dragon Age II</em>. The person who stays behind is presumed dead, but according to <em>The Veilguard</em>’s art book, BioWare considered bringing whoever you chose back as an ally. </p><p>One piece of concept art in the book shows someone—a pretty generic character who I would not immediately recognize as Hawke or any of the potential Grey Wardens—in what looks like the Fade. The character has glowing yellow eyes and a wolf approaching them, and the caption reads: “What if we return to the Fade and rescue whoever was left behind? How would their time in that alien landscape change them, and what insights could they offer into Solas’s plans?”<br></p><figure id="" data-id="9368fb506b1190627b53dd3d39a17a04" data-recommend-id="image://9368fb506b1190627b53dd3d39a17a04" data-format="png" data-width="650" data-height="366" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Concept art for Dragon Age: The Veilguard depicting a person with glowing yellow eyes being approached by a wolf." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Concept art for Dragon Age: The Veilguard depicting a person with glowing yellow eyes being approached by a wolf." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9368fb506b1190627b53dd3d39a17a04" data-recommend-id="image://9368fb506b1190627b53dd3d39a17a04" data-format="png" data-width="650" data-height="366" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Concept art for Dragon Age: The Veilguard depicting a person with glowing yellow eyes being approached by a wolf." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If this had come to pass, anyone who’d left Hawke in the Fade back in <em>Inquisition </em>would get two old heroes showing up in their <em>Veilguard </em>playthrough. The Inquisitor’s role changed throughout development, as evidenced by early concept art of players working for the <em>Inquisition</em> protagonist, but they always seemed to be part of the story. Hawke, however, doesn’t appear at all in <em>The Veilguard</em>, and is only mentioned in passing a few times so as to keep their fate in <em>Inquisition </em>ambiguous.

Just what it will mean for gamers around the world, however, may not be clear for some time. </p><h2 id="h186606"><a id=""></a>A History Of Streaming</h2><p>For about 20 years now, companies have been trying (and mostly failing) to let gamers stream console and PC titles via the internet without having to download anything. As early as 2005, a service called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-cluster&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-cluster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">G-Cluster</a></span> was  offering this. Perhaps you’ve heard of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnLive&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnLive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OnLive</a></span>, which let players stream games from big publishers starting around 2009. (Both services are now defunct.) </p><p>However, things didn’t start heating up in the video game streaming space until <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Now#:~:text=PlayStation%20Now%20was%20launched%20in,coming%20later%20in%20the%20year.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Now#:~:text=PlayStation%20Now%20was%20launched%20in,coming%20later%20in%20the%20year." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2014 and the arrival of Sony’s PlayStation Now service</a></span>. That was the first time one of the bigger players really got involved. In the decade since, Xbox has started offering more ways to stream games, Sony has expanded its offerings, and Amazon, Google, and Nvidia have hopped into the streaming wars, too. (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stadia-google-refund-cloud-streaming-assassins-creed-1849597014&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stadia-google-refund-cloud-streaming-assassins-creed-1849597014">Google’s Stadia service famously flopped</a></span> and is no longer around.) </p><p>Through all of this, streaming games has never felt like it was really a <em>thing</em>. It was an option, sure, but I rarely met anyone who used these services. It seemed like a neat idea, but not something anyone was really using.</p><p> That’s changed recently, however, as I now know more people who stream games on their phones and other devices. This shift has happened as Xbox has ramped up its cloud streaming offerings alongside Sony and the other tech giants. </p><h2 id="h186607"><a id=""></a>Xbox and PlayStation expand their streaming services</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps-portal-new-update-cloud-streaming-ps5-beta-test-1851703376&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps-portal-new-update-cloud-streaming-ps5-beta-test-1851703376">On November 19</a></span>, Sony announced that its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-ps5-resell-ebay-sold-out-restock-1851031015&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-ps5-resell-ebay-sold-out-restock-1851031015">PS Portal</a></span> handheld device would now be able to stream some games without a console. Xbox has been letting players do that for a few years now, letting you stream Game Pass titles on your phone or browser. But on November 20, the day after Sony’s announcement, Xbox declared it was also going to start letting people stream games they own on supported devices. </p><p>Game streaming is now a part of many different video game ecosystems. You can stream Xbox titles on your phone, and PlayStation games on your PC. Some publishers have even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-trilogy-comes-to-switch-via-cloud-stream-1847800725&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-trilogy-comes-to-switch-via-cloud-stream-1847800725">released streaming-only games on the Nintendo Switch</a></span> to get around the aging console’s weaker specs. It’s clear that cloud streaming is no longer an oddball experiment, but instead a key part of multiple company strategies moving forward. </p><p> “Our biggest growth in Xbox players is on PC and cloud,” Xbox boss Phil Spencer told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/xbox-console-future-cloud-ceo-phil-spencer-1235166597/#:~:text=Speaking%20about%20consoles,in%20more%20places.%E2%80%9D&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/xbox-console-future-cloud-ceo-phil-spencer-1235166597/#:~:text=Speaking%20about%20consoles,in%20more%20places.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Rolling Stone</em> in a recent interview</a></span>. </p><p>“The console space isn’t growing, across all of them. We love those customers, but in terms of continuing to expand and grow Xbox, it’s about PC, it’s about cloud, and it’s about making our games more available in more places.” </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-says-it-will-soon-reveal-agressive-plans-for-cloud-gaming/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-says-it-will-soon-reveal-agressive-plans-for-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In May 2023</a></span>, PlayStation’s then-CEO Jim Ryan said during a business call that “cloud [gaming] will be fundamental” and explained that Sony has “fairly interesting and quite aggressive plans to accelerate our initiatives in [game streaming].” </p><p>Amazon, one of the biggest companies around, is investing heavily into streaming with its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tweaktown.com/news/91358/activision-ceo-says-amazon-luna-has-the-most-game-streaming-customers/index.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/91358/activision-ceo-says-amazon-luna-has-the-most-game-streaming-customers/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">own Luna service</a></span>, which lets you play big and small games across multiple devices.

A lot of people, both inside and outside these tech companies, seem to expect cloud streaming to become more and more popular in the coming years.</p><p>In 2024, more people are playing games via the cloud. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1760300717334462498&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1760300717334462498" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox boss Phil Spencer said in February that at least 10 percent</a></span> of all hours spent on Xbox are now via players streaming games on their phones or other devices. It makes sense that as games get bigger, consoles get more expensive, and phones get better, a lot of people might decide to just stream the latest <em>Call of Duty </em>or <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> instead of spending money on a new console, downloading the game, and playing it in one spot. </p><p>Anecdotally, a lot of younger people I know stream games on their phones and prefer it over playing with a controller or keyboard on their TV or PC. That might send a shiver down your spine, but the reality is that this is our future. I don’t think offline games are going away, but it’s clear that as console sales stagnate, cloud gaming looks like a potential goldmine to big game companies, publishers, and tech giants, if they can make the tech work and keep their costs reasonable.</p><p>Today, I know plenty of people who stream games via Xbox cloud or their PS Portal. I’ve now started streaming some games to my phone when I’m lazy and just want to do some grinding in an RPG or online game. It’s easier than ever and works better than it once did, too.
