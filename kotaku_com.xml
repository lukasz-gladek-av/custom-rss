              <p>Premium brands love charging $100, $200, even $300 for Bluetooth speakers but a lot of the time, you’re paying for the label more than the performance. If you want real bang for your buck, the <strong>Anker Soundcore 2</strong> is a fantastic choice. Now, with <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4189/">Amazon dropping the price from $45 to just $29, this deal is too good to pass up</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4189/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Pocket Powerhouse That Delivers Where It Counts</h2>
<p>The Soundcore 2 isn’t your average small speaker: Inside its <strong>compact body hides a powerful 12W output</strong>, delivered through dual neodymium drivers engineered to produce rich sound even at higher volumes. One of its standout features is the BassUp technology which selectively boosts low frequencies in real time and makes bass tones punchier without causing distortion.</p>
<p>One of the big concerns when buying a portable speaker is durability and resistance to weather conditions: The <strong>Soundcore 2 handles that with an IPX7 rating of waterproofing</strong>. It’s a level of protection that can keep it underwater for full submersion up to 1 meter for 30 minutes. It also makes it easy to clean it up—just wash off and go.</p>



<p>Anker’s famed power management combined with a 5,200mAh lithium-ion battery<strong> lets this speaker run for up to 24 hours on a single charge</strong>. That’s enough to last a full day of work or travel without constantly hunting for an outlet. Plus, <strong>fast charge technology</strong> means you’re back to full power quickly and makes it ready for your next adventure.</p>
<p>Portability is never sacrificed: Tipping the scales at <strong>about half a pound </strong>and measuring small enough to fit into backpacks, purses, or big pockets with ease, it fits easily in your pocket. The looks are clean and minimalist, and the controls are uncomplicated enough that anyone can become familiar with them quickly. And talking of Bluetooth, the new <strong>Bluetooth 5.0 standard ensures reliable and low-latency connections</strong> with your device and improved range.</p>
<p>If expensive Bluetooth speakers are out of your budget, then this Anker Soundcore 2 deal shows you don’t have to take out a second mortgage on a quality portable speaker that’s rugged, sounds great, and plays all day on one battery charge.</p>

              <p>Avast is one of the true giants in cybersecurity today, trusted by over 435 million users worldwide. As a core part of Gen Digital (which also owns Norton, AVG and Ccleaner), the company has long been synonymous with free antivirus software. However, in the face of increasingly aggressive and sophisticated cyber threats, Avast has evolved: The days of relying on freeware antivirus are numbered; Avast is now leading the way with robust pay-for security solutions that are <strong>designed to guard all devices and every corner of a user’s online life</strong>.</p>
<p>The cybersecurity landscape in 2025 is overwhelming. Microsoft and Identity Theft Resource Center data show that more than 600 million cyberattacks took place globally per day throughout last year. Nearly two billion people had data exposed in breaches. The bad guys aren’t even just going after big business: the primary targets are regular folk, with cyber thieves going far beyond mere viruses to steal identities, bank account data, and more using sophisticated malware and fraud.</p>

Paid subscriptions include a smarter and more comprehensive solution, way beyond yesteryear malware scanning.</p>
<p>A premium choice is <strong>Avast Premium Security</strong>. At <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3817/">a massive 60% discount dropping the first year down to a mere $31 (previous price being $78)</a>, it’s an affordable option that secures one device with premium features. Members are provided with virus, ransomware and phishing protection. It scans Wi-Fi networks to detect vulnerabilities and ensures your digital life remains unscratched by bandits looking to exploit your system. Regardless if you’re a PC, Mac, Android, or Apple user, this offer gives you the essential and robust security.</p>

<p>Add more, and <strong>Avast Ultimate</strong> has it all from Premium Security with extras such as <a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-vpn/avast-vpn-vs-nordvpn">the Avast SecureLine VPN</a>, which encrypts your internet connection to shield your surfing and keep it private. For $43 after a discount of 60% compared to $109, you get Cleanup Premium as well which maintains your devices in smoother operation by clearing out garbage and streamlining their performance. AntiTrack technology silently in the background prevents trackers and conceals your online identity from snoopers’ view, an essential privacy feature in today’s data-driven world.</p>
<p>In a world where hacks and scams get increasingly formidable by the minute and the consequences of compromised data pile up,<strong> Avast’s premium security subscriptions are basic insurance</strong>. They give you so much more than traditional antivirus solutions: <strong>they safeguard your entire digital existence</strong> and provide you with the comfort of mind not just for yourself but for your family and devices as well.</p>

              <p>Not everybody can afford $500 or $1,000 for an iPad or iPad Pro, but if seeking a decent everyday use alternative, <strong>Amazon’s Fire HD tablets</strong> are certainly well worth a look. They cover all the bases for general use and currently, Amazon is discounting the price by nearly 40% so the <strong>Fire HD 10</strong> is pretty much impossible to ignore: At a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4205/">price that has dropped to $89 from $140</a>, it’s a chance to enjoy a quality tablet without the usual premium.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4205/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Tablet that Gets Big Features at a Budget Price</h2>
<p>The Fire HD 10 has <strong>prioritized speed and simplicity</strong> with 25% more performance than its previous generation through an octa-core processor and 3 GB of RAM. It means streaming, reading, browsing and gaming all happen without frustrating lags or delays. Its <strong>10.1-inch full HD screen is rich with clean 1080p images</strong> and brings colors and details in sharp brightness. Whether binge-watching your favorite <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/netflix">Netflix</a> shows or flying through work, the screen makes every frame count.</p>



<p>Battery life is a smart friend in this case as it <strong>lasts up to 13 hours of normal usage</strong>. Yes, extended trips or days without a plug will not leave you stranded. Storing-wise, <strong>there’s 32 GB as base</strong> (expandable with a microSD card up to 1 TB), a whole book collection of apps, videos, and books in your hands. The aluminosilicate reinforced glass toughens the screen and withstands drops better than most of the competition, including the Samsung Galaxy Tab A8.</p>
<p>The 5 MP front-facing camera is a welcome added feature for day-to-day video chats or social media content creation without needing to use special gear. And when inspiration strikes, the Fire HD 10 supports the Made for Amazon Stylus pen which recognizes over 4,000 levels of pressure for flowing, natural writing or drawing (bit it is sold separately).</p>
<p>If spending a big amount of money on an Apple tablet is not feasible but frequent use of a tablet is, this Fire HD 10 deal is difficult to pass up.</p>

              <p>Portable monitors are a game changer when you need some extra screen space but can’t lug around a bulky setup. Picture this: a screen that’s just a bit wider and heavier than a regular notebook in your backpack, giving you plenty of room to work or unwind wherever you are. This <strong>Arzopa 16.1″ portable monitor fits right into that sweet spot</strong>. And the best part? Amazon is running an early Prime Day deal that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4204/">slashes the price to about $76 after a 30% coupon, down from around $110</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4204/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bigger Screen and Brighter Colors</h2>
<p>This Arzopa design has also bumped up the screen size from 15.6 inches (which is typical for so many portable monitors) to 16.1 inches. That extra inch of screen space makes more of a difference than you might think: i<strong>t gives you a more natural 16:9 ratio</strong> that is easier on the eyes and perfect for streaming your favorite shows.</p>
<p>Quality is not just a matter of size. The monitor uses an I<strong>PS panel with crisp 1080p full HD resolution</strong>. It also gains color accuracy with a comprehensive 100% sRGB gamut that renders images with rich, real-life colors. Thanks to a 1000:1 contrast ratio, dark areas are deep and detailed and the light areas glow, a wonderful option for anything from creative work to Netflix bingeing.</p>



<p><strong>At 1.7 pounds and 0.35 inches thin</strong>, this monitor is easily stashed away in bags. Its slivers of a bezel pack more screen into smaller space, and the <strong>fold-out kickstand</strong> so you don’t require any other hardware to prop it up.</p>
<p><strong>Both USB-C and mini HDMI connections</strong> let you plug it into laptops, phones, game systems, and more at a snap. There are a few display options like duplicate, extend, or as a second display, so you can configure your workflow or entertainment center without a single hassle. Plug and play is trouble-free as it plays right away out of the box.</p>
<p>If you’ve been craving a little more screen real estate, this early Prime Day deal is a perfect chance to grab one of the most premium portable monitor without a hefty price tag.</p>
