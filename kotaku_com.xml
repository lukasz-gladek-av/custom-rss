              <p>Apple products can come a little pricier then some of its peers. Though, most users find them worth it for their reliability, ease-of-use, or, in some cases, because you bought an iPhone 4s over a decade ago and now have just gotten too used to the Apple ecosystem to migrate out of it. No shame, I’m describing myself too. Apple stuff is simple, it does what we expect them to too, and it integrates easily with all our other Apple crap. That’s why its always nice to see when some of these iPhones, Macs, or AirPods get hit with a big discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4755/">Right now, Amazon has the Apple AirPods Max over-hear headphones on sale for 22% off</a>. Now, 22% may not sound like a lot at first, but that shakes out to a savings of $119. It brings the price down from $549 to just $430 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4755/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Apple AirPods Max are a stylish pair of over-the-ear headphones which are capable of high-fidelity audio thanks to the help of the H1 chip alongside Apple’s dynamic driver. These headphones are able to produce sound that can adjust itself in real-time to follow along with you. It does so by tracking your head position so it feels like you are in the pit at your favorite concert venue. And with support for Dolby Atmos, you’ll be hearing rich and detailed audio for certain songs, movies, or shows.</p>
<h2>Active Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>Enjoy pro-level active noise cancelling when using the Apple AirPods Max so you can focus on only the sound you want to hear. Turn off the distracting noises coming from your environment, whether that’s a loud roar of a plane turbine or a chatty office of co-workers.</p>



<p>Battery life is reliable. The Apple AirPods Max will grant you with a solid 20 hours of listening time off of a single charge. That should be enough to get your through your flight or day at the office, no problem.</p>
<p>The limited time discount isn’t available with all color options unfortunately. If you were eyeing either the orange or starlight versions of Apple’s premium line of headphones, you’re in luck. Those are the two seeing the full $119 discount. The other color options are all still on sale, just not for as much. You can pick up the black or blue model of the Apple AirPods Max for $49 off at $500 even or the purple version for $20 off at $529.</p>

              <p>No one likes to deal with low storage, and sometimes even a terabyte or two just isn’t enough to keep up with everything you need to save. If you’re after a long-term fix and your storage needs have outgrown the usual upgrade options, the Seagate Expansion 14TB external hard drive might be just what you need.</p>
<p>It usually runs you around $300, but right now, you can grab it for $230 on Amazon, after a 16% discount from its regular price. This is the lowest price we have seen it go for in a while, but the offer is going to end soon. Get your orders in before the price shoots back up!</p>

<h2>Massive Storage for All Your Old and New Files</h2>
<p>14 terabytes is no joke. That’s enough capacity to house hundreds of movies, a million photos, and numerous work documents for years to come. If your storage needs are consistently growing (as everyone else’s) and you don’t want to find yourself in the same situation every few months, this is a nice long-term solution. Think having your entire digital library – both old and new stuff – in one portable build that goes wherever you do.</p>
<p>Getting started is simple. Plug in the adapter it comes with, connect the USB 3.0 cable, and it’s ready to go. File transfers are quick as well. Grab all that you need to transfer, drag it over it, and drop. It works well with both Windows and Mac, but Mac users will need to reformat it for use with Time Machine. There are no complicated drivers or setup procedures to worry about. It literally takes a few minutes to get everything going, even if it’s your first time with an external drive.</p>



<p>You’re also getting Rescue Data Recovery Services with the purchase. In case of water damage or a natural disaster, Seagate’s team can help recover your important files in no time. Included in the box are a Seagate Expansion desktop drive, an 18-inch USB 3.0 cable, an 18W power adapter, and a quick start guide.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’re looking for a storage solution that can take care of all your old and new data, this 14TB SSD will be a great addition to your work setup. The storage capacity is massive, so you won’t have to worry about running out of space again for years to come. The offer ends soon, so be sure to act fast to grab it for less.</p>
