              <p><span>The Analogue 3D, a premium gaming console that’s fully compatible with Nintendo 64 games, just got</span> <a href="https://www.analogue.co/editions/3d-prototype"><span>a new line</span></a><span> of translucent colorways replicating five colors that were prototyped for the N64 but never released. The new Analogue 3D: Prototype Editions follow the limited release of Analogue’s Funtastic line, which replicated the N64’s Funtastic colorful translucent shells last December and </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnalogueInc/comments/1pj8cgh/analogue_3d_limited_editions_what_sold_out_first/"><span>sold out</span></a><span> in less than two hours.</span></p> <p><span>The new limited edition line comes in five colors: Ghost, in sea glass (and the star of the show, in my opinion); Glacier, in milky white; Atomic Purple, in deep plum; Extreme Green, in, you guessed it, neon green; and Ocean, in cobalt.</span></p>   <p><span>“Five colors were officially prototyped for the original Nintendo 64,” the company writes. “Unreleased. Until now. They were real. They were manufactured. They were never released.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The company continues, “Analogue 3D: Prototype Editions finally release these lost colors as limited editions. History, finished. Decades later.”</span></p> <p><span>The unreleased N64 colors were </span><a href="https://consolevariations.com/blog/5-rumored-n64-prototypes-finally-discovered"><span>discovered</span></a><span> in 2019 by Console Variations, after a former Nintendo of Europe employee contacted the site. This little piece of lost video game history will be restored for the lucky customers who manage to get their hands on the new line before it sells out.</span></p> <p><span>The “highly limited” Analogue 3D: Prototype Edition consoles will be available for purchase on Monday, February 9 at 8 a.m. PST, and will ship within 48 hours. They will retail at $299.99.</span></p>

 <p><span>In partnership with Analogue, 8BitDo is releasing a series of matching controllers for the new Prototype console line. The controllers will also be available for preorder on February 9 at 8am PST, though they won’t ship out until April. The controllers will be sold (separately) for $44.99.</span></p>

 <p><span>In addition to the Analogue 3D, the console maker also sells the Analogue Pocket, a handheld compatible with games for the Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance (though it’s currently out of stock).&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The Analogue 3D is available in standard Black and White for $269.99, with matching 8BitDo controllers sold separately for $39.99.</span></p>
