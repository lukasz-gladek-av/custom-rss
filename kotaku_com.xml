            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Kylo Ren/Ben Solo actor Adam Driver recently revealed that after working on the sequel trilogy of <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-new-jedi-order-writer-replaced-rey-delayed-1851747797"><em>Star Wars</em> films</a>, he and acclaimed director Steven Soderbergh pitched a new <em>Star Wars</em> movie to Lucasfilm. But because the movie was set after <a href="https://kotaku.com/well-okay-lets-talk-about-star-wars-the-rise-of-skyw-1840561224">2019’s<em> Rise of Skywalker</em></a> and starred Ben Solo, who dies at the end of that film, Disney allegedly passed on the project, which was tentatively named <em>The Hunt for Ben Solo.&nbsp;</em></p> <p><a href="https://apnews.com/article/adam-driver-star-wars-soderbergh-jarmusch-4e08164d0419759f1b5b50d69864975d">In a new interview with the <em>Associated Press</em>,</a> Driver talked about his career, his love of working with talented filmmakers, and the struggle to get projects funded and approved. And during this conversation, he talked about a previously unknown<em> Star Wars</em> film that he and Soderbergh were pitching to Lucasfilm and Disney around 2021.</p>

 <p>“I always was interested in doing another <em>Star Wars</em>,” Driver told the <em>AP</em>. “I had been talking about doing another one since 2021. [Lucasfilm] had reached out. I always said: With a great director and a great story, I’d be there in a second. I loved [Kylo Ren] and loved playing him.”</p>

  <p>So Driver teamed up with director Soderbergh and Rebecca Blunt to create an outline for a film that would star Ben Solo, the son of Han Solo, who in the sequel trilogy has fallen to the Dark Side and become Kylo Ren. However, by the end of <em>The Rise of Skywalker,</em> Solo has redeemed himself, turned good, and eventually sacrifices his life to save Rey’s. Apparently, according to Driver, Lucasfilm execs loved it. So the group hired Scott Z. Burns to write a full script, which Driver told the <em>AP</em> was “one of the coolest (expletive) scripts I had ever been a part of.” Next, it was time to pitch the movie to Disney. And that’s when it all fell apart.</p>

 <p>“We took it to [Disney CEO] Bob Iger and [Disney co-chairman] Alan Bergman, and they said no,” said Driver. “They didn’t see how Ben Solo was alive. And that was that. It was called <em>The Hunt for Ben Solo,</em> and it was really cool. But it is no more, so I can finally talk about it.”</p>

 <p>The AP reached out to Soderbergh, who confirmed Driver’s story and added, “I really enjoyed making the movie in my head. I’m just sorry the fans won’t get to see it.”</p> <p>According to Driver, the plan was to be “judicial” and “economical” with the proposed film’s budget, and for it to be in the “same spirit” <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-and-worst-parts-of-every-star-wars-movie-1850406311">as older <em>Star Wars</em> movies</a>, which are “handmade and character driven.” But sadly, Disney didn’t want to bring back Ben Solo. Meanwhile, remember when Disney brought the fucking Emperor back to life because it gave up on the sequel trilogy’s main villains halfway through? We live in the worst timeline.</p>

              <p>If you’re rushing to grab the latest round of free-ish games included in October’s PS Plus Extra or Premium bundle, you might want to slow your horses slightly and double-check that you aren’t about to accidentally lose your ownership of one of the games forever. Due to an ongoing bug with the PlayStation’s current subscription service, if you previously picked up PS Plus Essential’s giveaway of <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em> in 2022, downloading it again today will erase your license to own it completely!</p> <p aria-label="Post Title: Fun fact: The Crew 2's &quot;Offline Mode&quot; still requires the Internet, and is unplayable during the AWS blackout. (As well as Settlers and probably 90% of Ubisoft's singleplayer games)" aria-describedby="feed-post-credit-bar-t3_1obfk0e">This issue is pointed out by <a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2025/10/21/ps-plus-extra-essential-yakuza-like-a-dragon-game-license/"><em>PlayStation Lifestyle</em>‘s Zarmena Khan</a>, who has been trying to raise awareness of this hefty problem ever since Sony relaunched its PS Plus service three years ago. It boils down like this: Back in the day, when you downloaded the monthly freebies from PS Plus Essential, they were yours to keep for so long as you maintained your subscription. It was a great deal, and made logging in at the start of a month—well—essential. However, in 2022 this changed, with PS Plus shifting to be more like Microsoft’s Game Pass, such that the games are only accessible to play so long as they remain a part of the PS Plus catalog. Once they’re gone from there, you can no longer play them without paying for the full version. The problem is, if you picked up a game via the Essential service and then re-download it via the modern PS Plus, your original license is permanently overwritten and you’ll lose access to a game you previously owned once its time on the sub comes to an end. And that’s pretty bad!</p>

 <p aria-label="Post Title: Fun fact: The Crew 2's &quot;Offline Mode&quot; still requires the Internet, and is unplayable during the AWS blackout. (As well as Settlers and probably 90% of Ubisoft's singleplayer games)" aria-describedby="feed-post-credit-bar-t3_1obfk0e">This month makes this issue particularly relevant, with <em>Yakuza: Like a Dragon</em>, which was originally given away as part of PS Plus Essential in August 2022, now available in the catalog. Reddit user kabirsingh84 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PlayStationPlus/comments/1obn64b/reminder_if_you_claimed_the_ps_plus_essential/">first raised the concern yesterday</a>, reminding people that the PS Plus Extra version that arrives today will delete your license.</p>

   <p>So before you grab it—and indeed any other game added to the PS Plus subscription—make sure to check your library to see if you picked it up any time before 2022. It’s so easy to have grabbed all three games in any given month, forgot you ever did, and then too easily lose your ongoing right to play it.</p> <p>Of course, this all shines a bright light on the degree to which <a href="https://kotaku.com/california-ab-2426-digital-games-the-crew-new-law-psn-1851659641">we increasingly don’t own the majority of the games we play, or even buy</a>, as consumer rights are eroded by deeply dubious digital licenses.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-quietly-clears-out-galaxy-s25-edge-512gb-before-the-black-friday-rush-while-apple-sticks-to-full-price.1330426/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As the name implies, the Samsung Galaxy S25 Edge is slim. It measures in at under a quarter inch thick. Beyond that, you’re getting the quintessential Samsung Galaxy experience with this phone.&nbsp;The Samsung Galaxy S25 family of phones come in a few different storage capacity options plus a whole slew of colors, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4899/">but right now the Edge model with 512GB is deeply on sale. You’ll save 40% on the specifically the titanium silver and titanium jet black options</a>. They normally go for $1,220, but the discount brings them down by $490. That makes it so you only have to pay $730 for a limited time.</p>
<p>Just because this model phone is extra thin, doesn’t mean it’s sacrificing any toughness. Each is made with a durable titanium build along with a Corning Gorilla Glass Ceramic 2 face.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4899/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Superior Photography</h2>
<p>Despite how thin the phone is, the S25 Edge is still able to pack in Samsung’s powerful 200MP camera. You can capture every stunning detail with the highest resolution camera on any Galaxy phone. It also includes and ultra wide auto-focus 12MP camera plus the 12MP selfie camera on the front.</p>
<p>One of the more practical uses of Galaxy AI integration in the S25 Edge is when it comes to the camera. The Samsung smartphone employs a feature called Best Face. You ever set up to take a group photo, snap a bunch in a row, then look back through them only to see there’s something wrong with each of them? Maybe Jolie blinked in the first, then Daniel got distracted and turned his head in the next. None of them are post-worthy. Well, Best Face can intelligently take everyone’s best look across all the photos and stitch them together into one perfect shot. It only takes a few seconds and can provide results for group photos of up to five people.</p>



<p>Selfies are also elevated when taken on the Galaxy S25 Edge. Galaxy AI can recognize your environment’s lighting and capture accurate skin tone, balancing the levels on the fly without any extra editing.</p>
<p>Finding photos through your camera roll has also been made easier. If you’re trying to find a specific pic you took, you can just describe it in your search to have Galaxy AI dig through your photos to bring you to it. Like maybe you dress your dog up as a Dracula for Halloween but you don’t remember what year that was. Just type in “vampire dog” and it should come up.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-society-battle-connoisseurs-jacinthe-2000637284"><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>franchise</span></a><span> is an excellent propaganda machine. Thanks to the anime focusing so heavily on the powerful bond between </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389"><span>Ash and his starter Pokémon, Pikachu</span></a><span>, everyone feels like they </span><i><span>have </span></i><span>to love their first partner in each game. These cute little guys are typically given to you by a professor, and they serve as an early foundation for the rest of the team you’ll build out over the course of the game. But sometimes, you’ll boot one of these games up and realize you don’t like any of your options. Then you’re stuck with this hangnail of a Pokémon you don’t really care about. Friends, what if I told you that there’s another option? One that most trainers, chained down by sentimentality, never even consider? Put that little shit in the box and catch your actual fave.</span></p> <p><span>Every time a new </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game comes out, fans decide which of the three starter monsters they’ll be taking out on their adventure. These fire, water, and grass-type Pokémon are meant to give new players a sense of the series’ rock-paper-scissors-style types and weaknesses, and usually end up being faces of the franchise for a few years until the next game comes out. The </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>games, however, have handled this a bit differently. Instead of three new critters to start your journey with, these experimental spin-off RPGs bring back old starters from previous games, but with a new twist. </span><i><span>Arceus </span></i><span>gives Rowlet, Cyndaquil, and Oshawatt’s final stages regional variants, and </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>gives Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile Mega Evolutions.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>, however, has gotten a bit of flak for its starter choice which includes Chikorita and Tepig, arguably two of the least popular starters in </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>history even though they are both my special babies who have never done anything wrong. So if you fire up a new </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game only to find yourself greeted with three Pokémon you’re not particularly thrilled about, are you just forced to use them for several dozen hours? No, my friend. That’s just what Big Pokémon Company wants you to think.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000005417" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000005417"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000005417">The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>While I’ve never boxed a starter during my initial playthrough, I’m no stranger to treating my game-sanctioned first partner like any other Pokémon on my team. That’s because the second I boot up one of these games, I’m looking for my real starter: a Pichu or PIkachu. My favorite Pokémon is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-alolan-raichu-quest-how-to-get-mega-2000637259"><span>Raichu</span></a><span>, and because it’s the evolved form of the series’ mascot, my basic ass has the wonderful privilege of knowing my favorite boy is going to be in most games (we don’t talk about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/only-three-pokemon-are-catchable-in-every-game-but-not-1850461272"><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White</span></i></a><span>). So every time I pick a starter in these games, I know they’re going to end up playing second fiddle to my electric rat. I learned at an early age that I don’t have to believe the lie that my starter has to be my best friend, because they’re often just a placeholder for the little yellow guy in my mind. That was true in </span><i><span>Z-A</span></i><span>. I picked Chikorita, and when he evolved into Meganium, he was a surprise MVP of my playthrough thanks to the new grass/fairy-type Mega Evolution. But even though my time in Lumiose City began with this Pokémon, he didn’t </span><i><span>have </span></i><span>to be in my party any longer than it took me to catch another critter. In fact, most games barely acknowledge the starter after you initially get one.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, we have one of the more underwhelming starter line-ups ever, at least for people who hate good and cute babies like Chikorita and Tepig, with Totodile being far and away </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/over-half-of-you-are-picking-totodile-as-your-pokemon-legends-z-a-starter"><span>the most popular of the trio</span></a><span>. What if you don’t need a water-type Pokémon in your party because your favorite is Gyarados? Did Totodile’s ugly </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>Mega Evolution after it becomes Feraligatr</span></a><span> put you off the blue dude altogether? The secret no one at Game Freak wants you to know is that you can put that little guy in a box and make a party that has no starters in it at all. Hell, take it a step further and release that red-headed stepchild back into the wild. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-crossdress-clothing-options-gender-2000637336"><span>Taunie and Urbain</span></a><span> don’t have to know you sent their Pokémon down the street with a bindle. Break free of the chains of decades of Ash and Pikachu brainwashing and write your own story.</span></p>

              <p>Dating isn’t easy. Especially if you happen to be a poor female soul cursed with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/21/magazine/men-heterofatalism-dating-relationships.html?utm_source=newsshowcase&amp;utm_medium=gnews&amp;utm_campaign=CDAQspWt0aOL99lsGPeQp6Hnw_mspQEqDwgAKgcICjCO64oDMJavPA&amp;utm_content=related&amp;gaa_at=g&amp;gaa_n=ASWzDAj2070ceV5niWLiExz7RE6uqIscvHvFTwlASZjfdaIZDJ2TwX8FRRCWk55LxUyicaxQPQ25azo74ocH5pU8rHhCmNd0l0SrXjkLvZyd&amp;gaa_ts=68817188&amp;gaa_sig=FDeQQB0pPPY6GmEQ04nFWesgmVcQDaCT4UAJeHrOWle61WGf2D-tp0pqldaLrNruTgZ6mi9JxAvwOFLYbm0xWQ%3D%3D">wanting to date men</a> (it’s me, I am poor female soul). When they don’t seem checked out, they’re busy telling you the elaborate details of how their marriage collapsed over intimacy issues. Or confiding in you about their secret plans to make everyone in their polycule very unhappy. Maybe they won’t stop talking about video games (which can go either way, really). Or, as upcoming indie narrative game <i>DateBoy</i> simulates, maybe the guy you’re dating won’t stop <i>playing</i> video games. Ugh, my eyes are up here, buddy.</p> <p>Developed by brothers Anton and Henri Pätsi, <i>DateBoy</i> casts you in the role of a boy on a date at an Italian restaurant who is Checked Out™, too busy playing video games under the table while his off-screen date struggles to carry on a conversation. It’s a free narrative game out on Steam and Itch.io next month and it looks delightfully amusing. Check out <a href="https://youtu.be/Ezkq3qqwUu4">the trailer here</a>:</p>

  <p>Essentially you play as a dude on a date, trying to play a platformer that bears a passing resemblance to <i>Gimmick!</i> on a device that’s probably legally distinct from a certain beloved late ‘90s handheld console. While hopping around in the platformer, you’ll have to try and keep up with the usual, tired dating conversational topics such as “How was your day?” with opportunities to deliver those one-word answers that us girls <i>love </i>hearing on a night out.</p> <p>Oh well. At least there’s pizza.</p> <p>The game promises to be no longer than half an hour. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4022300/DateBoy/">The Steam listing</a> makes for an amusing read, too. So if you’re looking for what seems to be a cute narrative joint, maybe mark this one on your calendar and try not to stand it up.</p>

              <p>Not a fan of bulky, tower desktops but still want something powerful enough to handle everyday work and play with ease? The Acemagician M1 mini PC does all that and more, and you can now grab it without paying the full price at Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4898/">The retailer has slashed 35% off this compact powerhouse, bringing the price down to just $299</a>. That’s a solid deal for a model this packed, but it won’t be around for long. Get your orders in before the price shoots back up, or the stock ends for good.</p>

<h2>No-Fuss Build, But No Compromises on Performance</h2>
<p>The size is small, but don’t let it fool you. You’re getting an AMD Ryzen 7 6800H processor with speeds up to 4.7GHz. It features Hyper-Threading technology, so using creative, resource-intensive applications and running multiple programs at once won’t be an issue. Expect around 8–11% better CPU performance and up to 50% improved GPU performance compared to the previous-gen Ryzen 7 5800H.</p>
<p>For memory, there’s a nice 16GB of DDR5 RAM. It’s enough to keep the PC running smoothly during most everyday tasks, but you also have the option to expand it up to 64GB if your needs grow. Storage comes in the form of a 512GB PCIe SSD, offering ultra-fast load times and sufficient capacity for all your essentials. Keeping all your favorite movies and important documents in a single place won’t ever be a problem. Need more room? Add a 2.5-inch SSD and expand storage up to 4TB.</p>



<p>Port-wise, you’ve got five USB 3.2 ports, plus a USB-C Gen 2 port that supports 10Gbps transfer speeds, PD charging, and 4K display output via DP1.4. There’s also a 2.5G RJ45 Ethernet port for blazing fast wired connections, alongside Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.2 for when you want to keep things wireless. In total, you can add up to three 4K displays simultaneously using the HDMI, DisplayPort, and USB-C outputs.

If missed out on this two-day sales even hosted by Amazon to save on some cool things you didn’t know you needed, you’re not out of luck just yet. Some select deals have extended past the sale and are still discounted right now. Take a look at this Anker USB-C docking station. It’s not just a docking station as it doubles as a stand to put your monitor on. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4158/">For the time being, Amazon still has it going for 32% off. That discount brings the price down from $250 to just $170. You’re saving yourself a solid $80.</a></p>
<p>What we’re looking at is a 12-in-1docking station that can turn your messy and clutter-filled desk into an organized space that feels good to sit and work at. It can hold up your monitor with it’s shelf-shaped design while leaving enough room below to fit your keyboard when it’s not needed. Push it underneath when you’re leaving your desk or if you’re like me and you’ve just grabbed yourself some lunch while watching a long YouTube video.</p>

<p>Raising your monitor can also promote better posture while seated, even if just by a few inches. It encourages you not to hunch yourself over at your desk, keeping the screen at eye-level.</p>

<p>Across the top, you’ll find a wireless charging pad to set down your phone so it can recharge while you’re working. As far as data transfer goes, the two USB-C ports and three USB-A ports are capable of speeds of up to 10Gbps.</p>
<p>Tucked underneath the docking station is a sizeable compartment which you can funnel cables into, helping to eliminate clutter caused by disorganized cables just laying where they fall.</p>
<p>Designed with tough aircraft-grade aluminum, the docking station proved durable. Beneath the legs are some anti-slip silicone pads which keep it firmly in place. All and all, the work station measure in at 21.26 inches by 8.66 inches by 3.54 inches<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4158/">.
