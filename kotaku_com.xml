              <p>Happy Silksong Weekend to all who celebrate. If you’re not playing the most anticipated game of the decade right now, I can only imagine it’s because you don’t own any gaming console or PC to play it on. So, here! Let me help you. <strong>The Xbox Series S is a wonderful option for an entry-level game system and right now it happens to be on sale</strong>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3931/">It’s MSRP is $380, but for a limited time, you can grab one for 13% off at just $329.</a></p>
<p>Now for the elephant in the room… Back when the Xbox Series X and Series S first launched in 2020, the latter of which was priced at just $300. A few months back, Microsoft made and announcement confirming plans to raise the price of its consoles and games. The Xbox Series S went up by $80 to $380. So while this discount brings console down lower than the current list price, this Series S is still $29 more than it had been for five years (ignoring any other discounts over that time). It stinks, but it is what it is.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3931/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>All-Digital Gaming Console</h2>
<p>This model comes with a controller and hold 512GB. It’s disc-free so you’ll be downloading all your games onto that internal storage or onto an external SSD which you can purchase separately. It may not have 4K gaming, but it can still produce higher than standard HD resolution at 1440p. Plus, it’s got HDR support to ensure that the darks look dark and the bright colors pop. It can handle refresh rates of up to 120FPS so performance is still pretty great.</p>
<p>Like it’s counterpart, the Xbox Series X, this console has a feature called Quick Resume. No longer do you need to worry about finding a save point when you want switch to a different game. You can suspend your gameplay in the background, hop into something else, then return to it later right where you left off. My apologies to any game dev who works on title screens because I only ever see those once.</p>



<p>Quick Resume is possible because of the Xbox Velocity Architecture, which also allows for super-fast load times.</p>
<p>You can enjoy streaming your favorite TV shows and movies right on the Xbox Series S. Download apps like YouTube, Netflix, HBO Max. While your games are locked to 1440p, you can still stream video from Disney+, Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and more in full 4K.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3931/">For a limited time, the Xbox Series S is down to just $329.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you found that headline confusing, try to imagine the constant bemusing misery that arrives at the door of seemingly the only other Mark Zuckerberg, an attorney who is finding his life made increasingly complicated by the shared name. So even though it’s not actually Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg that’s suing Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta, the mop-haired billionaire remains the cause of the consternation, because for Indiana lawyer Mark Zuckerberg, sharing the Facebook creator’s name is causing him massive issues in both his work and personal life, and indeed costing him lots of money.</p> <p><a href="https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/04/mark-zuckerberg-sues-mark-zuckerberg/">As reported by&nbsp;<em>TechCrunch</em></a>, Mark S. Zuckerberg—a bankruptcy attorney from Indiana—is repeatedly having his paid-for Facebook posts removed by Meta, and his accounts closed down, on the inaccurate basis that he’s falsely impersonating Mark E. Zuckerberg, co-creator of Facebook—and he’s not getting his money back. He’s had enough.</p> <p>Speaking to Indiana’s WTHR, Mark S. explained that he and Facebook’s Zuck are the only two people he can find who share the name, meaning his situation is rather unique. Four times Facebook has suspended the attorney’s business account and deleted his firm’s advertisements, based on the belief that he’s deliberately trying to pass himself off as the tech billionaire, and then failing to return his resulting lost costs. So this Zuckerberg is now suing that Zuckerberg to get his money back, his legal fees paid, and potential lost money as a result of Meta’s actions.</p>

  <p>“All my competitors advertise on Facebook,” says our new favorite Mark Zuckerberg, “so I have to do it too.” Speaking to the Indianapolis news station, he says he pays for ads, “they take my money, but then they shut me down.”</p> <p>Meta gave a statement to WTHR saying, “We know there’s more than one Mark Zuckerberg in the world and we are getting to the bottom of this.”</p>

 <p>Mark S. Zuckerberg’s life isn’t only affected in this way. It seems sharing his name with one of the most controversial figures in the world comes with a personal cost, too. He has in fact <a href="https://iammarkzuckerberg.com/">dedicated an entire website to the topic</a>, on which he talks about how even his personal Facebook account has been suspended five times, despite providing three forms of identification each time he re-opens it, and when it’s working he’s the constant target of hacking attempts, while his phone blows up with notifications every night. (Dude, come on, just turn the notifications off. And don’t even have the app on your phone. No one should. It’s looking at data from all your other apps.) His office receives daily phone calls from furious people demanding tech support, and he says he “routinely” receives death threats and harassment via Messenger.</p> <p>In fact, at one point he was <a href="https://iammarkzuckerberg.com/docs/20250821111936235R.pdf">accidentally sued by the State of Washington</a>, which somehow mistook him for the other guy. And that must suck. Short of changing his own name (and really, the world should surely be able to cope with two people using it), he’s left resorting to legal action to at least not have it cost him money. Oh, and the attention it’s attracting in the press probably won’t do him much harm, either.</p> <p>Mark S. Zuckerberg’s site ends on a lovely note:</p> <p>“Like I said, I don’t wish Mark E. Zuckerberg any ill will at all. I hope the best for him, but let me tell you this: I will rule the search for ‘<a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=mark+zuckerberg+bankruptcy&amp;aq=f&amp;aqi=g1&amp;aql=&amp;oq=&amp;gs_rfai=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mark Zuckerberg bankruptcy</a>‘. And if he does fall upon difficult financial times, and happens to be in Indiana, I will gladly handle his case in honor of our eponymy.”</p>

              <p>The Switch 2’s game key cards have <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-key-card-game-cart-physical-list-confirmed-1851777742">proven a source of extreme consternation</a> since the launch of Nintendo’s latest console. Physical carts in plastic boxes that don’t actually contain the game at all, making a mockery of game preservation and the entire purpose of owning a physical copy of your game. The reason for their use is usually presumed to be cost, given how expensive a 64GB Switch card is for a publisher (apparently $23 each!), and that Nintendo <a href="https://gamerant.com/nintendo-switch-2-cartridges-new-size-capacity/">right now</a> is not offering a smaller option to publishers. However, in the case of Ubisoft’s <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> it seems it’s&nbsp;due to a more significant weakness of the Switch 2.</p> <p>So far, tech geeks are super-impressed with how Ubisoft has managed to get such a large, complex open-world game working on the handheld console. As much of a step up from the original Switch as the Switch 2 might be, it’s still not exactly cutting-edge technology, and the requirements to be able to run on a handheld device can be restrictive. So great work by all involved! However, <em>Outlaws</em> has become yet another entry in the very long list of games releasing with nothing but a game key on an otherwise blank cart, and understandably people are narked about spending $60 to buy a pile of empty plastic.</p> <p>More than anything else, it’s the knowledge that Nintendo absolutely&nbsp;<em>will</em> one day switch off the eStore that processes the keys to allow the games to be downloaded. As with every previous generation of digital store, the servers will go away, and the purchased games will disappear into the ether. This leaves people either looking at emulation (which Nintendo deeply loathes), or re-buying the same game again when it’s released as a “Classic” download on the newer device (where, hilariously, Nintendo makes it available via emulation). This all enormously sucks. So yes, one day your copy of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> Switch 2 will be nothing but a very bad-tasting SD card.</p>

 <p>Except, it seems in this particular instance this isn’t an act of cost-cutting on a premium-price game. (For whatever reason, <a href="https://gamerant.com/nintendo-switch-2-max-cartridge-size/">Nintendo has only offered 64GB cards for the Switch 2</a>, driving up production costs and encouraging many to resort to key cards instead.) However, according to Rob Bantin (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/ubisoft-employee-explains-why-star-wars-outlaws-is-a-game-key-card">thanks <em>Nintendo Life</em></a>), the audio architect on <em>Outlaws</em>‘ engine Snowdrop, it’s because the streaming speeds between the Switch 2 carts and the console just aren’t fast enough to run the game properly. And that seems like it could be a big deal.</p> <p><em>Digital Foundry</em>‘s John Linneman <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dark1x.bsky.social/post/3lxx7nqqits2t">posted on BlueSky</a> to report how impressed he was with the port, reposting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8m_cu6LfAuA"><em>VGC</em>‘s video about the tech</a>, adding that&nbsp;<em>DF</em> has its own video on the way. Others replied, one person pointing out that the game is somehow only 20.2GB, but another expressing disdain that it’s a key card. After a bit of back and forth, Rob Bantin entered the conversation and revealed all.</p>   <p>“Snowdrop relies heavily on disk streaming for its open world environments,” said Bantin. “And we found the Switch 2 cards simply didn’t give the performance we needed at the quality target we were going for.” In other words, the game needs to be fully installed on the console’s SSD drive to be able to run properly. The audio architect continued, “I don’t recall the cost of the cards ever entering the discussion – probably because it was moot.”</p>   <p>It’s hard to know how big of an issue this is going to be for the Switch 2 over the next seven or eight years of its likely life, but given a 2024 port can’t run off the card because of speed limitations, other larger, open-world games could share some similar issues. We’re talking about games releasing in 2030 after all. However, Bantin offers some optimism. “I think if we designed a game for Switch 2 from the ground up it might have been different,” he added. “As it was, we’d build [sic] a game around the SSDs of the initial target platforms, and then the Switch 2 came along a while later. In this case I think our leadership made the right call.”</p>

 <p>We’re stepping beyond my nerdy understanding here, but from my research the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lwgdn433kc27">Switch 2 cards are limited</a> to 400MB/s transfer rates, while the <a href="https://www.thessdreview.com/our-reviews/sd-express/nintendo-switch-2-powered-with-silicon-motion-sm2708-sd-express-controller-for-800mb-s-speeds/#:~:text=The%20Nintendo%20Switch%202%20console,the%20normal%20NVMe%20SSD%20protocol.">Switch 2’s SSD can offer close to 900MB/s</a>. So that’s a obviously a significant difference. However, it’s crucial to note that&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> runs from its game card at 400MB/s, and there are few complaints there. So if games are intentionally designed for the Switch 2’s card limitations, this might not be a frequent issue? But, again, it does mean that releasing a cross-platform game could require a huge amount of heavy lifting to make a version that runs from a card, when the PlayStation, Xbox and PC versions will all be installing to SSD. (Why Nintendo doesn’t allow SSD installation from game cards is another massive question, and seemingly a very obvious solution.) And, let’s not forget, the Switch 2 will be overlapping the second half of its life with the inevitable PlayStation 6 and Xbox Series 2.</p> <p>It’s all a pretty pickle for developers looking to release big games on the Switch 2, without pissing off audiences and rendering their games ethereal.</p>
