She is the next person to take on the Avatar title after Korra in the previous series, but the title is not one of honor at this point in history, as it has marked the new hero as a destroyer of worlds. The official synopsis is as follows:</p><p>“A young Earthbender discovers she’s the new Avatar after Korra – but in this dangerous era, that title marks her as humanity’s destroyer, not its savior. Hunted by both human and spirit enemies, she and her long-lost twin must uncover their mysterious origins and save the Seven Havens before civilization’s last strongholds collapse.”</p><p>The image shown at Comic Con has the new Avatar front and center, alongside a feline companion and another character named Jae, who is described as Pavi’s mentor.</p><figure id="" data-id="d4a14144c3c29c07df60b36107e118fd" data-recommend-id="image://d4a14144c3c29c07df60b36107e118fd" data-format="jpg" data-width="3441" data-height="1933" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pavi, Jae, and a feline companion look over a desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pavi, Jae, and a feline companion look over a desert." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nickelodeon</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d4a14144c3c29c07df60b36107e118fd" data-recommend-id="image://d4a14144c3c29c07df60b36107e118fd" data-format="jpg" data-width="3441" data-height="1933" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Pavi, Jae, and a feline companion look over a desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Seven Havens</em> will premiere in 2027 on Nickelodeon and span 26 episodes across two seasons.

This PMC will be a part of the game’s multiplayer mode, too. Despite the trailer being all about the campaign, it’s clear that this time around EA and series creator DICE—which is part of a larger group of teams working on <em>BF6 </em>known as Battlefield Studios—are aiming for a grounded, contemporary military sim. This is unlike recent <em>Battlefield</em> entries like <em>BF2042</em> and <em>BFV</em>, which either focused on the past or the future. This is good. <em>Battlefield 3 </em>and <em>4 </em>are probably the best games in the series. I just hope that after launch, <em>BF6</em> avoids becoming an IP slop shop like <em>Call of Duty </em>and other big shooters have.</p><p>These days, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crossover-skins-destiny-2-witcher-halo-rainbow-six-bad-1851039973?_gl=1*52m3rn*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTMzODI0MDkkbzY3JGcwJHQxNzUzMzgyNDA5JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crossover-skins-destiny-2-witcher-halo-rainbow-six-bad-1851039973?_gl=1*52m3rn*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTMzODI0MDkkbzY3JGcwJHQxNzUzMzgyNDA5JGo2MCRsMCRoMA..">it seems like every major live-service shooter is filled with crossover skins</a></span>. I’ve been playing <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> recently, after its big update, and was shocked and horrified to be killed by a person dressed as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zRanYrbVBA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zRanYrbVBA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rick from <em>Rick &amp; Morty </em>during a match</a></span>. Later, I killed Master Chief and Lara Croft. The gritty, tactical aesthetic Ubisoft had spent years creating was ruined and the game felt like a joke. </p><p>A similar thing has happened to <em>Call of Duty,</em> which continues to introduce sillier and weirder skins, including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjaKA57mnu8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjaKA57mnu8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beavis and Butthead</a></span>. Even <em>Destiny </em>has decided to ruin what was one of the most unique and interesting sci-fi universes in decades by shoving <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-destiny-2-renegades-trailer-release-date-1851779376&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-destiny-2-renegades-trailer-release-date-1851779376"><em>Ghostbusters</em>,<em> Star Wars</em></a></span><em>, </em>and more into the game. </p><p>Look, I get it. <em>Fortnite </em>makes a lot of money. And it relies heavily on IP crossover skins with various movies, TV shows, and other games. The thing is, <em>Fortnite </em>has always been a weird cartoon playground that felt more like a toybox than a real world. So I don’t mind the Predator, Peter Griffin, Hatsune Miku, and Godzilla hanging out together. It’s a horrible, but impressive, pop culture nightmare. And it doesn’t need to be copied by every other live-service game around. </p><p>My hope for <em>Battlefield 6</em> is that EA realizes the opportunity they have with this new game. Every one of your competitors, big and small, has made a deal with the devil and added crossover cosmetics and goofy skins in the pursuit of <em>Fortnite</em>-like profits.</p><figure id="" data-id="1d66d7459ba3cee8a05db231907939e3" data-recommend-id="image://1d66d7459ba3cee8a05db231907939e3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1d66d7459ba3cee8a05db231907939e3" data-recommend-id="image://1d66d7459ba3cee8a05db231907939e3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And EA and Battlefield Studios have a chance here to go in a different direction. To take a different path with <em>Battlefield 6</em> and its cosmetics. </p><p>Don’t ruin the game’s aesthetic and grounded tone by adding Spider-Man or whatever; instead, focus on adding content that fits within the universe and doesn’t distract during battles. Add more camo options. More tactical vests and goggles. New weapon attachments and boots. It might not be as flashy as, say, adding The Thing from <em>Fantastic Four</em> into the game, but it will preserve <em>BF6</em>'s tone and look. </p><p>I think if EA goes this route, it could differentiate this new <em>Battlefield </em>game from the upcoming <em>Call of Duty</em> and all the other free-to-play live-service shooters out there in 2025. And these days, that could be the key to building a large and loyal audience. Better yet, it means I won’t have to get picked off by someone dressed as Batman or Darth Vader while trying to capture an objective. Doesn’t that sound nice? Imagine a game with a distinct and consistent art style. It’s not impossible. It could happen. And I hope EA and Battlefield Studios realize that and keep the slop out. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-crossover-skins-rick-morty-call-of-duty-1851786919]]></content:encoded>
