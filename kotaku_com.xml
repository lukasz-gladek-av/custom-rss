              <p><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-5-tactica-tactics-rpg-review-switch-1851020804"><i><span>Persona 5</span></i></a> <span>collaboration was announced </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-18-persona-collaboration-skins-joker-2000619195"><span>shortly before the game’s current season began</span></a><span>, and at the time, we didn’t know who would be dressing up as a Phantom Thief in Blizzard’s hero shooter. I’ve grown increasingly tired of how Blizzard has turned </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>into </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> with all these licensed crossovers replacing its own iconography and worldbuilding, but I’m also a </span><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>superfan, and I get to be a mark sometimes. Today, Blizzard announced the five heroes who will be suiting up as the vigilante high schoolers, and while I’m excited that one of my mains is getting a collab skin, I’m also glad to see that Kiriko, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-kiriko-mercy-venture-reaper-season-12-skins-1851626893"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s teacher’s pet</span></a><span>, is nowhere to be seen this time around.</span></p> <p><span>Blizzard showed off Wuyang, Genji, Lifeweaver, Mercy, and D.Va sporting costumes based on the Phantom Thieves. These will all be available tomorrow, September 16, and they look, well, pretty much exactly like the characters they’re referencing. There are some interesting details, though, such as the rose petals falling from Mercy’s wings, which are evocative of Ann’s Persona Carmen; Lifeweaver’s flower-petal back piece, meanwhile, has some of Yusuke’s iconography attached to it, and D.Va’s mech has been made to look like Makoto’s motorcycle Persona, Johanna. The full rundown:</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Wuyang as Joker (Ren)</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Mercy as Panther (Ann)</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Lifeweaver as Fox (Yusuke)</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>D.Va as Queen (Makoto)</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Genji as Skull (Ryuji)</span></li> </ul> <figure id="attachment_2000625741" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625741"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625741">© Blizzard Entertainment / Atlus</figcaption></figure> <p><span>These skins will likely come with other cosmetics, but Blizzard hasn’t revealed those yet. When the collaboration was first teased, we saw what appeared to be a highlight intro based on </span><i><span>Persona 5</span></i><span>’s All-Out Attack animations, so we’ll see if all five characters get that, or just Wuyang. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/in-defence-of-persona-5-s-ryuji-1797700262"><span>Ryuji</span></a><span> is my favorite </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>character, so I wish I played Genji, but I do play Lifeweaver, so I will be donning the Fox mask for a few matches later this week.</span></p>

              <p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> was one of the most surprising announcements to come out of last week’s Nintendo Direct. It’s yet another remake for the often overlooked PS1-era Japanese RPG, and it’ll arrive amid a recent influx of other<em> Dragon Quest</em> remasters. This one has my full attention, though, and not just because the original game is a sprawling adventure I’ve always wanted to go back to and properly finish. It’s also the art style, which moves past the recent obsession with HD-2D pixel art glow-ups and offers a blueprint for how to revive tons of other beloved JRPG classics.</p> <p>The new “hand-crafted” aesthetic is more akin to the toys-and-dioramas-style visuals of<em> Yoshi’s Woolly World</em> or the<em>&nbsp;Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em> remake than what we’re used to getting from Square Enix. <em>Dragon Quest VII</em> <em>Reimagined</em> sits somewhere between the HD-2D retro sensibility of last year’s excellent <em>Dragon Quest III</em> remake and the hyper-realistic, Unreal Engine visuals of the <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>remake trilogy, with detailed graphics that exaggerate the storybook whimsy of Akira Toriyama’s original designs rather than running away from them.</p> <p>The big secret to this new look? Scanning actual dolls. Hi-res captures of IRL toys for characters like Hero, Kiefer, and Maribel helped ground the new art style while retaining all of the whimsy. “For this game, we scanned figurines, like this one here, to create the in-game models,” the remake’s producer said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTTfUC4MUZs">a short overview</a> with series creator Yuji Horii. “They’re very well done. Using a graphical aesthetic we call the ‘diorama style,’ we’ve depicted the stories and the characters’ emotions in an entirely new way.”</p>

 <p>The game isn’t far away either. It comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Switch 1, and Switch 2 on February 5, 2026 (one small bummer is that the Switch 2 physical version is a game key card only and progress <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1nfv3i9/dragon_quest_vii_reimagined_the_switch_2_version/">doesn’t transfer</a> between the two console generations).</p>  <p>Alongside exploring dungeons, engaging in familiar turn-based battles, and tinkering with a meaty job system, <em>Dragon Quest VII</em> revolves around an island-hopping adventure that sees its heroes time-traveling between the past and present as they confront the Demon Lord Orgodemir. It’s a very, very long game, clocking in at up to 100 hours just for the main story. Despite the heft, it was mostly overlooked when it first came to PlayStation due in part to its dated-looking graphics. It didn’t get localized in the West until 2001 after the PS2 was already out and just a month before the arrival of <em>Final Fantasy X</em>.</p>

 <p><em>Dragon Quest VII</em> got a second look when it was remade for the 3DS in 2013 as <i>Dragon Quest VII: Fragments of the Forgotten</i> <em>Past</em>. It completely overhauled the graphics into 3D polygons and abridged much of the story to shave dozens of hours off the average runtime. <em>Reimagined</em> will make further improvements, including an even more streamlined story and new quality-of-life features like a redesigned UI to make the game easier to navigate. But the most pivotal change will probably be the new “Moonlighting” mechanic that lets characters use abilities from two different jobs simultaneously.</p> <p>We’ve seen Square Enix take all sorts of different approaches to reviving its back catalog in recent years. While <em>FFVII</em> got the full remake treatment, other PS1 games like <em>Chrono Cross</em> and <em>Legend of Mana</em> have simply received HD resolution boosts and additional features that would be considered barebones even by the standards of a third-party emulator. Then there’s stuff in the middle like <em>Dragon Quest III</em> and <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> which are ground-up overhauls that still try to remain as faithful the originals as possible.</p> <p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em><em>&nbsp;</em>offers a fourth alternative that would be perfect for other games like the original <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, which Toriyama also designed the characters for. It even looks perfect for seemingly impossible-to-remake RPGs from other publishers like <em>Earthbound</em>. Players have been sharing fan art of that SNES classic in the style of <em>Reimagined</em> for decades now. We even recently <a href="https://noisypixel.net/earthbound-clay-figure-set-hobonichi/">got new clay models</a> of the main cast that are perfect for scanning. I hope the <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined </em>model proves to be viable for projects beyond Square Enix, though I could certainly see it working for something like the long-rumored <em>Final Fantasy IX </em>remake as well.</p>

              <p>Massive game install sizes and the diminishing role of physical media continue to be frustrating. This time around, <i>Final Fantasy VII Remake</i>’s Switch 2 “physical version” is in the crosshairs. A “Game-Key Card,” <i>Remake</i>’s physical Switch 2 release contains no data itself but will initiate a massive download that’ll Kirby up a ton of the Switch 2’s otherwise generous built-in storage capacity.</p> <p>Despite having a pretty-looking case design, <i>FF7R</i> will ship on Switch 2 with a card that merely serves as a physical license to download a whopping 90GB (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-on-switch-2-is-a-game-key-card-thatll-fill-a-third-of-your-consoles-storage-space">h/t <i>Eurogamer</i></a>), which is around a third of the spacious (or so we thought) 256GB storage capacity of the Switch 2. But as Switch 2 connoisseurs will point out, Square Enix probably didn’t have much choice. The maximum size of an actual physical Switch 2 game is only 64GB. While file compression can work wonders, <i>FF7R</i> with its <i>Intergrade</i> expansion is just too damn big to fit on a cart.</p> <p>As our comrades at <i>Eurogamer</i> wonder, however, is this Nintendo’s fault for “not offering larger game cards?”</p>

 <p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-physical-games-ps6-all-digital-disc-drive-2000625699?mrfhud=true">PlayStation Only Made 3 Percent Of Its Money From Physical Games Sales Last Year</a></p> <p>I’m going to actually say yes to that question. After all, the Switch 2 is clearly making a play to be the premiere place to go for AAA experiences on handhelds–and it’s got the horsepower to do it, as we’ve seen with <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465"><i>Star Wars Outlaws</i></a> and even <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>.</p> <p>At the time of this writing, one can buy a 256GB SD card for peanuts (if peanuts is just $25 to you), so why are the Switch 2’s carts limited to just 64GB? It feels like an arbitrary decision that, if Nintendo was invested in physical media and the ability to play a game on a dedicated <i>handheld </i>device without any internet connection whatsoever, it would have made efforts to solve–especially for ambitious (and very good!) games like <i>FF7R</i>.</p> <p>And let’s be honest, 90GB isn’t uniquely large when it comes to AAA games. It’s early days for the Switch 2, so what’s this problem gonna look like as games only continue to bloom in size?</p>
