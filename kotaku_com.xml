              <p>Tom Rothman, CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group, told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RIBjgm-DdY"><em>The Town with Matt Belloni</em></a> that Sony’s Spider-Man Universe isn’t dead, but it is, as Belloni put it, getting a “fresh reboot” with “new people.” This comes after the box-office and critical bombs of <em>Morbius</em>, <em>Madame Web</em>, and <em>Kraven the Hunter </em>over the last three years.</p> <p>The backlash to <em>Morbius</em> and <em>Madame Web</em> alone was enough for <a href="https://kotaku.com/kraven-the-hunter-spiderman-jc-chandor-1851707831"><em>Kraven the Hunter</em> director J.C. Chandor to plead before the film’s release</a>, “People have got to give us a chance and come out and support this film, and literally try to wash away some of the other stuff that’s happened. Give our film a chance.” But <em>Kraven</em> turned out to be just as bad as the others. Even the most successful films of the bunch, <em>Venom</em>, <em>Venom: Let There Be Carnage</em>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/venom-last-dance-knull-explained-spider-man-marvel-1851647953"><em>Venom: The Last Dance</em></a>, have been embraced more for their unintentional camp than their actual quality.</p>

 <p>The reboot strategy is one that Sony has tried before with their Marvel characters, and it didn’t go particularly well last time. After producing three well-regarded Spider-Man movies directed by Sam Raimi between 2002 and 2007, the studio brought Marc Webb on to helm a reboot series in 2012. Only two out of the planned three movies were ever made. After that, Sony collaborated with Disney to bring Spider-Man into the massively successful Marvel Cinematic Universe, even though Sony owns the film rights to the character. It was, as Belloni said in the interview, “kind of a tail-between-the-legs moment to have to go to Disney and say, ‘Listen, we kind of ran this into the ground, we need you to bring this back.'”</p> <p>Rothman disputed Belloni’s accounting of how the Disney deal went down, arguing that the MCU crossover has been hugely successful for Sony, but it’s hard to ignore the evidence that Sony has struggled to figure out how to make a good comic book movie on its own. Rothman didn’t share any other details about what a rebooted SSU might look like.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Avowed Doesn’t Have A Typical Romance Mechanic, But That Makes Its Romantic Moments Hit Even Harder]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/avowed-romance-mechanic-rpg-kai-2000673362</link>
            <guid>1445404</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>In the lead-up to the February 2025 release of action RPG </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525"><i><span>Avowed</span></i></a><span>, developer Obsidian Entertainment warned players not to expect any romance in the game. “We are building thoughtful relationships with our companion characters,” game director Carrie Patel told </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/obsidian-explains-why-avowed-wont-let-you-romance-your-companions"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span> a full year before its release. “Ultimately, I personally am a fan of making [romance] an option, but I feel like if you’re going to do it, you really, really have to commit and make sure that you’re giving all to fulfilling that in a way that feels both true to the character, but also creates an engaging player experience. So not something we’re doing for </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>, but I wouldn’t say never.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>This didn’t come as much of a surprise; though there have been sporadic dalliances with romance in Obsidian’s back catalogue, most notably in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pillars-of-eternity-ii-the-kotaku-review-1826397542"><i><span>Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</span></i></a><span>, the company has largely eschewed the mechanic, even as it grew in popularity in both the genre and the industry as a whole. So it was a welcome surprise when it turned out that there was, in fact, romance in </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>—but not in the way players would have expected.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span> handles romance very differently from most other Western RPGs, and if players went into the game expecting the genre-typical smorgasbord of horny, fuckable party companions, they would have been sorely disappointed. Instead, there’s just one romance in </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>, and it’s composed of only a handful of lines of dialogue and a brief mention in the epilogue. The storyline is more about the romanceable character’s emotional growth and development than their physical attraction to the player character. </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span> takes a mechanic that can often feel tacked-on and makes it an integral part of the story. It does exactly what Patel said a good video game romance should—and it’s a breath of fresh air compared to genre norms.</span></p> <h2><strong>How most Western RPGs handle romance</strong></h2> <p><span>We have one-time Western RPG powerhouse BioWare to thank for pioneering romance mechanics in the genre. The studio first introduced romanceable companions in 2000’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-ii-is-still-one-of-the-greatest-rpgs-ever-1278311582"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate II: Shadows of Amn</span></i></a><span>, and further refined their house style with the </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span> franchises. A “BioWare-style RPG” has become shorthand for a particular type of game that emphasizes player choice through customizable blank-slate player characters, dialogue options, and branching storylines, and features a large cast of attractive NPCs who you can recruit to join your party and eventually romance.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>That “blank slate” approach to romance in RPGs eventually became the de-facto standard industrywide, with games like CD Projekt’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-the-kotaku-review-1845946628"><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i></a><span> and Larian Studios’ </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i></a><span> carrying on the tradition. The benefit of that approach is that it can be genuinely fun to blow off steam in between high-risk missions by exchanging witty, flirty banter with a hot companion. But there are drawbacks to that method, too. As Patel explained to </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-arent-there-romances-in-avowed-obsidian-explains"><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i></a><span>, “The more you introduce romance as a mechanic, and the more that you build systems around it, and metrics, and ways for players to bolster and measure their affinity and affection level with other characters, the more it becomes something people engage with as a system rather than as a relationship.” Building an intimate relationship gets boiled down to completing a sidequest checklist, and it can make what should come across as a genuine connection between two characters feel hollow instead. So while BioWare-style RPGs have become known for their inclusion of romance mechanics, it’s pretty rare that the storylines that result from those mechanics actually feel romantic.</span></p>

 <h2><strong>What makes <i>Avowed</i> different</strong></h2> <p><span>In </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span> you build your own custom character, an envoy from the Aedyran Empire sent to the lawless Living Lands to investigate rumors of a plague known as the Dreamscourge. In the Living Lands, you recruit four NPCs for your adventuring party, of which you can bring two at a time to explore with you.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>So far, so BioWare. But the companion chats at camp in </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span> never take a turn for the romantic. In most similar RPGs, a conversation between the player character and one of their companions about training together would probably be laced with innuendo—in fact, a story about how Turians train and prepare for battle is what leads into Garrus’ famous “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlZtNtzmZeY"><span>reach and flexibility</span></a><span>” line from </span><i><span>Mass Effect 2</span></i><span>. However, during an early conversation about training in </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span> between the protagonist and one of their companions, your responses are all focused on what you’d like to improve—learning how to take more damage, strike harder, or a little bit of everything. There’s no hamfisted flirting to be found.</span></p>

 <p><span>As Patel told </span><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/avowed-interview-2024"><i><span>Windows Central</span></i></a><span>, </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>’s companions are “characters who are really tied to the central story [of the game].” The first of those companions you encounter is Kai (voiced by Brandon Keener, who also voiced Garrus in the </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span> series), an aumauan mercenary carrying a lot of baggage from a lifetime of running away. He was a deserter from the Rauatai Navy; he left his subsequent home, Thirdborn, six years ago and never returned, though he’s cagey on the details of his departure. He’s also got some unfinished business with Tama, the deceased leader of his former mercenary squad, that he’s hesitant to talk about. His backstory, which he slowly reveals to you over a series of contemplative fireside chats, is integral to the plot. It’s also a romance.</span></p> <p><span>Over the course of the game, as Kai opens up about Tama, you can help guide him to the realization that Tama was in love with him—and he was also in love with Tama. Though it’s obvious to the player that, before his death, Tama tried to subtly express his feelings to Kai (there’s a full-on oil painting of Kai in Tama’s house, for fuck’s sake), Kai was too oblivious to pick up on his hints. When the game’s main story eventually takes the party to Thirdborn, it forces Kai to confront why he left and never returned: He walked away from Tama when he was on his deathbed, promising to return quickly, but he never did, because he couldn’t stand the thought of watching Tama die.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s only after you help Kai deal with that trauma that something approaching a romance mechanic kicks in. You can tell Kai that you have feelings for him, though, in typical Kai fashion, you need to fully spell it out for him before he understands what you mean—his obliviousness still runs strong, and you get a good sense of how infuriating it must have been for Tama over the years. Kai’s response to your confession ties back into his personal growth; he tells you that he never thought he’d be able to feel close to someone again after losing Tama, and eventually adds, “If you want to be with me after everything you’ve seen—and if you still feel that way once we’ve finished our journey…I want that, too.” And that’s it. There’s no sex scene, not even an embrace or a kiss. Just a quiet acknowledgement that, because Kai was able to deal with his trauma, he’s ready to move on.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>If you choose to romance Kai, you get a short bit of exposition in the epilogue that reflects that as well. “But the most unexpected boon of Kai’s adventures is the romance that blossoms with the envoy. He’d thought his chance at love died with Tama, but after the envoy helped him accept that loss, he realized he’d found another chance with someone who saw him, knew him, and loved him as he was. He wouldn’t let this one pass him by,” it says.</span></p> <p><span>Speaking to </span><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i><span>, Patel explained the hidden romance option. “There’s nothing that says ‘hey this is a thing that can happen’—there’s no system that’s going to track your status with them—but if you’re doing the kinds of things that you would do if you were interested in this character, you’ll probably come across the option by the end of the game. And it should feel natural, organic, and surprising,” she said. By removing the “mechanic” part of the romance mechanic, tying it to Kai’s emotional growth, and making it less about the NPC as a vehicle for pure fantasy indulgence, </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span> does something truly unexpected: It incorporates romance in a BioWare-style RPG in a way that’s actually romantic.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A new digital charity bundle available for the next two weeks includes some fantastic boomer shooters like <em>Selaco, Cultic, </em>and <em>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun. </em>And the whole bundle costs just $17.</p> <p>Over the last few years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/boomer-shooter-retro-fps-dusk-ion-fury-prodeus-1851144571">we’ve seen an influx of retro-inspired first-person shooters</a>, often referred to online as boomer shooters. Not all of them are great. Some are downright terrible. I know, I’ve played a lot of them. Sure, they all include shotguns and fast-moving action. But not all of them feature tight combat and satisfying gunplay. Don’t worry, though, because <a href="https://www.digiphile.co/collections/boomer-shooter-blueprint">Digiphile’s new charity boomer shooter Steam bundle, which is available until March 10</a>, contains only certified bangers.</p> <p>Here’s the full list of what’s in the bundle:</p> <ul> <li><em>Selaco</em></li> <li><em>I Am Your Beast</em></li> <li><em>Mullet Madjack</em></li> <li><em>Beyond Citadel</em></li> <li><em>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</em></li> <li><em>Incision</em></li> <li><em>Cultic</em></li> </ul> <p>All of this for just $17 is wild. You could pick any two of these games and they would be worth that price. But all seven for less than $20 is one of the best deals I’ve seen in a long time. Here are a few of my favorites from this bundle and what I had to say about them previously.</p>

 <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/selaco-gzdoom-engine-fps-steam-review-early-access-1851513067"><em>Selaco</em></a>, a boomer shooter built using the bones of <em>Doom</em></strong><em> – “Selaco </em>is a more polished, well-made, and fun FPS than some AAA shooters I’ve played in recent years developed by massive teams using modern engines and big budgets. And this thing is technically in early access! In fact, I bet as you play&nbsp;<em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>you’ll quickly forget all about its&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>origins as you run around its large, hand-crafted campaign maps filled with different enemies, puzzles, and loads of secrets.”</li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40000-40k-boltgun-review-retro-fps-shooter-1850466690"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</em></a>, a gory retro shooter with modern ideas</strong> – “<em>Boltgun&nbsp;</em>is crunchy and retro in all the right ways, with sliders letting you make the game more or less pixelated or modern-looking. You can, for example, turn off some of the fancier lighting effects and lower the resolution to create a very early ‘90s shooter feel, or turn all that stuff up and get something that looks more like a late-PS1-era shooter.”</li> <li><strong><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/mullet-madjack-anime-fps-roguelike-hades-review-steam-1851475865">Mullet Madjack</a>,</em> an FPS all about killing rich robots</strong> – “In 2024, billionaires and AI have become some of our biggest enemies. So it’s nice to have&nbsp;<em>Mullet Madjack</em>, a game that lets me mow down a bunch of rich-robot assholes using assault rifles and shotguns. It’s even better that the game is one of 2024’s best, thanks to its solid world-building, awesome visuals, and incredibly fast action. The future might suck, but at least it’ll be fun!”</li> </ul> <p>So yeah, great bundle of games. <a href="https://www.digiphile.co/collections/boomer-shooter-blueprint">And the charity that this bundle is supporting</a> is all about helping protect whales and dolphins. Get some great boomer shooters and save a few whales? What more could you ask for?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Switch 2 Nintendo Direct Reveal Is The Newest Contender For Worst Game Of 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/tokyo-scramble-switch-2-worst-game-2026-2000673341</link>
            <guid>1445317</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There’s still plenty of months left in the year for someone to steal </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/code-violet-reviews-metacritic-opencritic-dino-crisis-2000658906"><i><span>Code Violet’s</span></i><span> crown</span></a><span>, but one new game has already come awfully close to its abysmally low review scores. Unfortunately, this one did have a small amount of hype behind it, as some people were genuinely excited about </span><i><span>Tokyo Scramble</span></i><span><em>.</em> The Switch 2 exclusive, </span><i><span>Dino Crisis</span></i><span>-inspired survival horror game was revealed in a Nintendo Direct earlier this month. Now it’s out and getting panned.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As spotted by </span><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tokyo-scramble-worst-reviewed-game-2026/"><i><span>TheGamer</span></i></a><span>, </span><i><span>Tokyo Scramble</span></i><span> was released almost two weeks ago, on February 11, but reviewers clearly haven’t been in too much of a rush to cover it. Perhaps this is due in part to a lack of review codes, a lack of interest, or a combination of the two, but the scattered list of review scores resulted in a grim consensus. The dino horror game earned itself just a 19 percent Critic Recommend score on <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/20062/tokyo-scramble">OpenCritic</a>, and a “Generally Unfavorable” 40 out of 100 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/tokyo-scramble/">Metacritic</a>.</span></p>

 <p><span>On the plus side, because the scores for </span><i><span>Tokyo Scramble</span></i><span> are still trickling out, </span><i><span>Code Violet </span></i><span>has temporarily retaken the throne as the worst-rated game of the year on OpenCritic. A last-minute 66/100 score from </span><i><span>33Bits </span></i><span>helped bump it up to a 48 Top Critic average, a far cry from the 37 score it previously held on February 19, which was three whole points lower than </span><i><span>Code Violet’s</span></i><span> average score. I’m sure that will be great news for whoever decided that </span><i><span>Tokyo Scramble</span></i><span> deserved a spot on Nintendo’s Partner Showcase earlier this month.</span></p> <p><span>One thing that </span><i><span>Tokyo Scramble</span></i><span> does have over </span><i><span>Code Violet </span></i><span>is its user score, which is currently sitting at a respectable 6.6/10 on Metacritic. However, there are only 14 total user reviews for <em>Tokyo Scramble</em> on the site, and the overall score has been slightly influenced by one guy who gave it a 10/10. I’m not usually one to diss random review scores, but that same guy also gave </span><i><span>Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem</span></i><span> a 0/10 for some indiscernible reason. Also, if we’ve learned anything </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-metacritic-cory-in-the-house-ds-game-2000659380"><span>from last month’s</span></a><i><span> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span> vs. </span><i><span>Cory in the House</span></i><span> debacle, it’s that you probably shouldn’t put too much stock in Metacritic’s user reviews.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Everything We Know About Star Wars: Galactic Racer]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/everything-we-know-about-star-wars-galactic-racer-ps5-podracing-multiplayer-open-world-burnout-2000673277</link>
            <guid>1445272</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sure, Jedi and giant space battles are cool and an important part of the<em> Star Wars</em> franchise. But as I’ve said before, <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-games-dont-always-need-to-include-jedi-1840696384">not every <em>Star Wars</em> game needs to include lightsabers and Force powers</a>. Thankfully, later this year, we are getting <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em>, a very different kind of <em>Star Wars</em> game that is promising a fast-paced racing experience similar to past games like S<em>tar Wars: Racer’s Revenge.</em> If that sounds like something you want to know more about, well, just keep on scrolling down to learn even more about <em>Galactic Racer</em>.</p>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/former-burnout-devs-star-wars-racing-game-galactic-racer-2000652809">Announced during the 2025 Game Awards</a>, <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> is a high-speed arcade-like racing game that will feature a full single-player story featuring new and old characters and plenty of different race tracks to speed around on.</p> <h2>When is <em>Galactic Racer</em> launching?</h2> <p><em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> doesn’t have a specific release date yet, but it is scheduled to launch sometime in 2026.</p>

 <h2>What platforms will it be available on?</h2> <p>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>  <h2>Is there podracing in this game?</h2> <p>Yes! Fans were a bit nervous that <em>Galactic Racer</em> might not feature podracing when its first teaser trailer didn’t feature any podracers.<a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-galactic-racer-racing-game-podracing-confirmed-2000665131"> But the devs have since confirmed that yes</a>, it will include podracing, and a new trailer even shows it off. But it should also be clear that this isn’t exclusively a podracing game, but a <em>Star Wars</em> racing game that will let players mix and match different types of speeders and other vehicles together.</p> <h2>Is it true that some former <em>Burnout</em> devs are making this?</h2> <p>Yup. Fuse Games is a studio formed by a bunch of developers who previously worked at Criterion on games like<em> Burnout Paradise</em> and <em>Need for Speed: Most Wanted.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/former-burnout-devs-star-wars-racing-game-galactic-racer-2000652809">So these folks know speed and racing</a>.</p>

 <h2>Is <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> an open-world game?</h2> <p>No! <em>Galactic Racer</em> isn’t an open-world racing game like <em>Forza Horizon</em> or<em> Burnout Paradise</em>. Instead, it is a track-based racer similar to older <em>Burnout</em> titles.</p> <h2>Is there multiplayer in the game?</h2> <p>Yes. <a href="https://www.pcgames.de/Star-Wars-Galactic-Racer-Spiel-75467/News/star-wars-galactic-racer-tga-1488889/">Fuse Games says 12 people will be able to race together online</a>. There will also be some sort of online ranking system.</p>

 <h2>When is <em>Galactic Racer</em> set in the <em>Star Wars</em> timeline?</h2> <p><em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> is set after the events of <em>Return of the Jedi.</em> But beyond that, the creators behind the game don’t seem to be too worried about <em>Galactic Racer</em>‘s placement in the grander <em>Star Wars</em> canon. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-star-wars-galactic-racer-interview-why-its-not-open-world-how-its-story-mode-works-and-when-its-set">Here’s what Fuse Games CEO and founder Matt Webster told <em>IGN</em></a>:</p> <blockquote><p>“I don’t think it really matters. As you say, you’re on Jakku after the events of <em>Return of the Jedi,</em> the galactic civil war is over, and that’s where sport becomes a more interesting opportunity. I don’t think we’re ever specific about timeline beyond that.”</p></blockquote> <h2>Wait, was that Sebulba from <em>The Phantom Menace</em>?</h2> <p>Yes, it was. But he is older now and sports a cool beard. Maybe he’s learned his lesson after cheating against Anakin and other racers all those years ago. But I doubt it…</p>  <h2>Will <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> include a battle pass or seasons?</h2> <p>When asked about seasons in the previously mentioned <em>IGN</em> interview, Webster bluntly said “No” and said the game is a “premium” release.</p>

 <p>“We have our campaign, and we have arcade mode, and we have multiplayer, and it’s a self-contained thing,” said the CEO. “But what we also recognize is that the landscape of <em>Star Wars</em> evolves and changes over time and so do games as they go. So we see an opportunity for us to tap into more<em> Star Wars</em> or new<em> Star Wars</em> over time, but in terms of us outlining what we think post-launch is going to look like, [seasons are] not something that we see. The only reason I say a blind no to it is, in my head, season pass is connected to free-to-play games, and that’s not what we are making.”</p> <h2>Will you be able to walk around on foot in <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em>?</h2> <p>Yes! Your main character in the game’s campaign is named Shade, and they will be able to walk around a social hub area and interact with NPCs while also being able to upgrade their vehicles.</p> <h2>This is cool and all, but I wish we’d get a big <em>KOTOR</em>-like RPG <em>Star Wars</em> game again…</h2> <p>Good news, that’s also a thing that is happening. <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-know-about-star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-release-date-trailer-2000653076">You can learn more about it here!</a></p>

              <p>Discord hears you. It gets your concerns. It wants to win back your trust. That’s the message from cofounder and CTO Stanislav Vishnevskiy, who announced the <a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-will-force-you-to-scan-your-face-or-id-to-unlock-all-of-its-features-2000666884">company’s controversial new age-verification requirements will be delayed</a>, but not reversed, as it works to try to better explain what’s happening to its millions of users. “We’ve made mistakes,” he wrote.</p> <p>Vishnevskiy says he’s just like you, getting off work and hopping on voice chat with friends while playing games like <em>Baby Steps</em> and <em>Arc Raiders</em>. Leveraging his gamer cred, the executive tried to quell the recent backlash while making clear that nothing is fundamentally changing about the age-verification rollout coming, other than the timing and optics. For Discord, the issue appears to be a failure to properly communicate the policy rather than the policy itself.</p>

 <p>“In hindsight, we should have provided more detail about our intentions and how the process works,” he <a href="https://discord.com/blog/getting-global-age-assurance-right-what-we-got-wrong-and-whats-changing">wrote in today’s update</a>. “The way this landed, many of you walked away thinking we’re requiring face scans and ID uploads from everyone just to use Discord. That’s not what’s happening, but the fact that so many people believe it tells us we failed at our most basic job: clearly explaining what we’re doing and why.”</p> <p>Vishnevskiy continued, “We know many of you believe the right answer is not to do this at all. We hear you.” He then went on to insinuate that Discord’s hands are tied as new regulation rolls out across more countries and U.S. states. The company promises more transparency about its vendors and processes, but otherwise nothing about the age-verification rollout is fundamentally changing other than the timing.</p>

 <p>Here’s how the newly delayed rollout will work as outlined <a href="https://discord.com/blog/getting-global-age-assurance-right-what-we-got-wrong-and-whats-changing">on Discord’s website</a>.</p> <blockquote><p><strong>We’re delaying our global rollout to the second half of 2026.</strong>&nbsp;Where we have legal obligations, we will continue to meet them, but we will only expand globally after we’ve done the following:</p></blockquote> <ol role="list"> <li> <blockquote><p><strong>Adding more verification options.</strong>&nbsp;We already had alternatives in development, including credit card verification. We’ll complete and expand those before scaling globally so you have more options you’re comfortable with.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p><strong>Vendor transparency.</strong>&nbsp;We’ll document every verification vendor and their practices on our website, and make it clear in the product who each vendor is. We’ve also set a new requirement: any partner offering facial age estimation must perform it entirely on-device. If they don’t meet that bar, we won’t work with them.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p><strong>A new spoiler channel option.</strong>&nbsp;We know many communities use age-restricted channels not for adult content, but for topics people prefer to engage with on their own terms: spoilers, politics, and heavier conversations. We’re building a dedicated spoiler channel option so communities don’t have to age-gate their server just to give members that choice.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p><strong>A technical blog post before global launch.</strong>&nbsp;We’ll publish a detailed post explaining how our automatic age determination systems work, including the signal categories and privacy constraints. So you can evaluate our approach for yourselves.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p><strong>Age assurance data in our transparency reports.</strong>&nbsp;We’ll include how many users were asked to verify, what methods they used, and how often our automated systems handled it without any user action.</p></blockquote> </li> </ol> <p>The apologetic backpedaling comes after weeks of Discord users pushing back on new requirements that would require some users to submit photos and IDs to the gaming chat platform if its AI tools decide you’re not over the age of 18 and you try to access “adult” content servers. A prior “<a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-age-verification-hack-persona-2000672570">experiment</a>” with this new policy that was implemented in the UK became a lightning rod for some frustrated users when it was revealed that one of the vendors involved in the process, a firm called Persona, was backed by funds from surveillance company Palantir cofounder Peter Thiel.</p>

 <p>Discord later said it cut ties with the vendor and that it has new safeguards in place to prevent user data from being hacked as it accidentally was last fall. But the bubbling cauldron of AI surveillance, data security concerns, and Discord’s reportedly impending IPO has left even some of its most hardcore users skeptical.</p>
