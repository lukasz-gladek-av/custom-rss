In this short, but sweet, adventure, players control a chicken named Chick and his sidekick Nugget as they set out on an adventure to rescue stolen eggs. It’s a simple but cute premise for a game, and it should provide a worthwhile experience for fans of platformers and cozier games. If you’re wondering just how many hours you’ll be spending with Chick and Nugget, let’s dig into how long it takes to beat <em>PaperKlay</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196470" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="123" data-playlist="196470,196215,196923" data-current="196470"><div><p>The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22020.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h25077"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to beat <em>PaperKlay</em>?</h2><p><strong><em>PaperKlay</em> is a fairly brief little game that should take most players around 6 hours to see through to its conclusion</strong>. Given its launch price of only $15, though, that ends up feeling like a pretty decent amount of content for platforming enthusiasts to sink their teeth into. </p><p>Like many other games in the genre, <em>PaperKlay</em> is also a collect-a-thon with plenty of things to seek out in each of its levels.</p><p>If you want to collect every button, orb, and egg in <em>PaperKlay</em>, you will almost certainly need to play through various levels multiple times. And a few orbs, in particular, require you to have a lot of environmental awareness. You’ll need to engage in puzzles (such as flipping parts of the level to line up platforms), find items in the world to return to their owners, or even rapidly track down red orbs before a timer runs out.</p><p><strong>Doing everything in <em>PaperKlay</em> can certainly increase your playtime by a few additional hours, possibly even double the amount of time you’d spend if you just played through it once</strong>. Collectibles can be used to upgrade your abilities, so you might find return trips to previous levels a bit speedier once your health, glider, and jumping abilities are all improved. You’re also likely to earn most of the game’s achievements by the time you play through each level a few times.. </p><p>All in all, it’s worth investing the time in this adorable platformer, even if the journey is over quicker than we may wish. Here’s to hoping WhyKev is eyeballing some DLC for the future so that we can all spend a bit more time with Chick and Nugget.</p><p><em>PaperKlay</em> is available now on Windows PCs, with a Nintendo Switch version on the way at an unspecified date in the future.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For comparison, the original <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> earned $145 million total domestically across its nearly four-month run in theaters back in the summer of 2002.
