              <p>Formula 1 fans know the thrill of collecting memorabilia, but official F1 merchandise usually comes with hefty price tags. LEGO sets tied to racing deliver that collecting satisfaction while giving you something to actually build and display. With the Austin Grand Prix happening today, LEGO is capitalizing on the F1 buzz by dropping this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4535/">6-pack of collectible F1 race cars to an all-time low of $20 on Amazon, down from $29.</a> That works out to just over $3 per car which is ridiculous pricing for official LEGO F1 builds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4535/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mystery Box Format Offers Collecting Thrill</h2>
<p>The <strong>collection includes 6 randomly chosen mini F1 cars</strong> from a total of 12 different models, and every box is an opening surprise. The roster includes real 2024 F1 teams such as <strong>Red Bull’s RB20, Mercedes-AMG, Ferrari, McLaren, Aston Martin, Alpine, Williams, VCARB, Sauber, and Haas</strong>, along with an F1 car and F1 Academy car. Every model comes with the unique livery and color of its team, right down to the exact team logo and sponsor decals that immediately identify them with anyone who’s a sports fan. The surprise is that <strong>you don’t know what six you’re receiving until you open the box</strong>&nbsp;which introduces the aspect of collecting that kids and adults alike find actually fun.</p>
<p>Every vehicle has a team-specific helmet inside the cockpit, mimicking the actual drivers’ equipment. The wheels even spin, so they are not just for show. Children are able to roll them over surfaces and set up their own racing, re-creating passes and duels they’ve watched on television. The spinning wheels are just a little detail, but it makes these go from flat-out collectibles to toys that invite make-believe play and storytelling.</p>



<p><strong>With 174 pieces in total across all six cars</strong>, the build complexity is exactly between the ages of 6 and older. Each individual car is probably 10 to 15 minutes to build, so they’re all good fast builds without consuming hours of build time. Each car costs about 29 pieces, sufficient to make comprehensible F1 forms with the characteristic halo cockpit cover, front and back wings, and aerodynamic body style that are trademarks of contemporary Formula 1 design.</p>



<p>The small size makes them perfectly aligned to be displayed on bookshelves, desktops, or shelves without taking up much space. Display the six of them to present a miniature grid setup, or combine them with other Lego F1 sets if you are collecting a massive collection. The size is perfectly aligned for dioramas or race environments if you prefer to customize your own display. As the total of 12 cars is available in the full set, there is a clear accomplishment goal completionists are striving for, and double-trading with friends provides a social collecting aspect.</p>
<p>For die-hard F1 enthusiasts who don’t want to expend vast sums of money on diecast models or clothing, this set provides official branding and proper team representation for pennies compared to the cost. As LEGO, it’s something with wide appeal across the board to everyone from young children just getting into F1 to older adult fanatics who are collectors of racing memorabilia. At $20 for a half-dozen cars, <strong>it’s the most affordable means of getting official F1 team merchandise since Austin’s GP puts people in racing mode</strong>.</p>

              <p>Apple has a reputation for keeping prices locked at full retail, especially on their latest releases. The company never discounts anything directly which makes finding deals on new Apple hardware feel like spotting a unicorn. That’s why the current situation with the 2024 Mac Mini is worth your attention: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">just dropped the latest 256GB M4 model to $499, down from $599</a>, and this is the lowest price we’ve seen on Apple’s newest compact desktop. For this level of performance in such a compact package, there’s really no point looking at Windows alternatives right now.</p>

<h2>M4 Chip Performance That Matters</h2>
<p>The M4 chip in this <strong>Mac Mini features a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU</strong> which means serious computation from an object that’s hardly larger than a coaster. Apple’s chip design means these cores operate differently than standard Intel or AMD processors. The CPU is divided between performance and efficiency cores and uses heavy tasks such as video or 3D rendering on the performance cores and background tasks on efficiency cores without draining power and heat.</p>



<p>The total 16GB of RAM comes into play here as Apple’s architecture divides RAM between the GPU and the CPU instead of having independent ones like in the ancient machines. The <strong>system dynamically allocates memory</strong> depending on what you’re doing in this integrated manner so 16GB is more than enough compared to the same in the case of Windows. You can trim 4K video, have several creative programs open at once, or seriously multitask without the system bogging down. The <strong>256GB SSD offers speedy storage</strong> that’s light years ahead of the hard drives still found in value PCs.</p>
<p>This Mac Mini <strong>coexists nicely with Apple’s ecosystem</strong> in ways Windows mini PCs don’t: The Continuity features allow you to begin writing on your iPad or iPhone and resume where you stopped on the Mac Mini. AirDrop shares files from one device to another in an instant and hassle-free process. You can use your iPhone as a webcam for FaceTime, reply to messages directly from your desktop or even use your Apple Watch to control your Mac by unlocking it.</p>



<p>Wired Gigabit Ethernet is the standard with you getting to enjoy wired network speeds that blow WiFi for massive file transfers or streaming video. WiFi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 wireless connectivity is also available on the Mac Mini. Port alternatives are also ample with various <strong>Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports</strong> providing up to 40Gbps data transmission speeds, up to 6K resolution support for external displays, and speedy charging of devices. <strong>Two USB-A ports</strong> are included for legacy peripherals, and the headphone port is capable of driving high-impedance headphones to provide high-quality audio without an attached DAC.</p>
<p>Its small size allows it to <strong>vanish on a desk or be screwed behind a monitor</strong> with a VESA adapter. It is only 7.7 inches by 7.7 inches and 2 inches in height, occupying less space than most external hard drives. The <strong>fanless design makes it silent to operate</strong> which is ideal for recording studios, bedrooms, or offices where fan noise becomes irritating.</p>
<p>Priced at $499, this Mac Mini offers performance that would run much higher in a run-of-the-mill desktop or mini PC of this size. If you’ve been waiting for Apple to budge on pricing, this is as good as it gets.</p>
