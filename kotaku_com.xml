In addition to Riot Games, <em>Call of Duty</em> publisher Activision, <em>God of War</em> maker Santa Monica Studio, and <em>Last of Us</em> maker Naughty Dog are also within a few miles of the fire. </p><p><em>Black Ops 6 </em>studio Treyarch is also in the area, while fellow <em>Call of Duty</em> studio Infinity Ward is north of the Palisades in Woodland Hills.<em> Spider-Man</em> maker Insomniac Games, meanwhile, is in Burbank, closer to the Eaton fire where 10,600 acres have burned so far. </p><p>“Employee safety and well-being is our top priority,” a spokesperson for Activisiom told <em>Kotaku</em>. “We’re actively monitoring the situation as it is quickly evolving.

It takes a village to do what we do and we are all in this moment together. For those in our offices around the world who have been reaching out, your support has been incredible — we’re reminded once again how strong a team Riot truly is.”</p><p>He continued,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> It’s too early for anyone to know exactly what will be needed or what can be done in the aftermath of this. The reality is… we are still in the middle of it.
