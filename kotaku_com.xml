              <p>Halloween has reached Gearbox’s recently released looter shooter, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149">Borderlands 4</a>.</em> But the free event is being heavily criticized online because, well, it sucks.</p> <p>As we reach the end of October and get closer and closer to Halloween, many live-service and online games start to activate seasonal, limited-time, <a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-events-in-video-games-are-just-the-best-1839174541">Halloween-themed events.</a><em> Borderlands 4</em> is one of these games, and its new “Horrors of Kairos” event went live on October 23 and ends on November 6. And nobody really likes it, as the “event” is less of a big, in-game Halloween celebration and more of a small change to a pre-existing mechanic with two new weapons and some pumpkin-y skins.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:sxmjis6jypsib2k7rk6pjoau/app.bsky.feed.post/3m3uuejx3fs24" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigwrz7ycyz5c4end5542plzpzo4bzo4hvcxcyafg6fivvwufpvnea"> <p lang="en">Double, double, recoil and trouble 🎃💥</p> <p>During Horrors of Kairos, defeat World Bosses for a chance to earn two new Legendary weapons:</p> <p>💀 Legendary Order Grenade – Skully<br> 💎 Legendary Tediore Assault Rifle – Murmur</p> <p>Event ends Nov. 6.</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:sxmjis6jypsib2k7rk6pjoau?ref_src=embed">Borderlands (@borderlands.2k.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:sxmjis6jypsib2k7rk6pjoau/post/3m3uuejx3fs24?ref_src=embed">2025-10-23T17:15:38.775Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>Basically, the new Halloween event in<em> Borderlands 4</em> changes how random world boss spawns work in the looter shooter. They still happen during “Horrors of Kairos,” but now, when you enter the boss’s holo-bubble to start the fight, the sky turns orange, and when you kill the big bad, they might drop one of the two new legendary guns temporarily available during the spooky event. Then the bubble closes and the sky goes back to normal. And uh, that’s it. Oh, and there are some free Halloween skins you can get from using a Shift code. Okay, that’s it.</p> <p>This is not very exciting. And because world bosses spawn randomly in the open world, players have to just drive around waiting for a boss bubble to appear. And if you have a strong build, the fight might be over in less than a minute. Compared to <em>Borderlands 3</em> and its big Halloween event, this is extremely disappointing. In the last game, the Halloween event introduced a new character, added a new limited-time map, featured a new boss, and more.</p>

 <p><em>Borderlands</em> content creators are ripping the new event apart in YouTube videos and posts. Popular <em>Borderlands</em> YouTuber Joltzdude139 uploaded a new video on Friday that spelled it out simply and bluntly with the title: T<a href="https://youtu.be/HFfPynrUr30">he Horrors Of Kairos Halloween Event Sucks In <em>Borderlands 4</em></a><em>.</em> In the comments below, he added: “<span dir="auto" role="text">As a biiiiig <em>Borderlands</em> fan, I am absolutely disappointed in this Halloween event.” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1oev9am/gearbox_making_premium_content_for_premium_game/">And he’s not alone</a>. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1oerp2e/bl4s_halloween_event_is_so_bad_i_booted_up_bl3_to/">Checking Reddit,</a> Twitter, YouTube, and elsewhere, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1oeiv0v/say_what_you_will_but_mad_respect_for_moxsy/">everyone seems sad about it. </a></span></p> <p><span dir="auto" role="text">Sure, Gearbox advertised the Halloween update as a mini-event, but this feels more like a super-tiny event. I can’t wait for <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-randy-pitchford-gearbox-80-real-fan-post-1851782855">Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford’s 700-word tweet</a> about all of this that will likely drop within the next 48 hours.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is there a disturbance in the force when it comes to <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>‘s week-one sales? Will Steam Deck compatibility help aid the Switch 2 on its road to becoming a handheld port machine? And why are <em>Sims 4</em> creators abandoning EA’s official affiliate program? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>People <a href="https://x.com/SuperSavajin/status/1981324284493443583">are once again</a> debating whether Nintendo should bring back Virtual Console instead of forcing fans to rent all of its games in perpetuity. While it’s true that people had been wanting Nintendo to do a low-cost Netflix-like retro service for a while, much of that was due to constantly needing to <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-virtual-console-switch-online-classic-retro-1851760770">re-purchase the games across non-backwards-compatible devices</a>. With the Switch 2, that’s no longer an issue. Personally, I’d prefer to just buy the original <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> again instead of pay $50 a year to play it.</p>

 <h2><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> is selling less than other recent games in the series</h2> <p>The Pokémon Company announced the latest entry sold 5.8 million copies in its first week, split roughly evenly between Switch and Switch 2. Sounds impressive, but it’s slightly behind other recent Pokémon games:</p> <ul> <li><em><strong>Pokémon Sword</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em><strong>Shield</strong></em>: 6 million copies in its first three days</li> <li><strong><em>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl</em></strong>: 6 million copies in its first week</li> <li><em><strong>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</strong>: </em>6.5 million copies in its first week</li> <li><em><strong>Pokémon Scarlet </strong></em><strong>and </strong><em><strong>Violet</strong>: </em>10 million copies in its first three days</li> </ul> <p>That’s a little surprising given the hype around a new console launch and the fact that it’s been three years since fans received a mainline Pokémon game. Are those viral videos about the bad graphics and how lifeless Lumiose City looks putting a damper on things? Are some fans aging out all these years later? Or is this just a momentary slip on the way to <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> still becoming one of the top-20 best-selling Nintendo console games ever?</p>

 <h2><em>The Simpsons</em>‘ takeover of Fortnite continues leaking</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">FORTNITE SIMPSONS SEASON (HD KEY ART) <a href="https://t.co/eL7l1skLRJ">pic.twitter.com/eL7l1skLRJ</a></p> <p>— Shiina (@ShiinaBR) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShiinaBR/status/1981479839564537972?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Now we have the key art which gives lots of clues for what to expect, including Homer with a magic TV remote that might spawn donuts, Bart in a mech suit, and Flanders flying in on a loaf of bread.</p>

 <h2>There’s a fresh rumor about <em>Baldur’s Gate III</em> coming to Switch 2</h2> <p>Leaker NateTheHate <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1980357667035181154#m">writes</a>, “Have heard something on BG3 for SW2 but need more verification on it before I can share.” Larian Studios recently went out of its way to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1nokvh1/baldurs_gate_3_hotfix_34_steam_deck_native_build/">make the RPG natively Steam Deck compatible</a>.</p> <h2>Some of the biggest <em>Sims 4</em> YouTubers are leaving EA’s creator program over the sale to Saudi Arabia</h2>  <p><em>PC Gamer</em> reports that James Turner, Jesse ‘Plumbella’ McNamara, and Kayla ‘lilsimsie’ Sims have all left what is essentially an affiliate program for the game run by EA where they can make money off of creating mods and other content related to the game.</p>

 <p>“Due to the recent sale, I have asked to leave the EA Creator Network and I will not buy or make content around any future release. I think taking this stand is the right choice for me personally, but I’m not going to judge anybody on their decision,” McNamara said. “I’m in a privileged position to be able to say I’m leaving so easily.”</p>

 <p>In a separate discussion, Sims said, “This situation is a nightmare for our community. Nobody supports this sale, and it is putting creators in a very difficult position. They have built their entire career and livelihood over a game that they have no control over.”</p>

 <h2><em>Factorio: Space Age</em> is already confirmed for Switch 2</h2> <p>The hit survival crafting assembly game sequel will be coming to the Nintendo console <a href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-439">around Christmas</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is secretly </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-npc-dialogue-funny-moments-lines-2000638295"><span>one of the funniest games of the year</span></a><span>, as I was reminded last night when I experienced something that was as annoying as it was hilarious.. I’ve finished the main story, and so I’ve been chipping away at all the remaining side quests, filling up my Pokedex, and trying to get everything in a place where I’m okay with putting the game down until the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span>. So I’m spending most of my time chatting up citizens, battling wild Pokémon, and checking off research assignments without a care in the world. But last night, something happened that now has me putting my guard up. I was trapped in a conversation with a child about their special interest, and it was one of the funniest scenes I’ve encountered in the game.</span></p> <p><span>In Lumiose City’s Rouge Sector, you’ll find a school called Académie Étoile. There are a few quests here, including one really cute one where you teach a group of curious kids about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>Mega Evolution</span></a><span>, but there’s one student who’s just hanging out in a corner by herself. This nameless child’s speech bubble exclaims, “I’ve memorized a bunch of people’s names!” As someone who has become terrible with names in his 30s, that’s impressive to me. If someone doesn’t have a name tag on, I </span><i><span>will</span></i><span> forget what they’re called when they tell me. That happens with anyone, and it’s nothing personal. I used to have a mind like a steel trap, and then everything started sliding right out of my skull once I got old enough to rent a car. So I talk to this kid, and she tells me she has a “super amazing memory” and can remember every name she’s ever seen, even if she only saw it once.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>She asks if I want her to show me, and I’m like, “Hell yeah, queen. Pop off!” because who wants to shoot down a child telling you about something they’re excited about? Then she asks me again if I’m sure because it’ll take her about six minutes to rattle off every Bob, Jan, and Jimbo she’s ever known. I fully expected the game to make me skip through a bunch of text boxes before we were interrupted by a teacher or parent who had been looking for this girl, but no, </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>did something even funnier: it started playing the game’s credits and would not let me skip or opt out of them.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>For six minutes, I watched the credits roll a second time, and just laughed at how good of a fucking bit this is. Anyone who’s interacted with children knows they love to talk your ear off about whatever they’re hyperfixating on. If you don’t know anything about it, you just gotta kinda smile, nod, and say “oh, wow!” now and then so they know it’s okay to be excited about things. Game Freak emulating this by making you watch the credits is such an efficient gag that I couldn’t help but giggle at the mess I’d gotten myself into. The kid told me exactly what she was going to do, and for some reason, it didn’t occur to me that she might actually deliver. Hopefully, she gets a job in comms because never forgetting a face or a name is an invaluable skill in that field.</span></p>

              <p>Being and adult can be a lot. We’re expected to work at least eight hours a day — usually more. For some of us it might take over and hour to commute to work, each way. When we finally get home, we have dinners to cook and dirty clothes to launder. To stay healthy, we should be getting in some daily exercised too. Plus, some of us have small humans to take care of, pick up from school, help with their homework — it’s never ending. If you fall behind on vacuuming your living room, that’s completely understandable with everything else going on. Though, you work so hard, you deserve to come home to a clean home every day. That’s why you got to jump on this Amazon limited time deal for a Eufy robot vacuum.</p>
<p>The Eufy C10 can be scheduled to clean up for you every day while you’re out so you can come home to a clean living space. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4991/">The robot vac is currently 54% off, saving your more than half. It normally is listed at $480, but the discount brings it down to just $220.</a> That’s a savings of $260 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4991/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Self-Empty Station</h2>
<p>Not only does this vacuum clean your floors for you. It can also empty itself all by itself. The docking station it returns to after every trip has a three-liter dust bag which the robot vacuum empties into each day. So instead of needing to empty the robot vacuum every few days, you only need to empty the dust bag about every 60 days.</p>
<p>This robot vacuum has a powerful suction with 4,000 Pa of sucking power. The rolling brush makes it so the vac can pick up all kinds of tough debris like pet hair, dirt, and crumbs embedded deep in your carpet.</p>



<p>The vacuum is designed to be a short 2.85 inches tall. This slim shape allows it to navigate under tight, hard-to-reach spaces like beneath a couch, bed, or desk.</p>
<p>Navigating your home comes easy to this robot vacuum. The Eufy C10 uses laser navigation to map out the layout of your home, analyzing and creating an optimal path to take for a thorough cleaning.</p>
<p>You can used the companion app to mark off any no-go zones you don’t want it to enter. The app also can be used for scheduling when you want the robot vacuum to run. You even use voice controls to get it started on the fly.</p>

              <p>Have you ever gone duck hunting? It’s terrifying. Somehow those birds are always watching, ready, hiding just out of plain sight ready to get you. Mmm. On second thought I might have that experience confused with something else. Regardless, murderous animals are funny and horrifying, and it seems a lot of folks on Steam are in agreement as duck-based indie shooter <i>Escape From Duckov</i> has just pulled ahead of EA’s big AAA shooter <i>Battlefield</i> <i>6</i> in concurrent players.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/theres-a-damned-good-reason-escape-from-duckov-has-sold-a-million-copies-in-a-week-2000638588">There’s A Damned Good Reason <i>Escape From Duckov</i> Has Sold A Million Copies In A Week</a></p> <p>Released on October 16, 2025, <i>Escape From Duckov</i> is a solo survival extraction shooter featuring ducks with guns who aren’t afraid to use them. It has that lovely charm that many indie games tend to get when they fuse an otherwise serious, <a href="https://kotaku.com/theres-a-damned-good-reason-escape-from-duckov-has-sold-a-million-copies-in-a-week-2000638588">well-executed</a> genre with a not-so-serious premise: in this case, ducks with guns. And it would seem (<a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/indie-shooter-escape-from-duckov-overtakes-battlefield-6-on-steam-3273511/">h/t <i>Dexerto</i></a>) that us extraction diehards or those who just enjoy silliness aren’t the only ones drawn to these funny birds; the game has recently outstripped <i>Battlefield 6</i> in concurrent players, successfully hopping over the popular milsim shooter in the <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/">top five most-played games</a> on Steam at the time of this writing.</p>

And, hey, maybe the broader gaming community is warming up to extraction shooters a bit more? I’d be totally here for that ahead of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325"><i>Arc Raiders</i></a>’ launch next week.</p>

While there was a moment where we thought we might have gotten a new Huntr/x banger that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-huntrix-spotify-new-song-mazatlan-by-night-2000632680"><span>turned out to be a Spotify hack</span></a><span>, Netflix hasn’t put out any new music from the fictional K-pop group yet. What’s a Huntr/x fan to do other than listen to the soundtrack on loop? Well, Ejae, the singing voice of lead vocalist Rumi, has finally put out her own debut single, and yeah, the girl can sing even when she’s not slaying demons.</span></p> <p><span>“In Another World” is a ballad that sounds like something you’d hear over a Disney musical’s end credits.
