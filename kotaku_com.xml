              <p>Now that’s its 2026, Samsung is likely to announced a refresh to its flagship lineup of smartphones with their anticipated S26 versions. Though a goods way to save some cash while staying mostly up to date with the latest tech is to pick up the previous year model whenever you’re looking to upgrade. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, S25+, and S25 aren’t going anywhere and still remain some of the best choices for Android users.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6734/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</h2>
<p data-start="30" data-end="301">The high-end Galaxy S25 Ultra comes in several configurations with different storage options. Samsung has eliminated the 128 GB model from the prior generation, streamlining the lineup into a 256 GB version ($1,300), a 512 GB version ($1,420), and a top-tier 1 TB option. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6734/">Right now, Amazon has the 256GB model on sale for as low as $1,020 which is a discount of 22% saving $280.</a> Likewise, the 512GB model has come down to as low as $1,100. That’s 23% discount, saving $320. Amazon currently isn’t offering the 1TB model.</p>

<h2 data-start="303" data-end="319">What You Get</h2>
<p data-start="321" data-end="512">The S25 Ultra stands as Samsung’s latest flagship smartphone, packed with premium features throughout. Driven by Galaxy AI, many capabilities see notable upgrades compared to its predecessor.</p>
<p data-start="321" data-end="512">If you’re finding yourself increasingly relying on AI, Gemini Live allows you to speak freely and naturally with the onboard AI to attain information in real time like you would a regular person.</p>
<p data-start="321" data-end="512">The 6.9-inch display delivers sharper imagery and more vibrant colors than ever before. The camera system features a 50MP Ultra Wide lens designed to capture the full scope of your surroundings. With the help of Galaxy AI, the camera intelligently detects ambient lighting to produce accurate skin tones and detailed textures, bringing portraits to life without the need for extra editing. Video recording is smoother than ever with Night Video and Audio Eraser, allowing you to shoot vivid footage in low-light environments while reducing unwanted background noise using Galaxy AI.</p>


<p data-start="1099" data-end="1368" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Across the Galaxy S25 Ultra, S25+, and S25 lineup, you can choose from a handful of sleek color options. The S25 Ultra specifically comes in a titanium metal case, including the colors Titanium Black, Titanium Gray, Titanium Silverblue, and Titanium Whitesilver. The discounts are not equal between each color, though all are on sale for at least a couple hundred off. The most affordable of each storage size are the Titanium Black for the 256GB model and the Titanium Gray for the 512GB model.</p>
<p data-start="1099" data-end="1368" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">These phones comes unlocked, meaning you can use them with your cellular provider of choice. No contracts locking you down at point of purchase.</p>
