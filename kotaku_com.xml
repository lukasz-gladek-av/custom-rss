              <p><span>The Streamer Awards, an annual ceremony celebrating the best in live-streaming hosted and produced by QTCinderella, took place over the weekend in Los Angeles, California.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>There were some genuinely touching moments, like adorable grandma and jigsaw puzzle aficionado <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/ijustlovepuzzles">ijustlovepuzzles</a> winning the Hidden Gem award, and a touching speech from Best Breakout Streamer <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/adapt">FaZe Adapt</a>, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RuCvMC6vemM">The Streamer Awards</a> was mostly three and a half hours of people regularly rewarded for behaving badly doing just that.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If you aren’t privy to the interpersonal drama and controversy surrounding the professional streamer space, that’s okay. I wish I could </span><i><span>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</span></i><span> a lot of this information from my head. Just know that in the months leading up to the fifth annual Streamer Awards, host QTCinderella has broken down on her stream, citing stress around organizing the event, while other streamers (mostly ones not nominated for awards) accused her of rigging the ceremony. It was the special brand of drama-farming and rage-baiting that has come to define the streamer space.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Just like earlier this year at San Diego’s TwitchCon, during which streamer Emiru (who won Best Creative Arts Streamer on Saturday) was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/emiru-twitchcon-assault-video-cosplay-streamer-2000637226"><span>physically assaulted at a meet-and-greet</span></a><span> and “clip farmers” acted out on the convention floor and outside of it, bad behavior was on full display this Saturday at The Streamer Awards.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Multiple clips circulated on social media over the weekend that are a cogent reminder of how young and, in many cases, small-minded some of the most popular streamers are. A 17-year-old streamer known as Rakai, who recently got a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1pcsvzd/twitch_partner_rakai_has_been_banned_for_2_years/"><span>two-year suspension for stealing flowers from Walmart while live</span></a><span>, approached a married, </span><a href="https://x.com/SlatDontMiss/status/1997473082601099651"><span>lesbian couple while live-streaming to ask them if they were gay</span></a><span>, not long after asking a different woman streamer if she “had a man.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Co-host FanFan, who mingled amongst attendees’ tables during the ceremony, </span><a href="https://x.com/scubaryan_/status/1997496510091550723?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1997496510091550723%7Ctwgr%5Ed2c8b429f5603e06934a254da23384087baad6ca%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fd-3543798751762506370.ampproject.net%2F2510081644000%2Fframe.html"><span>made a joke comparing Kai Cenat</span></a><span>, who is Black, to Sean “Diddy” Combs, “congratulating” him on his new documentary with 50 Cent. </span><i><span>Sean Combs: The Reckoning</span></i><span>, a four-part documentary examining the life and behavior of the rapper recently imprisoned for transportation of prostitution, just aired on Netflix. It was produced by 50 Cent. Immediately after her joke, an influencer named Tylil grabbed the mic FanFan was passing around to state, “If y’all gonna be making jokes, at least make it funny.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“The streamer awards: *fat joke* *gay joke* *anti black joke* *another gay joke* *another anti black joke*,” </span><a href="https://x.com/memebag_/status/1997705007899279646"><span>read a post on X</span></a><span>.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">India Love gets booed off stage after claiming DDG and Rakai deserved Breakout Streamer of the Year over FaZe Adapt 👀<a href="https://t.co/0IA0gN8As4">pic.twitter.com/0IA0gN8As4</a></p> <p>— FearBuck (@FearedBuck) <a href="https://twitter.com/FearedBuck/status/1997541200111219147?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>    <p><span>At one point during the show, influencer India Love stormed the stage to insist that two other streamers, controversial rapper DDG and the aforementioned Rakai, deserved to win Breakout Streamer of the Year over FaZe Adapt. Love was booed off-stage and later apologized while livestreaming. “There was no excuse for my behavior,” </span><a href="https://x.com/FearedBuck/status/1997914755751718920"><span>she said</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">My hottest take on the streamer awards is all the drama and clip farming is a direct consequence of promoting and rewarding that kind of behavior throughout the entire year. </p> <p>Reap what you sow type shit.</p> <p>— Sean (@SeanDaBlack) <a href="https://twitter.com/SeanDaBlack/status/1997682224557437387?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>“My hottest take on the streamer awards is all the drama and clip farming is a direct consequence of promoting and rewarding that kind of behavior throughout the entire year,” wrote streamer SeanDaBlack on X. “Reap what you sow type shit.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Moments like </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@twitch/video/7580961051093503246"><span>ijustlovepuzzles winning the Hidden Gem award</span></a><span> helped elevate The Streamer Awards’ vibes—the older woman streamer, who has 46,000 followers on Twitch, was incredibly emotional as she received her award. “I was in such a dark place when my kids created this Twitch account and gave me something to do. This stream gave me life,” she said.</span></p> <p><span>If streaming were more about platforming interesting people who genuinely love what they do and less about rewarding teen boys for misbehaving, maybe The Streamer Awards would be less tough to watch. Other winners included Flats for Best </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span> streamer, TheBurntPeanut for Best FPS Streamer and best VTuber, </span><i><span>Peak</span></i><span> for Stream Game of the Year, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ishowspeed-crawley-tiktok-wizard-bark-off-twitch-clip-1851573475"><span>iShowSpeed</span></a><span> for Streamer of the Year.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[ASUS Offloads TUF Gaming Graphics Card Even Further After Black Friday as the GeForce RTX 5060 GPU Hits an All-Time Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-offloads-tuf-gaming-graphics-card-even-further-after-black-friday-as-the-geforce-rtx-5060-gpu-hits-an-all-time-low-2000651222</link>
            <guid>1376242</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Graphic card upgrades can cost a pretty penny, but that’s not the case today. Right now, you can pick the ASUS TUF Gaming GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB OC edition gaming graphics card without paying the full price, courtesy of a deal currently live on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6279/">On a regular day, it would run you around $540, but you can snap it up at a 30% discount right now, which drops the price to $378.</a> This is its lowest it’s dropped to in quite some time, and is packed with everything you need to push some gaming and creative boundaries this holiday season. It’s selling out like crazy, though, which is why we recommend grabbing yours before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6279/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Improved Efficiency With Impressive Heat Dissipation</h2>
<p>ASUS has designed this thing with military-grade components for exceptional performance and reliability. We’re talking certified military-grade TUF chokes and MOSFETs to deliver impressive power to the GPU for better stability, plus 5K black metallic capacitors for wider temperature tolerance and a longer lifespan than other options in this range. The protective conformal coating makes the graphics card temperature (high and low), shock, humidity, and fog resistant, while the dual ball fan bearings ensure quiet cooling even when things get intense.</p>
<p>Speaking of intense gaming/creative sessions, you’ll also appreciate the axial-tech upgrades with fans that propel more air, and the high-quality diecast shroud with aluminum backplate featuring larger vents for even better heat dissipation. The MaxContact design expands the surface area of the heat spreader by 5% when needed to keep the overall GPU temperatures and prevent thermal throttling. Fans are also designed to stop when the temperature reaches below 50 degrees Celsius, letting you enjoy quieter performance during less resource-intensive tasks.</p>



<p>As for the performance, RTX is the most advanced platform for full ray tracing and neural rendering tech that completely upgrades the way you play. You’re getting fifth-gen tensor cores that deliver incredible AI performance with FP4 and DLSS4, new streaming multiprocessors that are optimized for neural shaders, and fourth-gen ray tracing cores for mega geometry. Translation? Low latency and improved visual quality for all your favorite titles. Responsiveness comes from Reflex 2, which offers quicker target acquisition and better reaction times, as well as introduces Frame Warp to further reduce latency based on the latest mouse input in the game. Customization options let you monitor performance and tweak settings based on your own preferences. This is done through GPU Tweak III, where you can overclock, undervolt, and monitor real-time stats with an intuitive interface.​ You’ll also enjoy access to MuseTree, which is an AI-powered image-generation app with your purchase, plus get a complimentary membership to Adobe Creative Cloud, all Apps.​</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking to upgrade the way you play your favorite titles or work on some creative projects, you need a solid graphics card in your setup. These don’t come in cheap, and discounts on some of the best options out there are few and far between, which makes this deal one worth grabbing. You’re saving $162 on an option that’s going to completely transform your experience, but the discount wraps up soon. Grab it before that happens!</p>

              <p>A holiday splurge is a good thing. A holiday splurge also does not mean paying full price for a bit of indulgence. That’s why we’re giving a hearty thumbs up to <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/">this Amazon deal that cuts 35% off the price of the truly jawdropping Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 curved gaming monito</a>r, a 57-inch giant with 4K UHD resolution and elite-level speed and refresh rate. The Odyssey Neo G9 is one of the absolute best gaming monitors available anywhere, and with this $800+ price plunge, it can and should be your 2025 holiday splurge at just $1,500.</p>
<p>Samsung’s established itself as the best monitor brand in the U.S., earning that title and best gaming monitor brand in the U.S. for two years running. The Odyssey Neo G9 is the best evidence of why — it’s truly huge, and the curved effect and flawless performance create one of the most immersive gaming experiences ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The World’s First Dual UHD Monitor</h2>
<p>Talk about unique — the Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 is the first dual UHD monitor ever. The 57-inch display is as wide as two UHD monitors and brings every bit of the mindblowing detail and sharpness across the entire field of view. The action literally wraps around you as you play, giving you as deeply immersive an experience as you can get without using VR goggles.</p>
<p>The 240Hz refresh rate is a lock-solid lag killer, and the 1ms response time ensures that you are on top of your game, every time, with every move. This is the kind of speed that pro gamers use in competition, but at a far smaller price during this Amazon deal. The Odyssey Neo G9 also supports DisplayPort 2.1 for the latest and best connection.</p>
<p>AMD FreeSync Premium Pro technology is built into the monitor to create absolute sync between the Odyssey Neo G9 and the graphics processor of your console or PC, eliminating stutter, tearing, and other game-killing flaws.</p>



<h2>Outrageous Detail</h2>
<p>Samsung’s Quantum Matrix Technology with Quantum Mini LEDs creates some of the best brightness and contrast of any monitor anywhere. There are 2,392 separate dimming zones across the massive screen that combined with outstanding 12-bit black levels to create astoundingly accurate picture quality. The contrast ratio of 1 million to 1, spread over 57 inches of gaming space, will make you unbeatable.</p>
<p>The CoreSync and Core Lighting Plus won’t enhance your gaming, but they will greatly enhance your gaming space and save you the cost of buying gaming lights separately. The CoreSync tech projects your on-screen colors into the room behind you, with the gaming action and the lighting effects in perfect sync.</p>
<p>The Samsung Odyssey Neo G9 gaming monitor — 57 inches of brilliant 4K UHD resolution and blazing speed and refresh rate — is a truly elite device that’s just come way, way down from its elite price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6278/">It’s $800 off at Amazon right now, but only for a limited time, so don’t miss out on your chance to splurge on yourself.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Stranger Things Fans Blame Netflix For The Bad Dialogue In Season 5]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-5-bad-dialogue-clips-video-will-mike-2000651378</link>
            <guid>1376185</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-ghosts-n-goblins-nes-arcade-error-2000649178"><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ fifth and final season</span></a><span> is rolling out on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875"><span>Netflix</span></a><span>, and it’s true, something certainly seems stranger than in previous seasons this time around. Viewers of the long-running supernatural coming-of-age drama are arguing that the show’s writing has taken a massive nosedive, and even as someone who isn’t actively watching the series, I feel like some of the clips popping up on my social media feeds are not flattering. Fans think a Netflix initiative might be to blame.</span></p> <p><span>Take, for example, these two clips of Noah Schnapp and Finn Wolfhard delivering extremely simple, flavorless dialogue with a seriousness and gravitas the language doesn’t earn. Some folks attribute the awkwardness of these scenes to the actors’ performances, but others point out that it’s not just the self-serious delivery that’s the problem; it’s that it’s mixed with dialogue so straightforward that it reads like a mandated plot summary for those who haven’t been paying attention.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><span>This dumbing down of dialogue is just one part of the issue; some are also criticizing the uptick in obnoxious quip-driven writing. Some fans are quick to point out that teenagers might believably say cheesy stuff like the kids do in </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>, however, so that’s more of an ongoing debate. The pushback hasn’t stopped people from making parodies of the latest season, likening its banter to cringe TikTok speak or MCUisms.</span></p>

         <p><span>Fans have a theory that this decline in writing quality may have come from a Netflix mandate. In January, </span><a href="https://www.nplusonemag.com/issue-49/essays/casual-viewing/"><i><span>N+1</span></i></a> <span>ran a story that detailed initiatives within the streaming company which told creatives to essentially treat the service’s original programming as if viewers are going to be on their phones scrolling through social media as they watch it. This means dialogue is dumbed down, basic plot points are repeated unnaturally in spoken exchanges, and ideally someone can follow what’s going on, even if the show doesn’t have their undivided attention.</span></p> <p><span>It’s a real shame that </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>might be falling into this trap in its final season, as fans have been waiting nearly a decade for this show to wrap up. Hopefully, the second set of episodes and the eventual finale will fare better when they’re released on Christmas and New Year’s Eve. Also, let’s hope that this doesn’t end up bleeding into all of the upcoming Warner Bros. projects if Netflix’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-wb-batman-arkham-hogwarts-legacy-mortal-kombat-2000650918"><span>merger goes through</span></a><span>.</span></p>
