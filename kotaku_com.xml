              <p>A demo for a free <a href="https://kotaku.com/impressive-simpsons-hit-run-remake-was-made-by-one-f-1847530115"><em>Simpsons Hit &amp; Run</em></a> mod that turns the beloved game into a <em>Futurama</em> adventure is finally here, around four years after the project was first revealed.</p> <p><em>Futurama Hit &amp; Run</em> is a still-in-development total conversion mod of 2003’s <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/the-simpsons-hit-run">Simpsons Hit &amp; Run</a>,</em> a fan-favorite semi-open-world game based on the long-running animated TV show and featuring most of the original voice cast and writers. <em>Hit &amp; Run</em> is one of those PS2-era games that has a large fanbase of older fans who desperately want a sequel. But what’s even better than a sequel? A whole new game based on a different animated comedy created by Matt Groening.</p>  <p>On October 19, Slurm Team (a collection of fan modders and devs) released the <a href="https://modbakery.donutteam.com/projects/view/48">first playable demo for<em> Futurama Hit &amp; Run</em></a><em>.</em> The free demo features the mod’s first level and is a small slice of the planned full project, <a href="https://youtu.be/5vhFwQmTD5c">which was first announced back in 2021</a>. Still, what is here is impressive and could easily be mistaken for a game that was released back on the PS2 in the early 00s. It should be noted that the devs behind the mod confirm that the demo contains AI-generated voices, but those will be replaced with real voice actor performances in the full release.&nbsp; Honestly, calling this a mod doesn’t feel accurate, as <em>Futurama Hit &amp; Run</em> is more like a new game built using the engine and tech of the OG <em>Simpsons</em> version. Here’s some gameplay of the demo:</p>

  <p>Considering how few <em>Futurama</em> games we got back in the day, and how we’re currently in the middle of a <em>Simpsons</em> video game drought (with <a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-tapped-out-closing-shutting-down-ea-when-faq-1851658796"><em>Tapped Ou</em>t being shut down</a> in 2024), projects like this are the closest things fans of either animated show can hope for in 2025. Well, besides <em>Fortnite</em> skins and events, like a rumored <em>Simpsons</em> event coming to Epic’s battle royale juggernaut later this year. That might be fun, but I’ll still be over here longing for a new<em> Hit &amp; Run</em> starring Homer and the family. <a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-hit-and-run-2-sequel-remake-remaster-planes-1851038958">There were plans to make a sequel back in the day, but it never happened.</a></p> <p>Until then, I can play this new&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Futurama</i>&nbsp;mod using&nbsp;<a href="https://donutteam.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-stringify-link="https://donutteam.com/" data-sk="tooltip_parent">Donut Team’s fan-developed modern PC port of Simpsons Hit &amp; Run</a><i data-stringify-type="italic">,</i>&nbsp;available here. Note that you’ll also need an official copy of the original game to play the port and this new&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Futurama</i>&nbsp;mod.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Friends, you might not know it by scrolling through my author page here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, but there were a few years where I was really disillusioned with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-games-best-worst-part-scarlet-violet-red-blue-1850084491"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a><span>. For a few generations, I played the games, but I wasn’t living and breathing Game Freak’s monster-catching RPGs like I am now and did as a kid. This wasn’t because the games weren’t resonating with me, but because I’d been kind of annoyed by the types of competitive-focused fans I suddenly found myself surrounded by in my high school years. All these years later, </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>has you encountering a group of similarly snobby, pretentious, gatekeeping </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a> <span>battlers, and putting the smack down on them was one of the most karmically satisfying moments in the game for me.</span></p> <p><span>As the kids around me grew up in my small Georgia hometown, it seemed like their relationship to </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>changed. They stopped caring about who their favorite little guys were and started crunching numbers and making spreadsheets, suddenly becoming very concerned about the competitive viability of these monsters above all else. I tell a guy Beautifly is one of my favorite Pokémon and he starts preaching to me about how she’s a weak point in my team because she’s a frail bug. Bro, I don’t give a fuck, look how pretty she is. Eventually, the constant competitive-focused conversational detours those people insisted upon became so obnoxious, they pushed me out of the space. </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>was always a social outlet for me, so to feel like I couldn’t really connect with other people through our mutual love of the world and its mysterious creatures soured me on it almost entirely.</span></p>

 <p><span>Eventually, I found my way back. The </span><i><span>Detective Pikachu </span></i><span>game was the first step back in the door, as its mystery adventure mechanics and hopeful view of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe struck a chord with me in 2018. Then the movie came out, the </span><i><span>Let’s Go </span></i><span>games and </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span> had me tethered to my Switch, and I could not have been more back. I watch competitive play at arm’s length, but I’m still hankering to go to the World Championships some day. By and large, though, I play these games for the worldbuilding, the story, and to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-alolan-raichu-quest-how-to-get-mega-2000637259"><span>hang out with Raichu</span></a><span>. Don’t tell me how to make my Pokémon better for a hypothetical tournament I’ll never compete in. I do not wish to know.</span></p>

  <p><span>I’m not the only one who feels this way, either, as evidenced by a group of kids in </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> who call in Lumiose City’s mob equivalent to, with your help, get some competitive snobs to leave them alone. Lumiose City has a group called the Society of Battle Connoisseurs, which is led by the fairy-type trainer Jacinthe, a rich socialite who has a large amount of influence in the Paris-inspired metropolis. She is also, as you will come to find out, someone who insists upon herself, shows up uninvited, and puts literal barriers up to trap people into doing what she wants, and she seems to be involved in some kind of odd, fetishistic relationship in which she makes Lebanne dress up as a maid as some kind of humiliation ritual. That insistence seems to trickle down to the rest of the SBC members, as our first encounter with them is during a quest in which the player is running errands for the Rust Syndicate. A pair of these elites has started hounding a group of children, probably aged between five and eight, about how to make their Pokémon the Very Best Like No One Ever Was. Are you feeding your Pokémon the right supplements to ensure they’re competitively viable? If not, the SBC will come find you and pester you in broad daylight.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000637287" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637287"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637287">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>So these poor kids call in for backup, and because I am indebted to the Rust Syndicate, that backup is me. The kids run up to me with distressed looks on their faces, and say they were just having battles on their own before the two people dressed way too well to be hanging out on a battle court started “lecturing” them about the importance of competitive viability. “I bet they’re just trying to show off to us because nobody their own age will put up with them,” one says. And despite all their insistence upon their own competitive superiority, my team wipes them out, and they go running off to their homebase with their Slowpoke tails between their legs. It was cathartic.</span></p> <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is such an expansive franchise that it can mean different things to different people. Some fans only engage with the games, others with the anime or card game, and some may just like having plushes on their desk. A series this big and broad is never just one thing to everybody, and trying to insist that it should be is the kind of toxicity that pushes people out. There will always be bad apples in the community that want everyone to conform to their vision of things, but at least I got to send my own personal </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>snobs packing.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Your beloved older laptop’s biggest problem might not be that balky spacebar you’ve already replaced twice, or the big scratch on the lid. If it’s been sort of gasping and wheezing along, it could just be an issue of storage, or lack thereof. An overstuffed hard drive in a PC laptop or desktop is an unhappy hard drive, and an unhappy hard drive can bring everything to a screeching halt.</p>
<p>You could replace the whole thing, obviously, or <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4874/">you could give the old fella a new lease on life for as little as $55 by hitting Amazon for their deals on the Samsung 870 EVO 2.5-inch SSDs</a>, ranging in size from 500GB all the way up to a monstrous 4TB. It’s like a brain transplant, but far less expensive, and with no bonesaws needed.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4874/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bigger, Faster, Better</h2>
<p>We’ve established that replacing an older, smaller internal SSD with a Samsung 870 EVO doesn’t require a pile of money, but it also doesn’t require a mastery of IT skills. Once you back up your old drive to a reliable external storage device, swapping it out for the Samsung 870 EVO is a fast, easy procedure. Restore your files to the new drive, and the difference in performance will be immediately obvious. That’s due in part to the vastly superior speed of the 870 EVO — sequential speeds of up to 560/530 MB/s.</p>
<p>Unlike your old drive, the 870 EVO is up to the heaviest of tasks, including 8K video processing, and it’s built with durability and length of life in mind — the 4TB model is guaranteed by Samsung for up to 2,400 TBW (terabytes written). And, while it is absolutely recommended that you do a little research beforehand to ensure the Samsung 870 EVO is compatible with your laptop or desktop PC, it’s been compatibility-tested for a massive array of host systems and applications, including chipsets, motherboards, NAS, and video recording devices.</p>



<h2>Who Knew?</h2>
<p>Samsung has been renowned for so many high-quality tech products over the years, from TVs to smartphones, home appliances to tablets, laptops to wireless earbuds, it’s easy to overlook the fact that Samsung has also been the world’s leading brand for flash memory for over two decades, all the way back to 2003. Whether you’re opting for the 500GB model of the 870 EVO for just $55, going all the way up to the 4TB for $260, or somewhere in between, you’re getting an internal drive from the world’s leading brand.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4874/">The current Amazon deal is for the 500GB model of the Samsung 870 EVO — it’s 27% off right now, bringing its price down from $75 to $55</a>. The 1TB ($95), 2TB ($180), and 4TB ($260) models are currently listed at full price. But even if you’re looking to replace a 500GB hard drive, the Amazon deal for just $55 delivers a far faster, more advanced drive than your current one.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/reolink-solar-powered-outdoor-security-camera-is-selling-out-fast-at-its-lowest-price-yet.1329541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Something simple you can do to your home to feel a bit safer is install a home security system. One or more outdoor cameras can bring you peace of mind, allowing you to monitor your home and keep it safe from unwanted intruders. Heck, even just having a visible camera attached to your house can be enough to deter someone from stepping onto your property. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4873/">Reolink as both a 5MP and 8MP security camera that’s solar-powered and happens to be part of an Amazon limited time deal. Right now, you can get either of these outdoor cameras for 27% off.</a> That brings the 5MP model down from $120 to $88, saving you $32 and the 8MP camera down from $150 to just $110, saving you $40.</p>
<p>The 5MP Reolink security camera is capable of recording in a detailed resolution of over 2K while the 8MP can capture even more details, recording in full 4K. The cameras work both day and night as they have support for night vision. And this isn’t that crappy kind of night vision you see in the movies. This records in full color even after dark.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4873/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The 2K+ and 4K security cameras can pan and tilt, able to survey nearly a full 360 degrees. You’ll be able to view the the full extent of your property right from your laptop, phone, or tablet.</p>
<h2>Security Camera That Powers Itself</h2>
<p>The Reolink security camera system is solar-powered, which of the three ways to power a security camera is clearly the best. Lots of wireless security cameras are battery powered, so over time you’ll need to get the ladder out of the garage and up high to replace the batteries. A wired solution will never run out of charge, but you’re now limited in where you mount it to somewhere nearby an outdoor outlet. Solar power is the best of both worlds. The freedom to install it anywhere you need with the convenience of setting it up once and letting it just do it’s thing.</p>



<p>Just 10 minutes of daylight is enough to power the Reolink security camera systema full 24 hours. Five hours of sunlight will give it enough juice to run for up to four months, so no need to worry about a cloudy or rainy day every once in a while.</p>
<p>Installation is easy as pie. It’s wire-free and just clicks into place inside its mount. Should take your no more than five minutes of your day.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/what-did-miyamoto-actually-say-about-old-games-and-nintendo-movies-2000637247</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! Today, we’re talking about a viral misquote from Mario’s dad, getting an update on the<em> Sleeping Dogs</em> movie, finding out why <em>Dead Cells 2</em> was never made, and checking out the duck-themed extraction shooter that is also the latest Steam sensation. Oh, and it’s Monday. Boo! But hey, not every day can be as cool as Saturday. Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <h2><strong>An Inaccurate Miyamoto Quote About Old Games Went Viral Over The Weekend</strong></h2> <p>On Sunday, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stealth40k.bsky.social">video game collector and content creator Stealth40K</a> shared a quote from a recent interview with Mario creator and legendary game designer Shigeru Miyamoto about old games becoming unplayable and movies lasting forever. “Games eventually stop running when newer versions come out, but films remain forever,” was the quote shared by the account.</p>

 <p>The post, now deleted, quickly went viral online, as many thought it was very funny that someone from Nintendo, a company that has made it very difficult to preserve and emulate old games, would seemingly moan about retro titles becoming unplayable one day. Lots of takes were shared and jokes made. Except there was one problem: The quote was potentially inaccurate and possibly taken out of context.</p>

 <p>As pointed out by many, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/erasu.bsky.social/post/3m3kwej7aqk2g">including Erasu on Bluesky</a>, the quote Stealth40K shared online was from a press release that seemingly pulled a quote from a longer answer from a <a href="https://www.ndw.jp/nintendomuseum-interview-240925/">September 2024 interview</a> <em>Nintendo Dream Web </em>conducted with Miyamoto that delved into Nintendo IP, preserving old games, and using movies and other media to keep characters like Mario around, even as old games become harder to access. Of course, the original quote has to be translated, so unless you natively speak Japanese or ask the designer himself, it’s impossible to fully understand what Miyamoto meant, but here’s a translation of the full quote:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“Ultimately, what people remember are the IPs. Games become obsolete when new versions come out. But that’s incredibly sad. We started video production partly because of that sadness -seeing our creations become playable only on Virtual Console. Even making them playable in a museum has its limits, but video content can endure forever. I envision more and more of these things accumulating, making Nintendo itself a huge brand.”</p></blockquote> <p>And to be clear: I’m not 100 percent sure this translated version of the interview is exactly what Miyamoto meant, or <a href="https://english.kyodonews.net/articles/-/63038">if the quote included in the press release</a> was an accurate translation or a completely new quote from Miyamoto reiterating the point he made back in 2024. But what I can tell you for a fact is that you should be careful when you see a juicy quote from a famous person or creator, as it’s possible that it’s not accurate or that it’s taken completely out of context. Be careful out there, folks.</p>

 <h2><strong>New Report Reveals More About The Rumored <em>Resident Evil 0</em> Remake&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-resident-evil-0-remake-in-development-new-casting-and-plot-details-unearthed">A new report from <em>MP1st</em> corroborates</a> previous rumors and reports about Capcom’s work on a <em>Resident Evil 0</em> remake. The outlet claims that<em> Guardians of the Galaxy</em> video game voice actor Jon McLaren is involved with the project, which is codenamed Project Chamber. It’s believed he will star as Billy Coen, one of the game’s co-protagonists. The report also details some changes the remake is allegedly making to the source material, though the reported info is a bit spoilery, so I’ll let you read the full article if you want to learn more.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This new Resident Evil Zero Remake leak/rumor is true, and I believe the first real details on RE:0 shared online outside me talking about it's existence, delay, change of hands on developer, &amp; 2028 release window previously:<a href="https://t.co/xMKCsDyyvI">https://t.co/xMKCsDyyvI</a></p> <p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1980233514579845448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Dusk Golem, a well-known Capcom and<em> Resident Evil</em> insider who has a solid track record, shared the report on Twitter and claimed it was accurate. The unannounced<em> RE0 </em>remake is reportedly launching sometime in 2028, following a previously reported <em>Code Veronica</em> remake that is in development.</p>

 <h2><strong>New Duck-Themed Extraction Shooter Sells Half A Million Copies In 72 Hours</strong></h2> <p>Here’s a great reminder that you can’t predict what will be successful on Steam. <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3167020/charts/"><em>Escape From Duckov</em></a>, a top-down single-player extraction shooter starring cute little ducks, has sold over <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/escape-from-duckov-crosses-500000-sales-in-3-days">500,000 copies in three days</a>. Wowza! Meanwhile, over on SteamDB, the game reached 180k concurrent players over the weekend. That makes it one of the most popular games on the platform, putting it above giants like <em>Rust </em>and <em>Grand Theft Auto V.</em> Will people still be playing the game in two weeks, or will everyone move on to some other new viral game? No idea, but for now at least, some cute ducks with guns have taken over Steam.</p> <h2><strong>The <em>Sleeping Dogs</em> Movie Has A Finished Script</strong></h2> <p>For nearly <a href="https://deadline.com/2017/03/donnie-yen-sleeping-dogs-neal-moritz-original-film-1201948700/">a decade now,</a> Square Enix and Hollywood have been trying to make a movie based on 2012’s open-world action game <em>Sleeping Dogs</em>. Over the weekend the film’s star, Simu Liu, posted a screenshot of the completed <em>Sleeping Dogs</em> script. So it seems like people are still trying to make a <em>Sleeping Dogs</em> movie. Good luck, I guess.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">in honour of our sleeping dogs script draft being done, here’s my sleepy dog 👍 <a href="https://t.co/l1KsFNDj5V">pic.twitter.com/l1KsFNDj5V</a></p> <p>— Simu Liu (@SimuLiu) <a href="https://twitter.com/SimuLiu/status/1979664278459388314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2><strong><em>Dead Cells 2</em> Isn’t A Thing Because The Devs Ignored Fan Demands And Made Something New</strong></h2> <p>A lot of people love 2018’s roguelike platformer <em>Dead Cells.</em> A lot of those people would love a sequel. Instead, developer Motion Twin went and made a different follow-up game called <em>Windblown</em> that people seem to like as well, but not nearly as much as <em>Dead Cells.</em> And Motion Twin’s co-creative director and designer, Yannick Berthier, doesn’t seem to mind.</p> <p>“We are driven by what we want to make,” <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/dead-cells/2-why-it-never-happened">Berthier told <em>PCGamesN</em> in a recent interview</a>. “If we were a ‘business,’ we would be talking about <em>Dead Cells 2</em> right now. We are not talking about <em>Dead Cells 2.</em> We are talking about <em>Windblown</em>, because we are a collective of individuals that are creative and want to create stuff. [If] we would have been [part of] another company, maybe the pressure to do a sequel would have been way, way stronger – I mean, internally. Externally, it’s super strong. Every post we do, we tend to have a few comments like, ‘OK, cool, when <em>Dead Cells 2?</em>‘ But it’s fine.
