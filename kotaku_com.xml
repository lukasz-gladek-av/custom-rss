              <p>Hit the button! The big red one. Over <em>there</em>. Fine, I’ll hit it. *LOUD MUSIC STARTS* Folks, it’s Friday! We made it to the weekend. But first, before you go off and enjoy the last work day of the week, please read today’s Morning Checkpoint. Today, we’re talking about <em>The Last of Us </em>TV show, looking at the future of S<em>pace Marine 2,</em> checking out some sales data for<em> Cyberpunk 2077,</em> and learning what Kojima thinks of AI. Someone hit that button again. It’s too loud, I can’t think.</p> <h2>Hideo Kojima thinks AI is the next big gaming revolution</h2> <p>The <em>Death Stranding 2</em> director was in the midst of his Saudi Arabia tour stop when he opined on how games are changing. “Gaming is always about technology,” he said during a panel discussion, <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/hideo-kojima-nicolas-winding-refn-blur-lines-games-cinema-1235416035/"><em>Rolling Stone</em> reports</a>. “At first, the games were all 2D, about 16 colors, 16 bits…the biggest, first change was [that] games became 3D. The second is we [became] connected by [the] internet, and you could play [online]. The third is the trend right now that AI is now coming into game creation, and we have not just ChatGPT, but they learn from how the players control. And I think that you’ll take advantage of that.”</p> <p>But Kojima seems more interested in going to the movies or visiting museums than chatting with bots and playing games. “I probably just play maybe one game a year,” he said.</p>

 <h2><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on Switch 2 sold far more physical copies than digital</h2> <p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/75-of-cyberpunk-2077s-nintendo-switch-2-sales-were-physical/">As spotted by <em>VGC</em></a>, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> developer CD Projekt revealed during the company’s latest financial results that its open-world sci-fi RPG featuring Keanu Reeves was a big hit on Switch 2. Interestingly, 75 percent of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> copies sold on Switch 2 in June were physical game cards. This is notable as CD Projekt Red opted not to use the controversial game key card system, and instead, <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was one of the biggest third-party Switch 2 launch window games to ship entirely on a physical game cart.</p> <p>Considering <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> was reportedly the <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-switch-2-set-a-us-launch-month-record-at-1-6-million-units/">best-selling third-party game on Nintendo’s new console</a>, it seems Switch 2 owners, at least for now, prefer a real physical copy over key card shenanigans.</p>

 <h2><em>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</em> is getting a brand new class in 2026</h2> <p><em>Space Marine 2</em> launched a year ago this month. To celebrate the third-person shooter entering its second year, <a href="https://www.focus-entmt.com/en/news/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-unveils-its-year-2-roadmap-and-sets-its-anniversary-update-to-september-4">Saber Interactive has released a new roadmap</a> for it that promises a lot of new content, including a new class: The Techmarine. The studio didn’t share many details about the new class, but did confirm that Techmarines will get to wield Omnissiah Axes, a new exclusive weapon. Beyond the new class, the next year of content includes new PVE missions, PVP maps, fresh cosmetic options, and more.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Space Marine 2 - Year 2 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CxtlJ06u_lc?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2>New report claims Sony is planning a Switch-like PS6 handheld</h2> <p>YouTube channel and reliable tech leaker and reporter <a href="https://youtu.be/x-A3Bl2hXoQ">Moore’s Law Is Dead claims in a new video</a> to have seen multiple documents mentioning that Sony is working on a portable, handheld PlayStation 6 console that will launch alongside a more powerful, traditional machine. Notably, the channel claims that this PS6 handheld will support the ability to dock and connect to a TV, like the Switch, turning it into a more traditional home console. Moore’s Law Is Dead speculates that this PS6 portable console might cost around $500 and could ship sometime in 2027.</p>

 <h2>Bella Ramsey tells <em>Last of Us</em> TV show haters to go play the game</h2> <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-star-bella-ramsey-has-a-message-for-the-haters/1100-6534348/">As reported by <em>GameSpot</em> and <em>Culture Crave</em>,&nbsp;</a> Ellie actor Bella Ramsey talked about HBO’s <em>The Last of Us</em> and its already aired season two, as well as the upcoming season three. She discussed the death of Joel in season two and negative reactions to the show’s second year, saying:</p> <p>“There is nothing I can do about it anyway. The show is out. There is nothing that can be changed or altered [for Season 2]. There is not really any point in reading or looking at anything. People are of course entitled to their opinions. It doesn’t affect the show, it doesn’t affect how the show continues or anything, in any way, so they’re very separate things to me. So no, I just don’t really engage.”</p> <p>She also added that people who dislike the series can stop watching, explaining, “I would say, you don’t have to watch it. If you hate it that much, the game exists. You can just play the game again. You don’t have to watch [Season 3]. If you do want to watch it, I hope you enjoy it,”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/voidbreaker-fps-review-steam-pc-gamepass-titanfall-roguelike-roguelite-2000621067">The best new game you’re not playing is <i>Hades</i>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<i>Portal</i>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<i>Titanfall</i>&nbsp;meets&nbsp;<i>Battlefield</i></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4-blizzard-union-ai-layoffs-microsoft-2000621003"><em>Diablo</em> developers unionized: “Passion can’t protect us from job instability”</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/hitman-woa-freelancer-world-of-assassination-roguelike-2000620985"><em>Hitman: World of Assassination</em> quietly became a lot more than just the best stealth game around</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="I Bought 100 Copies of Mario Paint for the Art" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aHuQZVtzdIo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-world-championship-closing-ceremony-recap-z-a-2000618195"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is shaking up the series’ formula in more ways than one when it launches in October. It’s got real-time combat, it all takes place in one city rather than an entire region, and it has a new take on multiplayer to take advantage of that new battle system. Even with all this newness, perhaps the most exciting thing Game Freak is adding is more of something old: Mega Evolutions. These superpowered temporary transformations have long been one of </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans’ </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-best-gimmicks-mega-evolution-tera-types-1850736746"><span>favorite battle gimmicks</span></a><span> from over the years, and since we’re heading back to Kalos, their region of origin, what better time than now to add a wave of new Mega Evolutions? A list of possible new forms </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolutions-new-leak-starters-1851772521"><span>leaked earlier this year</span></a><span>, and so far it seems to be accurate. Here are all the Mega Evolutions we know of so far.</span></p> <h2><b>Mega Dragonite</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Start a New Story in Lumiose City with Pokémon Legends: Z-A!" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fWDx1omjIwM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p><span>Mega Dragonite was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legends-za-champions-friends-concierge-1851786682"><span>the first new form</span></a><span> revealed for </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. It emphasizes traits from its pre-evolution, Dragonair, by including a jewel on its tail and adding wings to the sides of its head. It maintains its Dragon/Flying typing, but becomes exceptionally faster and stronger in this form. Mega Dragonite views taking out an enemy quickly as an act of kindness, and has a jolly big smile when it uses powerful attacks because it knows all this violence will be over soon. It’s basically Superman.</span></p> <h2><b>Mega Victreebel</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Mega Victreebel Raises a Stink! | Pokémon Legends: Z-A" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f79j5pSboEQ?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>used a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-victreebel-evolution-trailer-2000619134"><span>spooky found footage video</span></a><span> to reveal Mega Victreebel, but if you take it out of that environment, it is one of the goofier looking Mega Evolutions in the series. The pitcher plant Pokémon’s body has become so engorged with acid that it ties one of its own vines around its throat in order to contain all of it within its bulbous stomach. Now it hops around on its belly as it stalks its prey and loosens the grip around its neck when it needs to projectile vomit its acid onto an enemy.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Mega Hawlucha</b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Mega Hawlucha Makes a Comeback! | Pokémon Legends: Z-A" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xt4ccSMw870?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-hawlucha-machamp-trailer-2000620960"><span>Hawlucha’s new Mega form</span></a><span> is probably the most straightforward one we’ve seen thus far. It gets buff like it’s been downing creatine, dons a new mask and cape combo, and its feathers form a belt around its waist. Mega Hawlucha also gets a signature move called Flying Press that it used on Machamp in its reveal cinematic.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That’s all the Mega Evolutions we know of so far. Game Freak will no doubt reveal more between now and when </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>comes to Switch and Switch 2 on October 16. Will Mega Raichu be among them, or will I be made to suffer </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-raichu-alolan-pikachu-anime-1851011570"><span>another slight for my favorite electric rodent</span></a><span>? We all know the answer. I don’t need you to rub it in.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-owned-hyperx-gaming-headset-now-cheaper-than-last-labor-day-as-amazon-clears-out-stock-2000621022</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hp-owned-hyperx-gaming-headset-now-cheaper-than-last-labor-day-as-amazon-clears-out-stock.1283949/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Playing video games with over-the-ear headphones feels like a wholly different experience than just having the audio play through your TV speakers. The word “immersion” gets tossed around so easily these days, but I get it. Having you game sound pumped right into your ears is a more immersive experience. If you don’t have a pair, you can actually get yourself a wireless gaming headset for not too much money. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3790/">The HyperX Cloud III which normally goes for $150 just dropped by 33% at Amazon.</a> That shaves $50 off the price, bringing what you pay down to only $100 for a limited time.</p>
<p><strong>The audio of the HyperX Cloud II gaming headset is strong</strong>. It’s got angled 53mm drivers designed to optimizing your listening experience while gaming. Hear the pitter-patter of enemy footsteps so no one can get the jump on you when playing ranked.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3790/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Comfort Is King</h2>
<p>The HyperX Cloud IIIs are a comfortable wear. The HyperX signature memory foam all along the headband softens and spreads out the pressure along your crown so you won’t get that weird pain some headsets can cause after a long wear. The ear cushions are plush, wrapped in a premium faux leather which serves the purpose of keeping your ears cozy and locking in the sound.</p>
<p>Any wireless headset worth it’s salt needs good battery life. There ain’t no point in going wireless if you always need to plug it back in to charge after just a couple Victory Royales. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3790/">The HyperX Cloud III is a behemoth of power.</a> This thing can last you up to 120 hours on a single charge. That’s five full days of battery. So long has you make a habit of plugging it back in every couple of weeks when you’re done, you’ll never have to worry about not having a charge to play. If your gaming sessions are lasting longer than five days, please see a doctor.</p>



<p>Not in a party chat? Just playing some solo runs of <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> or something of the like? Go ahead and pop off the detachable microphone to get it out of the way. When you are in those chats and using the microphones, you can expect high-quality audio with clear voice coming through and going out. The mic is noise-cancelling with a built-in mesh filter to ensure your squad mates only hear your voice and not any disruptive noises in the background.</p>
<p>The headset is durable with it’s flexible aluminum frame. It can travel easily without worry and if you’re prone to accidentally knocking your stuff off your coffee table when you walk by, it should be just fine.</p>
