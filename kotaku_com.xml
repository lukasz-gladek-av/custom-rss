              <p>Netflix’s co-CEO, Ted Sarandos, doesn’t believe that the streaming giant is a negative force in the film industry. Instead, the soon-to-be owner of Warner Bros.&nbsp; believes Netflix is more of a savior.</p> <p>Netflix announced its <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">$82 billion bid to gobble up Warner Bros</a>., the legendary film and media company, earlier today. If it clears regulatory hurdles, the deal will position the supreme ruler of streaming services as a God Emperor of a massive TV and film catalog, as well as the properties belonging to Warner Bros. Games, which include the Lego games, as well as DC adaptations like the <i>Arkham </i>series of <i>Batman</i> games, and the <i>Mortal Kombat</i> games.</p> <p>During an interview with <i>Time </i>magazine editor-in-chief Sam Jacobs <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/netflix-ceo-ted-sarandos-movie-theaters-outdated-1236376565/">earlier this year</a>, Sarandos was asked point-blank: “Have you destroyed Hollywood?”</p> <p>“No,” Sarandos replied, “we’re saving Hollywood.”</p> <p>The CEO then casted doubt on the role of movie theaters moving forward. Though the streaming giant will need to premiere some films in theaters to be considered for certain awards, Sarandos doesn’t see the theater experience as something accessible for most folks. He said:</p>

 <blockquote><p>If you’re [fortunate enough to live in] Manhattan, and you can walk to a multiplex and see a movie, that’s fantastic. Most of the country cannot.</p></blockquote> <p>It’s a bit of an odd statement considering that cars exist. Still, Sarandos sees the industry’s reliance on theaters as an arbitrary limitation he’s happy to dispense with, much to the displeasure of Hollywood veterans <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-academy-awards-mean-nothing-to-me-if-they-dont-mean-theatrical-avatar-director-james-cameron-says-netflix-films-should-not-qualify-for-the-oscars-because-theyre-not-in-theaters">like <em>Avatar</em> creator James Cameron</a>.</p>

 <p>The industry remains concerned over the impact Netflix is likely to have should its purchase of Warner Bros. go through. <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">According to <i>A Shot</i></a>, the Director’s Guild of America, led by director Christopher Nolan, is going to meet with the streaming company to address “major concerns.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Directors Guild of America, led by president Christopher Nolan, plans to meet with Netflix to address major concerns regarding the streamer’s acquisition of Warner Bros. <a href="https://t.co/EcwdZ0A0Qz">pic.twitter.com/EcwdZ0A0Qz</a></p> <p>— A Shot (@ashotmagazine) <a href="https://twitter.com/ashotmagazine/status/1996978975311364261?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Theaters have been in a bit of a bind ever since the global pandemic made it hard to convince people to leave their homes to go see a movie. Should Netflix’s Warner Bros. acquisition go through, it’s all the more likely that even fewer movies may hit the literal big screen.</p> <p>And with that, let’s <a href="https://youtu.be/wKiIroiCvZ0">reflect on some wise words</a> about experiencing movies from one of the all-time greats.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/avengers-endgame-rerelease-movie-theater-tickets-doomsday-2000651023</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Marvel Studios has just announced it’s bringing the 2019 MCU finale </span><i><span>Avengers: Endgame</span></i><span> back to theaters next year.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“<i>Avengers: Endgame</i> — Back in theaters, September 2026,” <a href="https://x.com/MarvelStudios/status/1997018384719020370">Marvel Studios announced on X</a> on Friday. It’s accompanied by a short video that begins with a black screen before Anthon</span><span>y Mackie’s iconic “on your left” line plays, revealing the <i>Avengers: Endgame</i> logo to what is presumably a recording of a theater audience’s hoots and hollers. “Avengers, assemble,” Chris Evans’ Captain America says, accompanied by more screaming. </span></p> <p><span>We have reached the stage in pop culture where we are nostalgic for something that happened six years ago.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Avengers: Endgame — Back in theaters, September 2026. <a href="https://t.co/PRmW9pEAxm">pic.twitter.com/PRmW9pEAxm</a></p> <p>— Marvel Studios (@MarvelStudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelStudios/status/1997018384719020370?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>(Hilariously, an account called the Official Chicken Little Movie Account posted the entirety of&nbsp;<em>Avengers: Endgame</em> as a reply to the announcement.)</p>

 <p><span>Maybe this is a sign of how badly the COVID pandemic damaged our cultural psyche, but it’s more likely Marvel is trying to bring back some goodwill ahead of the release of </span><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday</span></i><span> next December. </span><i><span>Doomsday</span></i><span>, part of the </span><i><span>Avengers</span></i><span> series that first kicked off in 2012, is also considered a part of the “Multiverse Saga,” which plays on the franchise’s recent focus on time travel and alternate realities (we’ve seen it play out in films like </span><i><span>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Spider-Man: No Way Home</span></i><span>).</span></p>

 <p><span>Thanks to the multiverse’s rule-bending logic, </span><i><span>Doomsday</span></i><span> will star Robert Downey Jr., who played Iron Man in the first four </span><i><span>Avengers</span></i><span> films, but returns this time as Doctor Doom. It will also feature a massive, frankly absurd ensemble cast drawn in part from more than two decades of comic book movies. The roster is split into what appears to be teams, if this post claiming to showcase a video of a recent Disney Italia presentation is to be believed.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Disney Italia presented 'AVENGERS: DOOMSDAY' at a conference in Sorrento</p> <p>(via <a href="https://t.co/My30rheaoK">https://t.co/My30rheaoK</a>)<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/avengersdoomsday?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#avengersdoomsday</a> <a href="https://t.co/mRwzyOYM9z">pic.twitter.com/mRwzyOYM9z</a></p> <p>— Nerd Al Quadrato (@nerdalquadrato) <a href="https://twitter.com/nerdalquadrato/status/1995901455585227173?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The “teams” include actors from the original MCU flicks (Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Tom Hiddleston as Loki), the aughts </span><i><span>X-Men</span></i><span> movies (Patrick Stewart as Professor X, Rebecca Romijn as Mystique), the </span><i><span>Fantastic Four</span></i><span> reboot (Pedro Pascal as Mr. Fantastic, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm), and the </span><i><span>Thunderbolts</span></i><span> crew AKA </span><i><span>The New Avengers</span></i><span> (Sebastian Stan as Winter Soldier, Florence Pugh as Yelena Belova).</span></p>

 <p><span>If </span><i><span>Doomsday</span></i><span> sticks to its December 2026 release date, it’ll hit theaters more than seven years after </span><i><span>Endgame</span></i><span>. Normally, you could argue Marvel is worried fans will have forgotten what’s going on, but nearly every movie released since 2019 has somehow tied into the larger MCU picture. Plus, </span><i><span>Endgame</span></i><span> was the </span><i><span>end</span></i><span> of many core Avengers’ stories, while <em>Doomsday</em> seems to be picking up threads from a menagerie of Marvel films.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The cynic in me thinks this is an attempt to recreate the magic that took place when </span><i><span>Endgame</span></i><span> released all those years ago, and bad people recording in the movie theater with their phones gave us </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAIzLj3mYTw"><span>real-time audience reactions</span></a><span> to the return of the Thanos-snapped heroes and Captain America wielding Thor’s hammer. (If you consider that a spoiler, you must have been trapped in ice for the last half-decade.) The screams, the cheers, the exclamations of surprise—aside from the most recent </span><i><span>Spider-Man</span></i><span> flick bringing back Tobey Maguire and Andrew Garfield to stand alongside Tom Holland in Spidey suits, Marvel hasn’t gotten a crowd pop like that since.</span></p> <p><span>There have been some serious stinkers since </span><i><span>Endgame</span></i><span>, including </span><i><span>Eternals</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Captain America: Brave New World, </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i><span>Maybe Marvel hopes we’ll all step into a time machine and transport us back to a pre-COVID era when superhero movies could still stir something in our hearts. Nostalgia, remember, is a helluva drug.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/heres-how-to-fix-metroid-prime-4s-silliest-control-decision-2000651021</link>
            <guid>1374907</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-impressions-first-level-volt-forge-titanfall-2-factory-2000650657"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond,</em></a> out now on Switch and Switch 2, is a game that, as I continue to play it, is winning me over more. But one part of <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><em>Prime 4</em></a> annoyed me so much that I had to finally go into the settings, dig through some menus, and bypass a warning screen to fix it. I’m talking about the default jump button for the Morph Ball which is, inexplicably, different from the regular jump button.</p> <p>Look, I understand that this isn’t new to<em> Prime 4</em>. It was like this in <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-remastered-nintendo-switch-kotaku-review-1850124313"><em>Metroid Prime Remastered</em>,</a> too, and <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/960329-metroid-prime-trilogy/58099153">the Wii version of <em>Prime 2</em></a>. So for some folks, this might be second nature and not weird at all. But I haven’t played much <em>Metroid Prime </em>beyond the remaster of the first game, so when I discovered that jumping in Morph Ball mode used the X button instead of B, which is how you jump when controlling Samus on foot, I was perturbed.</p>

 <h2>How to change the jump controls in <em>Metroid Prime 4</em></h2> <p>I tried to play using the default controls for a bit, hoping I’d get used to it, but no luck. Thankfully, Nintendo and Retro Studios let you customize <em>Prime 4</em>‘s controls. The problem is that to do so, you have to dig through a few menus and alarm bells. It’s odd. But here’s how to change the Morph Ball jump button in<em> Metroid Prime 4: Beyond:</em></p> <ol> <li> <blockquote><p>Pause the game and open up the settings menu.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Scroll down to the control scheme subsection and hit A.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Now hit ZR to bring up the Morph Ball controls.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Select “Spring Ball” and hit A.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Now highlight the B button slot and confirm the swap.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>If your B button slot contains question marks (???) you need to do another step</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>The game will ask you if you want to go into advanced mode. Hit Ok.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>Now you can swap the&nbsp;??? (which is later revealed to be the Spin Ball ability) and fix this silly control choice.</p></blockquote> </li> </ol> <p>This should work the same on Switch or Switch 2. Since making this change, I’ve had a lot more fun jumping around as the Morph Ball. I’m not sure why Nintendo buried this option in some menus and behind a warning, but I’m thankful they included the ability to remap controls at all. Not every developer does that, and it can be very annoying. Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’m going to go hop around as a ball in <em>Metroid Prime 4.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/game-awards-statue-elder-scrolls-6-geoff-keighley-2000651010</link>
            <guid>1374784</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>For one night in 2005, the Mojave Desert glowed green. Microsoft inexplicably launched its then-new console, the Xbox 360, with a release event in a hangar in the desert. A Microsoft executive told Gizmodo in 2005 </span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/xbox-360-zero-hour-burning-man-as-interpreted-by-micro-138815"><span>that it was supposed to resemble Burning Man</span></a><span>, the art festival where Silicon Valley’s rich reenact the prelude to a </span><i><span>BioShock</span></i><span> game.. Another executive called it an “</span><a href="https://mashable.com/article/xbox-360-launch-event-zero-hour-photos"><span>Xbox 360 oasis</span><span>.</span></a><span>” Journalists and Xbox fans—it was both a press event and a player launch party—lounged on beanbags to play the hottest new console at one of dozens of stations. Microsoft served alcohol from paneled domes that are now synonymous with </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/12/31/950178368/yurts-igloos-and-pop-up-domes-how-safe-is-outside-restaurant-dining-this-winter"><span>covid-era outdoor dining</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>These sorts of big budget gaming events, where companies spared no expense on luring press and fans into weird places—all in the name of promoting new hardware or games—don’t exist much anymore. But 20 years later, an artifact channeling that bygone era has reemerged, once again, this time in the Colorado desert: a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/geoff-keighley-desert-statue-tga-diablo-4-2000649133"><span>mysterious demonic statue</span></a><span> with the bodies of the damned etched into its sides.</span></p>

 <h2>The Game Awards’ portal to hell</h2> <p><span>The Game Awards overseer Geoff Keighley posted a photo of the mysterious statue with a </span><a href="https://what3words.com/regal.inspiring.thickness"><span>geocode pointing people to an area of Joshua Tree National Park</span></a><span>, just off of Yucca Mesa Road. Tendrils glow red from the statue at night, illuminating the screaming skeletons of both humans and creatures. Several people who’ve visited the statue have posted about it on social media and Reddit. Apparently, a security guard watches over the relic—”cool dude,” </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1pcvnhp/so_i_got_to_visit_the_statue/"><span>according to Reddit user TautSexyElfKing</span></a><span>—and the statue makes sounds. Another person instructed others to knock on the door, saying something else will knock back.</span></p>

 <p><span>“It was very ambient and hellish sounding,” TautSexyElfKing said. “Almost like it was a doorway and on the other side was a large cavern with demons lurking about the other side. Maybe some light growling-ish sounds. There wasn’t anything I could make out in particular that would be a hint or anything”</span></p>

 <p><span>To the unaware, it looks like the kind of thing you might find at Burning Man, or maybe an altar for worshipping the devil. But Keighley’s post is a signal to gamers that this is an Easter egg—a marketing stunt. It’s working, not because it’s hyping people up for any specific game or console, but because it’s pushing people toward Keighley’s pride and joy: an end of year bash produced, owned, and hosted by the man himself.</span></p>

 <p><span>The statue itself is ambiguous enough that spectators can map it onto whatever’s at the top of their Game Awards World Premier wishlist. It’s off Yucca Mesa Road, so it must be for </span><i><span>Half-Life 3</span></i><span>. The demonic symbols are an obvious reference to </span><i><span>Diablo 4</span></i><span>‘s next expansion. No, wait—</span><a href="https://x.com/BT_BlackThunder/status/1994865924206452744"><span>maybe that’s </span><i><span>God of War</span></i></a><span>. It’s essentially a hell portal, which clearly means </span><i><span>Doom</span></i><span>. I don’t know, maybe </span><i><span>Elder Scrolls 6</span></i><span>? Or, perhaps, </span><a href="https://x.com/NoMansSky/status/1995954970626326556"><span>Keighley is simply himself opening a portal to hell</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1pdt9n9/what_if_its_not_teasing_a_game_at_all_and_geoff/"><span>intends to destroy the whole dang world</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">no one is considering that Geoff is simply opening a hell portal <a href="https://t.co/XKEgj6N3e6">https://t.co/XKEgj6N3e6</a></p> <p>— Sean Murray (@NoMansSky) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/1995954970626326556?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Apparently everyone is wrong, </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1pcf4dp/jason_schreier_says_that_the_game_awards_statue/"><span>according to</span><i><span> Bloomberg</span></i><span> reporter Jason Schreier</span></a><span>, who said it’s not </span><i><span>Diablo 4</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Elder Scrolls 6</span></i><span>. “</span><span>I don’t currently plan on reporting what it is, sorry, but it’s a good one,” he wrote </span><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/geoff-keighley-posts-cryptic-image-with-the-caption-regal-inspiring-thickness-up-not-diablo-up2-new-message-from-tga-account.1368046/page-7#post-148323163"><span>on a gaming forum</span></a><span>. </span><span>” Regardless of the answer, The Game Awards wins—the statue has gotten enough buzz that people will, certainly, tune in to see what the statue is teasing.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s a little more easily digestible than, say, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-two-year-mystery-is-over-this-is-frog-fractions-2-1790505179"><span>the </span><i><span>Frog Fractions 2</span></i><span> ARG</span></a><span> that went unsolved for literally two years spanning nearly two dozen games on Steam and a book in a California library. Then there’s the </span><i><span>Halo 2</span></i><span> ARG called I Love Bees, which spanned three months, jars of honey, and several pay phones,&nbsp; or when Electronic Arts launched copies of </span><i><span>Mass Effect 3 </span></i><span>into space using weather balloons. (</span><a href="https://kotaku.com/early-mass-effect-3-winners-may-have-jumped-into-legal-5888619"><span>The people who found the copies</span></a><span>, inevitably plummeting back to earth, could play the game early.)</span></p> <p><span>Keighley’s Game Awards statue doesn’t seem to necessarily be an alternate reality game. It’s hard to say if it’s really leaving any clues for gamers to decode or just there to power the hype cycle. It feels more aligned with the chaotic churn of algorithmic virality that everyone’s seeking these days—a weird thing in a weird place, easily photographed or videotaped and circulated on TikTok, Reddit, and elsewhere. </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=game%20awards%20statue&amp;t=1764954890852"><span>It’s working</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>The new AAA realty</h2> <p><span>Companies have done these sorts of things for highly-anticipated, big budget games like </span><a href="https://imgur.com/a/2GpQl"><i><span>Overwatch</span></i></a> <span>(big action figures in big boxes), </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWarRagnarok/comments/10p0i4x/giant_leviathan_axe_appeared_in_london/"><i><span>God of War</span></i></a><span> (big axe in London), and </span><a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/life-size-horizon-forbidden-west-clawstrider-statues-could-win-you-a-ps5"><i><span>Horizon Forbidden West</span></i></a><span> (big mechanical monsters). The difference, of course, is that it’s obvious what these installations were promoting. The danger in the Game Awards statue is that people will end up let down by whatever game it’s tied to.</span></p>

 <p><span>Events like The Game Awards were born to market AAA games; Keighley fills the show with commercials for the latest and greatest big-budget blockbusters from the industry’s mega-companies, backed by a booming voice boasting a world premiere announcement or new gameplay trailer. The biggest of these, games like </span><i><span>The Witcher 4</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Marvel’s Wolverine</span></i><span>, barely need the extra eye-balls while everything else gets lost in the shuffle. Homegrown debut hits like </span><i><span>Balatro</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Expedition 33: Clair Obscure</span></i><span>, meanwhile, come out of nowhere and dominate the zeitgeist without the help of giant marketing machines. While some companies hope to manufacture a fraction of that cachet with big showcase moments, it’s no longer obvious that they’re for sale. To hear some tell it, the old AAA gaming model has reached “</span><a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/the-man-who-signed-arc-raiders-the"><span>the end of days</span></a><span>.” We’re a long way from cosplaying Area 51 for a midnight console launch.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But I suppose that’s not Keighley’s problem. People might not remember whatever the statue ends up being for but they’ll tune into The Game Award to find out. He gets to hype his show either way.</span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-graphics-comparison-switch-2-ugly-2000650585"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> technically isn’t the first Nintendo-published Switch 2 game to offer 120FPS support, but I don’t count that weird paid tech demo known as <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-worst-games-nintendo-metacritic-drag-x-drive-welcome-tour-2000617517"><em>Switch 2 Welcome Tour</em></a> that launched with the system. No, <em>Prime 4</em> is Nintendo’s first 120FPS Switch 2 experience, and it’s amazing. It is also a bit odd coming from Nintendo, but it makes me really hope this is an option in future games from the <em>Mario</em> company.</p> <p>Out now on Switch 2 and the OG Switch, <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> is the next entry in the popular sci-fi shooter series that is itself a spin-off of the 2D <em>Metroid</em> games.<a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-impressions-first-level-volt-forge-titanfall-2-factory-2000650657"> And while I found the opening hour to be a bit meh</a>, the game really picks up once you reach Volt Forge. But one thing that was great and remained excellent from the very start was <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>‘s performance mode on Switch 2, which offers up 120 buttery smooth frames per second if your TV can handle it. Gunplay, platforming, driving, and even puzzle solving are just so much nicer at the higher framerate.</p>

 <p>And this isn’t some hidden mode. No, the moment you first boot up <em>Prime 4</em>, it asks you to select between two modes: a 4K/60FPS option and a 1080p/120FPS option. I’ve played the game both ways, and while the 60FPS option is great and looks a tad sharper, I’ve primarily played Prime 4 in the 120FPS mode because it feels so nice and smooth. At first, I was worried that the Switch 2 would struggle to maintain that high framerate. But in my hours with the game so far, I’ve only seen one or two dips, and that was only in the open world desert portions of <em>Prime 4.</em></p>

  <p>It’s tricky to share 120FPS videos on the internet. Even using YouTube is challenging, as the ability to watch 120FPS content depends on the video, your device, etc. So unfortunately, I can’t show you how good <em>Prime 4</em> looks running at a high framerate. <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2025/12/metroid-prime-4-is-switch-2s-first-true-120hz-3d-showcase">But trust me, it’s great and totally worth the small trade-off</a> of the image looking a little softer compared to the 4K/60FPS mode. And yeah, it’s weird to even be talking about modes like this in a Nintendo first-party release. I’m not upset about it at all, though, as I’ve long wanted Nintendo’s visuals and tech to catch up with the rest of the industry, and this is a big step in that direction.</p> <p>Now all I can do is think about how great it would be for the next mainline 3D <em>Mario</em> to offer a 120FPS mode. <a href="https://kotaku.com/let-us-all-remember-the-great-f-zero-gx-5920082">Can you imagine a new <em>F-Zero</em> running at 120FPS</a>? Or what about a <em>Smash Bros</em> sequel offering a high framerate mode? I know not all Nintendo-published games moving forward will support 120FPS, but I hope we get a few more every year as the company’s games often look and feel better than usual when you have all those extra frames.</p>
