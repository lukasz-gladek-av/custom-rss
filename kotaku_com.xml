The company is hiring for a senior director of multiplatform and account management, which is a fancy way of saying someone who will help Sony profit from bringing its games to more storefronts. This person will be in charge of “global commercial strategy for PlayStation Studios software titles across all digital platforms beyond PlayStation hardware, including Steam, Epic Games Store, Xbox, Nintendo, and mobile.”</p><p>Fans are already treating this as a window into Sony’s thinking moving forward, including the possibility of it bringing more of its own first-party exclusives to other platforms, something that seemed unthinkable even just a few months ago. The job listing for the multiplatform leadership role goes on to say, “Oversee the out-of-year (mid-range) commercial strategy for PlayStation Studios titles across all non-PlayStation platforms, driving long-term revenue growth and audience reach.” It also lists direct reports that include people overseeing sales on both Xbox &amp; PC.</p><p>Sony’s multiplatform approach began small with bringing big single-player exclusives like <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> and<em> Days Gone </em>to PC years after they were out on console. <em>MLB: The Show</em> is also on Xbox Series X/S and Switch, though it’s published by MLB on those platforms. Upcoming Bungie shooter<em> Marathon</em> is also multiplatform. Then last fall, Sony announced the <em>Horizon </em>Lego spin-off, <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em>, for both PS5 and Switch. And just this month, Sony revealed it will <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573?_gl=1*q9wu73*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3MDQ1NzEkbzEyOSRnMSR0MTc1MzcwOTY4NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573?_gl=1*q9wu73*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3MDQ1NzEkbzEyOSRnMSR0MTc1MzcwOTY4NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">publish <em>Helldivers 2</em> on Xbox Series X/S</a></span>. The new job listing, however, suggests things won’t stop there, and that this may be a reaction to more than just Microsoft bailing on the hardware race. </p><p>The tech giant has been on an accelerated course due to the struggling sales of Xbox this generation. Its multiplatform strategy began with  reversing course on taking games exclusive and announcing ports of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-podcast-exclusivity-business-update-ps5-hi-fi-rush-1851261518?_gl=1*q9wu73*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3MDQ1NzEkbzEyOSRnMSR0MTc1MzcwOTY4NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-podcast-exclusivity-business-update-ps5-hi-fi-rush-1851261518?_gl=1*q9wu73*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3MDQ1NzEkbzEyOSRnMSR0MTc1MzcwOTY4NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA."><em>Grounded</em>, <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, and <em>Pentiment</em></a></span> as trial balloons to test the response from prospective players on PS5 and Nintendo Switch. A year later, <em>Forza Horizon 5 </em>has made the jump, and <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> will bring the Locust-chain-sawing  shooter franchise to Sony’s platform almost 20 years after it became synonymous with Xbox. What’s more, monthly sales charts show these ported exclusives, including <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, are selling great on its long-time rival’s platform. </p><p>One way to view rumblings that Sony will look to bring more of its games to other platforms is as a direct reaction to Microsoft essentially throwing in the towel on exclusivity. But ballooning blockbuster development budgets and stagnating console sales—PS5 isn’t surging past PS4, thanks to lost ground by Xbox—suggests Sony is looking for more ways to profit off its games regardless of what competitors do. <em>Helldivers 2</em> makes it easy to draw the current line at just multiplayer live service games, but if Sony really does see Xbox as becoming indistinguishable from a gaming PC in the future (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000">complete with access to Steam</a></span>), it’s not hard to see it replicating its single-player blockbuster strategy on Xbox as well.</p><figure id="" data-id="8f2e1b334f891fdb36d4956d7f66c905" data-recommend-id="image://8f2e1b334f891fdb36d4956d7f66c905" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Helldivers fight below Xbox logos.

But another might simply be that people don’t buy consoles that way anymore. “People who buy a hardware system these days, they’re doing it because of the ecosystem, because of their friends list,” Circna gaming research director Mat Piscatella <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/bringing-your-games-to-other-platforms&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/bringing-your-games-to-other-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>The Game Business</em></a></span> last week. “You’re not going to get people to transition consoles because of exclusives anymore. We’re way beyond that point.”</p><p>It was a version of what Phil Spencer admitted in 2023 at what now appears to have been an important inflection point for Xbox. “There is no world where <em>Starfield </em>is an 11/10 and people start selling their PS5s,” he told<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-phil-spencer-interview-starfield-ps5-console-war-1850404446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-phil-spencer-interview-starfield-ps5-console-war-1850404446"> the<em> Kinda Funny </em>podcast</a></span> at the time. “That’s not going to happen.” He went on to say that many players are locked into wherever their digital libraries are now, calling the Xbox One/PS4 battle the “worst generation” to lose from the perspective of fighting over market share. </p><p>I’ve been skeptical of this view and think it undercounts Microsoft’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732">persistent struggle to consistently ship high-quality exclusive games</a></span> that everyone wants to play. But it also seems undeniable that players, especially younger ones, are less attached to where they play games than ever as long as they can play what they want. Does this mean we’ll see <em>God of War Ragnarök</em> on Xbox Series X/S next year? Almost certainly not. But exclusivity increasingly feels less like a promise binding all Sony first-party games, and more like a ticking clock competing platforms bake into their long-tail sales strategy. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ps5-xbox-exclusivity-helldivers-spiderman-switch-2-1851787122]]></content:encoded>

Every Nintendo Direct or Xbox Games Showcase, rumors start to swirl that this time—<em>this time</em>—the game is going to appear, and we’ll see it moving, and there will be a release date. And none of that ever happens. One of my favorite ever headlines on <em>Kotaku</em> was this one from Willa  after it didn’t show in April 2024's Direct: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-world-showcase-no-show-1851416028&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-world-showcase-no-show-1851416028"><em>Silksong</em> Fans Won’t Survive Another Round of Disappointment.</a></span></p><p>Then today, looking through the impossible avalanche of industry emails that pour in, I noticed Microsoft had sent over its itinerary for this year’s Gamescom. Germany’s Gamescom is the biggest gaming show in the world, and every August features its own Geoff Keighley-hosted night of trailers during which <em>Silksong</em> also doesn’t appear. But what’s this? Hidden in the list of games Microsoft will have playable in its booths at this year’s event, tucked between <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> and <em>Borderlands 4...</em>it’s <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>.</p><p>In fact, the email even specifies, “This includes the first ever public opportunity to go hands on with the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X, including a new playable demo for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong.</em>”</p><p>Rumors spread earlier this year that there might be some sort of strange deal between the ROG Xbox Ally and <em>Silksong</em>, after the logo for the game appeared <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000">in the launch trailer for the handheld console</a></span>.</p><p>However, Team Cherry’s Matthew “Leth” Griffin then <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1l6k3vt/thank_you_leth/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1l6k3vt/thank_you_leth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jumped on the game’s Discord</a></span> to confirm a previous vague suggestion the game would come out before Christmas 2025, and to add “we are not tied to a console release.”</p><p>Still, this Gamescom tie-in suggests there’s <em>something</em> going on there. Could it turn out to be pre-loaded on the ROG Xbox Ally, as well as being sold separately elsewhere? It’d sure be a cool incentive.</p><p>But more importantly, it seems <em>Silksong</em> actually exists so much that there’s at the very least a playable demo of the game. You just need to head to Germany next month to see it to believe it.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-rog-ally-gamescom-demo-1851787121]]></content:encoded>

In contrast, 54 percent of <em>Fantastic Four</em>’s opening total is from the U.S. So, again, rounding errors, but the same pattern.</p><figure id="" data-id="69d291abf7f3fc913134b32f16353b4b" data-recommend-id="image://69d291abf7f3fc913134b32f16353b4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1380" data-height="776" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="HERBIE the robot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="HERBIE the robot." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="69d291abf7f3fc913134b32f16353b4b" data-recommend-id="image://69d291abf7f3fc913134b32f16353b4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1380" data-height="776" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="HERBIE the robot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The reason anyone cares about this is the implication that the perceived lack of overseas sales means these films might not be making as much money as they “should.” Looking through this years’s biggest movies, the normal proportion of total box office to come in domestically is between 32 and 50 percent. <em>F1: The Movie</em>, the extraordinary advertising feature starring Brad Pitt, made just 32 percent of its $510 million in the U.S. <em>Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning</em> is on $592 million, with 33 percent coming in from American audiences. Even <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> got more than 50 percent abroad, and the same for <em>Thunderbolts*</em>.</p><p><em>A Minecraft Movie</em> teeters shy of the big one billion at $995 million, 44.4 percent domestic, while the biggest American movie of the year so far, <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em>, got 42 percent of its $1 billion from home shores. (The biggest movie of 2025, the Chinese animated film <em>Ne Zha II </em>which has pulled in an eye-watering $1.9 billion, got just one percent of that in the U.S.!)</p><p>So, given all this, producers and distributors will be wondering why international audiences aren’t showing up to skew the stats in a similar way for these two superhero movies. While sitting on thrones made of diamond-encrusted gold bullion.</p><p>It’ll be interesting to see if <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> has the same legs as <em>Superman</em>, especially given it’s a somewhat more obscure property among the non-comics-reading public. Still, it’s already the 13th biggest film of the year after just a couple of days.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-first-steps-opening-weekend-superman-1851787100]]></content:encoded>
