As pointed out by the outlet, this latest hiring shows that Lucasfilm and Disney are committed to the project, which was announced back in 2023 alongside two other <em>Star Wars</em> movies. </p><p><em>New Jedi Orde</em>r is set to bring back Daisy Ridley as Rey, who was last seen in the role in 2019's<em> The Rise of Skywalker</em>. The movie is said to be set about 15 years after the events of <em>Rise</em> and will show Rey<em> </em>training a new generation of young Jedi. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-celebration-daisy-ridley-jedi-order-sequel-1850311858?_gl=1*12d8ct0*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzc1NzAyNy4zMjMuMS4xNzM3NzU4MTI0LjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-celebration-daisy-ridley-jedi-order-sequel-1850311858?_gl=1*12d8ct0*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzc1NzAyNy4zMjMuMS4xNzM3NzU4MTI0LjYwLjAuMA..">Before the film was even announced in 2023</a></span>, two writers—Damon Lindelof and Justin Britt-Gibson—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2023/film/news/star-wars-steven-knight-damon-lindelof-justin-britt-gibson-1235560466/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/star-wars-steven-knight-damon-lindelof-justin-britt-gibson-1235560466/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">had worked on a version of the script</a></span>. However, by the time Lucasfilm officially announced it at Star Wars Celebration 2023 a new writer, <em>Peaky Blinders</em> creator Steven Knight, was working on <em>New Jedi Order</em>’s story. He dropped out in October 2024 and now Nolfi is writing the movie. </p><p>Despite all the screenwriter changes, documentary filmmaker Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy is still attached to direct <em>New Jedi Order</em>. The movie was supposed to arrive in December 2026, but late last year <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/disney-star-wars-ice-age-6-release-2026-1236063414/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/disney-star-wars-ice-age-6-release-2026-1236063414/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Disney delayed it</a></span> and removed it from its upcoming schedule. </p><p>While <em>New Jedi Order </em>struggles to get off the ground, a different <em>Star Wars</em> film will land in theaters next year. <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em>, which wrapped filming in December 2024, is set to hit screens in May 2026. After that, the next <em>Star Wars</em> movie to start shooting will be Shawn Levy’s project—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2023/film/news/star-wars-steven-knight-damon-lindelof-justin-britt-gibson-1235560466/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2023/film/news/star-wars-steven-knight-damon-lindelof-justin-britt-gibson-1235560466/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which got a big shot in the arm earlier this week</a></span> with rumors that Ryan Gosling is joining the cast. </p><p>So it’s very likely that <em>New Jedi Order </em>won’t be available in our galaxy until 2027 at the earliest. And that’s assuming George Nolfi can write a screenplay that Lucasfilm likes. If not, we might see a fifth writer hired to try and get this movie’s script finished and approved. One wonders how much longer Obaid-Chinoy and Ridley will wait around. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A lot of<em> Dragon Ball Super </em>was centered on constantly shifting power dynamics among transformations that cheapened the suspense by simply introducing a random transformation (Super Saiyan Blue Evolved? WTF?). Goku’s an idiot, Gohan is annoyingly nerfed, and Vegeta just keeps losing at everything. This is why <em>Daima</em> is shutting all of that noise up.<br></p><p>In just 15 gorgeously animated episodes, the latest series has returned the <em>Dragon Ball</em> franchise to its roots. Goku’s Super Saiyan transformation used to be a goosebump-inducing rarity that conveyed the legendary status of its power. It’s not until the fifth episode of <em>Daima </em>that Goku briefly goes through the golden transformation to dispatch King Kadan’s soldiers, and he’s only returned to that form a handful of times over the 10 episodes that follow. Instead, the series has prioritized hand-to-hand combat (with a little Power Pole action thrown in) to ground the fantastical feats in some form of reality. The anime also blew everyone’s minds when Vegeta unveiled his Super Saiyan 3 transformation in episode 12 to win the Dragon Ball from Tamagami Number Two. Not only did that one moment completely rewrite a major flaw in the <em>Dragon Ball</em> series (Vegeta really let Kakarot and Gotenks go SSJ3 but not him?), but it let it be known that the <em>Dragon Ball</em> canon was open to revision in <em>Daima</em>.</p><p>The fight choreography is also some of the best the franchise has seen since the masterclass duel Broly had with Goku and Vegeta in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-super-broly-makes-broly-the-hero-and-goku-1831964773&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-super-broly-makes-broly-the-hero-and-goku-1831964773"><em>Dragon Ball Super: Broly</em></a></span> movie from 2018. Goku dodging Tamagami Number Three’s ki blasts only to land destabilizing kicks to its legs, and backflipping in midair to avoid Tamagami’s Thor-like hammer from hitting him before breaking the handle with his Power Pole in one move brought literal tears to my eyes. The fights in <em>Daima</em> feel like they have real stakes and aren’t just throwaways in order to fill time and keep people entertained with dazzling ki blasts. </p><p>The story also does a great job of expanding on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-best-episodes-anime-shounen-goku-vegeta-1850605656&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-best-episodes-anime-shounen-goku-vegeta-1850605656"><em>Dragon Ball Z</em></a></span> arcs we love without venturing into the polarizing <em>Dragon Ball Super</em> stories. Let the record show, <em>Dragon Ball Super</em> is wildly underrated, and the Tournament of Power is arguably the greatest story arc in the entire history of <em>Dragon Ball</em>. That being said, Super sometimes delved too deep into the gods controlling everything. The Fused Zamasu vs. Vegito Blue was too astounding for it to be resolved by the newly introduced Zeno, god of all, simply wiping the baddie from existence. <em>Dragon Ball Daima</em> starting right after the fan-favorite Buu saga and expanding upon that without negating what happened in it has been exceptionally done.</p><p>Sure, Goku’s still an idiot and not as stoic as he was when facing off against Cell or Frieza in <em>Dragon Ball Z.</em> Most of the episodes focus more on exploration than fighting. But with the introduction of compelling characters like Glorio, Dr. Arinsu, and Panzy, the trips around the newly explored Demon Worlds feel less like a chore and more like excavations into a <em>Dragon Ball</em> past that was right under our noses the entire time. We may only have one more month left of <em>Daima</em> before its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-daima-finale-hulu-remove/#:~:text=This%20was%20the%20first%20official,be%2020%20episodes%20in%20length.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cbr.com/dragon-ball-daima-finale-hulu-remove/#:~:text=This%20was%20the%20first%20official,be%2020%20episodes%20in%20length." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">season finale</a></span>, so I implore all of you, lovers and haters alike, to have an honest watch of this fantastic series, and then take an honest look in the mirror, because it’s time to admit <em>Daima</em> is exactly what the <em>Dragon Ball </em>franchise needed and deserved. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
