                  Save 15% on the Funko Pop The Nightmare Before Christmas countdown calendar over at Amazon.
                </p><div>
              
              <p>I’ll tell you what a real nightmare before Christmas is. It’s shopping for all those gifts. Finding the right gift can be a struggle, and with lots of folks to shop for ranging across your friends, family, and loved ones, that bill can add up pretty quickly. That’s why it’s great to keep an eye out for a good deal during the holiday season. And right now, Amazon happens to have this Funko Pop advent calendar on sale featuring vinyl mini figures of beloved characters from Tim Burtons’s <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5580/">The mystery box filled with toys is normally priced at $50, but right now you can grab it for 19% off for a limited time. That brings the price down by nearly $10 so you only end up paying $40.</a></p>

<h2>24 Days of Surprises</h2>
<p>Now, advent calendars make for a great Christmas gift* with a asterisk on it. The asterisk is to call out that by Christmas day, it’s already too late to give someone this gift. Unless there joy comes from just ripping open each door and having the instant gratification of all toys at once, which I guess more power to ya. But ideally, they should receive this before November 1 so they can enjoy beginning each day with a new treat in the form of Jack, Sally, or many of the other <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas </em>characters. Perhaps they can pair opening one of the doors with completing their daily Connections in The New York Times.</p>
<p>Okay so there’s another weird caveat I need to call attention to. At the time of writing this, all throughout the item page on Amazon, it calls out to, “Open the tiny doors to 13 unique collectable Funko Pocket Pops!” Now, there are 24 doors so I don’t know what’s going on. I’m not sure if that 13 is a typo (though it comes up twice on the page) or if more than half those little compartments are empty.</p>



<p>What I do know is the box in the images calls attention to it being a “24-piece holiday calendar.” Maybe they’re not all unique and there are some repeats in there or maybe someone on the Funko marketing team just copy/pasted this part of the description and forgot to edit it. There’s only one way to know for sure.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5580/">Buy yourself the Funko Pop <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas </em>countdown calendar for the reduced price of $40 and find out what’s inside for yourself.</a> Then come back to the comments here and let me know your findings.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>The Witcher 3</em> lets you make a lot of choices as Geralt, the open-world RPG’s titular monster slayer, but its biggest strength is in how subtly they’re woven into the broader fabric of the world. None of the choices ever feel like they’re being telegraphed with big blinking signs. The long-term consequences are yours to parse. So it is with the game’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-geralt-yennefer-triss-kiera-romance-love-1849487104">big love triangle</a>, a branching path that CD Projekt Red recently revealed was a late edition to the best-seller.</p> <p>The sorceress Yennefer is who Geralt begins the game with, during a flashback at Kaer Morhen. The red-headed mage Triss Merigold doesn’t show up until halfway through when he gets to Novigrad, at which point players have the option of rekindling their past relationship or moving on as friends, depending in part on their choices during the prior game. Eventually, the player has to make their mutant playboy choose between the two, with their future partner eventually joining them at a cute little cottage at the end of both expansions.</p>

 <p>“It wasn’t [there] from the beginning, but at some point we understood that this lack of kind of conflict, personal conflict—of course, there’s Ciri—but there was a lack of <em>something</em>.” CD Projekt Red co-CEO Adam Badowski <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-3-didnt-originally-make-you-choose-between-romancing-yennefer-or-triss-this-decision-was-made-pretty-late/">told <em>PC Gamer</em></a>. “This decision was made pretty late, but it was great. It was a great decision.”</p>

 <p>While Yennefer is Geralt’s canonical love interest, she’s not actually in <a href="https://kotaku.com/first-witcher-game-remake-unreal-engine-5-1849816995">the first two games</a>. Triss, however, is, leading to a weird scenario&nbsp; in which many players actually have a stronger connection to her than to the witcher’s ongoing on-again, off-again partner. It would have been easy to steer him back to her for the duration of the third game, but playing up Geralt’s divided heart does a lot to give the otherwise gruff and sardonic mercenary a more emotionally engaging mini-arc within the final game.</p> <p>While Geralt will still make an appearance in <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-2027-release-window-investor-call-ps6-cdpr-1851772310"><em>The Witcher 4</em></a>, CDPR’s next sequel will pass the baton to Ciri as the main hero instead. Fortunately, fans of the grey wolf will get another chance to revisit the beginning of his journey in a <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-remake-open-world-rpg-cd-projekt-red-cyberpunk-1849832000">remake of <em>The Witcher 1</em></a> that is also in the works. Neither project has a release window just yet.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-launches-major-black-friday-deal-on-ipads-selling-2025-wifi-model-at-new-all-time-low-2000644324</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-launches-major-black-friday-deal-on-ipads-selling-2025-wifi-model-at-new-all-time-low.1353802/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been waiting for the right time to pick up an iPad, that time is now. Apple just kicked off most of its Black Friday deals on Amazon and spans everything from iPads and MacBooks to Apple Watches and AirTags. But perhaps the star of the show <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">is the 11-inch iPad with the A16 chip (WiFi + 128GB) which is now down to $299 from its original $349 sticker price</a>. This <strong>model launched in early 2025</strong> and quickly became the best-selling tablet on the market so to see it drop to an all-time low this quickly almost feels too good to be true.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Apple redesigned this iPad to handle the kind of multitasking most of us throw at our devices daily. The A16 chip powers through photo editing, gaming and streaming without hesitation. You get 128GB of storage right out of the gate and gives you plenty of room for apps, photos, videos, and documents before you even think about cloud storage.</p>



<h2>Best Value for Money Tablet</h2>
<p>It’s an <strong>11-inch Liquid Retina display</strong> that brings colors to life in such a way that streaming movies or editing photos becomes genuinely enjoyable. True Tone technology changes the color temperature of the screen with respect to your surroundings, so you are not squinting at a harsh blue glow by night or straining to see details by bright sunlight. This may sound minor until you realize how much easier it makes long reading sessions or late-night work sessions go on your eyes. The screen hits that sweet spot where it’s large enough for serious work but compact enough to toss in a bag without thinking twice.</p>
<p><strong>Wi-Fi 6 connectivity</strong> keeps you moving at full speed when you’re downloading files, uploading content, or jumping between video calls. The USB-C connector finally standardized charging and data transfer, meaning you can use the same cable for your iPad that you use for most of your other devices. There are 12MP cameras on both the front and back of the device, giving you solid options for video calls, document scanning, or just quick photos when you don’t have your phone handy. An important addition is Center Stage, a technology in the front camera that automatically pans and zooms to keep you in frame during video calls.</p>



<p>Touch ID built into the top button gives you quick access without typing passwords constantly. You unlock the iPad, sign into apps, and authorize Apple Pay transactions with just your fingerprint. The <strong>iPadOS uses hardware to full capacity</strong>, and allows you to run multiple apps side by side, use the Scribble to handwrite in any text field with an Apple Pencil, and organize your workflow in ways that actually make sense.</p>
<p>For $299, this iPad offers good value to anyone who needs a capable tablet that can handle real work without compromise.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Joins Black Friday With the 2-in-1 Surface Pro (2024) Hundreds Off, Its Lowest Price Ever]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/act-fast-to-save-a-massive-26-on-this-2024-microsoft-surface-pro-on-amazon-today-2000644008</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-joins-black-friday-with-the-2-in-1-surface-pro-2024-hundreds-off-its-lowest-price-ever.1353763/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday is just around the corner, and early deals are already coming in hot. This is a great time to grab both the essentials and big-ticket items you have been keeping an eye on, without paying the full price. Those looking for a powerful tablet that can turn into a full-fledged Windows laptop when needed should consider the Microsoft Surface Pro, especially now that it’s going for a lot less on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5579/">The 2024 model of this machine typically retails for $2,100, but you can now snag it for $1,550 after a nice 26% discount.</a> This discount applies to the Platinum model and is available to both Prime and non-Prime members. It’s also one of the steepest price drops we have seen on this model, but we’re not expecting it to last long. It’s best to grab yours before the price shoots back up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5579/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Screen, Plus All-Day Battery Life</h2>
<p>It’s slightly bigger than most tablets out there. You’re getting a 13-inch OLED touchscreen display that delivers brilliant visuals with exceptional color accuracy in both bright and dim settings. Your favorite shows will come to life, and even gaming will feel immersive. Touchscreen makes it easy to navigate; you can swipe, scroll, pinch, sketch, and even type with ease.</p>
<p>The tablet also comes with a built-in stand at the back, which makes it easy to prop the screen up however you like. Working on the go? Stand it upright. Going through a long, boring document? Use it as a notebook. Feeling a bit creative? Lay it flat on the table to paint or sketch. You can also add the Surface Pro Flex keyboard (which is sold separately) to your setup and turn it into a laptop when needed.</p>



<p>Performance-wise, you’ve got a Snapdragon X Elite processor with 12 cores. It’s powerful enough to handle all your heavy-duty tasks like content creation, video production, multitasking, and more. The 32GB RAM makes sure you don’t experience any frustrating slowdowns as you work, while the massive 1TB SSD offers plenty of space to store all your photos, videos, and files with ease.</p>
<p>Copilot+ integration makes your everyday tasks a breeze. You can use it to ask questions, get help with studies, generate art using a simple prompt, and even enjoy better video calls with improved lighting and real-time subtitles. This 2-in-1 tablet also won’t give up on you in the middle of a busy day, as the battery life is designed to last up to 14 hours on a single charge.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is so focused on its single-player story that you might have forgotten the RPG has a competitive mode like most other </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games. This four-player versus mode pits you and the other trainers against one another in a race to see who can defeat the most monsters in a short amount of time. Even if you’re not a competitive person, you might still be playing this mode to try and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-raichu-ranked-2000625708"><span>unlock some of the Mega Stones gated behind it</span></a><span>. So you want it to be fair, right? Well, it sounds like the mode is being overrun by hackers who are cheating their way to victory.</span></p>   <p><span>I don’t play much of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s multiplayer myself, so the first time I was clued into the hacking epidemic was through a video on TikTok that showed a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolutions-best-worst-designs-legends-z-a-2000625459"><span>Mega Garchomp</span></a><span> repeatedly using its powerful ground-type attack Earthquake without any cooldowns. Because there was no gap in between these devastating area-of-effect moves, its trainer racked up points on the scoreboard so quickly that there was no way anyone else could catch up.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>What I didn’t realize at the time was that this has become so widespread that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>creators are weighing in and providing their own footage of rigged online matches. Some of the possible hacks might not be that recognizable to the untrained eye. AustinJohnPlays has an </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAqhVep_5dc"><span>extensive video</span></a><span> on several hacked Pokémon he and others have encountered online, though not all of the exploits are as damning as a Garchomp with no cooldowns.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>For example, he shows a Lucario who seems to have been captured with a Poké Ball that isn’t available in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. This doesn’t give anyone a competitive advantage but it’s an example of how some people are clearly modding the game in various ways. Some are advantageous in competitive play, like someone having an </span><a href="https://x.com/amiosi/status/1986910946556535092?s=20"><span>Alpha Xerneas</span></a><span>, a larger, more powerful form of a Legendary Pokémon that is only obtainable once in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>and not as an Alpha. Clearly, some players are up to hacked shenanigans and taking these unobtainable Pokémon online.</span></p>

 <p><iframe title="Hackers are Ruining Pokemon Legends Z-A!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bAqhVep_5dc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p> <p><span>Some of the hacks AustinJohnPlays highlights might seem harmless, such as some players changing their in-game trainer ID card images to real photos, but when you see there’s an astronomical gap between their online scores and those of regular players, it’s probably safe to assume they’re also messing with the stats, movesets, and properties of their Pokémon.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>At the moment, </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>doesn’t have any kind of reporting or blocking feature, so these hackers are running around in competitive battles, spamming moves and using Pokémon they shouldn’t be able to access. We’ve reached out to The Pokémon Company for comment on the situation and will update this story if we hear back.</span></p>

              <p>Grabbing a powerful, sturdy laptop from a known brand doesn’t have to put a dent in your wallet. We’re spotting plenty of early Black Friday deals dropping in left, right, and center across different retailers. Amazon, specifically, is offering a wide range of high-end laptops for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5578/">For instance, the 15-inch Dell Inspiron 3535 touchscreen laptop is currently sitting at just $800 at the retailer, which is a massive 64% off its retail price of $2,200.</a> It’s packed with tons of useful features that are sure to support you during busy workdays and even make those late-night entertainment sessions a lot more fun. Alongside the direct discount, you’re also getting several handy accessories thrown in for free, including pre-installed Windows 11 Pro. The offer, however, is only around for a limited time, so it’s best to get your orders in sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5578/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Processor to Work, Stream, and Game Easily</h2>
<p>The laptop runs on an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U processor, delivering impressive performance that even outpaces Intel’s i7-1355U in most competing models. Paired with AMD Radeon Graphics, the machine is more than capable of handling everyday work, browsing, streaming, and even light gaming without slowing down.</p>
<p>There’s 32 GB of RAM to keep things running smoothly. It makes using demanding applications, as well as multitasking, a breeze. You will be able to work with different programs at the same time, take video calls, create presentations, push some creative boundaries, hop through tabs, and more; without a hint of lag. Best of all, storing everything locally won’t be an issue either. Dell Inspiron 3535 packs a massive 1TB SSD that offers enough space to house a ton of high-resolution photos, videos, programs, and even games without feeling limited. Plus, SSDs ensure fast boot/load times, so you won’t have to wait long to get started.</p>



<p>Display-wise, you’re covered with a modest 15.6-inch Full HD (1920×1080) touchscreen. Its narrow border maximizes the overall space, while the built-in Dell ComfortView technology keeps the screen easy on your eyes. Touch support means you don’t have to limit yourself to the trackpad or the mouse to navigate. When you’re not in the mood to press buttons, simply use your fingers directly on the screen to scroll long documents, swipe through photos, sketch, and even take notes!</p>
<p>Some other features that deserve a mention include the 720p HD webcam, ergonomic lift-hinge keyboard, Wi-Fi 5, and Bluetooth 5.0. All things considered, this laptop is great for work, studies, and even casual use.</p>
