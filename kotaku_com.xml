            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Valve hasn’t officially announced the price of its upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/16-cool-details-valve-new-steam-machine-console-controller-vr-headset-2000643572">Steam Machine consoles</a>. Maybe even CEO Gabe Newell doesn’t know how much the company will eventually decide to charge. But that hasn’t stopped a drip-feed of quote and speculation from pointing toward the higher end of the pricing spectrum. The company recently confirmed it won’t be subsidizing the devices, seemingly squashing any chance of it being less than the <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-valve-console-price-ps5-pro-2000643554">price of a PlayStation 5 Pro</a>.</p> <p>That was the sense we got from comments Valve made back when the Steam Machines <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-machine-frame-deck-console-controller-announced-2000643535">were first revealed</a>. Despite an emphasis on “affordability,” the company was also quick to confirm that the consoles would be “very competitive with a PC you could build yourself from parts” but also closer to the “entry level of the PC space” than what some fans might be expecting.</p>

 <p>Last week on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/dnKy4UEdiyo?si=vFixe-qpVjph_B0v">LinusTechTips YouTube channel</a>, Linus Gabriel Sebastian confirmed that he asked Valve directly if the smaller storage Steam Machine would be in line with a current $500 console. “Nobody said anything, but the energy of the room wasn’t great,” he said.</p>

 <p>The scales have now tipped even further away from that price point in an interview Valve did <a href="https://youtu.be/yvu66Y2VLq8?si=SskFh89ieBarjGmu">with gaming channel Skill Up</a>. YouTuber Ralph Panebianco asked point-blank if the company would use proceeds from Steam to make the hardware cheaper than it costs to manufacture. “No,” software engineer Pierre-Loup Griffais said. “It’s more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market. Obviously, our goal is for it to be a good deal at that level of performance.”</p>

 <p>It’s not been uncommon in the past for console makers to underprice hardware in order to grow their install base and make more money off of selling more games and servers on the backend. As the biggest PC gaming store around, Valve has billions of profits it could through at gaining market share in a potential console war. It sounds like that’s not what the company has planned, however.</p>

 <p>No subsidies is basically the final nail in the coffin for any hope that the Steam Machine will be priced to compete directly with a Switch 2, PS5, or pre-tariff Xbox Series X. Some fans are still hoping the 512GB model might come in between $600 and $700, which would put it around the current price of the 1TB Steam Deck OLED.</p> <p>Even that seems overly optimistic, especially with <a href="https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803">recent reports</a> that the AI arms race is about to push PC component prices <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-prices-dram-amd-ai-shortage-2000646851">even higher</a>. Next-gen consoles, which all rely on the same chip makers, will be facing similar pressures. We’ll see how it all shakes out when Valve reveals the Steam Machine price early next year. Who knows. Maybe the PS6 and next Xbox won’t be anywhere close to $500, either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
               <p><span>This past summer, kids turned to </span><i><span>Roblox</span></i><span> to protest the aggressive, violent escalation of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids. Now, activists are using both </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto V </span></i><span>roleplay to educate gamers on how to handle an IRL ICE raid.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As reported by both </span><a href="https://www.404media.co/ice-defense-training-on-fortnite-new-save-collective/"><i><span>404 Media</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.wired.com/story/activists-are-using-fortnite-to-fight-back-against-ice/"><i><span>WIRED</span></i></a><span>, a global gamer group called New Save Collective has been organizing special events in video games that mimic real-world ICE raids to help raise awareness and educate players about their rights. On November 20, the collective organized a </span><i><span>GTA V</span></i><span> event, which took place in the </span><i><span>GTA Online</span></i><span> RP servers and featured masked ICE agents stopping players and demanding they show identification.</span></p>

 <p><span>On November 21, New Save Collective held a related event in the currently</span><i><span> Simpsons</span></i><span>-themed </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>, specifically in the “Delulu” mode, the only one that features proximity chat. It allowed players to meet each other in-game before practicing what to do if ICE approaches them in a real-life scenario. The role-playing event featured agents played by the Collective (which has recently partnered with other immigration advocacy groups like Immigrants Belong and Define American) attempting to detain and/or question “vulnerable” civilians, their chosen term for people most often targeted by ICE raids.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In clips shared with </span><i><span>404 Media</span></i><span>, the agents reportedly urged other players, who were not the target of their search, to leave. “This does not concern you,” one said. A person responded with, “We’re allowed to record,” while the group of “civilians” closed in on the two agents, who were standing on top of a golf cart. The agents decide to “abandon the vehicle” and leave, during which a player yells, “Yeah, I threw a pizza at you!”</span></p>

 <p><span>Obviously, this is nothing like how an ICE raid goes in the real world, but that’s the point—to allow gamers a chance to role-play what could be a very scary situation with relatively low stakes. An organizer told </span><i><span>404 Media</span></i><span> that the goal of the space was less training for a potential ICE raid and more “to organize a community and build trust.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Both ICE and the White House have repeatedly co-opted gaming to both promote their anti-immigrant propaganda and serve as potential recruitment spaces. The most recent example happened last month when </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/oct/29/why-trumps-white-house-is-using-video-game-memes-to-recruit-for-ice"><span>official government Twitter accounts shared AI-generated images</span></a><span> of Trump as </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span>’s Master Chief and calls to “stop the Flood.” It’s heartening to see New Save Collective try and steal back some digital space from the alt-right. The “culture change organization” dedicated to humanizing immigrants,&nbsp; Define American, told </span><i><span>Wired </span></i><span>that, “Gaming wasn’t kind of a random genre that we chose. We’ve been tracking anti-immigrant myths and disinformation digitally for years.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>New Save Collective will hold more events throughout the rest of 2025, and told </span><i><span>404 Media</span></i><span> the response thus far has been “overwhelmingly positive,” except for the people claiming to be ICE agents who have tried to join the Discord server.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I haven’t seen the full </span><i><span>Wicked </span></i><span>stage play, but I was already well aware of the twists and turns we’d see in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wicked-2-for-good-trailer-elphaba-glinda-boq-tin-man-2000628205"><i><span>Wicked: For Good</span></i><span>.</span></a><span> The musical sequel covers the events of the play’s second act, and it includes several direct ties to the original </span><i><span>Wizard of Oz</span></i><span> story. As such, I was braced for it to reveal the brainless Scarecrow, but I was not prepared for how the guy would actually look when on screen, and neither were most people, it seems, as the reveal has caught fans off guard.</span></p>  <p><span>In the </span><i><span>Wicked </span></i><span>continuity, Fiyero (Jonathan Bailey, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jonathan-bailey-sexiest-man-alive-people-final-fantasy-2000641145"><i><span>People</span></i><span>’s Sexiest Man Alive</span></a><span>), the carefree prince who starts growing a conscious after he meets Elphaba (Cynthia Erivo), becomes the Scarecrow. He starts off as a dashing, charismatic narcissist, but as Fiyero grows to care for Elphaba and her battle for animal rights, he turns against the Wizard’s fascist regime and becomes a fugitive with the Wicked Witch.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Later in the film, he is captured by the Wizard’s guards and tortured. Elphaba, desperate to save her lover, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTv_FrdBQ6A&amp;pp=ygUTd2lja2VkIG5vIGdvb2QgZGVlZA%3D%3D"><span>casts a spell to keep him from dying or feeling any pain</span></a><span>. We don’t see Fiyero’s face for almost the entirety of the second half of the movie because </span><i><span>For Good </span></i><span>goes out of its way to obscure it and hide his identity, but we unknowingly see the back of his head a few times. That’s because Elphaba’s spell turned him into the Scarecrow who accompanies Dorothy in </span><i><span>The Wizard of Oz</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>We don’t actually see Fiyero as the Scarecrow until the final moments of </span><i><span>For Good</span></i><span>, and while an eagle-eyed </span><i><span>Wizard of Oz </span></i><span>fan may have caught onto this twist when he was strung up on a cross in a cornfield during Elphaba’s spell, plenty of first-time viewers were genuinely shocked by this reveal, not only because of Fiyero’s dark fate, but because Bailey straight up looks like a patched together version of Ryan Reynolds in his Scarecrow look.</span></p>       <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">My entire theater burst out laughing when they saw the Scarecrow's design</p> <p>— 5 DAYS UNTIL DON CHEADLE'S BIRTHDAY (@Schaffrillas) <a href="https://twitter.com/Schaffrillas/status/1991721384129777945?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">out mogged the wicked for good scarecrow <a href="https://t.co/CHKems9MTo">pic.twitter.com/CHKems9MTo</a></p> <p>— 👹 (@tummyhxrts) <a href="https://twitter.com/tummyhxrts/status/1992245081273991321?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>    <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">also happy to report fiyero looks chopped asf as the scarecrow like even tin man boq is out mugging him <a href="https://t.co/lrDdCGEHAQ">pic.twitter.com/lrDdCGEHAQ</a></p> <p>— gelphie conquers all (@aIicentinchains) <a href="https://twitter.com/aIicentinchains/status/1990796884131426684?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>While some might be unsettled by Fiyero’s new face, others aren’t going to let some straw and burlap keep them from </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YHed_tTvyhI"><span>recreating that one scene from </span><i><span>Pearl</span></i></a><span>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-extract-rat-elevator-revive-defib-2000646958</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Extraction shooters are eager to take everything away from you. And though <i>Arc Raiders</i> has proven to be a more friendly approach with its multiple paths of progression, dying at the end of a successful run still sucks. Getting pushed 99 percent of the way to failure and then surviving, however, is a feeling like no other.</p> <p>As more folks pour into <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ servers to hopefully extract and craft their way to glory, they’re capturing epic victories snatched from the jaws of defeat and sharing them as reminders that even when you think you’re about to lose everything, luck (or a guardian angel) can always intervene.</p>

 <p>Last night, I came across one such clip from a few days ago of what would seem to be an unfortunate PvP instance during a Night Raid (usually a preem opportunity to score some great loot if you know where to look) suddenly turned on its head:</p>

   <p>Gunned down by a rando, Reddit user Over_here_vibin prepares to get sent back home with nothing to show for it. Then his assailant gets sniped in the head literally out of nowhere. Turns out, some folks must’ve been watching nearby and were quick to put down the threat while also escorting Over_here_vibin to extraction.</p>

 <p>Fun fact learned from this video? If you don’t have a defib to revive a stranger, you can use bandages to temporarily stabilize them, which is often enough to see someone successfully get out.</p> <p>Humans aren’t your only potential allies, though. As <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-karma-doesnt-get-any-sweeter-than-this-extract-camper-gets-a-spoonful-of-justice-from-bots-accidentally-saves-his-would-be-victim-and-misses-his-own-extraction/">spotted by <i>Games Radar</i></a>, another fantastic clip sees someone gunned down literally as they’re standing in the elevator. If you’ve played any amount of <i>Arc Raiders</i>, then you know getting shot in the elevator is literally one of the worst feelings (especially as it often happens right as the doors are closing, meaning your assailant doesn’t even have time to loot your body and just offed you seemingly just for the fun of it).</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is Beautiful ❤️ <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ArcRaiders?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ArcRaiders</a> <br>🎥RedRiser <a href="https://t.co/RkAYVow0rL">pic.twitter.com/RkAYVow0rL</a></p> <p>— ARC Now (@ArcRaidersNow) <a href="https://twitter.com/ArcRaidersNow/status/1991792146995986490?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>As luck would have it, a Rocketeer (one of the most menacing of airborne threats in the game thus far) not only interrupts the execution animation, but knocks the assailant out of the elevator with a rocket, downing them in the process. While it is possible the assailant might’ve been able to crawl over and call in a new elevator, it’s likely their decision to shoot someone in the back led to their loss.</p> <p>My feeds are full of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/RescueRaiders/comments/1ovl0bh/got_rescued_today_was_this_one_of_you/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">situations like this</a>. It just goes to show that, until the game literally sends you back to Speranza, don’t give up. A friendly human, or Arc, might just save the day.</p>   <p>Oh, and if you run solos, please carry defibs for your fellow Raiders!</p>
