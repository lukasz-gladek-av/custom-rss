              <p><em>Sky the Scrapper</em> is a game about the untethered funk of early adulthood, punctuated by pulsing 2D high-score races to clean the sides of buildings. Succeed and you’ll collect just enough cash to keep your miserly solo life in a messy one-room apartment afloat. Fail and you’ll be forced to move back in with your parents. It’s an earnest mashup of twitchy arcade action and chill life sim that’s stayed with me long after I’ve stopped playing.</p> <p>Released on Steam by developer Ryo Kobuchi over the summer, <em>Sky the Scrapper</em> is divided into two parts. The first is a visual novel in which you navigate a weekly schedule from a menu screen that looks like its nestled inside an early 2000s ad for the PS2. You get text messages from your parents guilt-tripping you and updates from your boss at the window-washing company about whether you’re meeting expectations at work. If it’s your day off you can do stuff like take a nap, visit the museum, or go out to the club, each of which costs a certain amount of money and impacts your mood for the better or worse, which in turn affects your stamina recovery rate on the job. This is the <em>Persona</em>-like part of the game.</p>

 <p>When it’s not your day off, you spend your time mopping bird poop, graffiti, and other muck off the walks of urban highrises. You hang from a rope that acts like a 2D pendulum, letting you swing from one side of the building to the other. Hold down one button and you’ll be able to spend stamina to climb up the wall. Hold it down too long and you’ll lose your grip and plummet to the ground, leaving you with only partial pay and injuring yourself ahead of the next day’s work.</p>

  <p>A timer drives the action, and you only have a minute to clean up as much of each building as possible. Fail to wring out your tools at various times throughout the job and you’ll clean less effectively. There’s even an ultimate meter you can build to unleash a super-cleaning attack that lets you effortlessly wall-run without spending stamina. It’s an unusual amalgamation of arcade-y mechanics unlike anything else I’ve come across. After successfully completing certain jobs you earn points to unlock ability nodes along a sprawling network of skills, perks, and other buffs. You can also buy equipment to help you see at night or increase your stamina.</p>

 <p>There’s a lot of RNG in S<em>ky the Scrapper</em> and the difficulty ramps up surprisingly fast. Your changing work schedule dictates some of the hazards you’ll face, from barely lit night shifts to bad weather and birds darting at you. You might feel like you’re doing an okay job, only to realize you’re not scaling up your character fast enough to contend with the growing challenge, or you may find your ambitions clipped short by simple bad luck. There’s a poignancy to these moments as the mundanity of the rest of your daily city life builds up around them, but it can also feel a bit overly punishing.</p> <p>None of these systems or mechanics is as individually satisfying or polished as I’d like, but combine it altogether and <em>Sky the Scrapper</em><em>&nbsp;</em>offers a surprisingly unique and effective package. It feels like it establishes the template for a really neat, more fleshed-out sequel. Even so, I’m glad I stumbled upon <em>Sky the Scrapper</em> and still occasionally feel the call to go back and try to complete each of the different story scenarios and endings.</p>

              <p>Cady “Fandy” Hoffmann can usually be found on Twitch streaming <em>World of Warcraft</em> or <em>Overwatch 2</em>. This week, fans found her livestreaming the birth of her first kid. They’re calling Fandy the first streamer to give birth on Twitch. Many are not sure how to feel about the newest breakthrough in streaming culture.</p> <p>“Hi twitter my water just broke so I think I’m going this live Baby time&nbsp;:)” Fandy <a href="https://x.com/fandybtw/status/1975712190050279688">wrote on X</a> at 7:57 p.m. ET on October 7. The birth took place at home surrounded by friends and family with the camera on the far side of the room and privacy when mom needed it. A nurse appeared to be present as well. The Twitch chat was displayed on the living room TV with Fandy occasionally interacting in-between contractions.</p>

 <p>“I’ve waited forever for her,” she said at one point. “Get the hell out already.”</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" src="about:blank" width="800" height="450" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://player.twitch.tv/?video=2585966702&amp;parent=kotaku.com"><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start"></span><span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start"></span></iframe></p> <p>Giving birth in real life doesn’t happen as fast as in the movies. Fandy walks around, bounces on a yoga ball, and rests at various points during the livestream marathon before eventually getting into an inflatable water birth pool. Twitch CEO Dan Clancy even appeared in the chat at one point to wish her well. “Fandy, best of luck and congratulations. Wishing you the best in this journey,” Clancy wrote. Others in the chat said to <a href="https://x.com/Alykkat/status/1975775572845613449">fill the pool with Tylenol</a> for “optimum chances of raising a human genius.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">literally staying up late to watch someone livestream their birth spamming "lock in" and "push"</p> <p>you know what hell yeah</p> <p>— Liquid Eiya (@EiyaWoW) <a href="https://twitter.com/EiyaWoW/status/1975819858874110405?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The stream peaked at over 30,000 viewers, <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/twitch/twitch-streamer-fandy-gives-birth-live-on-stream-as-tens-of-thousands-tune-in-3263532/">according to<em> Dexerto</em></a>, with thousands hanging around to witness the moment the baby came out over seven hours later. Fady named her Luna and both mom and kid appear to be perfectly healthy following the landmark milestone for the Amazon-owned video platform. The two are resting peacefully at the end of the stream. Even <em>TMZ</em> felt the need to <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/10/08/streamer-fandy-gives-birth-live-on-twitch/">blur the newborn’s face out</a>.</p>

 <p>The stream was a wholesome look inside one of the most important and intimate moments in a person’s life. Maybe some fans preparing to have a child of their own will find it reassuring to see how smoothly it went. So why does it feel like there are just some things that don’t need to be recorded, let alone shared with the whole world in real-time? How will the child feel about it later on in her life? Why am I, a complete stranger, even in a position to have questions like this?</p> <p>“That’s a plus one baby, boys!” said husband Adamax after seeing his newborn for the first time. May they all live happily ever after.</p>
