              <p>The biggest shopping event of the year is almost here, and you know what that means; saving big on items that rarely go on sale. It’s especially a great time to treat yourself to some Apple products, since we’re spotting iPads, audio gear, and even MacBooks dropping to their lowest ever prices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">One of the best discounts live right now is the Apple AirPods 4 with ANC marked down to just $99.99.</a> These typically retail for $179, so you’re saving a whopping nearly $80 on the pair. These have dipped to around $130 during past sales, but $99.99 is the lowest we’ve seen them go in a long time. Even crazier? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/">The non-ANC AirPods 4 are nearly 50% off at just 69, which is an insane deal for the latest model.&nbsp;</a>The deal is open to all shoppers, whether you have a Prime subscription or not.</p>
<p>It’s best to get your orders in fast, as we’re not expecting the deal to stick around for long.</p>

<h2>Adaptive Noise Cancelation for an Immersive Experience</h2>
<p>Apple unveiled its AirPods 4 last year, after redesigning the pair for exceptional all-day comfort and greater stability. The redefined contour makes for a better fit, while the shorter stem keeps the frame minimal. The build is responsive, meaning you can just press the earbuds to control music and manage calls.</p>
<p>The pair is packed with Apple’s powerful H2 chip to unlock an immersive, rich audio experience with two modes; Active Noise Cancelation and Transparency. ANC blocks background noise and chatter, letting you vibe to your favorite songs or listen to podcasts without distractions. It’s great for noisy, chaotic public places where you just can’t seem to focus on what’s playing. Putting the buds on will disconnect you from the outside world, making it feel like you’re in a quiet room even when you’re packed into a subway.</p>
<p>Transparency mode does the opposite. It lets some ambient sound in, so that you can stay aware of what’s happening around while still enjoying high-quality audio. It’s better for public settings where you don’t want to miss when someone tries to interact. Even better, there’s Conversation Awareness that automatically lowers the volume of what’s playing when someone talks to you. You won’t have to awkwardly take the earbuds out just to hear the other person properly.</p>
<p>Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking is supported, too. It places audio all around you for a 3D experience, letting you enjoy your favorite movies and TV shows better.</p>



<p>Voice/video calls get a boost with Voice Isolation, a feature that reduces background noise while clarifying yours. Catch up with friends on the go, or hop on meetings in a cafe without having to repeat yourself or constantly apologizing for the background noise. It plays nicely with Siri, so you can use the voice assistant for hands-free convenience throughout the day. Just say “Hey Siri”, and ask it to play music, make calls, or check your schedule. It’s helpful when you’re behind the wheel and don’t want to take your attention off the road, or even when both your hands are busy typing and picking up the phone would break your flow.</p>
<p>On a single charge, AirPods 4 give you around 5 hours of listening in the standard mode, while up to 4 hours with ANC on. Drop them back into the charging case, and your total extends to 30 hours. The pair is also IP54-rated dust, sweat, and water resistant. Intense workouts in the gym or a few splashes here and there won’t affect the functionality.</p>
<p>All things considered, AirPods 4 are some of the best wireless earbuds out there. You’re getting impressive sound, two listening modes, and a reliable battery life, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">all for just $99.99 (ANC)</a> and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/">$69 (without ANC) right now.</a></p>

              <p>Apple maintains its tradition of avoiding Black Friday deals on their own retail website while quietly liquidating inventory through Amazon with more generous discounts than previous years.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/"> At $449, down from $599, this 11-inc 128GB/WiFi iPad Air (M3 chip) joins Apple discounting</a> spanning MacBooks, AirPods, Apple Watches, and iPads. The only product category notably absent from Amazon’s Black Friday Apple selection remains the iPhone 17 series, which still hasn’t launched on Amazon’s platform despite being available through carriers and Apple directly. This 25% discount on the<strong> iPad Air represents a record-low price</strong> for Apple’s mainstream tablet that balances capability with accessibility.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3760/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Between the Basic iPad and the Pro Models</h2>
<p>The basic iPad costs about $329 and comes with an A14 chip from the previous generation and a standard Retina display, and it’s for people who want a cheap device for browsing and basic productivity. The <strong>M3 chip in the iPad Air gives it a lot more processing power</strong> because it has desktop-class architecture that can handle demanding games and creative applications that would be too much for the basic model. The <strong>Liquid Retina display with P3 wide color and True Tone is better</strong> than the basic iPad’s display because it has more colors, better viewing angles, and adaptive white balance.</p>



<p>The iPad Pro positioned above the Air commands $800+ through M4 chip, mini-LED ProMotion displays reaching 120Hz and Face ID replacing Touch ID. Professional photographers, video editors, and digital artists justify Pro pricing through workflow advantages including ProRes video recording, LiDAR scanning, and reference-quality displays. <strong>But most users find the Air’s M3 chip provides more than adequate performance</strong> for typical tablet workflows and the $350+ savings compared to iPad Pro base models enables purchasing Magic Keyboard or Apple Pencil accessories for instance.</p>
<p>The M3 chip made for Apple Intelligence has an <strong>8-core CPU and a 10-core GPU architecture</strong> that makes it almost as powerful as a desktop computer. When you edit videos in iMovie or LumaFusion, the effects happen in real time and the timeline scrubbing is smooth.</p>



<p>The <strong>11-inch Liquid Retina display has a resolution of 2360 x 1640 at 264 PPI</strong> which makes individual pixels impossible to see. The P3 wide color gamut shows more colors than the standard sRGB display, and it makes colors that look washed out on other displays stand out more in photos and videos. The ultralow reflectivity coating keeps the screen visible outside where glossy screens wash out completely. The True Tone technology <strong>changes the white balance based on the lighting around you</strong> to make it easier on your eyes when you use it for a long time.</p>
<p>Stage Manager is one of the features of iPadOS that makes real work possible: It <strong>lets you create resizable and overlapping app windows</strong> like those on desktop operating systems instead of forcing you to switch between apps in full screen. Support for external displays makes the workspace bigger by adding monitors, and Scribble turns handwriting into text wherever you can type.</p>
<p>At $449, the iPad Air 11-inch is the best value for money iPad you can get during Black Friday. If you need tablet computing with good performance, this record-low price makes Apple’s mainstream iPad accessible without compromise.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-gave-up-on-fire-10-inch-hd-tablet-own-hardware-burned-with-zero-margin-2000648193</link>
            <guid>1366969</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The <strong>Fire HD 10</strong> packs a 10.1-inch Full HD display, octa-core processor with 3GB RAM and 13-hour battery life into a package that <strong>costs seven times less than entry-level iPads</strong>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4205/">At $69, down from $139, this tablet has become the #1 bestseller across Amazon’s entire computers and tablets category</a> while hitting a record-low price that makes it cheaper than many restaurant dinners. Amazon removes profit margins on own-brand hardware during Black Friday to drive Alexa and Fire OS adoption. The <strong>50% discount transforms tablets</strong> from considered purchases into impulse buys that justify owning multiple units for different family members.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4205/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD Display That Works</h2>
<p>The <strong>10.1-inch screen has a resolution of 1920 x 1080</strong> which means that Netflix, Disney+, and YouTube look clear instead of blurry. Text stays clear while you read instead of making your eyes hurt by being fuzzy. Rich colors make photos, videos, and games come to life with levels of saturation that are as good as those of tablets that cost a lot more.</p>



<p>With an octa-core processor and 3GB of RAM, <strong>this Fire HD 10 is 25% faster than previous generations</strong>. It can handle web browsing with multiple tabs, video streaming, and casual gaming without any lag. Kids use educational apps, parents watch cooking videos, and students read textbooks, and the tablet’s performance is always responsive, so it never feels like a limitation.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery lasts for 13 hours which is enough for a few hours of streaming</strong> and browsing each day. This means you can go on weekend trips, long flights, or full days without worrying about running out of battery. The 32GB of base storage is enough for basic apps, downloaded videos, ebook librarie, and photos, so you don’t have to add more right away. The <strong>microSD slot can hold up to 1TB of extra storage</strong> for growing content libraries.</p>
<p>Parents can also set up <em>Amazon Kids</em> parental controls to make tablets safe for kids by filtering content, setting time limits, and choosing educational content. With easy-to-use controls, parents can limit access to apps and videos that are appropriate for their child’s age and stop them from making purchases or seeing inappropriate content.</p>
<p>At $69, this is the lowest price Amazon has ever offered on its own brand on Black Friday. The combination of real Full HD quality, real performance improvements, and incredible durability at half the already-low retail price makes it a better deal than any other iPad competitor. The fact that this is the #1 best-selling item on all computers and tablets shows that buyers know a great deal when they see one.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-stuck-with-too-many-airpods-pro-3-now-selling-newest-earbuds-at-all-time-low-to-clear-stock-2000648166</link>

              <p>This year marks a turning point in Apple’s historically rigid pricing strategy where discounts remained rare and controlled. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">At $219, down from $249, the AirPods Pro 3 that launched just months ago join Apple’s unprecedented Black Friday selloff</a> happening exclusively on Amazon rather than through official channels.</p>
<p>The entire AirPods lineup received aggressive discounting including the <strong>AirPods Max at $399</strong>, <strong>AirPods 4 with ANC at $99</strong>, <strong>standard AirPods 4 at $69</strong>, and these flagship Pro 3 models. Apple appears determined to clear inventory quickly but discreetly through Amazon’s platform rather than diluting brand perception on their own website where premium pricing remains intact.</p>

<h2>Live Translation That Lets You Talk to Anyone</h2>
<p>With<strong> the real-time translation feature</strong>, you can talk to people who don’t speak English face-to-face. The earbuds translate speech right away and show the text on your paired iPhone: Ordering food, asking for directions or doing business in a foreign language is less scary when AI can help with these things. The feature works for <strong>phone calls as well and translates both sides of conversations in real time</strong> for international calls with coworkers, family or business contacts who don’t speak your language.</p>



<p>The <strong>heart rate sensor turns AirPods from simple audio devices into health monitoring tools</strong> that can keep track of heart health metrics during workouts without the need for chest straps or wrist-worn devices. The optical sensors measure blood flow through the ear canals and send heart rate data to Apple Health so you can keep track of your fitness in real time.<strong> Runners can see their heart rate zones</strong> in real time while they train without having to wear an Apple Watch.</p>
<p>The <strong>hearing aid feature is a huge step forward</strong> in accessibility because FDA-approved hearing aids can now work through regular earbuds instead of expensive medical devices. The feature runs built-in tests to figure out your hearing profile, then boosts certain frequencies where you have hearing loss while keeping the sound quality natural. People with mild to moderate hearing loss can get help with everyday tasks without the stigma or cost of traditional hearing aids, which can cost thousands of dollars.</p>



<p><strong>Active noise cancellation works better</strong> now because the processing has been improved to sample background noise and make anti-phase sound waves that are more accurate. The noise of airplanes, people talking in the office and traffic all fade away into silence and let you fully concentrate on music, podcasts or work without any outside noise. The <strong>adaptive transparency mode</strong> lets in background noise when you need it for conversations or to be aware of your surroundings – and it changes automatically based on how loud the noise is around you.</p>
<p>With dynamic head tracking, <strong>Spatial Audio makes three-dimensional soundstages</strong> where sounds seem to come from certain places in space around you. Directional audio cues that put dialogue in the center of the screen and sound effects that pan left and right make movies and shows more immersive than flat stereo can. More and more music producers are using spatial audio which means that artists mix tracks specifically for this format to make immersive experiences where instruments are in different places.</p>
<p>If you want Apple’s most advanced earbuds, this record-low price represents the best value available.</p>
