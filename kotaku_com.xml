A translated feedback sheet says that the design Game Freak had in the works too closely resembled fan mock-ups, which led to the team shelving the idea. Unfortunately, we don’t have any images of the flying fox at the moment.</p><p>That being said, the way fan artists were able to respond to the news by immediately whipping out their existing mock-ups of the hypothetical Eeveelution kind of suggests that Game Freak’s own ideas were likely being cannibalized by fan artists at the time, too. Eevee’s entire schtick is that it can evolve into one of several Pokémon, each with a different elemental affinity, so fans have been drawing mockups of possible Eevee evolutionary lines for decades, including flying-types.</p><p>Eevee is one of the most popular Pokémon in the franchise, having become a secondary mascot to the series alongside Pikachu. Eevee even got its own game in 2018’s <em>Let’s Go, Eevee! </em>on the Switch. It’s been a long time, however, since it got a new evolution, with the last being Sylveon, who debuted in 2013 as one of the introductions to the fairy typing that was added in <em>Pokémon X </em>and <em>Y</em>. Whether or not Eevee needs more evolutions remains a topic of much debate among fans, with some content with the eight it already has, while others would like to see Eevee get a form for all 18 elemental types in the series. It sounds like Game Freak isn’t opposed to the idea, as long as it can find one that feels wholly original, and given how long people have been making fan art of fake Pokémon, that sounds like a difficult proposition. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With a bunch of sales going right now on every imaginable storefront, it’s a great time to pick up a great horror game or two, and I think the <em>Oxenfree </em>games are a perfect one-two punch for the season. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="192716" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Horror Game You've Never Heard Of Is Scientifically The Scariest Ever" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="174" data-playlist="192716,196215,195670" data-current="192716"><div><p>Horror Game You've Never Heard Of Is Scientifically The Scariest Ever</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192716/192716_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192716/192716_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192716/192716_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192716/192716_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18169.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As it so happens, the critically acclaimed narrative games from Night School Studio, including the seminal indie title <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/oxenfree-the-kotaku-review-1753813513&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/oxenfree-the-kotaku-review-1753813513"><em>Oxenfree</em></a></span> from 2016 and its 2023 sequel, are both heavily discounted on Steam right now. I’ve highlighted a number of shockingly low deals in my time doing this, but I don’t think I’ve ever spotted a deal as good as this one: <strong>both <em>Oxenfree </em>and </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-review-night-school-netflix-1850628828&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-review-night-school-netflix-1850628828"><em><strong>Oxenfree II: Lost Signals</strong></em></a></span>&nbsp;<strong>will run you just $3 till November 4.</strong><br></p><p>Why is this such a steal? Besides the low low price of approximately three Arizona drinks, the <em>Oxenfree </em>games are just some of the most effective minimalist horror in the medium. At their simplest, they are 2D side-scrolling narrative games featuring branching dialogue options. But <em>Oxenfree </em>distinguishes itself with some exceptionally grounded writing, bringing to life its teenage and later young-adult casts as they unearth ghosts both real and imagined.<br></p><p>In the first game, a crew of teenagers goes to Edwards Island, a tourist trap off the coast of their hometown that’s also a famously “haunted” locale. On the night that Alex, her stepbrother Jonas, and the rest of their friends depart for the island, they start picking up weird radio signals and wavelengths that begin to open what can only be described as a schism between worlds. The angular portals that begin appearing around Edwards Island invite other kinds of beings into Alex’s reality, at which point the crew stops being able to discern reality from the tricks of otherworldly spirits.</p><p>I love intimate stories driven by characters rather than larger plot machinations. A good character study is one of the most enjoyable things a story can deliver, and that’s what <em>Oxenfree </em>really is. While both games are set against hauntings, possessions, historical tragedies, and even the goings-on of a cult, they <em>mostly </em>center on the unraveling of the leads, characters so tightly wound that they need ghosts to shake loose traumas that therapy could barely touch. Alex and her friends—as well as Riley and Jacob in the sequel—are each holding onto <em>a lot </em>before their fateful encounters, but they walk away from these experiences fundamentally changed, and as players who learn to love them, we hope, at least, that it’s for the better.<br></p><p>The oft-unspoken highlight of these games, though, is their runtime. The first game can be finished in about five hours, meaning that if you simply sit on your couch tonight and play it straight through to the end, you can be in bed at a completely reasonable time. That then sets the stage for you to enjoy the slightly bigger, and similarly ambitious, sequel (which clocks in at between 6-8 hours) tomorrow on Halloween. Remember when I called this pick-up a one-two punch? That’s what I meant.<br></p><p>For an even sweeter deal, you can <strong>pick up both <em>Oxenfree </em>games, the soundtrack to the first game, and even <em>Afterparty</em>, one of Night School’s more underrated titles about drinking your way out of Hell, for about $3. </strong>No matter how you slice it, this deal is out of this world.<br></p><p>Even if you don’t specifically enjoy these games just in time for Halloween, the fall is a notoriously spooky season. Make a weekend out of enjoying <em>Oxenfree</em>, that’s what I did when I played the first game! If you ever need a low-key and casual scary time, and you don’t want to watch a movie or show, why not pop on these two games? They’re as good as any season of TV, they’re relatively easy commitments, and they’re both incredibly thoughtful coming-of-age stories set at two completely different stages of life, because we’re always growing, we’re always learning, and more importantly, we’re all haunted by something. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
