While it doesn’t elaborate any further on which assets are made with AI and how, the confession has reaffirmed what some fans had been claiming for months. </p><p>The <em>Black Ops 6</em> slop controversy began last October, a week before the game released, with allegations <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7LZ0kokKBQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7LZ0kokKBQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spreading on YouTube</a></span> of certain prestige emblems looking AI-generated.

Loading screens depicted hands with extra digits, a tell-tale sign of work produced by algorithms built on stealing other artists’ work, but not knowing how to count. One loading screen included a black glove with six fingers holding billiard balls. </p><p> The second was a zombie Santa holding up hand that had six fingers. Both were laughably egregious at the time, but also fostered fears that other less obvious examples might also have been AI-generated. The appearance of the Zombie Santa was even worse in the context of Zombies mode’s voice actors <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-zombies-actors-quit-lack-of-ai-protection-its-claimed/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-zombies-actors-quit-lack-of-ai-protection-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being replaced</a></span> amid a SAG-AFTRA strike for greater AI protections in game acting. </p><p>Activision’s new disclosure comes after previous reports that developers within the company were encouraged to experiment with new AI tools in their work. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A report b<em>y Wired </em>claimed</a></span> an entire paid cosmetic was made with help from AI in 2023's <em>Modern Warfare</em>, after the publisher had greenlit the tools for help with making concept art and marketing materials. That same year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-duty-activision-blizzard-ai-chatgpt-guitar-hero-1850429574&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-duty-activision-blizzard-ai-chatgpt-guitar-hero-1850429574">then CEO Bobby Kotick praised the work</a></span> being done at OpenAI and other companies, suggesting the technology would be as transformative as the original Macintosh computer. </p><p>Now Activision is owned by Microsoft, which touted the largest launch ever for <em>Black Ops 6</em> last fall thanks in part to Game Pass, and has itself been moving full-steam ahead with trying to incorporate generative AI into game development. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-muse-our-first-generative-ai-model-designed-for-gameplay-ideation/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-muse-our-first-generative-ai-model-designed-for-gameplay-ideation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The company recently announced Muse</a></span>, a model for visualizing gameplay built on data captured from people playing Ninja Theory’s 2020 PvP game <em>Bleeding Edge</em>. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer even claimed similar technology would aid in game preservation by making it easier to emulate classics on modern hardware. </p><p>But so far, <em>Black Ops 6 </em>has proven generative-AI tools and the current level of quality control around them often can’t  even get simple static images on loading screens right. Fortunately, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3liwvll4mvy2a&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3liwvll4mvy2a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new SteamDB tag</a></span> lets players filters games that us generative-AI out of their store searches. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Psylocke functions perfectly as an assassin while Hawkeye is meant to be used at range. But if you’re looking for an easy-to-pick-up hero with more flexibility, there is plenty of fun to be had with Magik.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-best-worst-duelists-damage-hela-hawkeye-1851739483&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-best-worst-duelists-damage-hela-hawkeye-1851739483"><em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ Damage Heroes, Ranked From Worst To Best</a></span></p><p>The young mutant is a powerhouse of a duelist who can deal substantial damage and steal health from enemies at the same time. Her kit is admittedly a bit all over the place, but we have the tips to help you master the Limbo ruler and bully the opposition.</p><h2 id="h168859"><a id=""></a><strong>You can dive in or be an off-tank</strong></h2><p>Magik has two prominent play-styles that can find success. The more popular strategy in my experience is using her as a dive character. This means using her Stepping Discs to teleport in from the sides or behind the enemy team, getting an elimination or two, and then returning to safety. I wouldn’t recommend taking on a Vanguard, but any <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-strategist-supports-best-worst-luna-snow-1851738627&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-strategist-supports-best-worst-luna-snow-1851738627">support heroes</a></span> or lonely ranged attackers are perfect targets.</p><p>Another viable strategy is to play Magik as more of an off-tank, to keep enemies from focusing on your team’s Vanguards. The main difference is that you’ll be fighting on the frontline alongside your Vanguards. Feel free to mix it up occasionally and use your stepping stones for a quick dive on the opposing team as well.</p><h2 id="h168860"><a id=""></a><strong>Watch out for the damage falloff on her primary Soulsword attack</strong></h2><p>One of my favorite qualities about Magik is her sword’s reach. The 6.5m length outclasses all other melee units and has helped me get numerous eliminations that seemed just out of reach. However, it does come with a unique drawback of damage falloff. Her primary Soulsword melee only deals the maximum 65 damage if the enemy is within 4.5m. It will then fall to 50 percent at the end of its range.</p><p>This drawback exists in her Darkchild form as well. Although her Soulsword range increases to 10m, the damage falloff begins at 6m and drops to a measly 25 percent damage at maximum range. The key takeaway here is that it’s better to be up close and personal when swinging this sword.</p><h2 id="h168861"><a id=""></a><strong>Animation canceling is your friend</strong></h2><p>Another drawback with Magik’s Soulsword is the slow rate of the attacks. Thankfully, just like other heroes, you can get a lot more damage in with animation canceling. Many of her abilities can instantly cancel the swinging animation, but the sweet spot is right after the sword makes contact. My go-to combos typically follow a loop of Soulsword &gt; universal melee &gt; another ability. Thanks to the damage buff she receives from her <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-season-bonus-team-up-health-damage-1851725468&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-season-bonus-team-up-health-damage-1851725468">Season Bonus</a></span>, I usually just need another Soulsword swing plus melee added to ensure that combo eliminates weaker heroes.</p><h2 id="h168862"><a id=""></a><strong>Stepping Discs and Umbral Incursion should be used often</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="ce2ee11b904b0f1ba0c927304833c524" data-recommend-id="image://ce2ee11b904b0f1ba0c927304833c524" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magik launches upwards towards Iron Man on the practice range." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magik launches upwards towards Iron Man on the practice range." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ce2ee11b904b0f1ba0c927304833c524" data-recommend-id="image://ce2ee11b904b0f1ba0c927304833c524" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magik launches upwards towards Iron Man on the practice range." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Outside of animation canceling, the proper balance to her weighty attacks is some nifty mobility techniques with Stepping Discs and Umbral Incursion. Stepping Discs is a two-charge ability that teleports her horizontally in whichever direction she’s moving. Aside from becoming invincible to damage during the movement, it also allows her to cast one of two additional attacks for three seconds after teleporting. These special attacks include a wide area-of-effect swing and a demon familiar summon.</p><p>Umbral Incursion is a rapid dash that will slash enemies upward if it makes contact. Its range is longer than her teleport and the potential launcher is a great way to deal more damage. While she isn’t invincible during the dash, Magik can use it to dash upward or downward.</p><p>My advice is to use these liberally with fights and general movement alike. Both abilities are perfect for repositioning around enemies and putting the hurt on them. Pair them together and you can even get in the face of flying heroes like Iron Man. Equally important, the invincibility of Stepping Discs and verticality of Umbral Incursion makes them perfect for making a quick exit.</p><h2 id="h168863"><a id=""></a><strong>If your health gets low in a fight, keep on fighting</strong></h2><p>Whenever a fight gets too dicey for most heroes, the solution is either to use a protective or healing ability, or to escape. The appropriate response in Magik’s case is usually to keep swinging that sword and using her abilities. Thanks to her Limbo’s Might passive, Magik converts 30 percent of the damage she inflicts as bonus health. I can tell you from experience playing with her and against her that she can last a long time in a fight. Once the odds get stacked against her, such as a pesky ranged hero joining the fray, it’s time to leave.</p><figure id="" data-id="b3aa292dbc1e2893291c810f2cbcde19" data-recommend-id="image://b3aa292dbc1e2893291c810f2cbcde19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Darkchild breaks the ground beneath her as she roars on the Hero information screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Darkchild breaks the ground beneath her as she roars on the Hero information screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b3aa292dbc1e2893291c810f2cbcde19" data-recommend-id="image://b3aa292dbc1e2893291c810f2cbcde19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Darkchild breaks the ground beneath her as she roars on the Hero information screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h168864"><a id=""></a><strong>Play even more aggressively as Darkchild</strong></h2><p>Magik’s ultimate has her transform into the corrupted Darkchild for 12 seconds. Unlike the Hulk, the ability moveset is the same across both forms. The difference is that everything is enhanced as Darkchild. Attacks can do more damage and land additional hits, Umbral Incursion reaches a longer range at a quicker speed, and cooldowns are lowered across the board. All of it comes together to allow her to deal massive amounts of damage and gain a decent amount of bonus health at the same time.</p><p>Whether you’re diving in the back or pushing up front, the goal of Darkchild is to be aggressive and do whatever you can to get some eliminations. Earning the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-ace-scoreboard-team-kill-mean-1851722529&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-ace-scoreboard-team-kill-mean-1851722529">Ace title</a></span> can be a cinch with an ultimate like this. Just don’t activate it in the middle of a fight, since her low health can quickly get depleted and waste your opportunity.</p><p>Magik isn’t without her weaknesses in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, but she is still one of the deadliest dive heroes on the roster. If you’re interested in checking out a Vanguard dive hero, you can’t go wrong with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-venom-tank-how-to-play-mvp-svp-1851736774&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-venom-tank-how-to-play-mvp-svp-1851736774">Venom</a></span>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
