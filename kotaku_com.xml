Here’s how long it will take you to beat the game ahead of the new chapter. Whether you were waiting for the full two-part game to be available, or are just tuning into Don’t Nod’s latest narrative title, the good news is that part one can be finished in a respectable amount of time.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195150" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Diablo IV - Bear Bender Build" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="526" data-playlist="195150,196055,196918" data-current="195150"><div><p>Diablo IV - Bear Bender Build</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195150/195150_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195150/195150_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195150/195150_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195150/195150_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20607.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-dont-nod-review-life-strange-1851765273&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-dont-nod-review-life-strange-1851765273">The New Game From The Makers Of <em>Life Is Strange</em> Is Off To An Excellent Start</a></span></p><p>In <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, you play as the socially awkward Swann Holloway as she reunites with her high school friends to reckon with the truth about an unspeakable thing that happened in the summer of 1995. The game jumps between two alternating timelines–July 1995, when Swann forges bonds with Autumn, Nora, and Kat, forms the titular punk rock band with them and documents life in Velvet Cove, and November 2022, when she’s in her early 40s and meets up with two of the girls at a bar to reminisce their teenage years while catching up on each other’s lives since that fateful summer.</p><p>If you’re mostly going to be invested in the dramatic story for the first half of <em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, <strong>expect to log in six hours of your time</strong>.

The politician’s one hand is frantically waving around over here, gesticulating about the harm these games are doing to our youth, while the other hand is quietly passing an unseen wad of cash to a rich chum.</p><p>When Mike Johnson drops in his line about young men requiring Medicaid support because they’re “playing video games all day,” this is a very deliberate act of misdirection. In his speech, he even suggests that this act by these dastardly fellows is taking money away from the deserving recipients of…access to healthcare, single mothers, the elderly, and the disabled. See, video games are not only hurting these foolish men, but also indirectly causing suffering toward other groups you care about! Do not be in any doubt for a single moment that Johnson wouldn’t instantly turn on single mothers, the elderly, the disabled, or anyone else, if it were politically expedient for him, but in this example, he’s carefully chosen his specific misdirection.</p><p>Hell, let’s not lose sight of the fact that just one month ago, Mike Johnson trotted out the exact same line about “able-bodied” men mooching off the state with their games.

The point is, he doesn’t give a shit about single mothers and the awful effects video games are indirectly causing them.</p><p>What he—and the Trump administration at large—actually care about is ensuring their rich friends get richer, and if that involves nickel-and-diming the poorest, then perfect.

The fact that most of these apparently languorous men who play games all day are in fact in part- or full-time jobs, but are paid so badly that they cannot afford even the most basic healthcare, would seem like a systemic societal issue that should demand addressing. Something is fundamentally wrong when those who work the hardest are paid the least, and then it’s <em>those people</em> (including single mothers, the disabled, and every other category of the working poor) who are not only demonized, but targeted to have even more money taken from them. That’s an atrocity, but don’t notice! Look at the wavy hand pointing at the video games!</p><p>Or take the incessant blaming of video games (and all the other media that came before it) for real-world violence. Since <em>Doom</em> was co-blamed for the Columbine High School massacre, the scapegoating of gaming for violence and gun crimes in the United States has become commonplace.

Video games are as political as any other form of media, and they can absolutely be used to attempt to spread harmful ideas or normalize bigotry. Just like cinema, theater, books, songs… We should absolutely always be thinking critically about the games we consume, and providing counterpoints when we disagree with messages. But despite this, and despite the vital importance of it, whenever the words “video games” are coming out of a politician’s mouth as a culprit for society’s ills, immediately redirect your eyes to see what their other hand is doing. Because there’s always something there they don’t want you to see, think of, or ask questions about.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
