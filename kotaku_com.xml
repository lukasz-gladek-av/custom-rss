              <p>Good morning! It’s Friday, and I’m so happy because today is my last day before I go off on a two-week vacation. But before I leave, I have one more Morning Checkpoint for you all. Yup, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news and other cool stuff is back again, and this time we’re looking into the rumored <em>Halo</em> remake, mourning the death of AOL dial-up, and preparing for so many damn games to launch in October. Enjoy, and I hope you get to go on a vacation very soon. You deserve it.</p> <h2><strong>Amazon is erasing guns from old James Bond posters</strong></h2> <p>Here’s something strange. Amazon, the new owners of the James Bond franchise, are allegedly digitally erasing guns out of old promo images of various Bond actors and using those censored images on Prime Video. <a href="https://hmssweblog.wordpress.com/2025/10/03/altered-007-images-raise-fan-concern-about-amazon/">This was documented by 007 fan blog <em>The Spy Command,</em></a> and it’s all really silly, with some images simply cropped to hide a gun and others changed more drastically. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/philnobilejr.bsky.social/post/3m2c4ko55zc2j">There’s also evidence that some of the images are being tweaked using AI tools.&nbsp;</a></p>

 <h2><strong>The rumored <em>Halo </em>remake is reportedly being developed by the <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> company</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/10/02/rumor-halo-ce-remake-co-devleoped-by-a-virtuous-studio/">As first reported by YouTuber Mr.Rebs and corroborated by XboxEra</a>, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-combat-evolved-remaster-remake-ps5-xbox-1851523975">previously reported but not yet announced remake of the original <em>Halo</em></a> is allegedly being developed by Abstraction Games, a studio owned by Virtuous.&nbsp; Virtuous is the same studio that developed this year’s smash hit RPG, <em>Oblivion Remastered.</em></p>

 <h2><strong><em>Payday 3</em>‘s promised offline mode has been canceled</strong></h2> <p><em>Payday 3</em> launched in 2023 to negative reviews, and players flocked back to <em>Payday 2 i</em>nstead. Since then, the devs have been trying to improve the game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/payday-3-solo-offline-mode-beta-update-june-27-heist-pc-1851560236">In June 2024</a>, the studio behind the game launched a pseudo-offline mode that still required the internet. At the time, it was called a “stepping stone” to a true offline mode. Well, that’s not actually going to happen after all.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/as-if-things-werent-bad-enough-payday-3-has-canceled-its-promised-offline-mode/">As reported by <em>The Game</em></a><em>r</em>, during a recent livestream,<em> Payday 3</em>&nbsp;general manager Jonas Skantz confirmed that the studio wasn’t planning to make a true offline mode, claiming that adding the fan-requested feature “is not feasible for where we are going with the game.”</p>

 <h2><strong>Five of the most wishlisted games on Steam are launching in October</strong></h2> <p>We’ve talked a few times about how October is going to be a month packed with video game releases. And here’s more evidence of that. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/buckle-up-five-of-the-most-wishlisted-games-on-steam-are-all-coming-out-this-month/">As spotted by<em> PC Gamer</em>,</a> some of the most wishlisted games on Steam right now, including <em>Battlefield 6</em> and <em>Little Nightmares 3,</em> are all launching in October. Good luck out there, folks.</p> <h2><strong>AOL’s dial-up internet service is officially dead</strong></h2> <p>*SCREECHING NOISES* *DIFFERENT LOUD NOISES* *DEEE DEEE DDEEEEE DOO DOO DOOOOOOO* Okay, finally online. <a href="https://apnews.com/article/aol-dial-up-internet-shuts-down-08162912737f2fb221f10ba87ce5fc41">Now to look up news about my internet provider AOL, and oh no….</a></p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-toasty-guy-from-mortal-kombat-has-left-the-studio-after-30-years-2000631151">The Toasty! guy from<em> Mortal Kombat</em> has left the studio after 30 years</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/openai-sora-2-videos-pokemon-spongebob-dragon-ball-2000631137">OpenAI’s new video tool is producing slop featuring copyrighted characters like Goku</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-game-boy-build-masterpiece-mario-zelda-2000631059">Hey, the new Lego Game Boy is awesome and not very expensive</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-pc-steam-install-size-arrowhead-games-2000631503</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-devs-explain-why-the-game-has-an-obnoxious-install-size-on-pc.1315768/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I don’t play <i>Helldivers 2</i> nearly as much as I should. But the last time I called in the stratagem that is installing the game through Steam, I sat in awe at the absurdly massive 141.51GB install size. My drives are perpetually overflowing with nonsense, so it really is a me problem. But seriously? Why the hell is this game so large? Thankfully, Arrowhead Game Studios has an answer.</p> <p>In a recent “<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/543369627969783286">Tech Blog</a>,” Arrowhead’s deputy technical director explained just why we all have to flinch at that colossal storage requirement upon installing or reinstalling <i>Helldivers 2</i> on PC. Turns out, it’s old, platter-based storage mediums with their slow, spinny discs to blame. Unlike more modern solid state drives that have evolved beyond the need for mechanical moving parts, hard-disk drives (HDDs) are really slow, and by duplicating various bits of data, you can improve performance for those on older hardware.</p>

 <p>So yeah, that massive install size actually represents multiple copies of the various bits of code that make up <i>Helldivers 2</i>. As the blog states, this is done to put essential data “in physically close proximity to where they would be needed in the game.” This reduces the “seek time” an HDD needs to do to load up something. The blog continues:</p>

 <blockquote><p>For example, our build system will ensure that a copy of a tree texture is stored on the same part of the disk as the level geometry data. When the game loads the level, the read head can access all the necessary information on a single, continuous sweep, without having to “seek” to a different location. This dramatically speeds up loading times.</p></blockquote> <p>The blog spills some digital ink speculating whether or not, in 2025, saddling everyone with duplicated files is necessary–especially when common practice for building a PC has been to use an SSD for quite some time. Based on Steam user surveys, Arrowhead says it thinks about 12 percent of PC gamers on the platform still use old-school spinny drives. And since <i>Helldivers 2</i> is a multiplayer game, that means you want that 12 percent to also be loading into the game as fast as you are. So yeah, it’s not just about catering to these players specifically. It’s about making sure everyone, even those who don’t have access to a more modern drive, still has a good, speedy time. Real woke shit right there.</p> <p>That said, if you have an older machine and can’t afford a meatier graphics card or CPU upgrade yet, switching over to an SSD is one of the more affordable options for improving not just your gaming, but your entire machine’s performance. And hey, even a 512GB SSD is <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">cheaper than a year of Game Pass right now</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon’s second Prime Day of the year is just around the corner, which means it’s a great time to finally make some computer upgrades happen. If you’re on the hunt for a compact desktop that keeps up with your productive days, the Dell OptiPlex 7020 MFF mini PC is going for $1,000 on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4465/">It typically retails for almost $3,399, so this is a whopping $2,399 off (71% off) the regular price tag.</a> There’s enough power for all your everyday plus resource-intensive tasks, and it’s an easy yes at the current discount. Just act fast, because the offer might wrap up any moment now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4465/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast, Reliable Performance for All Tasks At Hand</h2>
<p>This isn’t one of those ultra-compact mini PCs that fit in the palm of your hand. Those are great if you just need something basic for everyday tasks, but you’re usually trading off a lot of power for the size. The OptiPlex 7020 is slightly bigger, but still easy to carry around.</p>
<p>It boasts a 14th Gen Intel Core i7-14700T processor with 20 cores (8 performance + 12 efficiency), and is also capable of hitting up to 5.2GHz speeds. This translates into ultra-fast performance for all your tasks, whether it’s using a bunch of different applications at once, dealing with never-ending spreadsheets, working on creative projects, or even gaming. The built-in 32GB of DDR5 RAM keeps things running smoothly, while the 1TB M.2 PCIe NVMe SSD makes sure you’re not stuck waiting around for the system to boot and the programs to load. Average work days will feel a lot more productive and, honestly, a lot less frustrating.</p>



<p>For connectivity, you’ve got Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth, plus a whole bunch of ports for all your essentials, including one USB-C 3.2 Gen 2×2, three USB-A 3.2 Gen 1, one USB-A 3.2 Gen 2, two USB 2.0, two DisplayPort 1.4a, one HDMI 1.4b, one RJ-45 Ethernet, and a universal audio jack. The DisplayPorts, HDMI, and USB-C here also let you connect up to four displays, so there’s plenty of room for expansion as well.</p>
<p>This mini PC runs on Windows 11 Pro, and you even get a keyboard and mouse in the box. Setting it up and getting started is easy. Those who like their desks to be as clean as possible will appreciate how it just mounts at the back of your monitor. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4465/">Just be sure to grab it while it’s still discounted (-71%).</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/good-boy-does-the-dog-die-horror-movie-indy-showtimes-2000631497</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fellow-animal-lovers-i-promise-the-dog-horror-movie-is-safe-to-watch-and-also-very-good.1315732/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>If you’re a fan of horror movies or dogs, you’ve probably heard about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/good-boy-trailer-horror-movie-dog-actor-release-date-2000618245"><i><span>Good Boy</span></i></a><span>, the horror movie in which the events play out from the perspective of a retriever named Indy. I am a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-nickname-pet-name-go-black-white-legends-arceus-1850392164"><span>card-carrying dog lover</span></a><span> who can barely stand to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/guardians-of-the-galaxy-vol-3-rocket-raccoon-animal-vio-1850408326"><span>see an animal distressed in a movie</span></a><span>, and I still bravely made my way to the theater to see the film after being intrigued by its premise and the rave reviews coming out of advance screenings earlier this year. I had resigned myself to possibly leaving the movie early if Indy’s No Good Very Bad Night proved to be too much. Thankfully, I didn’t feel the need to, and I was actually really impressed with the titular good boy’s performance, considering Indy had no prior movie training. If you’re a fellow animal lover who’s wary of the film, I understand your hesitation, but </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>is an interesting enough experiment that it’s worth seeing, and is surprisingly restrained as far as the horrors it subjects its furry star to.</span></p> <p><span>We won’t get into major spoilers until later, and we’ll put a big ol’ spoiler warning over it if you’re concerned about that, but what I left </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>most excited to talk about was how well it masks Indy’s lack of film experience. After the movie, director and co-writer Ben Leonberg presents a short documentary breaking down how he and his crew managed to pull off a horror movie starring a dog who had no prior training. Indy is Leonberg’s dog, and </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>was filmed with a small crew of people the dog was familiar with. So any time you see his character upset or scared, he’s actually just chilling. Leonberg explains how almost every shot of this pup is only made unnerving or scary by the surrounding shots of ghostly figures and the ominous music.</span></p>

 <p><span>Indy may not know he’s in a movie, but</span><i><span> Good Boy </span></i><span>is tailor-made for him and his perspective. Scenes are shot from his level, and you go long stretches of the movie without seeing a human face. </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>isn’t merely a horror movie with a dog in its cast; it is a horror movie that makes every creative decision in its tight 72-minute runtime to emphasize that he is the star of this waking nightmare. </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>follows Indy as he and his owner, Todd, move from the city to the family’s seemingly haunted rural home. From the outset, Indy sees ghosts his owner doesn’t, and as Todd’s condition worsens, Indy begins to fear they may be a threat to the ailing human.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000618247" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618247"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618247">© IFC</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Thanks to some smart filmmaking decisions, good editing, and shot composition, Indy is a very emotive actor for someone who has no idea what’s going on. In the documentary, Leonberg and his crew show how they would make sounds from behind the camera to get the dog to look where they needed, and his lack of training meant that they could spend all day shooting and only get a few seconds of usable footage. The whole production took over a year because the team was committed to Indy being the star, and I mean, look at that face. That’s a face made for the big screen.</span></p>

 <p><span>But you’re probably wondering if Indy is shown suffering throughout the movie. The horror genre has a way of putting its stars through grave situations that usually end with them bloodied and battered, if not worse. Without spoilers, I will say that </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>is pretty tame as far as what it subjects Indy to for most of the film. I imagine that was a conscious choice, considering, again, Indy isn’t an acting dog, and the more distressing moments his character is put through are some of </span><i><span>Good Boy</span></i><span>’s more awkward shots because it was clear the crew didn’t want to stress the pup out, so some scenes, like when Indy stumbles into a fox trap, are a little clunky, but they’re also very quick.</span></p>

 <p><span>Now, for the question a lot of you may be wondering: Does Indy die? I can tell you that </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>doesn’t do a lot of terrible shit to its canine star, and none of that will matter if the poor baby doesn’t make it to the end, right? Well, here’s a spoiler warning, so if you don’t want to know, don’t scroll down any further.</span></p>

   <p><span>No, Indy doesn’t die in </span><i><span>Good Boy</span></i><span>, but another dog does. As Indy investigates his new home, he learns about Todd’s recently deceased grandfather, who was also subjected to the horrors of this house. The old man also had a dog named Bandit who could see the same monsters Indy does, and Todd mentions that his grandfather’s dogs all “ran away” over the years. Well, that wasn’t true for at least one of them. At a point later in the film when shit’s getting real, Indy finds Bandit’s skeleton in the house cellar. In a few instances, Bandit’s “ghost” tries to help Indy by guiding him to clues within the house, but he’s only able to do this because he’s already dead under the house. If that’s a deal breaker for you, I understand. But if you’re primarily worried about on-screen dog suffering, </span><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>is as about as light on it as it can be with its premise.</span></p> <p><i><span>Good Boy </span></i><span>is such an interesting, imaginative movie that I do urge people who just enjoy cinema to give it a watch, even if they’re worried the subject matter might be challenging. The movie is an experiment that really pays off because its crew commits, and the moments where it pulls its punches speak to that commitment to its star’s comfort. If the premise scares you off, that’s understandable, but if you’re even mildly curious, as a dog lover myself, I say it’s worth giving it a shot.</span></p>
