              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/mlb-slugfest-2003">Remember<em> MLB Slugfest 2003</em></a>? If you do remember this over-the-top PS2-era baseball game, it’s likely because of its often funny color commentators, Tim and Jimmy, who offered up bizarre or crude jokes and stories between hits. And it turns out that some of the duo’s lines went a bit too far for the MLB 20 years ago.</p> <p>Published by Midway Sports in 2002 for PS2, Xbox, and GameCube, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ngx93LcdCyI"><em>MLB Slugfest 2003</em></a> was an arcade-y baseball game heavily inspired by <a href="https://kotaku.com/come-to-think-of-it-the-original-nfl-blitz-did-have-a-5911734">Midway’s popular <em>NFL Blitz</em> series</a>. Like <em>Blitz</em>, <em>Slugfest 2003</em> added a lot of chaos, violence, and humor into the classic sport in a way that I can’t imagine Major League Baseball would be okay with in 2025. But even back in the early 2000s, the MLB wasn’t on board for <em>all</em> of Midway’s naughty jokes and dark commentary bits. Now, thanks to the excellent <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-retro-classic-virtual-console-piracy-vghf-hist-1848558311">Video Game History Foundation</a>, we can hear which jokes crossed the line with MLB execs.</p>

 <p>On November 3, the VGHF posted a video on social media sharing some of the group’s favorite cut commentary jokes from<em> MLB Slugfest 2003</em>. The VGHF, a nonprofit dedicated to preserving and sharing video game history, says these cut lines, as well as some documents related to<em> MLB Slugfest’</em>s unused jokes, were discovered in the group’s archives on a CD.</p>   <p>Over on the VGHF’s archives, <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/item/c664b6e7-5b8c-409d-b92a-f45a4aebe9e8">you can find a document seemingly sent over to Midway</a>, presumably from the MLB, listing <a href="https://us.preservica.com/Render/render/external?entityRef=c664b6e7-5b8c-409d-b92a-f45a4aebe9e8&amp;token=17e03a1a-f2fc-42e4-a85e-9a8af97d201a">all the jokes</a> that were “disapproved” for use in the finished game. Some of these jokes are bad, and I totally support the MLB for asking for them to be cut. But some of the cut jokes don’t seem too bad. For example, this line:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“Baseball’s the greatest sport in the world, but one thing I liked growing up was taking a pop bottle and breaking it with a rock.”</p></blockquote> <p>That’s just funny. But perhaps my favorite cut line that is, admittedly a bit dark, is this one:</p> <blockquote><p>“Jimmy: Tim, have you ever wondered if this booth could just collapse and kill the both of us?”</p> <p>“Tim: Jimmy, it’s all I think about.”</p></blockquote> <p>Anyway, you can check out all the cut lines and more from <em>MLB Slugfest 2003</em> over on the VGHF’s fantastic publicly accessible digital library and archive, <a href="https://kotaku.com/vghf-old-retro-game-magazines-read-online-free-library-1851751951">which also contains over 1,500 video game magazines</a> that can be accessed for free. <a href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/">Though I recommend kicking over a few bucks to VGHF if you can, as the group is doing the work that publishers won’t</a> and that’s worth supporting.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sims-4-ea-saudi-arabia-acquisition-gay-relationships-2000640899</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Fans of several of EA’s franchises are worried about what might happen to their favorite games and series now that the publisher and all its subsidiaries are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829"><span>being acquired</span></a><span> by some of the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/electronic-arts-acquisition-saudi-arabia-jared-kushner-2000629849"><span>worst people and forces you could possibly imagine</span></a><span>. The Saudi Arabian government and Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, are buying out the company behind games like </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span>, BioWare’s catalog, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-lgbtqia-characters-tournament-saudi-arabia-1851411189"><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i></a><span>, all of which are known and celebrated for their queer characters and storylines. Fans are so worried about what might happen to these games and their inclusive design moving forward that </span><i><span>Sims </span></i><span>content creators have </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sims-4-youtubers-pokemon-legends-z-a-sales-2000638834"><span>opted out of the series’ creator program</span></a><span> over the acquisition. With so much uncertainty lingering over the company right now, fans can’t help but wonder what franchises like </span><i><span>The Sims </span></i><span>might look like after all the papers are signed. One of the original leads on the game says that if </span><i><span>The Sims </span></i><span>were to abandon the queer community, it would lose the heart and soul of what has made the life sim series so popular since its debut in 2000.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://frvr.com/blog/news/the-sims-designer-says-that-the-series-diversity-is-critical-especially-at-times-like-now/"><i><span>FRVR</span></i></a><span>, original </span><i><span>Sims </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Sims 2</span></i><span> artist and director Charles London explained that representing same-sex relationships is “incredibly important” to the spirit of the franchise.</span></p> <p><span>“It’s everything,” London told </span><i><span>FRVR</span></i><span>, “and I think it’s existential for the business, right? It is certainly for society. I think it’s incredibly important for there to be a mainstream, beloved brand that says ‘love is love and people are people’ and all the things that I certainly personally believe in, but also I believe it is existential to that business because it is what allows it to be universally appealing, right? Young, old, male, female, gay, straight, other, right? American, Iranian, whatever.</span></p> <p><span>“Its appeal and its recognition of the fundamental truths of our humanity is what creates the empathetic and emotional connection to that game that makes it so powerful,” he continued. “It’s not that there’s so many pants you can dress them in. Don’t get me wrong, that’s an important part of the business, right? That’s also existential… but it’s very connected to evergreen toys like Barbie.”</span></p> <p><span>Elsewhere in the interview, London says that the choice to put same-sex relationships in those early games wasn’t even meant to be the act of a “band of fearless social revolutionaries,” but was merely seen as a reflection of the human experience the team sought to emulate in </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span>, without which the game would have been telling a “lie.”</span></p> <p><span>“I think it goes beyond the sexual,” London said. “The answer I gave actually is applicable to, I think, as many of the decisions we could have possibly made in </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span> where we are agnostic and where we leave room for player choice. </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span> must remain [agnostic] for it to be successful, it must remain a faithful canvas on which the player is free to project the story that, to them, is important and emotionally impactful.</span></p> <p><span>“And that includes not just sexuality, it includes body image, it includes race, and it includes the choice of clothing. It includes the choice of architecture, the choice of job, structure, all the magnificent diversity of actual human life, and this is something that the team, I think, deeply understands.”</span></p> <p><span>At the moment, EA asserts that its “values and [its] commitment to players and fans around the world remain unchanged,” but given the pending new ownership, fans are skeptical. The Saudi Arabian government has made several attempts to latch onto the video game industry in an attempt at </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-saudi-arabia-street-fighter-6-sony-esports-2000622367"><span>“sportswashing” the dire state of its human rights laws</span></a><span>, which include the criminalization of same-sex acts, marriage, and cross-dressing. If someone in a position of power at EA says that developers are no longer allowed to implement queer characters and storylines, there’s no guarantee that </span><i><span>Mass Effect 5 </span></i><span>or a future </span><i><span>Sims </span></i><span>project will include them in the future. Hopefully, someone at EA hears what London is saying and fights back against any such regulation. It would be a real fucking shame if these series with storied queer history weren’t allowed to maintain it in the future.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’ve never played an isometric RPG that didn’t feel better with turn-based combat, so it’s really neat to hear <a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-exploit-update-obsidian-pillars-eternity-2-removed-steam-2000631633">that <em>Pillars of Eternity</em></a> will be testing the more tactical option in the weeks ahead. It’ll hopefully be more intuitive for some players than the game’s existing “real-time with pause” combat, and get more people to check out where Obsidian Entertainment’s big fantasy series got its start.</p> <p>Testing on the new mode will begin November 5 for the PC version of <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, with plans to add it in a future patch. Game director Josh Sawyer called it a big undertaking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mj6HObhD_8">in a video blog</a> announcing the update, and said it was inspired by the positive reception to the addition of turn-based combat in <em>Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pillars-of-eternity-ii-is-getting-a-turn-based-mode-1831961398">back in 2019</a>. That said, fans had criticism of the system which Sawyer said will be addressed for the version coming to the original <em>Pillars</em>.</p> <p>“One of the major changes is that action economy is a lot more accurate to the real-time with pause game,” he said. “It’s not a one-to-one translation of time because we did try that. But it does match the spirit of what dexterity should do, what recovery time should do, everything like that. The number of turns you get to take per round is no longer tied to the round, but to your speed and recovery. That feels like it has much greater parity with the real-time with pause mode.”</p> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="1 minute, 8 seconds One of the major changes is that action">To keep combat from feeling slow, lethality has been buffed so that fights aren’t super drawn out. Obsidian is also looking at a HUD toggle to let players swap combat modes on the fly, but there will be an option in the game settings menu that players can change at will either way. Fans are taking the news well and already demanding a sequel. “Please give this man the budget of <em>BG3</em> to make the next <em>Pillars</em>,” one wrote on YouTube.</p> <p tabindex="0" role="button" aria-label="1 minute, 8 seconds One of the major changes is that action"><em>Pillars of Eternity</em> might be an older game at this point but its universe is one that keeps getting carried forward, most recently with 2025’s great <a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525">first-person action-RPG <em>Avowed</em></a>. The turn-based mode will make it easier for players to revisit where the fantasy world of Eora got its start. It would be nice if it eventually comes to the console version of the game as well.</p>

              <p>Following some disruptive server issues after <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ first weekend was slammed with an influx of players, Embark Studios is giving out 500 Raider Tokens to those who played on Sunday, which translates to about five bucks in real, U.S. dollars. It’s a nice gesture, but as many in the growing <i>Arc Raiders</i> community have pointed out, five bucks ain’t gonna get you a whole lot in the in-game shop.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We appreciate your patience as our servers had a wobble on Sunday, Scrappy must've pecked a few wires loose, he's been put on the naughty step 🐓<br>As a token of our thanks, we're sending 500 Raider Tokens to all Raiders who logged in on Sunday.</p> <p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/1985381493829443634?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ servers were <i>packed</i> this weekend. Hitting over 300,000 concurrent players on Steam alone has helped land the extraction shooter in the top five most-played games on Valve’s storefront, putting it just under <i>Battlefield 6</i>. The game is winning over an eager fanbase with its engaging progression systems and hardcore gameplay loop. But <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ in-game cosmetic shop is a sore spot for many, especially given that the game requires a $40 purchase to play.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/20-10-skins-expensive-microtransactions-halo-diablo-4-1851008769">How The Hell Did We Let $20 Skins Become A Thing?</a></p> <p>“I thought $10 worth of coins would be enough to buy [a particular] skin, not the bundle, just the skin,” a Redditor writes in a post titled “The prices are…a little spicy, right?” Whether you’re playing <i>Fortnite </i>or <i>Diablo IV </i>or any number of other games, it’s become all too common to see high price tags affixed to the privilege of sporting a new digital look.</p>

   <p>But to many <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ fans, it’s not just the price, but the lack of customization options with the pricey cosmetics that’s getting under their skin. For now, while you can mix up different backpacks with different outfits, items like goggles, helmets, and boots are all tied to the skin they come with. So no astronaut suit with a cowboy hat for you.</p>

 <p>“The fact that [the] entire costume comes in one piece with some minimal customization,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ok55b1/comment/nm95vw5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one comment reads</a>, “rather than pieces you can slap on later and recombine with other stuff kinda drags value down for me.” Another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ok55b1/comment/nm8blmc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">highly upvoted comment reads</a>, “Step 1: Don’t buy it. Step 2: Watch as prices become reasonable.” Another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1om2l23/we_need_to_be_able_to_mix_match_helmets_round_2/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Reddit post with nearly 1,000 upvotes</a> encourages players to use Embark Studios’ support site to request the ability to swap helmets across different outfits.</p>

   <p>Other folks haven’t been as kind, with one popular post on Reddit describing a particular facial cosmetic as paying four bucks to “have poop smeared on your face,” while countless other players are upset over a lack of customization options for things such as beards.</p>   <p>Perhaps these pricing concerns wouldn’t be as salient if the game were free-to-play, like Embark’s other game <i>The Finals</i>. But given the $40 asking price, which feels plenty fair for a game of this scale, demanding half the cost of the game just to dress up a certain way feels odd to say the least.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-studios-gta-6-price-fortnite-simpsons-2000633663#:~:text=The%20Simpsons%20are%20seemingly%20on%20their%20way%20to%20Fornite%C2%A0">After rumors and leaks</a>, <em>Fortnite’s</em> new <em>Simpsons</em>-themed mini-season went live over the weekend, and I had a giant smile on my face as I ran around the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-springfield-update-leak-november-2000637296">new Springfield map</a>, no matter how many times I got sniped by random Gokus and Peelys.</p> <p>Over the years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/crossover-skins-destiny-2-witcher-halo-rainbow-six-bad-1851039973">I’ve made it very clear that I’m not a fan of the growing trend of crossovers in video games</a>. Sticking Master Chief in <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> or jamming Godzilla into <em>Call of Duty</em> has always been weird and nasty to me. It feels like all of pop culture is merging into a giant grey blob. It makes me sad. Yet, I always give <em>Fortnite</em> a pass because, for many years now, it has been an IP playground. <em>Fortnite</em> is just a giant mess of stuff, a new internet for the next generation. So what if they add Luke Skywalker or Ariana Grande to it? But even if I wasn’t willing to give <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-battle-royale-the-kotaku-review-1833890299"><em>Fortnite</em></a> a pass, I’d still be playing this new <em>Simpsons</em> season because it’s so dang good.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-simpsons-drop-into-springfield-in-br-and-delulu?lang=en-US">Launched on November 1</a>, the<em> Fortnite x Simpsons</em> mini-season turns the entire battle royale into a <em>Simpsons</em> video game, something we haven’t gotten in over a decade. In fact, <a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-tapped-out-closing-shutting-down-ea-when-faq-1851658796">it’s been nearly 20 years since the last console-based <em>Simpsons</em> game</a> and over two decades since 2005’s beloved <em>Simpsons Hit and Run</em>. That alone makes this new <em>Fortnite</em> season super special. The first time I landed at Evergreen Terrace in <em>Fortnite</em> and explored the Simpsons’ house, I had the biggest grin on my face and was excited to just poke at each room and detail. I was quickly killed by someone actually playing the game, but I didn’t care. I was finally playing a new, modern 3D <em>Simpsons</em> game in 2025, even if it was just a <em>Fortnite</em> event.</p>

  <p>Exploring beyond the Simpsons’ home, I found so many locations and details from the show. Want to visit Moe’s Bar? It’s here, and you can even hear a prank call from Bart. The first time I visited the Nuclear Power Plant, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Springfield_Nuclear_Power_Plant#Trivia">I heard a crow squawk, a detail that is always included when the location appears in an episode</a>. The Aztec Theatre is here. Mr. Burns’ massive mansion is fully explorable. Kamp Krusty is falling apart, but still explorable and properly dilapidated. Even the tire fire and <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Tomacco">tomacco farm</a> can be found in <em>Fortnite’s</em> new Springfield map. I even found a store selling Poochie merch. If you’re a big fan of the show like me, you’ll likely die a lot this season because you’ll be too distracted by Easter eggs, references, and details to notice the enemy players hunting you down.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000640879" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640879"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640879">©Epic / Disney</figcaption></figure> <p>Of course, beyond the map are skins based on characters from the show. At the moment, the battle pass has added Marge and Homer, and Bart is for sale in the store. Bart is wearing a strange mech exo-suit thing, which I get is the only way to make that character work within <em>Fortnite’s</em> proportions, but it does look odd. Based on leaks and trailers, we know that Krusty, Moe, Ned, Scratchy, and a <em>Simpsons</em>&nbsp;spin on Peely are coming, too. Personally, I hope a few more characters are coming as well, but my wallet is begging for the opposite.</p>

 <p>We are even getting a series of animated <em>Simpsons</em> shorts that connect to this new <em>Fortnite</em> season, with many of the original voice actors involved. And the main series on Fox included a grisly bit involving Peely in the show’s latest episode. It’s full-on media synergy, baby!</p>

  <p>But yeah, a few days into this new <em>Fortnite</em> x <em>Simpsons</em> season, I’m hugely impressed with what Epic has pulled off. The new island is not only fun to play on and filled with tons of details, but it also looks gorgeous. Everything has this show-accurate cel-shaded look, from random pieces of flooring to iconic buildings and more. I really hope Epic lets people tinker with this map within <em>Fortnite’s</em> content creation tools in the future because it feels like a waste to throw it all away at the end of this month when the mini-season wraps up.</p> <p>Until then, I’ll be dropping in on Springfield, saying thanks to Otto (the season’s bus driver) and finding more Easter eggs and silly details from my favorite comedy series of all time. And hey, maybe this season’s popularity will remind Disney that people want <em>Simpsons</em>-themed video games? One can hope.</p>
