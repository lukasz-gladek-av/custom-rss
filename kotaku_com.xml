Eggman’s loyal-to-a-fault henchman has been a consistent supporting character through all three movies thus far, and <em>Sonic 3 </em>pretty much solidified what had become a long-running fan joke and theory since the first movie premiered in 2020: Agent Stone is absolutely in love with Jim Carrey’s Eggman, and these movies are slow burn toxic yaoi.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194842" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: System Shock, Street Fighter 6, And More" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="183" data-playlist="194842,196790,195905" data-current="194842"><div><p>The Week In Games: System Shock, Street Fighter 6, And More</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194842/194842_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194842/194842_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194842/194842_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194842/194842_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20305.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While <em>Sonic 3 </em>presents easily the most emotionally charged version of Agent Stone’s love for Eggman, this guy has been self-destructively devoted to the mad scientist since day one. My god, is it toxic. In the first film, Carrey’s version of Eggman was defined by a mostly grounded superiority complex He’s just a dick to everyone, and that includes Stone. However, Stone’s undying loyalty means he takes it all on the chin, and the dom/sub undertones are not subtle. There’s a scene in which Eggman puts his hand in Stone’s mouth and pulls him close to whisper sweet nothings (unbridled abuse) into his ear. Later, he makes Stone pin himself to a wall as he once again hurls not-so-niceties his way, and the imagery is enough to make even people who are watching the scenes out of context blush.</p><p>It was with <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2 </em>that the movies dropped any notion of subtlety about how Agent Stone feels about the doctor. After Eggman is jettisoned onto a different planet at the end of the first movie, Stone opens up a coffee shop like a sad widower still hoping to see his husband return from the war. His first scene in the movie has him making latte art of himself and his ex-boss with hearts coming out of it. Gay. We later see more of Stone putting up with abuse, but my guy seems to be enjoying every second of it and still sticks with Eggman through another defeat at the hands of Sonic. By the time <em>Sonic 3 </em>is ready to finally address the abusive elephant in the room, it is some of the angstiest shit in a movie that has Keanu Reeves as a brooding, revenge-driven hedgehog.</p><p>In between all the pop culture references and needle drops, <em>Sonic 3 </em>is probably the most raw of all three movies, and that extends to Stone and Eggman’s relationship. Stone has become a capable protector for his superior, who has entered a deep depression after losing to Sonic last time. But when the doctor meets his grandfather, who seemingly replaces Stone as the most important person in his life, the agent is left abandoned as Eggman goes off to try and conquer the world without him. The “breakup” includes a painful phone call in which Stone pleads with Eggman to come back, saying that he’s not there to protect him from whatever his grandfather is planning and that he “can’t lose [him] again.” I turned to my siblings in the theater to remark about how gay it was. But it all comes to a bittersweet end as Eggman apologizes on a worldwide broadcast just before his apparent death while Stone helplessly watches with the saddest puppy-dog eyes to grace a theater screen. This is the tragic, toxic shit that terabytes of fanfiction and fan art are made of. After the events of <em>Sonic 3</em>, all the long-time Stobonik shippers are having a field day with edits and fanart, and new fans are realizing what they’ve been missing.</p><p>Given Eggman’s supposed death, it’s unclear if Agent Stone will have any role in the next <em>Sonic </em>movie coming in 2027. However, given the character’s popularity, it would be a shame to have one of the few human characters fans seem to universally love go away just as he’s finding himself. Fans are already hoping that Majdoub could return as Stone in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.patreon.com/posts/115749707?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/115749707?utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=android_share" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported Shadow spin-off</a></span> as the two had some rapport in <em>Sonic 3</em>.

The suggestion already has fans running with ideas and jokes.</p><p>While the future of Eggman and Stone is uncertain, one thing that is certain is that Majdoub approves of the Stobotnik ship. Here he is endorsing the pairing and saying that “toxic yaoi’s the shit.” So true, bestie.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The movie focuses on Robbie Williams, a British pop star who found fame overseas in the band Take That, before going on to have a successful solo career. But instead of a human actor playing Williams, <em>Better Man</em> features a CGI chimpanzee. Nobody in the movie comments about the fact that an ape is front of them, so its likely just an artistic metaphor inspired by Williams stating that he’s always been “less evolved than other people.” And this weird concept seems to have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://apnews.com/article/box-office-den-thieves-better-man-mufasa-3a702f5b216ef7268adf0e5be6a0e1e3&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://apnews.com/article/box-office-den-thieves-better-man-mufasa-3a702f5b216ef7268adf0e5be6a0e1e3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">failed</a></span>. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/box-office-den-of-thieves-2-first-place-robbie-williams-biopic-better-man-bombs-1236272480/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/box-office/box-office-den-of-thieves-2-first-place-robbie-williams-biopic-better-man-bombs-1236272480/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>Variety </em>on January 12</a></span>, <em>Better Man</em> opened in the United States at number 14. I didn’t even realize there were 14 movies playing in theaters right now. Yikes. <em>Better Man </em>has only scraped together about $1.1 million from the US and Canadian box office.  But hey, Robbie Williams isn’t a star over here—he’s big in the UK, right? So maybe the movie did better over there?

RIP <em>GTA San Andreas</em>’ Big Smoke as Punisher and CJ as Winter Soldier.</p><p>Naturally, it only took a few days for fans to find a workaround. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dexerto.com/marvel-rivals/marvel-rivals-players-already-found-a-way-to-bring-mods-back-3028424/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dexerto.com/marvel-rivals/marvel-rivals-players-already-found-a-way-to-bring-mods-back-3028424/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dexerto</em> notes</a></span>, there are essentially two techniques for bypassing <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ new asset hash check. The first incorporates the modded files directly into the game’s .pak files rather than separately through a mod manager. It’s a much bigger hoop than most players will want to jump through, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YskRnb4-Wyc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YskRnb4-Wyc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but it works</a></span>. </p><p>The second method is a bit more straightforward, but requires a very beefy SSD. It seemingly revolves around unpacking and repacking files quickly enough to skirt the new checks, and comes with the risk of overheating your PC as a result. “You can just extract the pak files like a zip and run them unpaked,” reads <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/1162&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nexusmods.com/marvelrivals/mods/1162" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new how-to by prafit1111 over on <em>NexusMods</em></a></span>. “The problem is, the game is loading 50,000 files versus 1 so this can be quite problematic even on the fastest SSDs. Using a solution like this could even make your SSD die faster.”</p><p>Plus, even if you don’t corrupt your game install or kill a piece of your rig, continuing to mess around with mods still risks permanently losing access to your account and all the cosmetics you’ve already purchased or unlocked. “It is not recommended to modify any game files, as doing so carries the risk of getting banned,” NetEase recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-1-update-appears-to-have-disabled-mods-much-to-the-dismay-of-fans-of-custom-skins&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-1-update-appears-to-have-disabled-mods-much-to-the-dismay-of-fans-of-custom-skins" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>IGN</em></a></span> in a statement. But hey, I guess some things are worth potentially getting hit by the <em>Marvel Rivals</em> ban hammer, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@imyinni/video/7450759811643247878?q=pochita%20jeff&amp;t=1736781239207&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@imyinni/video/7450759811643247878?q=pochita%20jeff&amp;t=1736781239207" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wiping the entire enemy team as Pochita Jeff</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
