            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A newly discovered bug in <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149">open-world looter shooter <em>Borderlands 4</em></a> is letting players use a specific legendary gun to fling themselves across large sections of the game’s map. It looks wild and could be useful for speedrunners. But Gearbox is watching the glitch and might, if needed, fix it to avoid technical problems.</p> <p>On September 19, Twitch streamer and content creator Bahroo shared a video of himself playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/12-tips-borderlands-4-guide-help-better-loot-gold-keys-side-quests-tricks-2000626554"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> while pulling off a technique known online as “Cricket Jumping.” The bug relies on a legendary handgun known as the “Noisy Cricket” and its powerful kick, which sends players flying backward. The gun itself is a reference to the <a href="https://meninblack.fandom.com/wiki/Noisy_Cricket">tiny gun with the same name seen in the ’90s sci-fi comedy film<em> Men In Black</em>.</a> Normally, this isn’t the most useful trait. But if you tab out or pause the game at the right time while charging up a shot with the Noisy Cricket, you can send yourself flying for miles. It’s wild to watch in action.</p>  <p>Cricket Jumping has been a known bug since at least September 16, <a href="https://youtu.be/g9qh_8N4QU0">as demonstrated in this short video</a> uploaded by YouTube user Platinum. But it wasn’t until Bahroo and other bigger streamers and creators began sharing videos of the technique that it caught on more and became more publicly known. And that attention eventually got Cricket Jumping spotted by <em>Borderlands 4′</em>s creative director Graeme Timmins. While you might assume someone from Gearbox would not be happy about this bug, Timmins seemed open to not patching it out, provided it doesn’t break the game.</p>

 <p>“I’ve got my eye on this,” replied Timmins to a video of the bug on Twitter. “My only worry is streaming issues or if this introduces instability. Not out to ruin people’s fun, but can’t have it cause tech issues. For now, tho, not going to do anything until proven issues arise.”</p> <p>So for now, it seems like Gearbox is going to let people Cricket Jump all around Kairos, assuming it doesn’t ruin the game for other players or introduce some nasty, less cool bug. Besides, I imagine <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">Gearbox has a lot more to fix in <em>Borderlands 4</em></a> right now, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">horrible console performance problems</a>, and isn’t too concerned about a silly super jump bug.</p>

              <p>Our first trailer for the next <em>Star Wars</em> movie <a href="https://kotaku.com/mandalorian-grogu-trailer-disney-boycott-2000627542">has arrived</a>&nbsp;and it looks incredibly forgettable. Fans are picking apart a 90-second clip of <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em> and mourning the franchise’s loss of visual identity. Is Disney’s take on the sci-fi galaxy far, far away cooked, or is this just how a movie about a dude in a helmet and a green puppet is going to look in the year 2025?</p> <p>Is the <em>Mandalorian and</em> <em>Grogu</em> trailer bad-looking? Yes. Is that sort of what I expected from the post-Disney+ entertainment industrial complex in the age of streaming? Also yes. Does any of this matter? Not to me. I did not stick around through three increasingly mediocre seasons of <em>The Mandalorian</em> for the second coming of Akira Kurosawa. I am coming to the movie to see some weird-looking aliens, goofy robots, and flashy lasers blow some stuff up. Even by those standards the teaser was a C minus, but the latest example of <em>Star Wars</em> mediocrity has some fans fully crashing out.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don’t want to sound negative but this trailer makes the movie feel more like a filler episode of the TV show.

My favorite, though, is this summary: “50% of the comments: Jimmy Kimmel and the Empire, 49.9% of the comments: This Looks Like Season 4, 0.01%: Somehow Razor Crest returned!” Folks on Reddit are taking things more in stride. “Kinda looks like it’s just supposed to be fun, which I totally dig,” reads <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheMandalorianTV/comments/1nnlzpw/the_mandalorian_and_grogu_official_trailer/">the top reaction</a>. “Like if it’s just a movie length episode I’m down with that.”</p>

 <p>That is about what I expected as well. I think it’s partly a testament to how much the Disney <em>Star Wars</em> shows, even when they’re bad, have looked like big-budget productions that <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em> movie just looks like a feature-length episode. I also think people are being a bit dramatic in rushing to judge a teaser for a film about back-bench characters who didn’t exist until just a few years ago against the most iconic stills across decades of original movies. It also feels like people have forgotten that Jon Favreau is directing.</p> <p>What are the most memorable shots that come to mind from <em>Elf</em>, <em>Zathura: A Space Adventure</em>, and <em>Cowboys &amp; Aliens</em>? I’ll wait. He’s not that type of director. The most visually arresting 60 seconds of footage he ever recorded was himself cooking a grilled cheese in <em>Chef</em>. He brings other virtues to his filmmaking, most of which are probably hard to get across in a 90-second teaser where almost no one talks. That is not a defense of <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em>, but it’s a point worth keeping in mind when judging the pre-release marketing for a movie about a stoic cowboy and his green muppet baby that’s literally called <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu</em><em>.&nbsp;</em></p>
