              <p>Three days ago, I was talking about how sometimes good things happen, like HBO’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661">bunk-ass live-action <em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>series</a> looking&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-hbo-show-season-4-final-catherine-ohara-2000665018">likely to end in three seasons</a> rather than four. Well, the monkey’s paw didn’t just curl, it rolled in upon itself with an intensity great enough to open a portal to a much, much worse dimension. Craig Mazin, whio serves as showrunner on the post-apocalyptic adaptation, isn’t done at HBO; he’s now apparently working on a <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate</em></a> series that will continue the story of Larian Studios’ RPG. Just shoot me, HBO.</p> <p><em><a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/baldurs-gate-3-tv-show-craig-mazin-hbo-1236710583/">Deadline</a>&nbsp;</em>reports that Mazin is working alongside Hasbro to create a continuation of the&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3&nbsp;</em>story that will include both new characters and some returning ones from the game. You know, the ones whose fates you could have greatly influenced with your decisions in ways too drastic for the writers to have any wiggle room in making sweeping choices for them? I already don’t trust Mazin with characters when he’s following the source material’s script, much less continuing their stories beyond the credits. According to&nbsp;<em>Deadline</em>‘s story, Mazin has full creative control. Call me Gale Dekarios of Waterdeep the way I could explode right now.</p>

 <p>“After putting nearly 1000 hours into the incredible world of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, it is a dream come true to be able to continue the story that Larian and Wizards of The Coast created,” Mazin said in a statement to <em>Deadline</em>. “I am a devoted fan of <em>D&amp;D</em> and the brilliant way that Swen Vincke and his gifted team adapted it. I can’t wait to help bring <em>Baldur’s Gate</em> and all of its incredible characters to life with as much respect and love as we can, and I’m deeply grateful to Gabe Marano and his team at Hasbro for entrusting me with this incredibly important property.”</p> <p>Thanks, I hate it. And I’ll inevitably be putting my boxing gloves on once more to enter the ring when it comes out like I did for <em>The Last of Us</em>.</p>
