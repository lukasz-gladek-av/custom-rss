              <p>The original PlayStation hit U.S. shores <a href="https://kotaku.com/30-playstation-1-games-well-never-forget-1851713931">30 years ago today,</a> helping usher in a disc-based gaming revolution that reshaped the industry. Four new consoles and lots of hardware iterations later, PlayStation is the undisputed winner in the high-end console gaming space. What were the top-selling games that helped it get there? A newly released list of the top all-time performers across all PlayStation platformers in the States tells part of the story, and it’s a pretty depressing one.</p> <p>Circana gaming research director Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lyftys4rhk2u">released the list</a> of the top 20 games across PlayStation’s history in the U.S. by unit sales to commemorate the PS1’s birthday. Here they are:</p> <ol> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em></li> <li><em>Minecraft</em></li> <li><em>Red Dead Redemption II</em></li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019)</em></li> <li><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</em></li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022)</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></li> <li><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em></li> <li><em>The Last of Us God of War (2018)</em></li> <li><em>God of War (2018)</em></li> <li><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops</em></li> <li><em>Rainbow Six: Siege</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops II</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: WWII</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4</em></li> </ol> <p>The top spots aren’t shocking. <em>GTA 5</em> and <em>Minecraft</em> are the two best-selling game ever across any platform. <em>Red Dead Redemption II</em> is the fifth-best. Sony’s critically acclaimed first-party blockbusters also rank highly. And then it’s just a sea of <em>Call of Duty</em>. <em>Modern Warfare</em>, <em>Black Ops</em>, good ones, bad ones, it doesn’t matter, they all rank, smothering any greater sense of the breadth, variety, and whimsy of the games released on PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, and PS5 over the years.</p>

 <p>“Man, this list makes me sad,” <em>Digital Foundry</em>‘s John Linneman <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dark1x.bsky.social/post/3lyg7tgphcc2a">opined</a>. “Most people playing games really only play the same few titles huh.” Big sigh. Much agree. Cultural PlayStation juggernauts that didn’t make the list include but are not limited to: <em>WipeOut</em>, <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em>, <em>Tekken 3</em>, <em>Street Fighter 4</em>, <em>Dark Souls</em>, <em>Nier: Automata</em>, <em>The Witcher 3</em>, <em>Persona 5</em>, and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</p> <p>Even now, annualized <em>Call of Duty</em> sequels remain yearly best-sellers, cannibalizing much of the remaining market for big-budget console releases. I keep waiting for the wheels to fall off the Activision military shooter machine, not because the games are terrible or I want anyone to lose their jobs but because I think we have enough <em>Call of Duty</em> to last us another quarter century and I bet all of those developers could make new, original stuff that’s really cool, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This year’s <em>The Edge of Fate</em> is arguably one of <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-edge-fate-matterspark-kelper-metroid-ball-1851786415">worst expansions ever</a>. Some great story beats and cool moments could not salvage one of the most disappointing loot grinds in the history of the game. Less than two months since launching, Steam concurrent numbers for Bungie’s MMO shooter have fallen off a cliff to all-time lows. On Tuesday the Sony-owned studio streamed a deep-dive into what feels like <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s last chance for a major rebound: the <em>Star Wars</em>-themed expansion <em>Renegades</em>.</p> <p>Out December 2, the first crossover-themed campaign in the live service game’s history was originally teased back in May. Fans had been wondering just how deep the collaboration would go. Would it just incorporate <em>Star Wars</em> motifs into <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s world, or be a full-on mash-up that would bleed more deeply between the disparate science fictions? The answer is somewhere in the middle.</p> <p>“<em>Renegades&nbsp;</em>merges&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>’s distinctive storytelling and gameplay with themes and elements drawn from the iconic sci-fi franchise,” Bungie wrote in its announcement. In practice this seems to mean a sci-fi Western with ties to deep <em>Destiny 2</em> lore that features lightsabers, AT-ST walkers, and lots of <em>Star Wars</em> sound effects, if for no other reason than it all sounds really cool. Also an X-Wing jumpship that is literally just an X-Wing.</p>

  <p><em>Destiny 2: Renegades</em> will revolve around rising through the ranks of the criminal underworld in a Mos Eisley-like outpost called Tharsis as players confront a new Cabal faction called the Barant Imperium. You’ll perform jobs for competing syndicates to curry favor and unlock new gear and options as the difficulty, rewards, and chaos keep escalating. Following the Drifter’s lead and going rogue, <em>Renegades</em> will ultimately try to tie things back to the mystery of The Nine that kicked off <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s current Year of Prophecy.</p> <p>There’s a lot of ideas that sound interesting, and fun mechanics like a very <em>Helldivers 2</em>-coded option to call down ammo crate drop pods that kill enemies in the process. And there’s also a lot of <em>Star Wars</em> stuff like the lightsaber, which is actually a new weapon called the Praxic Blade that players will collect and customize the parts for across the <em>Renegades</em> campaign and the upcoming dungeon. There will be different colors and even the ability to deflect incoming fire back at enemies like in the movies.</p>

 <p>Will all of this fit together in a way that feels exciting and natural and not like a licensed cash-grab that only further dilutes the mystery and mystique around the <em>Destiny 2</em> universe? I have my doubts. Would I like a mercenary-themed <em>Destiny 2</em> campaign about navigating competing factions and featuring non-linear mission progressions? Absolutely. Do I want to play a <em>Star Wars</em> MMO that functions like a shooter? Hell yeah. Do I want those things thrown into a blender? At this point, definitely not. Hopefully <em>Renegades</em> can prove me wrong.</p> <h2>Fixing <em>Destiny 2</em> starts with<em> <span id="m_4909743708046745216docs-internal-guid-c14c8924-7fff-f225-be60-f8ee97ab0814">Ash and Iron </span></em></h2> <p>Today’s mini-showcase was also the latest milestone on Bungie’s “fix <em>Destiny 2</em>” tour which continues with the free <em>Ash and Iron</em> update. It brings back the <span id="m_4909743708046745216docs-internal-guid-c14c8924-7fff-f225-be60-f8ee97ab0814">Plaguelands from the original </span><em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>and adds a new three-player activity called Reclaim, about golden age tech and the Vex. There’s lots of new gear, more lore drops around Maya, and an event coming later called Call to Arms that will see Devrim Kay finally leave his European Deadzone bell tower. There’s a new exotic mission coming as well with Iron Banner, Festival of the Lost, and more that will be detailed in an upcoming roadmap.</p>

 <p>More important are the fixes Bungie is promising leading up to <em>Renegades</em> in December. The studio wants to make the current power climb faster and improve overall rewards from activities. There will be upcoming buffs for supers and subclasses, alongside a pause on nerfs and balance changes as Bungie tries to right the ship. The “road to <em>Renegades</em>” will begin with making the loot chase more rewarding across the entire game, especially in raids and dungeons and for fireteams of three taking on the hardest activities. The proof will be in how that actually gets implemented, though.</p> <p>Bungie is still trying to tinker around the edges of its new systems implemented in <em>The Edge of Fate</em>. It could be an improvement, or it could lead to even more convoluted overlapping systems that foster bad incentives and boring activity loops. <em>Destiny 2</em> is at the point where it needs drastic overhauls that make it more fun but also much simpler. With 10 years of storytelling wrapped after last year’s <em>The Final Shape</em> expansion, it feels like <em>Destiny 2</em> needs to be content with becoming a casual session-based game rather than a weekly second job and build from there. There’s plenty of interesting stuff coming down the road, but I’m not yet convinced hitting the <em>Star Wars</em> button will be enough.</p>

              <p><span>The </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-original-stitch-sitting-cuties-merch-center-1850507835"><span>Sitting Cuties plush line</span></a><span> is one of the smartest initiatives The Pokémon Company has ever put into motion. There are over 1000 pocket monsters now, and odds are that each of them is somebody’s favorite. The series’ most popular critters, like mascots Pikachu and Eevee, tend to take up most of the company’s merchandise, so the Sitting Cuties plushes ensure that everyone has at least one piece of merchandise for even the most obscure little guy by creating a sitting plush of each Pokémon. They’ve been released in waves over the past seven years in order by generation. Today, The Pokémon Company released the Alolan line, meaning we’re now seven out of nine generations in. At this rate, there will be a Sitting Cutie for every Pokémon in the next couple of years. However, this good news also comes with some bad news: TPC is sticking with the inflated price.</span></p> <p><span>The Alolan Sitting Cuties are </span><a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/category/sitting-cuties"><span>available to order on the Pokémon Center website</span></a><span>, but they run you $16.99. These plushes were notable for being really affordable back in the day, with the original price being $10.99, but the price jumped in 2023. You can still find old plushes for the original price, but they’re almost all marked as sold out. If you can get past the sticker shock, the Alolan Sitting Cuties are pretty cool, but it’s a much harder sell to get people to buy multiple plushes in each drop, as the cost adds up much more quickly.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Generation VII has some of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s most elaborate designs, and the Sitting Cuties squish them into a tiny, chibi form that can sit on your desk or shelf, so it’s a challenge to get massive creatures like the Ultra Beasts to fit the visual identity of the line. Nevertheless, they’re still pulling it off. From a design standpoint, it’s interesting to observe how the Sitting Cuties manage to condense these bigger monsters into something that is roughly the same size as Pikachu. If you want to see some of the highlights, click through. Otherwise, try to get your Alolan fave before they sell out or some </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-world-championship-merchandise-scalper-reseller-2000617744"><span>scalping asshole</span></a><span> grabs them.</span></p>
