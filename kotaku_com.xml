Instead, it’s slowly built up a decently-sized library of first- and third-party retro games from across multiple console libraries. However, subscribers in Japan will be losing a retro game in March, even if they already downloaded it. </p><p>On February 27, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000023175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000023175" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Japan quietly announced</a></span>  that Super Famicon game <em>Super Formation Soccer </em>will be removed from the Japan’s Nintendo Switch Online service on March 28.</p><p>Nintendo confirmed that even players who have already downloaded and installed the game on their Switch consoles will no longer be able to play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Soccer&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Super_Soccer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">S<em>uper Formation Soccer</em></a></span> after March 28. </p><p>At the moment it appears that this title is only being removed from Nintendo Switch Online in Japan. In America the game was released as <em>Super Soccer </em>for the SNES. So far Nintendo hasn’t announced plans to remove this version from  NSO’s classic catalog over here. That might be because while <em>Super Formation Soccer </em>was published by Spike Chunsoft in Japan, worldwide the game was published by Nintendo. So it would appear that whatever deal was in place to license the game is expiring soon in Japan, but that deal likely doesn’t apply in regions where<em> Super Soccer </em>was published by Nintendo itself.</p><p>While I doubt there was a giant audience for <em>Super Soccer </em>on Nintendo Switch, it’s still bad news to see a game removed from the classic catalog. </p><p>Although games are removed from Game Pass and PS Plus all the time, people can still buy those games digitally. With Nintendo, these games are locked behind the NSO subscription service and once removed, you can no longer play them on Switch. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-virtual-console-switch-online-classic-retro-1851760770?_gl=1*1dotjpl*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDc3NjIzNy4yMTguMS4xNzQwNzc3NDIwLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-virtual-console-switch-online-classic-retro-1851760770?_gl=1*1dotjpl*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDc3NjIzNy4yMTguMS4xNzQwNzc3NDIwLjYwLjAuMA..">Just another good reason why Nintendo needs to bring back the Virtual Console for Switch 2</a></span>. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It can also look like greyscale goop. There are reasons for this, and ways to try and get around it. Here are the settings I recommend changing immediately, not just for a pretty <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> experience, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-steam-framerate-1851766992?_gl=1*1pxmrbl*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDc2OTk4NS41My4xLjE3NDA3NzQ1MTEuNS4wLjA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-steam-framerate-1851766992?_gl=1*1pxmrbl*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDc2OTk4NS41My4xLjE3NDA3NzQ1MTEuNS4wLjA.">but also a better one overall</a></span> (these recommendations are primarily for playing on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S). </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h686557"><a id=""></a>Turn that brightness slider down to 0</h2><p>Seriously, it’ll be all right, I promise. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is normally very bright and dull looking. Games always ask you to calibrate this before playing by making you play a little watermark-balancing mini-game, but I found that baseline to be wildly over-tuned. Turning the first two brightness sliders all the way down and keeping the third slider where it would normally be helped up the contrast for me and cut down on the sludge graphics, at least a little bit. </p><h2 id="h686558"><a id=""></a>Juice that saturation on your display</h2><p>This setting isn’t in the game but specific to whatever display you’re using. I jacked up the saturation and contrast to try and bring out more definition and color and that also helped. Now, if you like <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>’ more washed-out look, then by all means embrace it. But these are two things you can do to help mitigate it if you choose. The game also looks way better overall <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ethangach/status/1895554770813010257&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1895554770813010257" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">during the world’s daytime and when there aren’t storms</a></span>, so another hack is to just try to prioritize hunting during those times (unfortunately certain beasts only emerge when it’s ugly out). </p><h2 id="h686559"><a id=""></a>Turn off motion blur</h2><p>If you play a lot of games you probably instinctively do this already. If not, here’s your perennial reminder to toggle motion blur off so the game looks sharper and less blurry during combat. </p><h2 id="h686560"><a id=""></a>Turn on Felyne Language</h2><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> defaults to your Palico pals speaking in English, but you can change it so they speak in their native cat tongue instead. This way they’ll meow and purr at you during combat and exploration but you can still understand what they’re saying thanks to subtitles. It makes the experience much more immersive. Also yay cats!</p><h2 id="h686561"><a id=""></a>Boost the field of view</h2><p>Hunting monsters is hard when they’re taking up the whole screen and you can barely glimpse the read of the battlefield. You can dial back the camera to show you more of the world by bumping up the camera distance up. There are definitely times when it can be fun and cinematic to have things more zoomed in, but on the whole the wider lens helps a lot. </p><h2 id="h686562"><a id=""></a>Just say no to Seikret auto explore</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-tips-guides-items-pause-weapon-1851766658&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-tips-guides-items-pause-weapon-1851766658">The Seikret is amazing</a></span> but also loves to wonder off on its own when you don’t have a next objective selected. This default for the mount to auto explore the area can be turned off so you’re not constantly fighting it or confused if it’s actually taking you where you want to go or just randomly wandering around for no reason. </p><h2 id="h686563"><a id=""></a>Turn off some of the UI</h2><p>Exactly how immersive do you want to make <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>? That’s a question every player has to answer for themselves. Once you have the controls down pat, especially the quick commands, you can get away with very little onscreen help. But in the beginning I recommend at the very least turning off the control scheme help in the top right corner. You’d think it would disappear on its own after the tutorial but it doesn’t. Once you have your radial dial commands figured out, you can turn the item bag bar off too. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
