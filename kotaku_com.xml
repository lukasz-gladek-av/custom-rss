              <p>Earbuds and headphones are one of the most crowded markets there is. It can be hard to parse through what’s good, especially diving deeper then just the big names like Apple and Samsung. If you’re looking for something with a secure-fit that’s good for working out, with rich sound, and not too expensive, then direct your attention to the AeroFit 2. These are produced by Soundcore, a subsidiary brand of Anker, and are usually priced at $130.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4052/"> However, right now you can get them on sale for $30 off. The 23% discount brings them down to an even $100 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>The AeroFit 2 use an open-ear design that are made for all-day comfort. They’re comprised of soft materials that are non-invasive and curve around your ear. The hook shape allows them to be tailored to the vast majority of ear shapes and sizes out there. The actually speaker part is on a swivel so it can be positioned where it’s gripping perfectly on your ear, securely in place. So if you’re taking these out for a run, you can stay confident they are not going anywhere.</p>

The Soundcore AeroFit 2 support 100 languages and can translate what you’re hearing on the fly with high accuracy. Reliably travel abroad without even knowing the local language you may need to make sure you update the firmware to its latest version when you take it out of the box.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Another day in the 21st century, another fresh round of frustration and accusations that a company is using artificial intelligence to replace the labor of human beings. This time around, Françoise Cadol, Lara Croft’s French voice actress as heard in the localized version of <i>Tomb Raider IV – VI</i>, has issued a legal notice to Aspyr Media, which is <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-includes-direct-jab-joke-gearbox-former-owner-embracer-bluff-2000624815">owned by the Embracer Group</a>, over accusations that AI was used to touch up her performances.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-includes-direct-jab-joke-gearbox-former-owner-embracer-bluff-2000624815"><i>Borderlands 4</i> Seems To Include A Direct Jab At Gearbox’s Former Owner Embracer</a></p> <p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/french-tomb-raider-actress-takes-legal-action-against-aspyr-for-allegedly-replicating-her-voice-with-ai"><i>Game Developer</i></a>, Cadol, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/bsmart_tv/reel/DGQROP5hAwD/">an outspoken critic of AI</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DIyPRKusIg_/">member of the French anti-AI “Touch pas à ma VF” movement</a>, asserts that the alleged AI use came across her radar in August, following a patch pushed by developer Aspyr to the <i>Tomb Raider</i> collection. These patch notes mention restored voice-overs, tweaks to volume, and other audio adjustments that, ordinarily, wouldn’t raise much concern, especially as the Brazilian Portuguese localization is the only version that the notes specifically mention. However, attentive fans spotted some unusual affectations in Cadol’s recorded performance, bringing the concern to her attention. A video from French YouTuber Kingdom of Stott <a href="https://youtu.be/y8YsbC-d0ro?t=577">documents the changes here</a>:</p>

  <p>Starting right around 9:56, you can hear the original performance from Cadol, followed by the alleged AI version (the video is in French, so auto-translate captions help here for some of us). Despite failing French a number of times, I can recognize a clear difference in these two performances, as can many fans in the comments of this very video. Is it proof of AI use? Cadol seems to think so, describing the difference as “metallic” (via Google Translate) to <a href="https://www.leparisien.fr/culture-loisirs/cinema/cest-une-trahison-quand-lia-vole-la-voix-francaise-dangelina-jolie-pour-tomb-raider-10-09-2025-63HIGMNMEZBSFLELCKNN4S5I2M.php">French publication <i>Le Parisien</i></a>. And <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2525380/Tomb_Raider_IVVI_Remastered/">some recent negative reviews on the game’s Steam page</a> are also accusing the developer of pushing AI into the game. Having worked with audio for many years myself, I can think of at least half-a-dozen other things that aren’t AI that could make the audio kinda sorta sound like this, but there’s still an undeniable rigidity that screams AI and, well, look at the times we live in.</p> <p><i>Kotaku</i> has reached out to Aspyr Media for comment.</p> <p>The same video also mentions that fans have speculated AI was used in newly added loading screens a bit earlier. I’m more skeptical of that claim, but AI is getting better at hiding its trademark oddities. (Remember when it couldn’t render fingers well?)</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-elite-level-hp-laptop-bundle-64gb-ram-2tb-ssd-drops-again-overnight-72-off-and-likely-as-low-as-it-gets-2000624810</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon is not messing around with this new laptop deal, which is only fitting because it’s on a laptop that also does not mess around. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3724/">You can get a fully loaded 17-inch HP Business Laptop with a 12-core Intel Ultra 7 255U processor, supercharged AI power, and 2TB of storage for a 72%-off price of $1,119 — that’s a savings of over $2,800</a>.</p>
<p>Along with this enormously powerful HP touchscreen laptop comes a $200 accessories package including a wireless mouse, USB hub, 128GB flash drive, and 7-in-1 cleaning kit. For additional value, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/windows-11-pro">Windows 11 Pro</a> is preinstalled, and the 12 TOPS (Trillions of Operations Per Second) of AI computational power combined with Microsoft Copilot creates a peak AI device.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3724/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Terrific Touchscreen</h2>
<p>The generously proportioned 17.3-inch touchscreen of this business laptop is not only a perfect interactive device giving the user a rapid-reaction tablet-like experience, but it’s a vivid HD+ (1600 x 900 resolution) display with anti-glare treatment and 250 nits of brightness. The keyboard is also backlit for better accessibility, and the Copilot key is present for one-touch deployment of the powerful AI features.</p>
<p>Whatever you have on that high-performing screen — anything from multiple windows of complex spreadsheets to whatever TV show or movie you’re streaming — will come through without any hesitation or glitching. That’s because the 12-core Intel Ultra 7 255U processor is an absolute beast, able to hit speeds of up to 5.2GHz and bolstered by a maxed-out <strong>64GB of RAM</strong>. The huge<strong> 2TB SSD</strong> reads and writes data with impressive speed, and the huge amount of storage and memory combined with the elite processor makes this HP laptop virtually future-proofed.</p>



<h2>All the Connections</h2>
<p>The Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.4 hookups are just the tip of the connectivity spear. This HP laptop has a 720p HD webcam with a privacy shutter built in, and there are two USB-A, one USB-C, and an HDMI 1.4b port at the ready should you want to connect parallel accessories, including the 128GB USB flash drive and 7-in-1 USB hub that come free with this laptop. The pre-tuned stereo speakers complete this truly impressive package.</p>
<p>While the $4,000 retail price for this 17.3-inch HP Business Laptop with Windows 11 Pro and accessories bundle is a little bloated, to say the least, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3724/">the huge 72% Amazon price cut lands it at an exceptionally competitive $1,119</a>. With the powerful Intel processor, huge cache of memory and storage, and hypercharged AI engine, this will be your everyday productivity laptop for years to come.</p>

              <p><span>Sucker Punch Productions </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-sly-cooper-titanfall-splinter-cell-left-4-dead-1851506835"><span>hasn’t made a </span><i><span>Sly Cooper </span></i><span>game in 20 years</span></a><span>. The last time the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sony-ps5-state-of-play-1851786081"><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i></a> <span>developer put together an elaborate heist in the stealth platformer series was 2005’s </span><i><span>Sly 3: Honor Among Thieves </span></i><span>on the PlayStation 2. If that had been the Cooper Gang’s last hurrah, I would be more than happy to leave the anthropomorphic kleptomaniac crew in the PS2 days and play the old games on my Vita every few years. However, Sanzaru Games brought the series back in 2013 with the PS3 game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sly-cooper-thieves-in-time-the-kotaku-review-5981954"><i><span>Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time</span></i></a><span>, and it ended on a devastating cliffhanger, stranding the titular thief in Ancient Egypt thanks to some time travel shenanigans. Sanzaru intended to resolve this with a DLC mission, but Sony </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tbwTiCn16k&amp;t=3215s"><span>pulled the plug</span></a><span> on that, and the studio was acquired by Meta in 2020. So now, one of PlayStation’s mascots has been in time travel limbo for over a decade, with no sign of a fifth game or DLC in sight. Could Sucker Punch go back and make a new game, saving its beloved thief from a fate worse than death? Nope. Apparently, the studio is just not interested in going back.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ffOTS1CkZVg"><i><span>Minnmax</span></i></a> <span>had </span><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i><span> co-creative director Nate Fox on its show for 125 rapid-fire questions. Naturally, they talked a lot about the upcoming samurai game, joked about the relief of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-ghost-yotei-cyberpunk-2-keanu-leak-2000624435"><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6</span></i><span> getting delayed</span></a><span>, and discussed a hypothetical VR game concept set in the </span><i><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></i><span> world. At roughly the 7:40 mark, </span><i><span>Minnmax</span></i><span> asks Fox what percentage of the studio would be enthused about working on a fifth </span><i><span>Sly Cooper</span></i><span> game. Fox says “10 percent” of the Bellevue studio would be excited. Interviewer Ben Hanson expresses shock at the low number, and Fox says, “It’s been a long time, Ben, since </span><i><span>Sly Cooper</span></i><span>‘s come out.”</span></p>  <p><span>Yeah Nate, it has been a long time. The series just celebrated its 20th anniversary with a series of exclusive merchandise (all of which I bought), and Sly has spent more than half of those years now stranded out of time because Sony left him there. Look, I’m not picky. I just want Sony to get </span><i><span>any Sly Cooper </span></i><span>project off the ground that could potentially save my raccoon son from this terrible fate, I don’t need it to be </span><i><span>Sly Cooper 5</span></i><span>. In the years since </span><i><span>Thieves in Time</span></i><span>, Sony has greenlit and then </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/first-look-at-the-sly-cooper-movie-1510540922"><span>canceled an animated film</span></a><span>, and the </span><a href="https://slycooper.fandom.com/wiki/Sly_Cooper_(TV_series)"><span>animated series</span></a><span> that was in development at Technicolor Animation Productions has vanished without a trace. Hell, Sony could make a short comic series about the rescue mission to get him back to the present day, and I’d shut the fuck up. You will never hear me ask for a fifth </span><i><span>Sly Cooper </span></i><span>game again.</span></p> <p><span>While Sly may not be getting his own game anytime soon, the character continues to make appearances in PlayStation crossover games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150"><i><span>Astro Bot</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-the-kotaku-review-1847047303"><i><span>Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart</span></i></a><span>. Should I just consider him showing up in </span><i><span>Rift Apart </span></i><span>as a sign that Ratchet saved him from time travel purgatory?</span></p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>The streaming wars are over and with them the era of cheap, <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-ps-plus-disney-netflix-spotify-price-cancel-1850848468">buffet-style content delivery systems</a> is coming to an end. Prices are getting jacked up. Subscribers are getting nickel-and-dimed. Warner Bros. Discovery CEO David Zaslav is here to promise you that HBO Max will be doing this too.</p> <p>“We haven’t been pushing on the password sharing and the economics yet,” the cosmic-brained exec told other rich people at the Goldman Sachs Communacopia and Technology conference this week, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/why-hbo-max-password-sharing-crackdown-1236514152/">per <em>Variety</em></a>. “People are really starting to love HBO Max. That’s the key. We want them to fall in love with our content, with our series, with the differentiated offering outside the U.S. and then over time, it’s a little tricky, with the password sharing, we’re going to begin to push on that.”</p> <p>You can tell Zaslav loves his job because he talks about locating the optimal pricing strategy for other people’s creative output like he’s searching for the G-spot on a P&amp;L spreadsheet. Warner Bros. announced last month that it would soon start aggressively monitoring HBO subscribers’ accounts to make sure they weren’t letting friends and family mooch off them. But the password sharing crackdown isn’t the only thing coming to the home of <em>The Last Of Us</em> and<em> Peacemaker</em>.</p>

 <p>He continued, “I think our ability to raise price as people become more and more in love with the quality that we have and the series that we have and the offering that we have will have a real ability because I think the pricing across the board—not only is there too many players, in order to stay alive, a lot of the players have just decided to drop prices aggressively.”</p> <p>HBO Max’s first major price hike came in 2023 when the main plan <a href="https://www.avclub.com/hbo-max-subscription-price-increase-1849980303">went from&nbsp;$15 to $16 a month</a>. The following year prices went up again as the plans splintered, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/max-price-increase-hike-1236024561/">with the Ultimate tier rising to $21 a month</a>. HBO became HBO Max in 2020, then just Max in 2023, and then went back to HBO Max earlier this year. During that same period Zaslav saw the disastrous merger of Warner Bros. and Discovery that led to tons of debt and massive gutting of content at, among other places, HBO. Now Warner Bros. and Discovery will split up again by April 2026 as the stock price hovers below $20, down from a peak in 2021 of over $70.</p>

 <p>Big “my job here is done” energy from the guy awarded $50 million last year in total compensation for shuffling logos around on a whiteboard. Except we now know his job won’t truly be done until he jacks up HBO prices a few more times. Next year sees the arrival of a new <em>Game of Thrones</em> spin-off,<em> A</em> <em>Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</em>, and the <em>Green Lantern</em> detective show, followed by the <em>Harry Potter</em> reboot in 2027.</p> <p>“I think we want a good deal for consumers,” Zaslav said this week, “but I think over time, there’s real opportunity, particularly for us, in that quality area, to raise price.”</p>
