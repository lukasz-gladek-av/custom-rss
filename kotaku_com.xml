I love those guys. </p><p>The big focus in this new trailer, besides showing off a ton of unique environments that are just water and jungle, is on introducing a new Navi clan. However, this new group of blue cat people isn’t as nice and kind as the groups we’ve seen before. This is the dangerous Ash Clan, who are led by Varang, played by Oona Chaplin, and who use fire as their main weapon. They don’t seem interested in teaming up with Jake and his band of merry aliens, leading to war between the Navi while the humans continue to invade the planet. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-impressions-review-ubisoft-1851077773&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-impressions-review-ubisoft-1851077773">I like the <em>Avatar </em>movies (and games)</a></span> quite a bit, but I still can’t tell you who most of the CG alien people in this movie are or what they are trying to do.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> features a massive skill tree filled with nodes to invest in, which can passively increase your stats, improve your special attacks, or even upgrade how many healing charges you get from your Manna Vase. Best of all, every skill you buy can be refunded with a simple press of a button, meaning you can experiment to your heart’s content with different builds and strategies. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195922" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Is Alan Wake Worth Playing Before Its Sequel? | Total Recall" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="390" data-playlist="195922,196539,196055" data-current="195922"><div><p>Is Alan Wake Worth Playing Before Its Sequel? | Total Recall</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21438.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>While you may want to try new things as you work your way through the game, you’ll be more limited in the opening hours of the game. And that’s why I think you’ll definitely want to unlock the early skills below so you’ll be prepared for everything <em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> is going to throw at you.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> These skills are easily bought during the opening hours of the game when you have a limited set of weapons. As such, I chose to focus on the Longsword skill tree due to its strong potential for stunning enemies and dealing reasonably fast damage compared to heavier weapons you may discover in the first few areas. If you find that you prefer a different weapon a few hours into the game, rest assured there are comparable skills early in their skill trees, too. </p><h2 id="h157887"><a id=""></a>Skyborn Call I</h2><p>Skyborn Call I is the node located directly to the left of Illusive, which is unlocked by default. </p><p>This skill will increase your maximum Skyborn Might charges by one. Since Skyborn Might is among the most important parts of your kit, you’ll want to grab this one as soon as possible. With more Skyborn Might at your disposal, you can use magic more often (as well as wield stronger spells) or unleash multiple powerful melee skills in a row.</p><h2 id="h157888"><a id=""></a>Manna Capacity &amp; Manna Potency</h2><p>Manna Capacity and Manna Potency nodes are located directly above and below Skyborn Call I, respectively. </p><p>These skills do exactly what you’d expect: increase your Manna Vase’s number of uses and healing power. But they don’t require Red Mercury Essence to purchase. Instead, you’ll need special items found while exploring: Forgotten Remembrance and Lost Remains. You can find quite a few of these throughout your adventure, but I pointed out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-skills-birds-red-mercury-mana-1851787126&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-skills-birds-red-mercury-mana-1851787126">two early locations in our beginning tips guide</a></span>.

Since this combo is quick and easy to pull off, it makes for an excellent early pickup to ensure that you can keep stacks of Skyborn Might rolling in consistently. You’ll be especially happy to have this once you combine it with the skill below.</p><h2 id="h157890"><a id=""></a>Windforce</h2><p>Windforce is a node located in the Longsword tree purchaseable after buying Sword Saint and two Strength upgrades.</p><p>This skill allows you to use a charged heavy attack much more quickly if you have a stack of Skyborn Might. Thanks to Sword Saint helping you consistently build stacks alongside any you get from dodging well, you can pull off these charged heavy attacks with frequency. Doing so will let you stun enemies for critical attacks more quickly, with it being especially effective against small-to-medium-sized human foes. </p><h2 id="h157891"><a id=""></a>Strong Blade</h2><p>Strong Blade nodes are located in the Longsword tree that can be found on either side of Windforce after buying an adjacent node (either Vitality or Endurance).</p><figure id="" data-id="d25f3ef41d5a2a8134656a17e0c54f5b" data-recommend-id="image://d25f3ef41d5a2a8134656a17e0c54f5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of an item menu shows a red feather." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of an item menu shows a red feather." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Leenzee / Billy Givens / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d25f3ef41d5a2a8134656a17e0c54f5b" data-recommend-id="image://d25f3ef41d5a2a8134656a17e0c54f5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of an item menu shows a red feather." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Regardless of which node you choose, this skill will level up the mastery of the Longsword and increase its damage. But it doesn’t require Red Mercury Essence to purchase. Instead, you’ll need Faint Red Feathers, which you’ll find by exploring thoroughly and defeating specific enemies. One example is a little creature in a jar that spits poison at you. They’re often found down optional pathways or lurking in corners among debris. </p><p>You’ll find more Strong Blade nodes throughout the skill tree as well, each offering three tiers of upgrades (meaning three upgrades per node), so you’ll get more chances to increase the damage of your weapon as you venture further into the game. As you level these higher, however, you’ll need more advanced upgrade materials (feathers). </p><hr><p><br><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series S/X, and Windows PCs.  </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/wuchang-longsword-skills-strong-blade-windforce-1851787137]]></content:encoded>

The company is hiring for a senior director of multiplatform and account management, which is a fancy way of saying someone who will help Sony profit from bringing its games to more storefronts. This person will be in charge of “global commercial strategy for PlayStation Studios software titles across all digital platforms beyond PlayStation hardware, including Steam, Epic Games Store, Xbox, Nintendo, and mobile.”</p><p>Fans are already treating this as a window into Sony’s thinking moving forward, including the possibility of it bringing more of its own first-party exclusives to other platforms, something that seemed unthinkable even just a few months ago. The job listing for the multiplatform leadership role goes on to say, “Oversee the out-of-year (mid-range) commercial strategy for PlayStation Studios titles across all non-PlayStation platforms, driving long-term revenue growth and audience reach.” It also lists direct reports that include people overseeing sales on both Xbox &amp; PC.</p><p>Sony’s multiplatform approach began small with bringing big single-player exclusives like <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> and<em> Days Gone </em>to PC years after they were out on console. <em>MLB: The Show</em> is also on Xbox Series X/S and Switch, though it’s published by MLB on those platforms. Upcoming Bungie shooter<em> Marathon</em> is also multiplatform. Then last fall, Sony announced the <em>Horizon </em>Lego spin-off, <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em>, for both PS5 and Switch.

The new job listing, however, suggests things won’t stop there, and that this may be a reaction to more than just Microsoft bailing on the hardware race. </p><p>The tech giant has been on an accelerated course due to the struggling sales of Xbox this generation.

A year later, <em>Forza Horizon 5 </em>has made the jump, and <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> will bring the Locust-chain-sawing  shooter franchise to Sony’s platform almost 20 years after it became synonymous with Xbox. What’s more, monthly sales charts show these ported exclusives, including <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, are selling great on its long-time rival’s platform. </p><p>One way to view rumblings that Sony will look to bring more of its games to other platforms is as a direct reaction to Microsoft essentially throwing in the towel on exclusivity. But ballooning blockbuster development budgets and stagnating console sales—PS5 isn’t surging past PS4, thanks to lost ground by Xbox—suggests Sony is looking for more ways to profit off its games regardless of what competitors do. <em>Helldivers 2</em> makes it easy to draw the current line at just multiplayer live service games, but if Sony really does see Xbox as becoming indistinguishable from a gaming PC in the future (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000">complete with access to Steam</a></span>), it’s not hard to see it replicating its single-player blockbuster strategy on Xbox as well.</p><figure id="" data-id="8f2e1b334f891fdb36d4956d7f66c905" data-recommend-id="image://8f2e1b334f891fdb36d4956d7f66c905" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Helldivers fight below Xbox logos.

But another might simply be that people don’t buy consoles that way anymore. “People who buy a hardware system these days, they’re doing it because of the ecosystem, because of their friends list,” Circna gaming research director Mat Piscatella <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/bringing-your-games-to-other-platforms&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/bringing-your-games-to-other-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>The Game Business</em></a></span> last week. “You’re not going to get people to transition consoles because of exclusives anymore. We’re way beyond that point.”</p><p>It was a version of what Phil Spencer admitted in 2023 at what now appears to have been an important inflection point for Xbox. “There is no world where <em>Starfield </em>is an 11/10 and people start selling their PS5s,” he told<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-phil-spencer-interview-starfield-ps5-console-war-1850404446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-phil-spencer-interview-starfield-ps5-console-war-1850404446"> the<em> Kinda Funny </em>podcast</a></span> at the time. “That’s not going to happen.” He went on to say that many players are locked into wherever their digital libraries are now, calling the Xbox One/PS4 battle the “worst generation” to lose from the perspective of fighting over market share. </p><p>I’ve been skeptical of this view and think it undercounts Microsoft’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732">persistent struggle to consistently ship high-quality exclusive games</a></span> that everyone wants to play. But it also seems undeniable that players, especially younger ones, are less attached to where they play games than ever as long as they can play what they want. Does this mean we’ll see <em>God of War Ragnarök</em> on Xbox Series X/S next year? Almost certainly not. But exclusivity increasingly feels less like a promise binding all Sony first-party games, and more like a ticking clock competing platforms bake into their long-tail sales strategy. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ps5-xbox-exclusivity-helldivers-spiderman-switch-2-1851787122]]></content:encoded>

Every Nintendo Direct or Xbox Games Showcase, rumors start to swirl that this time—<em>this time</em>—the game is going to appear, and we’ll see it moving, and there will be a release date. And none of that ever happens. One of my favorite ever headlines on <em>Kotaku</em> was this one from Willa  after it didn’t show in April 2024's Direct: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-world-showcase-no-show-1851416028&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-world-showcase-no-show-1851416028"><em>Silksong</em> Fans Won’t Survive Another Round of Disappointment.</a></span></p><p>Then today, looking through the impossible avalanche of industry emails that pour in, I noticed Microsoft had sent over its itinerary for this year’s Gamescom. Germany’s Gamescom is the biggest gaming show in the world, and every August features its own Geoff Keighley-hosted night of trailers during which <em>Silksong</em> also doesn’t appear. But what’s this? Hidden in the list of games Microsoft will have playable in its booths at this year’s event, tucked between <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> and <em>Borderlands 4...</em>it’s <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>.</p><p>In fact, the email even specifies, “This includes the first ever public opportunity to go hands on with the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X, including a new playable demo for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong.</em>”</p><p>Rumors spread earlier this year that there might be some sort of strange deal between the ROG Xbox Ally and <em>Silksong</em>, after the logo for the game appeared <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000">in the launch trailer for the handheld console</a></span>.</p><p>However, Team Cherry’s Matthew “Leth” Griffin then <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1l6k3vt/thank_you_leth/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1l6k3vt/thank_you_leth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jumped on the game’s Discord</a></span> to confirm a previous vague suggestion the game would come out before Christmas 2025, and to add “we are not tied to a console release.”</p><p>Still, this Gamescom tie-in suggests there’s <em>something</em> going on there. Could it turn out to be pre-loaded on the ROG Xbox Ally, as well as being sold separately elsewhere? It’d sure be a cool incentive.</p><p>But more importantly, it seems <em>Silksong</em> actually exists so much that there’s at the very least a playable demo of the game. You just need to head to Germany next month to see it to believe it.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-rog-ally-gamescom-demo-1851787121]]></content:encoded>
