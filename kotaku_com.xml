Brown as the former security guard to a recently murdered American president. This then jarringly shifts into footage of David Schwimmer in January’s <em>Goosebumps</em> movie, <strong><em>The Vanishing</em></strong>. Then, far more excitingly, we get to see some <strong><em>Alien: Earth</em></strong>, the TV series set in the <em>Alien </em>universe, created by my favorite showrunner, Noah Hawley (<em>Bones</em>, <em>Fargo</em>, <em>Legion</em>).</p><p>There’s a new but extremely brief appearance by Marvel series <strong><em>Ironheart</em></strong>, a few seconds of <strong><em>Daredevil</em></strong>, and then, crikey, <strong><em>Chad Powers</em></strong>. This is a new comedy created and written by, and also starring, everyone’s new favorite beefcake, Glen Powell. It’s based on the Eli Manning character from <em>Eli’s Places</em>, and is about a college quarterback who loses his place on his team due to bad behavior, so creates an alter-ego, Chad Powers, disguises himself, and joins a struggling Southern team. Even weirder is how much the disguised Powell looks like Parker from <em>Gold Rush</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="7d5055061bd65bd6954703e9113b8eb1" data-recommend-id="image://7d5055061bd65bd6954703e9113b8eb1" data-format="jpg" data-width="850" data-height="478" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chad Powers and Parker from Gold Rush." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Chad Powers and Parker from Gold Rush." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney / Discovery / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7d5055061bd65bd6954703e9113b8eb1" data-recommend-id="image://7d5055061bd65bd6954703e9113b8eb1" data-format="jpg" data-width="850" data-height="478" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chad Powers and Parker from Gold Rush." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s a moment of a new show that has no online presence called <strong><em>Good American Family</em></strong>, that looks all sorts of weird, and then, finally, the one we’re waiting for, <strong><em>Andor</em></strong><em>.</em></p><p>It’s just 11 seconds, but we get to see once again what makes <em>Andor</em> stand out from so many of Disney’s TV shows—it’s shot on huge sets, and not a Volume stage. There’s big, open spaces! There are Stormtroopers! There are people telling Andor he needs to be a leader now, which he really obviously won’t want to be. There’s very little more to glean from it for an amateur like me, but you know the pros will be poring over this for every hidden detail. Here’s the section clipped out:</p><p>Oh, and after <em>Andor </em>we see some <em><strong>Percy Jackson and the Olympians</strong></em> season two, like anyone was still noticing.</p><p>So, get speculating.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
