              <p>The Pixel 10 phones from Google are direct competitors to the iPhone 17 lineup, and they offer great value that makes Apple’s prices look high in comparison. The great news is that there’s an <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5784/">unlocked Pixel 10 128GB currently on sale on Amazon for $549, which is $250 less than its $799 list price</a>. Google’s flagship phone comes with Google’s own Tensor G5 chip, a triple rear camera system with 5x optical zoom, and seven years of guaranteed Android updates.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5784/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Gemini AI Built-In Tensor G5 Processing</h2>
<p>The Tensor G5 chip is the newest version of<strong> Google’s custom silicon made for AI processing</strong> and computational photography on devices, not just for getting high benchmark scores. This processor can do complicated machine learning tasks right on your phone, so you can use features like real-time language translation, advanced photo processing, and Gemini AI interactions without having to send data to cloud servers. The architecture focuses on making everyday tasks as efficient as possible while also giving you extra performance when you need it.</p>
<p>With <strong>Gemini AI integration</strong>, the Pixel 10 becomes an interactive assistant that can understand natural conversation through Gemini Live and you can point your camera at things or text you don’t know and ask questions in everyday language. The camera will give you answers based on what it sees and this visual lookup feature can be used in a variety of situations, such as recognizing plants while hiking or translating signs in other languages in real time.</p>



<p>The <strong>main sensor in the triple rear camera system is 48 megapixels</strong> and has optical image stabilization, so it takes clear pictures even when your hands aren’t perfectly steady. The<strong> 10.8-megapixel telephoto lens gives you 5x optical zoom</strong> which keeps the quality of the picture when the subjects are far away. The 13-megapixel ultra-wide lens gives you a wider view for landscapes and group shots and the Super Res Zoom uses both optical and digital methods to get 20x magnification while keeping details that pure digital zoom destroys on other phones.</p>
<p><em>Camera Coach</em> looks at your composition in real time and suggests changes to make your shots better and gives you tips on framing, lighting, and positioning that help casual photographers take better pictures. You can see this advice as you frame shots, not after you’ve already taken bad pictures which makes the learning process quick and useful.</p>



<p>The <strong>Actua OLED display is 6.3 inches wide and has a resolution of 1080 x 2424,</strong> and the refresh rate changes from 1Hz to 120Hz depending on what you’re watching (to save battery, static content like reading drops to lower refresh rates). The screen is clearly visible even in direct sunlight, where many phones become unreadable, because the peak brightness is 3,000 nits and the IP68 rating means that the screen can be submerged in water for up to 30 minutes and still be safe.</p>
<p>The <strong>4,970mAh battery lasts for more than 24 hours of normal use</strong> between charges, so you can use it all day and night without needing to charge it in the middle of the day. Fast charging sends 30 watts through the USB-C port to quickly charge the battery when you need it and Qi wireless charging at 15 watts lets you charge your phone without a cable at home or in the car.</p>
<p>The Pixel 10 costs $549, which makes it a flagship option that offers high-end features without the $1,000 or more price tags that come with premium iPhones and Samsung Galaxy devices. This long Cyber Monday deal shows that December can be a better time to shop than the first holiday shopping weekend for people who are willing to wait.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bose Headphones Stuck at Cyber Monday Price, Amazon Never Raised It to Clear Stock Out]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-headphones-stuck-at-cyber-monday-price-amazon-never-raised-it-to-clear-stock-out-2000650104</link>

              <p>Amazon kept pricing steady on select flagship products after Cyber Monday ended, and the Bose <em>QuietComfort</em> headphones remain discounted at what marks their lowest price point yet. These<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/"> wireless noise-cancelling headphones now sell for $199 instead of the regular $349 tag</a>&nbsp;which brings premium Bose audio and industry-leading noise cancellation down to a price bracket where you’d typically find mid-tier alternatives with compromised performance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Adaptive noise cancellation</h2>
<p>The <em>QuietComfort</em> headphones have <strong>microphones around each earcup that constantly pick up sounds</strong> from the outside world and they make sound waves that are opposite to the noise that is coming in, which cancels it out before it gets to your ears. This active noise cancellation works over a wide range of frequencies and gets rid of everything from the low rumble of airplane engines to the mid-frequency chatter of people talking in an office. The system changes in real time as your acoustic environment changes and for example, it automatically lowers the cancellation strength when you move from a quiet room to a busy street. The plush over-ear cushions block out noise passively by making a physical seal around your ears. This works with active cancellation to make the silence even deeper than either method alone.</p>
<p>When you need to concentrate or sleep while traveling,<strong> Quiet Mode turns on full noise cancellation</strong> for the best isolation, while Aware Mode lets outside sounds through the headphones so you can hear announcements, conversations, or traffic without taking them off. This mode of transparency uses the same outside microphones that cancel out noise. It picks up sounds from the outside world and mixes them in with your audio playback in a natural way and with the push of a button, you can switch between modes, which lets you quickly adapt to situations where being aware is important for safety or socializing.</p>



<p>High-fidelity audio drivers make sound clear across the whole frequency range, bringing out vocal and instrumental details that are lost on cheaper headphones. You can change the bass, midrange, and treble settings right in the Bose Music app. This lets you change the sound to fit your tastes or make up for different types of music. When you want cleaner mids in bass-heavy electronic music, lowering the low-end can help. On the other hand, adding treble to acoustic recordings can bring out string details.</p>
<p>With noise cancellation on,<strong> the battery can last up to 24 hours on a single charge</strong> which is enough for multi-day trips or full work weeks without needing to plug in. Plugging it in for just 15 minutes gives you 2.5 hours of playback time, which is great if you forgot to charge it overnight and need to leave right away. The included audio cable with an inline microphone lets you connect the headphones with a wire when Bluetooth isn’t available or when the battery dies in the middle of a flight.</p>



<p><strong>With multipoint Bluetooth</strong>, you can connect to two devices at the same time and switch between them automatically based on which one plays audio first. You can stay connected to both your laptop and your phone at the same time, you can answer calls on your phone without having to disconnect from your computer or miss notifications while watching videos. The seamless switching between devices makes it easy to switch audio sources without having to go into Bluetooth settings every time.</p>
<p>The padded headband spreads the weight evenly across the top of your head, stopping the pressure points that form when you wear poorly made headphones for a long time. The over-ear cushions are made of memory foam wrapped in synthetic protein leather. This makes them feel soft against your skin and keeps their shape even after years of daily use and these headphones stay comfortable even on long flights across the ocean or during eight-hour work days.</p>
<p>The $199 price drop is $150 less than Bose’s top-of-the-line noise-canceling headphones, which puts them in competition with brands that can’t match their adaptive ANC, sound quality, and comfort all day long.</p>
