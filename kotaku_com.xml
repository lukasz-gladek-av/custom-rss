              <p>The AirPods Pro 3 have just been released a few weeks ago (check out <a href="https://gizmodo.com/airpods-pro-3-review-skating-to-where-the-puck-is-going-not-where-it-has-been-2000658726">Gizmodo’s review here</a>), but here is a fact: the improvements from them to the AirPods Pro 2 are negligible but the price difference is rather high. Amazon is clearing out its stock for <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/">the AirPods Pro 2 at a new all-time-low price of $169 (previously $249), but you can have them at that price until stocks last</a>. This is the best deal available, and there is no logical reason you should pay a dime more for the AirPods Pro 3 when the second-generation ones have nearly the same experience at a much lower price.</p>

<h2>Our Favorite AirPods Pro 2</h2>
<p>The H2 chip is a major increase in processing power over the original AirPods Pro. This proprietary <strong>Apple silicon allows for Active Noise Cancellation that eliminates up to twice as much background noise as the original</strong>, and creates a great isolation bubble even on busy trains or noisy city streets. The low-distortion driver, paired with the H2 chip, produces clear high-end frequencies and robust bass and gives audio fidelity on par with Dedicated audiophile earbuds. Voice Isolation significantly enhances call quality through the use of computational audio and isolates your voice from background noise so your colleagues or friends hear you distinctly even when you’re calling from noisy environments.</p>
<p>The Adaptive Audio mode needs a special mention here because it automatically combines Active Noise Cancellation or Transparency mode according to what you’re experiencing around you. As you don’t have to choose between modes, you don’t have to constantly flip between them which is a common complaint amongst older wireless earbuds.</p>



<p>Conversation Awareness takes it a step further, automatically recognizing when you initiate a conversation with someone close to you and automatically reduces audio volume while increasing voices, then automatically switches back when the talk ends. These intelligent features eliminate the need for continual adjusting of controls, a common complaint with older wireless earbuds.</p>
<p><strong>Personalized Spatial Audio produces a three-dimensional soundstage</strong> through custom audio calibration based on a measure of your individual ear shape using the iPhone camera, along with dynamic head tracking. This tech makes audio from music and films sound like it is occurring at you, not inside your head. The trick is highly effective on Dolby Atmos content, creating a true immersion that changes the way you experience media on your devices.</p>



<p>The AirPods Pro 2 introduced something fantastic: a <strong>complete hearing health ecosystem that goes beyond standard earbuds</strong>. The scientifically validated Hearing Test walks you through a clinical-grade assessment right from your iPhone which measures your hearing sensitivity across different frequencies to create a personalized audio profile. This isn’t just a gimmick; it’s genuine hearing science packed into consumer tech. The clinical-grade Hearing Aid feature then amplifies environmental sounds and conversations in real time for people with mild to moderate hearing loss, essentially functioning as an FDA-authorized over-the-counter hearing aid.</p>
<p><strong>The IP54 rating means both the earbuds</strong>, and the MagSafe charging case are dust-, sweat-, and water-resistant against splashes. Wear them on exercise, light rain, or dusty events without a second thought. <strong>Four sizes of silicone tip</strong> ensure the proper fit for different ear shapes, a must for both comfort for being worn for a long period of time and for the acoustic seal needed for good noise cancellation.</p>
<p>Make sure you don’t miss that deal, it might run out of stock soon.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jbl-quietly-offloads-the-waterproof-flip-5-speaker-now-listed-for-pennies-on-amazon-2000631979</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jbl-quietly-offloads-the-waterproof-flip-5-speaker-now-listed-for-pennies-on-amazon.1317370/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Portable Bluetooth speakers aren’t just summer essentials for beach trips and backyard barbecues. As winter settles in, these compact powerhouses become your soundtrack for cozy indoor gatherings, holiday dinner parties where you want music flowing through every room or even those brave souls who enjoy winter hiking and need motivation on snowy trails.</p>
<p>JBL has built an incredible reputation in the audio world, and <strong>their Flip 5 remains our favorite pick in the portable speaker category</strong> for its balance of sound quality, durability, and portability. For Prime Big Deal Day,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4518/"> this bestseller has dropped to a new record low price of $89 (down from $99)</a>, which makes it an ideal time to grab one before the holiday season kicks into full gear.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4518/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Strengths and Ability That Translate into Something Tangible</h2>
<p>The <strong>Flip 5 has 20 watts of output power</strong> housed within its cylindrical body, so you’re getting true room-filling sound instead of cheap portable speaker sound that is often tinny. That 20 watts adds up to clear vocals and surprising deep bass for a portable speaker of its compact nature and enables it, for instance, to deliver acoustic sessions or thumping electronic beats without distortion at loud volumes.</p>
<p>The frequency response goes all the way up to 20 kHz which is the entire range of the human ear so you experience every nuance of sound within your tunes, from the bright ring of cymbals to the throb of the bass guitar. JBL’s distinct sound signature is on clarity and punch which makes for a dynamic listening experience that makes people want to get up on their feet instead of simply filling the background with noise.</p>



<p>The <strong>IPX7 water resistance rating warrants special attention</strong> due to its extension beyond splashing resistance. This rating signifies that the speaker is capable of being submerged for 30 minutes within a span of up to three feet of water without being compromised or malfunctioning at all. In practice, you don’t have to be concerned about using it poolside, take it inside the shower for your morning regimen, or have it playing at some impromptu rain shower at a live event outdoors.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life is 12 hours on a single charge</strong> which is sufficient for the majority of day-long activities without scrambling for a plug outlet. This battery life is based on moderate volume usage, so turning the sound up full blast will reduce the battery life, but for routine home or camp usage, you should have several playback sessions prior to needing a recharge. The speaker is <strong>charged through a USB-C,</strong> which is fast becoming the standard across devices, so you should be able to share the charging cable with charging your smartphone or tablet.</p>
<p>The PartyBoost functionality opens up creative uses by enabling you to <strong>wire up a number of Flip 5 speakers wirelessly for stereo or extra volume</strong>. This works flawlessly with other PartyBoost-enabled JBL speakers and creates a cohesive sound experience between a number of rooms or expanding the coverage area for a broader gathering.</p>
<p>For $89, you’re getting dependable JBL engineering that has garnered <strong>more than 82,000 customer reviews with a 4.8-star average</strong>. For anyone assembling their audio collection or upgrading a worn-out speaker, this Prime Big Deal Day deal amounts to good value on a tried-and-true performer that takes daily usage in stride.</p>

              <p>Over the last year, two trading card games have received levels of attention never seen before in their decades-long histories. Both&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> and&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em> have become more popular than ever, with both franchises selling out of new product so routinely that it’s become normal to not be able to find any packs in any stores. Rather than attempting to ramp up production to meet these additional demands, both companies appear to be leaning in, encouraging the scarcity with ever-more-desirable and underproduced sets, for significant short-term gains. However, I contend this focus on the frenzy has a massive cost: the regular players. And when a generation of kids simply cannot buy the cards they need to build a deck, the long-term losses could be brutal.</p> <p>If you’ve got some disposable income and are a collector of pretty cardboard, times are great. Those able to afford scalpers’ fees or the booming secondhand market can pick up some all-time best-looking cards in both series, with <em>Pokémon’s</em> ever-more-beautiful full-art cards routinely fetching $500 in resales and <em>Magic</em>‘s waterfall of tie-in expansion sets from some of the most popular properties in entertainment selling out before most people even learn they’re on sale. You know who this isn’t helping? People who actually play <em>Pokémon TCG</em> or&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>.</p>

 <p>Right now, where I live in the UK, the only way I can get a pack of <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>cards released in the last 12 months is by <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-pull-rates-2000629165">making it my job to write about them</a> and having them sent to me directly by The Pokémon Company. This is clearly not a path open to all. At the same time, I routinely pop into both specialist card stores and larger retailers to see if I can get anything from November 2024’s Surging Sparks onward, let alone the most recent sets, and usually find they have nothing at all. In the last week I’ve noticed justifiably unloved Temporal Forces packs from March ’24 showing up here and there, and that’s my lot. If I wanted to be playing in live games with the current meta, I’d now have to resort to buying even bulk cards from resellers.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, over at Wizards of the Coast’s&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-universes-beyond-lotr-reprints-1851664815">it’s no better</a>. Where once the game would release occasional spin-off sets based on other media properties for a fun treat, the card game is now dominated by an ever-growing number of “legal” cards from other universes, not least the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em> sets. And boy oh boy, <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-x-secret-lair-mtg-sold-out-ebay-reprint-1851784230">they’ve been a scalper’s paradise</a> too. Then there was <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-magic-gathering-secret-lair-card-pre-order-drop-1851786245">July’s Sonic-themed debacle</a>, as well as the impossibility of finding <em>Lord of the Rings</em> packs. This is only going to get weirder, <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/aligning-the-universes-making-all-our-sets-legal-in-all-our-formats">now that Universes Beyond sets will be legal in all Constructed formats</a>. This is going to include such exceptionally un-<em>Magic</em> licenses as <em>Spider-Man</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313"><em>Star Trek</em></a><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313"> and, er, Dwight from&nbsp;<em>The Office</em></a><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">?</a> The result of this is obviously that the sets are attracting collectors over and above players, bringing in the people looking to pull the rarest, most interesting art to put in a binder. And good on ’em—I rarely play&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG</em> any more now that my kid’s lost interest, but I still love my binders. But there’s a consequence.</p>

 <p>I worry for the players. If you can’t just buy the packs, you can’t play the game. And given both companies appear to be not only doing nothing to improve the situation, but going out of their way to make it worse, this will surely have a long-term impact on the products in the future? Your adult collectors today were likely kids or teenagers playing in the past, and when those adults cut out the next generation of kids, that pipeline springs a very significant leak.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000632027" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000632027"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000632027">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>In <em>Pokémon</em>‘s latest set, Mega Evolution, the company has chosen to include <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-gold-cards-pull-rate-2000630564">two cards so rare they only appear in one out of every 2,520 packs</a>, which of course is driving even more frenzied interest toward the cards when they’ve already been <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">close to impossible to buy for nearly a year</a>. Repeated <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771">promises from The Pokémon Company to increase production</a> either haven’t been honored or haven’t made a meaningful difference, and a move like this really underlines just how uninvested it is in making things any better. Meanwhile, Wizards of the Coast appears to be chasing the same results with its Secret Lair drops that sell out in minutes and leave so many people disappointed, with the company adding more spin-off sets this and next year than in multiple previous years combined.</p>

 <p>And yes, absolutely, these companies don’t care! If it’s a scalper or a five-year-old buying the products, the money fills up their bank just the same. But I suspect they <em>are</em> going to care when interest drops off considerably in the next five to ten years, after a generation who was cut off from being able to access the games reaches an age when they’ve got spending money. It’s what my friend Paul describes as “Funkopopping” their brands. They’re forgetting that all the little words written on those cards have a purpose beyond making the pictures harder to enjoy.</p> <p>Who knows, maybe time will prove me wrong, and both companies’ emphatic leaning on driving short-term buzz will work out for them, and I’ll look like a big old idiot. But I do suspect otherwise.&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900">disappearance into a scalper-driven secondhand market</a> is a&nbsp;<em>terrible</em> look for the company, even if it pushes up their profits in the moment, while&nbsp;<em>MtG</em>‘s watering down of its own universe to become some&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>-like mash-up of contemporary culture seems like such a short-sighted cash-grab. And none of it benefits the group of misfit kids who find company and kindness in sitting around a table, playing the games. And that sucks.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-15-fhd-portable-monitor-doubles-your-display-size-and-its-now-going-for-pennies-on-the-dollar-for-prime-day-2000631978</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-15%E2%80%B3-fhd-portable-monitor-doubles-your-display-size-and-it%E2%80%99s-now-going-for-pennies-on-the-dollar-for-prime-day.1317337/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Looking to boost your productivity without cluttering your desk or weighing down your backpack? A portable monitor opens up a world of possibilities: extend your laptop screen for seamless multitasking at the coffee shop, transform your phone into a mini workstation during travel, enjoy console gaming on a crisp display anywhere or catch up on movies during long commutes.</p>
<p>The beauty of these displays is that they take up less space than a standard notebook while doubling your screen real estate. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/">the KYY 15.6-inch portable monitor has dropped to a new record low of $69 (down from $99) for Prime Big Deal Day on Amazon</a>, and the good news is that this deal is <strong>available to non-Prime</strong> members as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This makes it one of the cheapest ways of adding a second monitor to your setup but what counts is what you’re getting for your money. The KYY monitor <strong>provides Full HD 1920×1080 resolution on a 15.6-inch IPS panel which means clear text and high-quality colors from almost any angle due to the 178-degree viewing angle</strong>. The IPS setup provides true color consistency even when you’re not looking directly at the monitor. The addition of HDR tech provides greater contrast and colour depth, creating more realistic images that make both work documents and entertainment media more interesting to watch.</p>
<p>The monitor includes <strong>blue light reduction tech and flicker-free backlight</strong> which helps reduce eye fatigue when sitting for prolonged periods or staying up for gaming sessions. The side menu control wheel gives fast toggling for brightness, contrast and color temp without digging through convoluted button combinations. The <strong>monitor allows both landscape and portrait modes</strong>, which allows it to be flexible for varying uses such as coding for instance.</p>



<h2>Premium features worth the extra cost</h2>
<p>The connectivity choices warrant a special mention since they dictate how easily you’ll be able to truly employ this monitor across your devices. The KYY features a couple of full-function <strong>USB-C ports</strong>&nbsp;which is a big plus point. This allows you to power the monitor and send video out of a single cable when plugged into laptops or phones sporting USB-C with video output (Thunderbolt 3 or USB 3.1). The real-world advantage here is getting rid of cable clutter and streamlining your portable setup. For devices that lack USB-C, there exists a <strong>Mini-HDMI port that guarantees backward support for older laptops</strong>, gaming consoles such as PS4 and Xbox and the Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p><strong>Thin and light at 0.3 inches thick and just 1.7 pounds</strong>, the monitor fits into a backpack without adding discernible bulk. The smart cover, which is included, has several uses: it protects the display from scratches when being carried around with its tough PU leather covering, magnetically attaches to the display for a frameless experience, and doubles into a stand with two rotating grooves for varying viewing angles. This makes carrying a separate stand or holding the monitor against some arbitrary object unnecessary. The dual stereo speakers built-in, along with a 3.5mm audio jack, make sound options available without needing external speakers, although the speakers are more geared towards casual usage than audiophile-quality sound.</p>
<p>For this all-time-low $69, you’re getting a full portable display solution with the<strong> Protective Cover and Screen Protector bundle included</strong>. For remote workers or gamers requiring portability for their setup, this bundle gives huge value for expanding your visual workplace.</p>

              <p>If you’re not already one of the hundreds of millions of people who own an Alexa speaker at home, then <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em> could be a good time to join the ride. Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4514/">discounted its Echo Dot at a record-low $34, down from the usual $49</a> (and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4515/">the Echo Pop to $24 from $39</a>), and there’s a reason this tiny speaker has become so popular: It removes that daily friction of foraging for your phone when setting timers when cooking, changing thermostats manually or searching for the correct playlist when your hands are full.</p>

<h2>Audio That Finally Keeps Up with the Convenience</h2>
<p>Earlier Echo Dots won their success on the strength of functionality over audio quality, but that changes with this new model: <strong>Amazon entirely rebuilt the internal audio design to produce tighter vocals, more robust bass response, and richer sound</strong> that fills a room rather than just crowding a corner. The speaker includes a new custom full-range driver that addresses high-end reproduction and low-end reproduction much more effectively than older, smaller drivers. That results in your morning news updates coming through with sharp clarity and music streaming through Spotify or Amazon Music with enough richness for casual enjoyment.</p>



<p>Integration with a smart home makes the <strong>Echo Dot a universal remote for your entire home</strong> for all your devices that are compatible. If you have bulbs, plugs, thermostats or cameras that are smart, voice commands replace physical switches or smartphone apps. The motion sensor and internal temperature sensor incorporate another form of automation with routines.</p>
<p>Several Echo devices per home allow whole-home audio so your music accompanies you wherever you go from kitchen through living room to bedroom. Pairing with Fire TV creates a home theater setup with playback managed by Alexa, searching for titles, and volume adjustment. Echo Dot also extends wifi coverage when paired with appropriate eero mesh wifi systems and does away with connectivity dead spots causing streaming stoppages and lost connections.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy features also include a physical off button for the mic that electronically disables the mics</strong>, and gives you complete control over when the unit is permitted to listen. The button glows red when the mics are disabled for obvious visual feedback. Amazon built some layers of privacy into the infrastructure, and the company does not sell your personal information to third parties.</p>
<p>At $34 for Prime Day, the Echo Dot is the least expensive way into a voice-activated home automation and daily convenience features that quickly become a necessity once you experience them.</p>

              <p>Amazon’s <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em> leave no brand behind nor any product category, introducing deep discounts on even the highest-end tech available out there. When setting up a high-performance PC, when upgrading a gaming rig or when processes on a professional level demand scorching fast storage velocities, the <strong>Samsung 990 Pro SSD is the ultimate consumer-grade solid-state drive</strong> at hand.</p>
<p>Currently, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4513/">2TB variant has fallen to an all-time-low $159 on Amazon, from its usual $199 asking price</a>. This fantastic Gen4 NVMe storage from Samsung is the sort serious gamers, video editors, 3D artists, and data pros depend on when seconds on load time make a difference.</p>

<h2>Sequential Velocities That Recalibrate What Fast Is</h2>
<p><strong>Sequential reads go up to 7,450 MB/s, writes up to 6,900 MB/s</strong>. To give you a better idea, you’re getting close to the theoretical limit of the PCIe 4.0 interface which is around 8,000 MB/s tops. That means the drive takes less than eight seconds to unload a 50GB installation for a game or relocate a 4K video workflow file whilst getting coffee. These speeds are thanks to <strong>Samsung’s proprietary controller and V-NAND</strong>&nbsp;which stacks memory cells vertically for elevated density and performance without increasing the physical size of the M.2 2280 form factor that occupies standard motherboard slots.</p>



<p>But sequential raw speeds are only part of the equation: Random read and write performance is more relevant to real-world computing because the majority of activities involve accessing spuradically distributed data across the drive, not large swathes of contiguous files. <strong>Samsung boosted random performance by more than 55% over the last-generation 980 Pro</strong>, directly translating to snappier program launches and less stuttering in open-world titles constantly streaming assets from disk.</p>



<p>The Samsung 990 Pro delivers up to 50% better performance per watt than the previous generation so you get those scorching speeds using less energy and less heat output. This matters for compact form factors with limited airflow, thin notebooks where battery life is a concern or multi-drive workstations where overall heat accumulation might become a problem.</p>
<p>The 2TB capacity provides a sweet spot for current computing requirements – and games are increasingly going over 100GB installations, with some titles such as Call of Duty going over 200GB. Serious video editors who deal with 4K or even 6K video have a need for storing raw files, render caching, and project libraries. Data analysts working on large datasets prefer storing all of them on fast local storage instead of sluggish network drives.</p>
<p>The Samsung 990 Pro SSD is powered by a 1,200 terabytes written endurance rating on the 2TB model which means theoretically you have the capability of writing 600GB of information every single day for five years until the warranty expiration limit is reached. For most users, that is a lifetime of usage. The drive also includes Samsung’s Magician software, which monitors the health of the drives, manages firmware updates, and includes a secure erase feature.</p>
<p>At $159, this is the best pricing that we have seen on Samsung’s highest performance consumer-grade SSD yet.</p>

              <p>Cleaning your floors shouldn’t feel like a never-ending chore, especially when pet hair seems to multiply overnight and daily messes keep piling up. The good news? The <strong>Roborock Q10 S5+</strong> just<strong> became Amazon’s #1 bestseller in robot vacuums</strong> during Prime Big Deal Days, and that’s impressive enough to catch your attention.</p>
<p>This newly released powerhouse combines serious suction, advanced mopping and a self-emptying station into one complete package, and right now it’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/">dropped to an all-time low of $299 on Amazon, down from its usual $399 price tag</a>. When a robot vacuum climbs to the top of the sales charts with those kinds of numbers, you know something special is happening.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Q10 S5+ addresses the fundamental frustration of robotic cleaning: constant maintenance. Its <strong>self-emptying station holds a massive 2.7-liter dust bag that handles up to 70 days of debris</strong> before you need to think about it. For households with shedding pets or high foot traffic, this means you can essentially forget about your vacuum for more than two months while it quietly does its job. The <strong>station automatically pulls dirt and hair from the robot after each cleaning session</strong>&nbsp;so you’re not emptying tiny dustbins every other day like with basic models.</p>
<h2>Powerful Performance That Handles Real-World Messes</h2>
<p>The suction power here is worth a mention because numbers count when you’re working with ground-in dirt. At 1<strong>0,000 Pa, the HyperForce suction power creates enough pressure for it to remove embedded pet hair</strong> from carpet fibers, lift crumbs out of hardwood crevices and deal with the type of debris that lesser robots just bulldoze around. That’s about double what you’ll get on starter versions.</p>



<p>But a vacuum on its own won’t cure the tangling problem plaguing the majority of robot vacs, especially homes with long hair or fluffy pets. Roborock created a dual anti-tangle solution comprising a JawScrapers Comb main brush with a special side brush designed specifically to fight hair wrap. The structure of the comb separates and directs hair dynamically into the suction stream instead of wrapping it round the roller, so you’ll have a lot less time spent cutting out bunched-up grime from the brush bar.</p>
<p>The VibraRise 2.0 cleaning system provides a dual-zone sonic vibration technology that cleans floors 3,000 times a minute. This isn’t the languid wet pad sliding you witness on less advanced models. The active scrubbing action indeed addresses dried-on spills and tacky areas, and the system automatically lifts the mop pad 0-8mm when it recognizes carpet using ultrasonic sensors. That same recognition initiates automatic suction boost on the carpets for further cleaning while safeguarding them against moisture damage.</p>
<p>The navigation tech distinguishes advanced robots from simple bump-and-go ones, and the <strong>Roborock Q10 S5+ makes full home 360-degree mapping</strong> a breeze with its PreciSense LiDAR scanning tech. The tech provides precise floor plans and multi-level mapping, so a two-storey home, for instance, will have both floor plans remembered by the robot, which then changes cleaning strategy to suite both areas. ReactiveTech obstacle avoidance with structured light detection detects chair legs, toys, and cables, amongst others and cleverly navigates a path around them without getting stuck or requiring rescue.</p>
<p>Make sure you don’t miss that deal before it runs out of stock (which is a matter of time).</p>
