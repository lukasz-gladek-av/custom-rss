While Arrowhead Game Studios won’t confirm that future collaborations will be priced lower than that, it is giving away the second set in the crossover  to try to win back fans heading into the end-of-year break. </p><p>“Firstly, we are gifting to everyone the planned second wave of the <em>Helldivers</em> x <em>Killzone</em> collaboration items today, free of charge,” the devs <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516322672418750732?l=english&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516322672418750732?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote in a new blog post</a></span>. “The distribution of those items will begin shortly, in two waves. As such we’re also going to extend the duration of the items currently in the Superstore from 5 days to 10 days so that you have a chance to get hold of it and reduce the risk of missing out.”</p><p>At issue is the fact that <em>Helldivers 2</em> is a $40 game charging free-to-play prices for new skins as part of a potential slippery slope, amid its expanding post-launch monetization strategy. Arrowhead’s CEO made the argument that premium sets like the <em>Killzone </em>collaboration are how the company can afford to keep major updates, like the recent introduction <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-illuminate-omens-tyranny-free-update-1851720355&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-illuminate-omens-tyranny-free-update-1851720355">of the Illuminate enemy faction, completely free</a></span>. </p><figure id="" data-id="16ad83dcdf0f50c52c5e25c62311903d" data-recommend-id="image://16ad83dcdf0f50c52c5e25c62311903d" data-format="png" data-width="1105" data-height="141" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows comments from Arrowhead's CEO.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But many players felt like it was crossing a line and out of step with the game’s previous pattern of releasing new items as unlockable in $10 battle passes (which can be partly paid for with currency slowly accumulated in game). In fact, the <em>Killzone</em> set was originally supposed to be part of a Warbond, but the studio decided against that over concerns about a backlash to that as well. “Some of you are not happy with the prices of the items and we will revisit this,” the company responded in its latest update.</p><p>In addition to lengthening the stay of new crossover items in the shop’s monthly rotation, it sounds like Arrowhead is also looking at a way to have a secondary shop of items that never changes so that latecomers always have a chance to buy the more highly sought-after crossover merch. Some fans worried that this latest economic encroachment was due to publisher Sony’s meddling, but CEO Shams Jorjani said in the <em>Helldivers 2</em> Discord that that wasn’t the case. “It’s a partnership but we are in the driving seat behind the decisions,” he wrote. “This one is on us.”</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In November you could battle Snoop Dogg and Eminem while sporting a brand new pair of Nikes on your amorphous blob-creature. It’s a corporate soup of cameos and crossovers which, viewed from the outside, can appear rather gross. And now, Mariah Carey of all people might be getting in the mix?</p><p>I’m a recent convert to <em>Fortnite</em>, drawn in by my 10-year-old, having made the lazy (but understandable) mistake of thinking it just a cacophony of cartoonish noise. It turns out, beneath the corporate tie-ins and embarrassing celebrity endorsements, it’s one hell of a solid online shooter. I thoroughly enjoy playing, ideally in Duos with the boy, but spend a lot of time playing solo too. Thanks to some superb, parkourish movement (made even better in this latest season with wall-scrambling, roly-poly landings and samurai-sword-induced double-jumps), excellent gun fighting, and a vast variety in approaches, I’ve found my groove.</p><p>That doesn’t mean the corporate nonsense grates <em>less</em>, but once through the looking glass you can at least appreciate why people put up with it. And...sometimes it’s fun?</p><p>Given that November’s shorter so-called “Remix” season (which brought back season 2's map and dreary weapons) featured Snoop, Ice Spice, Eminem and Juice Wrld, the idea that Mariah Carey might be hiding in a vast block of ice (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1giQVuoTAFM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1giQVuoTAFM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as she apparently so often does</a></span>) doesn’t seem very far-fetched. Heck, at the end of Remix, there was a (stunning) slightly interactive event in which an Ice Spice the size of a skyscraper performed a gig in New York City, while titanic Eminems fought one another and a Juice Wrld as big as the solar system sang as players jumped around the rings of Saturn. It’s tough to rule anything out after that.</p><p>Anyhoo, that’s what the leakers are saying is due to happen in just a couple of days:</p><p>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here’s a look:</p><p>It begins with flashbacks to Superman’s life as Clark Kent, as he bleeds out on the arctic snow only to eventually be rescued by Krypto. We get glimpses of Rachel Brosnahan as Lois Lane, Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luthor, and Pruitt Taylor Vince as Jonathan Kent, as well as plenty of slow-motion action shots and some borderline overly sentimental shots; like a kid raising a Superman flag amid a local humanitarian crisis, and an indistinct mob of Metropolis citizens booing and cajoling Superman as he walks into a building. </p><p><em>Superman</em> 2025 won’t just be about the superpowered alien adapting to life on his new home planet, though. It’s also set to include include appearances by Edi Gathegi as Mister Terrific, Isabela Merced as Hawkgirl, and Nathan Fillion as Green Lantern, who appears for a split second in the trailer with one of the goofiest wigs I’ve ever seen. No idea how writer and director Gunn expects to fit all of that into one movie with a sub-three hour runtime, but here we are.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
