And while it might not be a new phenomenon, it’s still enjoyable to watch these fan creations as they show us just how far Rockstar’s tech has come over the decades. So I knew that after Rockstar published <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-2-everything-spotted-round-up-easter-eggs-1851779329&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-2-everything-spotted-round-up-easter-eggs-1851779329"><em>GTA 6</em>'s second trailer earlier this month</a></span>, following the news that the open-world sequel was being delayed until May 2026, someone would set out to recreate the new video in a previous<em> GTA </em>game. And here we are. <br></p><p>Foosmoke made the video using mostly&nbsp;<em>GTA San Andreas</em> to recreate nearly every moment from the new <em>GTA 6</em> trailer. Sometimes the creator adds extra details using video editing tricks or bits from <em>Vice City,</em> but this is still more or less the <em>GTA 6</em> trailer recreated in <em>San Andreas</em>, and it’s a blast to watch. </p><p>Previously, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/_V1HzqpoAgU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/_V1HzqpoAgU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Foosmoke recreated the first <em>GTA 6</em> trailer</a></span> as if it were a PS2-era game. That video is also great. Of course, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-remakes-remix-lego-vice-city-san-andreas-1851157083&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-remakes-remix-lego-vice-city-san-andreas-1851157083">Foosmoke wasn’t alone in recreating that first trailer</a></span>. Plenty of people did as well, sometimes in other games or even, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-recreated-real-life-comparison-miami-1851240237?_gl=1*1vh7wqc*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDc4NTMyODMkbzg0JGcxJHQxNzQ3ODYxNjg3JGo1NyRsMCRoMCRkTGhKQ1VESkJYd2lqTzFUMTlocEx1a0ptWERkbVBiM21jZw..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-recreated-real-life-comparison-miami-1851240237?_gl=1*1vh7wqc*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDc4NTMyODMkbzg0JGcxJHQxNzQ3ODYxNjg3JGo1NyRsMCRoMCRkTGhKQ1VESkJYd2lqTzFUMTlocEx1a0ptWERkbVBiM21jZw..">in one case, in real life.</a></span> </p><p>Fans have done similar recreations in the past.

It’s wild how much more realistic Rockstar’s newer <em>GTA </em>games look compared to past entries. However, I do miss the more primitive and blocky visuals, as they live firmly in a very nostalgic part of my brain. </p><p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>is set to launch on May 26, 2026, on PS5 and Xbox. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The plot thickens. Big Daddy Gollum’s still wreaking havoc on your damn team, and the role of Gustave will now be played by Clive Rosfiel—er, Verso. Despite trading the Devil of Hell’s Kitchen for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtube.com/shorts/FnCzW3SHeWY?si=1-UlnohHlpfMTCeJ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtube.com/shorts/FnCzW3SHeWY?si=1-UlnohHlpfMTCeJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Final Fantasy VIII</em>’s number one simp</a></span>, it’s a relatively easy transition, but not one without its quirks—and a whole new gimmick to learn. Once you learn that gimmick, and get into some of the deep skills in his tree, though, Verso can become the linchpin of your team. We’ll show you how. </p><h2 id="h50651"><a id="1"></a>Basic kit</h2><figure id="" data-id="80e64bdf7ac06841721ae1fcce0459b6" data-recommend-id="image://80e64bdf7ac06841721ae1fcce0459b6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The weapon selection screen shows Verso's weapons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The weapon selection screen shows Verso's weapons." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="80e64bdf7ac06841721ae1fcce0459b6" data-recommend-id="image://80e64bdf7ac06841721ae1fcce0459b6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The weapon selection screen shows Verso's weapons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So, one of the things right upfront that eases the Gustave-to-Verso transition is the fact that <strong>he immediately inherits all of the weapons you collected as Gustave</strong>. Remember back in the day when a party member left, and they’d take all the good armor and weapons with them? God, we lived as savages in the 90s. </p><p>Anyway, that means you’ve got a nice deep armory of sword options to start with. That said, sticking with Verso’s basic loadout for a bit is the best way to go, given that <strong>he’s the only character who can wield Light magic right out of the gate</strong> without having to prime the skill (i.e. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480">Lune’s Mayhem</a></span>). </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Lune In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>This is handy as all the enemies in the first major area you get to after Verso joins up are weak to Light. You’ll get plenty of practice if you just stay the course of the main story. In addition, it’s not quite his default loadout per se, but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dualliste-phase-2-verso-1851781495&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dualliste-phase-2-verso-1851781495">the Dualliste boss</a></span> at the end of that area drops the Dualliso sword. This allows Verso a second turn after a basic attack To get such a weapon so early after obtaining him makes it worth mentioning as a crucial part of his kit, especially because of his... </p><h2 id="h50652"><a id="2"></a>Special mechanic: Perfection</h2><figure id="" data-id="4bf4924fbdd84d939f06fc50d0e5ad50" data-recommend-id="image://4bf4924fbdd84d939f06fc50d0e5ad50" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The party faces off against Renoir." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The party faces off against Renoir." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4bf4924fbdd84d939f06fc50d0e5ad50" data-recommend-id="image://4bf4924fbdd84d939f06fc50d0e5ad50" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The party faces off against Renoir." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Devil May Cry</em> fans will be right at home with this mechanic. Verso basically just has that game’s ranking system as a gimmick. Very simply, you start at grade D, and landing attacks, dodging, and parrying all add a certain amount of Perfection Points that raise the grade from D, C, B, A, all the way up to S, with points taken away if you take a hit.</p><p>The twist, however, is that while all of Verso’s skills get a damage boost depending on his rank, many of them also have a specific rank where they are enhanced even further. Using an ability tied to a specific letter rank that Verso has achieved enables a secondary effect. This can be anything from earning more Perfection if the attack hits, to dealing more damage, or it can even make expensive skills cheaper. </p><p>An excellent example here is Verso’s Perfect Break Skill. By itself, it’s a pretty powerful Light attack. However, if you hit it while you’re exactly at Rank B, it only costs five AP to cast (down from seven). So, while getting to rank S does have its benefits, building your offense around specific ranks—especially in the early goings of Act II—is where the real fun lies. It’s not always about racing to get an S lined up for him.</p><h2 id="h50653"><a id="3"></a>Recommended builds and synergies</h2><figure id="" data-id="4722e4a0317a435bd3a499f57647946b" data-recommend-id="image://4722e4a0317a435bd3a499f57647946b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Verso's various skills." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows Verso's various skills." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4722e4a0317a435bd3a499f57647946b" data-recommend-id="image://4722e4a0317a435bd3a499f57647946b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Verso's various skills." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s another running aspect of Verso’s skill tree that, while not necessarily a core gimmick, does deserve shouting out. That’s the fact that there are quite a few skills predicated on sacrificing either health, status, or rank to either benefit the party, or dealing absurd amounts of damage. That’s actually a really well-implemented way to tie combat in with his place in the narrative, but it also means that on top of being able to build a character based around skills hovering around a certain rank, <strong>if you’re willing to take a risk, you can build Verso into a devastating glass cannon.</strong></p><p>Even if you don’t go fully down that road,<strong> Berserk Slash should be a permanent skill for any Verso player.</strong> It allows him to deal more damage the less health he has left. If you feel like getting extra nuts, pair that up with Overload (gives nine AP, immediately jumps Verso to Rank S, but drops his health to one point), and watch Berserk Slash send your enemies screaming into the goddamn Shadow Realm. </p><p>This is a safer strategy once you get ahold of the Cheater Picto from beating Sprong (the massive Nevron hanging out in the ocean)—and it’s one of those combos that can utterly break the game once you get the Painted Power Picto that removes the 9,999 damage cap. There’s glory waiting for those who can walk the edge of life and death with Verso. </p><p>But hey, if you’d like to keep your boy safe and still do a number on enemies, there’s plenty of options for that too. As mentioned, the Dualliso blade you get from the Dualliste grants a second turn after a basic attack, Pair that up with Energizing Shots (20-percent of Free Aim shots go back to you in AP) and Blitz (grants another turn), and you can absolutely monopolize an enemy if you get lucky enough. Pair Strike Storm up with any Pictos that enhance critical hits, and you’re almost always guaranteed to hit Rank S in no time. Once you get into the latter portions of Act II, you can basically just spam that and Perfect Stars—his most powerful Light attack—and you’ll put a whole lotta Nevros in the dirt. </p><p>In the early going, though, your options will be a bit more limited. Depending how not-adept you are at dodges and parries, it’s perfectly viable to build Verso’s whole loadout around staying at C rank. Berserk Slash and Strike Storm both benefit at that rank, which helps the case, but you can also build Verso as a support character using Leadership and Paradigm Shift (both granting AP to the rest of the team). In which case, you’ll want to pick up the Lanceram sword at some point in your journey, since it guarantees you’ll never drop lower than C. </p><hr><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
