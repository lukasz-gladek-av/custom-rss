              <p>A 45-minute deep-dive into <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-nintendo-direct-mario-donkey-kong-1851774194"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a> revealed all the ways it’s setting itself apart from other kart racers. While director Masahiro Sakurai began <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-switch-2-kirby-air-riders-smash-bros-sakurai-2000618190">the latest Nintendo Direct</a> by joking that his new Switch 2 exclusive is basically <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-free-roam-open-world-burnout-paradise-1851776569">just <em>Mario Kart</em></a>, everything that followed built the case for why it’s actually much more. Essentially a<em> Kirby Air Riders</em> Let’s Play starring the <em>Smash Bros.</em> director himself, the showcase revealed new modes, mechanics, and the game’s release date.</p> <p><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> will come to Switch 2 on November 22. In addition to the main racing mode, it’ll also feature a series of other contests, from time trials to a destruction mode that looks an awful lot like <em>Twisted Meta</em>l. The menus and sound effects look <a href="https://kotaku.com/smash-bros-sakurai-youtube-sequel-switch-2-1851678195">straight out of <em>Smash Bros. Ultimate</em></a>, including the win screen that shows characters applauding. The entire showcase even ended with a surprise reveal for what seems to be a new Kirby character that looks like Meta Knight if he were dragged out of an alternate, post-apocalyptic dimension.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Kirby Air Riders Direct – 19/08/2025" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gn5c4RkoYAc?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The main attraction in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is the titular Air Riders mode. While it’s structured much like the original GameCube release back in 2003, a second button has been added to the control scheme. In addition to pressing a button to drift around corners and building up boost, characters also have access to a special ability that can be unleashed to speed up or attack other players. The courses are also bigger this time around to accommodate more racers, with an updated roster and vehicle garage for players to mix and match with.</p>

 <p>The returning City Trials mode looked with up to 16 players this time looks far more interesting. Like <em>Mario Kart World,</em> it drops you into a big sandbox where you drive around exploring and collecting power-ups. Random events then spawn that you can join to compete in with your upgraded vehicle. The challenges range from battles to gobbling up as much food on the map as possible. There are also mini-games reminiscent of hitting the sandbag in Smash Bros., with players aiming and flinging themselves at a wall of different scoring cubes to rack up points.</p> <p>Whether that’s all enough to make <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> feel like the big November release the Switch 2 deserves remains to be seen. It’ll arrive just a month after <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, and we still don’t know when<em> Metroid Prime 4</em> is coming out. Sakurai ended his stream saying that there’s still more to reveal in <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>, hinting at another Nintendo Direct coming sometime in the fall. In the meantime, it would be great to get the GameCube version on Switch Online.</p>

              <p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> latest update has given players plenty of new things to do, from grinding for new talismans to trying not to die to the new 9-star boss fights. But players on PC are still struggling with poor performance optimization, and Capcom now says no major fixes will be ready until the winter.</p> <p><span>“To our hunters playing <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> </span><span>on PC, we’re committed to listening to your feedback and improving both performance and stability of the game,” an update posted on X on August 18 <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1957473035885121806">reads</a>. “Although we will continue to implement gradual improvements in the weeks ahead, we are targeting Free Title Update 4 this winter to implement a multifaceted plan, including CPU and GPU related optimizations, followed by a second stage of mitigation measures afterwards. We’ll share more information on the specifics in the future.”</span></p> <p>The response from fans so far has been less than stellar. “It’s not normal to wait one year to get at least a small optimization for PC players,” wrote one. “We are paying for stability and performance as the same time free updates. I have a war machine and i have to play everything on LOW hoping it’s going well.” Another posted, “Love MHWilds I really do, but waiting almost a year for the game to run at least a little better is a bit crazy.”</p>

 <p>Similar sentiments have been echoed across the game’s subreddit and recent Steam reviews where <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> still sits at just 25 percent, up from an all-time low earlier in the summer, but still far from where the overwhelmingly positive ratings other recent entries in the series sit. While not everyone’s facing issues, people on a range of machines are still reporting crashes, ugly textures, and unstable framerates even at 30fps.</p> <p>There’s currently a new Title Update 3 scheduled for September to add a new monster and more balance adjustments to combat and progression, followed by Title Update 4 in the winter. There’s also the game’s first expansion, which new <em>Monster Hunter</em> entries tend to get 12-18 months after they ship. It’ll be a make-or-break moment for the players on PC who feel like the last six months have been closer to an Early Access experience.</p>
