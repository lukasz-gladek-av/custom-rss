            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/whether-samsung-likes-it-or-not-amazon-just-slashed-the-49%E2%80%B3-odyssey-oled-gaming-monitor-by-almost-50-for-prime-day.1318777/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is there anything better than getting fully immersed in your favorite titles, feeling like you’re part of the game? A standard 16:9 screen is sadly not made for that, and if you don’t want to get pulled out right when things get good, going ultrawide is the solution.</p>
<p>We know upgrades like this can feel overwhelming, since a good-sized ultrawide screen from a known brand can easily run you over $1,600, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4584/">but that changes today. Thanks to Prime Day, the Samsung 49-inch Odyssey OLED G93SC curved gaming monitor is 44% off on Amazon, dropping the price to $900.</a> That’s one of the lowest prices we’ve ever seen on this wild screen, and with a $700 discount, it’s not a deal that’s likely to last long.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4584/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Screen With Lifelike Visuals</h2>
<p>It’s a beast at 49 inches, offering brilliant colors, deeper contrast, and richer tones for lifelike visuals. More pixels per inch give you better detail, so you’re not sacrificing sharpness for size. The screen is as wide as two QHD monitors side by side, minus the dual setup fuss, with the 1800R curve wrapping around your field of vision for a distraction-free gaming or streaming experience. Dark colors come through clearly as well, thanks to QD-OLED technology and DisplayHDR True Black 400 support. Translation: better visibility even in low-light scenes; perfect for spotting the bad guys hiding in the dark and keeping an eye on shadows.</p>
<p>You’re also getting a 240Hz refresh rate and a 0.03ms response time to keep things smooth. Plus, with both NVIDIA G-Sync compatibility and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, screen tearing and input lag won’t be an issue either. Connectivity-wise, you’re covered with HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort, and a built-in USB hub. There’s also an Auto Source Switch+ that can detect when the connected devices are turned on and switch over automatically.</p>



<p>For when you’re in the mood for some multitasking, the Picture-by-Picture mode splits the screen in half. Maybe use one for video calls, while having work documents and the browser open on the second. Or maybe stream your favorite content on one side while editing on the other? The possibilities are endless.</p>
<p>Even with all this, the overall design stays minimal. It’s just 4.5mm thick at its thinnest point, which makes it one of the slimmest OLED panels in this range.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4584/"> It’s still a bit of an investment at $900, but this deal brings it into a much more approachable range than we usually see.</a></p>

              <p>Losing your keys, wallet or luggage ranks among the most frustrating daily experiences. Apple’s AirTag solves this problem in a way no competitor can match, thanks to the <em>Find My</em> network powered by hundreds of millions of Apple devices worldwide. This massive network means your lost item can be located almost anywhere, even if it’s miles away from your own iPhone.</p>
<p>For Prime Big Deal Day, Amazon has dropped AirTag prices to record lows. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">4-pack now costs just $64, down from $99</a>: Since a single AirTag normally sells for $29, <strong>this deal essentially gives you almost two free AirTags</strong>. If you only need one, the single AirTag is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4215/">also at an all-time low of $19, down from $29</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4215/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See Single AirTag at Amazon</a></p>

<p>AirTags function by using Apple’s Find My network, <strong>a group of all iPhones, iPads, and Macs with their location services running</strong>. When you flag an AirTag lost, other <strong>Apple devices running Bluetooth proximity</strong> to it can pick up its Bluetooth signal and report its location anonymously back to yours. It all occurs entirely behind the scenes without notification of the other device’s owner, and all of your location information stays encrypted and private. By virtue of its massive scale, your AirTag becomes locatable even in isolated regions, if someone running an Apple device wanders by.</p>
<h2>Precision Location Detection and Privacy-Aware Design</h2>
<p>Installing an AirTag is a matter of seconds. You just point it near your iPhone or iPad, tap to pair and tag it to an item like your keys or backpack. The U1 chip in newer iPhones powers Precision Finding employs ultra-wideband technology and walks you straight to your AirTag with onscreen arrows and haptic indicators. As you approach, your iPhone displays the exact distance and direction and turns a potentially frantic search into a mere follow-the-arrows endeavor.</p>



<p>Each AirTag uses a <strong>typical CR2032 replaceable battery</strong>, which runs for approximately a year with average use. You’ll receive a notification when it’s running low, and it’s a breeze to replace it by pressing down and twisting off the stainless steel back case. The <strong>AirTag is water- and dust-resistant IP67</strong> so it’s fine being submerged for 30 minutes for a distance of a meter of water.</p>
<p>Privacy features are built into the core design: If an unknown AirTag is traveling with you, your iPhone alerts you automatically. Android users can also detect nearby AirTags using Apple’s Tracker Detect app. The AirTag will also play a sound if it’s been separated from its owner for an extended period, preventing unwanted tracking. These safeguards address privacy concerns while maintaining the device’s usefulness for legitimate tracking.</p>



<p>The thin, lightweight design is just 1.26 inches across and 0.31 inches deep, tiny enough to slip into a wallet’s card slot or affix to a keychain. The shiny stainless steel face is customizable with free engraving if you order directly from Apple, but Amazon’s sale does not include it.</p>
<p>The 4-pack is nicely priced for families, couples, or individuals having several things they’d like to monitor. Put one on your keys, a second on your wallet, a third on your backpack, and maintain a fourth as a spare for your suitcase when traveling. For $64 for four during your Prime Big Deal Day sale, you’re really spending less money per AirTag than ever before.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-25000mah-100w-laptop-power-bank-is-selling-for-peanuts-amazon-is-rushing-to-clear-its-inventory-2000632554</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-25-000mah-100w-laptop-power-bank-is-selling-for-peanuts-amazon-is-rushing-to-clear-its-inventory.1318726/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Small power banks that charge your phone are handy, but did you know power banks exist for laptops too? They’re less common but incredibly practical, especially since they can charge your phone and other devices at the same time. Running out of battery during a flight or during a long day away from outlets becomes a non-issue when you have serious charging capacity in your bag. For Prime Big Deal Day, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3789/">has dropped the price on the most popular Anker (25,000mAh, 100W) laptop power bank to $89, down from $134</a>. That’s a $45 discount and an all-time low for this Anker model, <strong>available exclusively to Prime members</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3789/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Anker power bank <strong>boasts an enormous capacity of 25,000mAh</strong> which equates to usable real-world powering of your devices. For context, it’s enough to give a full charge to a MacBook Air, enough to supply your iPhone several full charges or keep your tablet going for hours of continuous use. With a 90Wh rating, it also falls within airline requirements for personal protective devices for your carry-ons, so it’s permissible to bring it onboard your flights.</p>
<h2>Triple 100W USB-C Ports Upgrade Your Charging Experience</h2>
<p>The <strong>crown jewel here is the three USB-C ports</strong>, each of which is capable of dispensing a <strong>whopping 100W of power</strong>. That’s important because newer laptops require serious power to charge at a full speed. A MacBook Pro 16-inch, say, requires about 96W for best-in-class charging. With 100W per port, you’ll be able to charge your laptop at full speed, <strong>all while powering other devices simultaneously.</strong></p>



<p>The built-in cables rectify one of the greatest nuisances of power banks: forgetting or misplacing charging cables. <strong>Anker ships two USB-C cables embedded on the power bank itself</strong>. One of them reaches a distance of up to 2.3 feet and gives you a degree of mobility when outlets are centralized or when you want to access your device as it charges. This retractable cable is rated for more than 20,000 times of retraction so it should not readily fail due to wear and tear. The other cable is 0.98 feet long and also serves as a strap for carrying, designed to withstand over 20,000 bends. Such a dual purpose creates durability and portability.</p>
<p>Along with the built-in cabling, there are also other sources of charging <strong>available in the form of a USB-A port and a second USB-C port</strong>, for a<strong> total of four devices being charged simultaneously</strong>. This setup is best for traveling families or professionals who carry multiple devices along. You may charge your laptop off one built-in cabling, your cell phone off the other, your wireless headsets off the USB-A port and a smartwatch off the additional USB-C port.</p>



<p>Recharging of the power bank itself is incredibly quick due to a 100W ultra-fast recharging feature. It achieves a capacity of being at a 30% state by being plugged into a charger of 100W within a total of 22 minutes. <strong>Recharging takes a total of about 90 minutes</strong>&nbsp;so keep it topped off during your morning getting-ready process or lunchtime.</p>
<p>As a Prime member for $89 during this Prime Big Deal Day sale, you’re getting laptop-level powering capability at a budget-friendly cost.</p>

              <p>Will the jump button come back in the next <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>? Will<em> Battlefield 6</em> really work right out of the box? Can <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em> prevent the further atomization of modern society? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. I am still thinking about Xbox and how much Microsoft keeps fumbling the bag. And I’m <a href="https://x.com/JamiesAct/status/1975227593763999973">apparently not</a> <a href="https://x.com/JamiesAct/status/1975244040896716915">the only</a> <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1975556977536475617">one</a>. But for real: what’s going on <a href="https://x.com/Omnipotentgam0r/status/1974904157829321171">with those Walmart displays</a>?</p> <h2>The Saudi Arabia <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em> DLC will let you manually jump</h2>  <p><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-arabia">Reportedly funded by</a> Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman Al Saud, the <em>Valley of Memory</em> DLC is a free major update for the 2023 game that takes Basim to the AlUla region in search of his long-lost father. It includes a new skill, tool customization, difficulty levels, and replaybale missions and challenges. The most important change to me, however, is the addition of a manual jump to add more depth to the parkour. The stealth action series hasn’t had a dedicated jump button since <em>Unity</em> as movement became more streamlined and automated. Hopefully, the experiment pays dividends in <em>Valley of Memory</em> and paves the way for more complex parkour in the next big <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> sequel.</p>

 <h2><em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake is reportedly coming to PS Plus this month</h2> <p>That’s according <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ce-remake-sorti-en-excluvisite-console-sur-ps5-va-debarquer-sur-le-ps-plus-extra-60622">to billbil-kun at Dealabs</a>, who says last year’s PS5 exclusive will be arriving as part of the Extra and Premium tiers later this month. It arrives alongside <em>Alan Wake 2</em> on PS Plus Essential and <em>The </em><em>Last of Us Part 2</em> on Extra and Premium. Not a bad haul for this year’s Halloween.</p>

 <h2>Physical copies of <em>Battlefield 6</em> are out early and include at least part of the game on the actual disc</h2>   <p>Bucking recent trends, <em>Battlefield 6</em> apparently comes with the actual game on the disc, at least on PS5. A fan on Reddit claims the servers are live and the campaign and multiplayer both work. You can preview the game’s full day-one update and all of the over 200 changes it makes <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1975214752314937744">here</a>.</p>

 <h2>Funcom layoffs hit <em>Metal Hellsinger</em> studio</h2> <p>The Outsiders, a Funcom studio based in Stockholm, Sweden, is shutting down, founder and creative director David Goldfarb <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/locust9.bsky.social/post/3m2jumlqlmc2m">announced yesterday</a>. The team had previously produced the rhythm-based demonic FPS <em>Hellsinger</em> which sold one million copies. ” It will always be a high point for me personally and I will be forever grateful we got to make it and for the wonderful team and partnerships that made it happen,” he wrote.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Marathon</i>, Bungie’s upcoming hero extraction shooter, is getting another invite-only test soon. The test will run from October 22 to 27, and <a href="http://www.bungie.net/7/cen/News/Article/techtestapply">folks can sign up right here</a>. Things haven’t gone great for <i>Marathon</i> thus far, but following the <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-alpha-review-impressions-bungie-extraction-fps-1851777775">disappointing reception</a> of the first alpha test, and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-art-alpha-gameplay-posters-antireal-1851780911">embarrassing accusations of plagiarism</a>, it’ll be interesting to see what tweaks Bungie has made and just what the game is shaping up to be.</p> <p>Revealed back in 2023 with a very impressive cinematic trailer, <i>Marathon</i> is a reboot of <a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-marathon-halo-destiny-extraction-shooter-1850480259">Bungie’s classic <i>Doom</i>-like shooter</a> from the ‘90s. It’s also Bungie’s first new shooter since it made the pivot to <i>Destiny</i> in the early 2010s, following its departure from Microsoft and the <i>Halo</i> series.</p>

 <h2>There’s still no release date for <i>Marathon</i>, and the game has a lot to prove to fans</h2> <p><i>Marathon</i> was originally slated to release for current-gen consoles and PC on September 23, 2025. That date has come and gone. Unfortunately for Bungie, folks didn’t find the game terribly fun during the alpha earlier this year, and so the studio made the decision to indefinitely delay its release. The drab environments didn’t really speak to Bungie’s artistic strengths, and the hero shooter element (which I, a huge extraction shooter fan, <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-runner-extraction-hardcore-1851775956">tried to be open-minded</a> about) still seems like an odd fit.</p>

Matches mostly consisted of fights with the same repetitive robots instead of incorporating the more alluring palette of creature designs the <i>Marathon</i> franchise has.</p>

 <p>We do know that the upcoming closed test will let players try out a new feature: Proximity chat, which allows you to hear other players’ voice chatter only when you’re near them. Bungie initially wanted to avoid using this, as the studio felt it was ripe for toxicity and abuse. While proximity chat can result in, well, <a href="https://kotaku.com/warzone-2-features-proximity-chat-gulag-contracts-mw2-1849793098">rather silly situations in a shooter</a>, it’s a pretty important feature in a PvPvE game; overhearing nearby players not only adds a bit of voyeuristic drama, but it can also help you avoid getting jumped sometimes.</p>

 <p>The closed test will also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-marathon-details-leak-from-latest-closed-test/">feature some tweaks to TTK (time-to-kill) as well</a>. We’ll see if this is enough to start rehabilitating <i>Marathon</i>’s image for folks.</p> <h2>It’s been a real cluster-f over at Bungie from the sounds of things</h2> <p>Conversations about the nuances of what does and doesn’t work in <i>Marathon</i> were all pushed to the side when it was revealed that Bungie had lifted designs from artist antire.al without permission or acknowledgement.</p>

 <p>Bungie had its explanations for how the artist’s work made it into its game, essentially saying that it was material used for inspiration and research that found its way into production pipelines, and thus made it into the game. The studio blamed this oversight on a former employee and promised a full review of all its assets to be sure this wouldn’t happen again.</p>

Here’s hoping the test later this month shows that it’s moving in the right direction.</p>

The 1TB version — normally $135 — is now down to $80 while the 2TB version — normally $240 — is now down to just $122. That’s a savings of up to $188.</p>
<p>File sizes for AAA video games have been surpassing behemoth levels for some time now. Look at something like <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>. It requires a whopping 150GB of your storage to install. And that’s a game from 2018. I can’t even begin to imagine what absurd size requirement Rockstar’s upcoming&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> will have.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4568/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This PCIe Gen4 2230 NVMe M.2 SSD is smaller than your standard internal SSDs and that’s because it is designed with PC gaming handhelds in mind to help you bring your whole game library with you when you hit the road.</p>
<p>The Steam Deck has three models, each with a different internal capacity. The LCD version of the Steam Deck only comes with 256GB while with the OLED, you have a choice of 512GB or 1TB. The ROG Ally and all new ROG Xbox Ally each come with 512GB. If those numbers aren’t enough for the gaming you want to do on the go, then you can upgrade with the Crucial P310 SSD.&nbsp;Installation is easy and should only take you about five minutes of your time to get you started gaming with way more storage.</p>
<p>While the Crucial P310 SSD is made with the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Ally in mind, it is additionally compatible with certain laptops such as the Microsoft Surface or select Dell models.</p>



<h2>Extreme Performance</h2>
<p>The Crucial gaming SSD is capable of read and write speeds of up to 7,100 MB/s. You can expect fast load times. Power efficiency is always good to have with PC hardware both for environmental reasons and to keep the electric bill down. Here, though, there is an added benefit. Game longer. Better power efficiency means easier on the battery means you can play for longer before it dies.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4568/">For a limited time, you can expand the storage on your PC gaming handheld to a large capacity of either 1TB or 2TB with the Crucial P310 internal SSD.</a> The 1TB is down 41% to $80 while the 2TB is down 49% to $122.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I finally broke the seal on </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>this past week because I am a mark for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-fortnite-skins-rumi-mira-zoey-event-2000630221"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>and its trio of monster-slaying idols. Epic fast-tracked skins, cosmetics, and a reskinned mode themed around Netflix’s animated musical, and I paid for my first V-Bucks to play as Rumi and fight hordes of demons with shotguns and SMGs. Friends, it gave me the ick. I loathe </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>’s brand of artless, cross-promotional excess, and even a solid social hub and battle royale can’t wash that away for me. You know what can, though? Watching the singing voices of Huntr/x get into </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> now that their characters are in the game.</span></p> <p><span>Rei Ami, the singing voice of Huntr/x’s rapper Zoey, has been campaigning for a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>X </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>collaboration for months, and even </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@rei.ami/video/7555327877944839455"><span>got to reveal her character’s skin ahead of the crossover’s launch</span></a><span>. Now that she’s finally got it, she’s been playing </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>on streams and TikTok Lives as Zoey, and I haven’t seen a pop-off as hype as the first time she got a Victory Royale in the skin in a minute. My girl is out here emoting in real life.</span></p>

   <p><span>Ejae and Audrey Nuna, the singing voices for Rumi and Mira, aren’t </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>players, but they did shoot a promo video reacting to the skins in which the group jokes about taking a class on how to play Epic’s game.</span></p>

   <p><span>Well, it looks like those lessons are happening. Rei Ami posted a video during their ongoing promotional tour for </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters,</span></i><span> showing them spending some of their spare time playing </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>. Ejae managed to get 36th place in her first battle royale match as Rumi, though she was killed by another player called WetPickle4996. I want to talk to that player. Do they know they just destroyed the Honmoon?</span></p>    <p><span>I’m obsessed with this, and I’m waiting for some talented animators and artists to draw Zoey teaching Rumi and Mira how to play </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> like a new fandom in-joke. Huntr/x probably doesn’t have that much time to game these days, though, as the group is about to make their live debut on </span><i><span>The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon</span></i><span> as the musical guest. The trio is </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bzuUNSf0bCg"><span>performing “Golden” on tonight’s episode</span></a><span>.</span></p>
