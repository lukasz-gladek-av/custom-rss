              <p>InXile Entertainment’s next game is the first-person steampunk RPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-xboxs-big-summer-2025-showcase-1851784007"><i>Clockwork Revolution</i></a>. Studio founder Brian Fargo, who’s leading the project, recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tjeRn2eA3y4">sat down with YouTuber MrMattyPlays</a> for a deep-dive interview about his long career and his take on current hot topics in the video game industry like generative AI and LLM technology, which the Xbox studio’s parent company is currently investing $80 billion in. Has InXile embraced it in a similar fashion? “For certain things, but but I’m very keen to what are the ethical uses of it?” he said. “I am worried about job loss.”</p> <p>Fargo, whose career in games dates back to the 1980s when he worked on influential role-playing games like&nbsp;<em>The Bard’s Tale&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Wasteland</em>, laid out <a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-baldurs-gate-3-nier-automata-ai-chatgpt-1851778257">a couple of different use cases</a> he foresees for tools like ChatGPT, but distinguished them from things like using generative AI to plagiarize the creative output of other artists. “These games…we’re close to about the same word count as the Bible, basically, and so that’s a lot of data no human can get in in its head,” he said. “So would I like an LLM to be able to query: ‘How many times did [inaudible] talk?’ ‘How many times have we used this skill?’ Like there’s some things that I would want to query the information to make sure so I see that.”</p> <p>The veteran studio head said he also uses generative AI for inspiration they way he might visit a museum or scroll through people’s Deviant Art pages, but that only commissioned work is used in the actual production process. Other uses Fargo pointed to were cleaning up motion capture footage and potentially voicing quick pickup lines added to a game at the last minute if the actor agrees to it and is paid extra but is otherwise unable to make it into the studio. That part sounds in line <a href="https://kotaku.com/sag-aftra-strike-voice-actor-game-darth-vader-1851784189">with what SAG-AFTRA members settled on</a> in a new contract after months on strike.</p> <p>“Can we use it for, like, mundane tasks that nobody wants to do so the human creativity can soar?” Fargo said. “Well, I think that’s kind of cool. I don’t think anybody wants to do some of these things. Do we really want humans going through checking for punctuation? You know, I mean, I don’t have it doing it right now, but that would seem like I’d rather have those same people going, ‘I have a great idea to to make this scene far better.’ Like that, I’d rather have the minds thinking about the good stuff.”</p>  <p>While the <em>Clockwork Revolution</em> director wasn’t as hypercritical of AI and the hype around it as some game developers have been, he also came off as more cautious than others within Microsoft, including CEO Satya Nadella. Nadella recently boasted that <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/29/satya-nadella-says-as-much-as-30percent-of-microsoft-code-is-written-by-ai.html">30 percent</a> of Microsoft code is written by AI, and revealed earlier this year that <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-15/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-on-his-ai-efforts-and-openai-partnership">he uses multiple AI assistants</a> to get him through his day. The company is pushing its use in gaming as well, rolling out models that can <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/introducing-muse-our-first-generative-ai-model-designed-for-gameplay-ideation/">hallucinate gameplay</a> or watch you play games and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/719668/microsoft-xbox-gaming-copilot-windows-game-bar-beta-test">Google tips for them</a>. A Copilot add-on for Xbox is already being tested on PC.</p>

              <p><span>One thing rich people love to do is miss the point. Entire multimedia franchises are built as critiques of powerful people using their money and influence to put the average Joe through some hellish trial for their own amusement, and then rich folks are like, “What if I remade that?” Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast, who has made a lot of YouTube content out of putting people in viral simulations of outlandish competitions or even dangerous situations with the promise of a cash prize, has already made a recreation of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeasts-irl-squid-game-sees-contestants-just-running-t-1848134062"><i><span>Squid Game</span></i></a><span>, the hugely popular Netflix series which was intended to be a commentary on the power the wealthy wield over the impoverished. Now, he’s apparently considering doing the same for </span><i><span>The Hunger Games</span></i><span>, a dystopian franchise about a society where the wealthy and powerful who reside in the Capitol treat the common citizen like cattle and make them kill each other for sport.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><i><span>The Today Show</span></i><span>, Donaldson was seemingly caught off-guard when the interviewer asked him about his plans for a </span><i><span>Hunger Games</span></i><span> recreation. He did say that the idea would “obviously” not pit people against one another in a fight to the death, with the concept instead being to put “potentially 26 random people” on an island and have them use something like laser tag guns instead of real weapons to eliminate each other, with the last person standing winning a million dollars.</span></p>    <p><span>“I think that would absolutely crush because yes, we recreated </span><i><span>Squid Game</span></i><span>, but we also rebuilt Willy Wonka’s Chocolate Factory,” Donaldson said on </span><i><span>The Today Show</span></i><span>. “I have a chocolate company, and we gave golden tickets and brought people out, and people loved it. A lot of times, we just bring these fictional ideas to life, and people love seeing it.”</span></p> <p><span>Donaldson isn’t wrong that people love to experience a facsimile of their favorite fictional worlds. It’s why theme parks are so popular, and you can find an escape room based on all your favorite horror franchises. I’m sure his team will have no shortage of people volunteering as tribute, but I still think that recreating these stories, even if they aren’t actually putting people in deadly situations, involves taking advantage of those in need in order to profit from the theater and spectacle of it all. MrBeast has </span><a href="https://www.beastphilanthropy.org/"><span>used his position to do a lot of good</span></a><span>, but I can’t help feeling like using </span><i><span>The Hunger Games</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Squid Game</span></i><span> as reference points for your real-world game shows just makes everyone involved look like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-slur-n-word-clip-2017-controversy-explained-1851612313"><span>caricatures of the sadistic game makers</span></a><span> these dystopian stories are meant to critique.</span></p>
