That could all start changing fast. Amazon now has full creative control over the blockbuster spy series after hashing out a deal with its long-time producers, and founder Jeff Bezos is already asking fans who should play 007 next. <br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Creative control for the decades-spanning series of films adapting the Ian Fleming books previously rested with Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, whose father produced the first Bond film,<em> Dr. No</em>, back in 1962. His daughter and stepson will remain a part of the franchise moving forward but will no longer have veto power over its future direction and new films. </p><p>Bezos, who helped oversee the evolution of Amazon into a multi-media conglomerate that made inroads into online streaming and film with the acquisition of MGM Studios in 2022, immediately <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/JeffBezos/status/1892590064766484622&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/JeffBezos/status/1892590064766484622" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to social media</a></span> to ask fans who they want to see don the infamous MI6 agent’s black tuxedo and tie next. </p><p>The names of several A-list male British actors started flooding in, including Henry Cavill (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/henry-cavill-james-bond-homelander-audition-youtube-1851757227?_gl=1*1h6749h*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDA3ODYzNy41MDEuMC4xNzQwMDc4NjQwLjU3LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/henry-cavill-james-bond-homelander-audition-youtube-1851757227?_gl=1*1h6749h*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MDA3ODYzNy41MDEuMC4xNzQwMDc4NjQwLjU3LjAuMA..">you can watch his earlier audition for the role here</a></span>), Michael Fassbender, Tom Hardy, and Theo James.

Whoever Amazon selects will likely be young enough to continue as the face of the franchise for several films. </p><p>Craig was in the role for roughly 15 years, beginning with 2006's <em>Casino Royale</em>. Prior to that it was Pierce Brosnan (four films in seven years) and Timothy Dalton (two films in just two years). While Sean Connery was the first and best-known<em> James Bond</em>, it was Roger Moore who appeared in the most Bond films total, beginning with 1973's <em>Live and Let Die</em> and ending with 1985's <em>A View To A Kill</em>.</p><p>Even if Amazon does complete casting in short order, it will likely still be a few years until an actual movie is ready. The longest Bond has ever been on hiatus is six years, but this break is likely to eclipse that ahead of the franchise’s new era under the control of Amazon.
