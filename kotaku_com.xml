              <p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/2018/07/12/longtime-bioware-vet-james-ohlen-retires-from-games-industry">James Ohlen</a> joined Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/james-ohlen-joins-wizards-of-the-coast">back in 2019</a> after a 22-year stint at BioWare to create a new IP for the Hasbro-owned tabletop gaming company. Six years later, after cofounding Archetype Entertainment to ship a very <em>Mass Effect</em>-looking RPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/exodus-trailer-scifi-rpg-matthew-mcconaughey-1851674488">called <em>Exodus</em></a>, he’ll no longer be head of the studio when the game eventually ships in 2027.</p> <p>“At this stage, James felt his work on the game was complete and that the polishing and tuning were in great hands with the team,” Hasbro VP of Communications Abby Hodes <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-17/hasbro-hires-new-video-game-boss-as-exodus-studio-head-steps-down?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NjAwNjU2MywiZXhwIjoxNzY2NjExMzYzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0ZOOEpLSVAzSlQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.DsXTL5uiyiElHnbXg3lBhhoGNbYoIOcplrfvRhfCrLw">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a> in a statement. She added that Ohlen asked to “shift his creative focus” and would remain a consultant for the company on tabletop gaming.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is James Ohlen. He was the lead designer for Baldur's Gate 1 &amp; 2, Dragon Age: Origins, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and now he's making EXODUS.</p> <p>He has been referred to as the "godfather of Bioware design".

It’s an expensive-looking game from a brand new studio that began work during the pandemic, which might be part of why the delayed project is still a couple of years from launching.</p>

 <p>But <em>Exodus</em> isn’t just the potential start of a new franchise, it’s an entire world that Hasbro wants to use as a springboard for other products. Wizards released an <em>Exodus</em> <a href="https://ttrpg.store.exodusgame.com/?fbclid=PAQ0xDSwMR2gNleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABp9kE9hc3UJPQ0PP0i_inu10Pi6VbPjeWCFVkVhGOOKLvOciRaubmZ8vQQP9g_aem_OILHflwjwSOk5SahfUXFWw">TTRPG book</a> earlier this year and would no doubt love to look at trading card and TV spin-offs if the game eventually becomes a <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>-like hit.</p> <p>Bloomberg also reports that Ohlen stepping down comes alongside Blizzard veteran and <a href="https://kotaku.com/former-blizzard-boss-mike-morhaime-launches-dreamhaven-1845152912">Dreamhaven</a> co-founder Paul Della Bitta becoming head of Wizards’ Digital Ventures division underneath fellow Blizzard veteran John Hight. Plenty of other BioWare veterans still remain at Archetype, including Chad Robertson and Drew Karpyshyn.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Here Are 10 Great RPGs You Can Add To Your Collection For Surprisingly Cheap]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/rpg-sale-cheap-ff12-kingdom-come-2-ps5-switch-2000653958</link>
            <guid>1386577</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This time of year makes me miss being a kid and <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-s-the-best-or-worst-gaming-gift-youve-ever-recei-1845928462">unwrapping a cool new RPG</a> I could then spend the winter quietly toiling through. Not an internet guide in sight. Just a fan living in the moment. So I’m always on the lookout to see what games are getting discounted during the holiday sell-off in case there are one or two things I can pick up and add to my physical collection for cheap. I might even wrap them and put them in a stocking or under the tree and pretend they’re from Santa.</p> <p>Here are a few of the good deals out there so far. I’ll be on the lookout for more and will update the list if I find them. Please feel free to share any good ones you’ve spotted in the comments as well.</p> <h2><em>Visons of Mana&nbsp;</em></h2> <p>The whimsical action-RPG is currently <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/visions-of-mana-playstation-5/">just $20 everywhere</a> across both PS5 and Xbox Series X|S (physical only). It’s a surprisingly decent stab at reinvigorating the <em>Mana</em> franchise after more than a decade without a real sequel.</p>

 <h2><em>Final Fantasy 16</em></h2> <p>This one’s also $20 <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/final-fantasy-xvi-standard-edition-playstation-5/JXL9RG8LSC">at most stores</a> this week, a steal for a 2023 GOTY contender that shines despite its most glaring flaws. The music, performances, and cinematic boss fights are all top-tier and the action feels great even when it gets repetitive.</p>

 <h2><em>Unicorn Overlord</em></h2> <p>This Vanillaware strategy RPG also gets a bit repetitive in the back half but is worth it for the current price of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unicorn-Overlord/dp/B0CJ4KF5J7?tag=kotaku01-20">just $25 across PS5 and Switch</a>. The story makes no sense but the art is exceptional and the mash-up of turn-based combat and RTS micro-management is enough to keep you powering through.</p>

 <h2><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em></h2> <p>I’m still not very far in Warhorse Studios’ open-world immersive sim but I’m liking it a lot more than the first game. It’s also surprisingly cheap for a 2025 Game Awards nominee. It’s just $40 for PS5 and only $30 for Xbox. The PS5 version’s also been going <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/playstation-5/products/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii---playstation-5/408117.html">in and out of stock</a> at GameStop for the same lower price.</p>

 <h2><em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em></h2> <p>Don’t let the mobile game origins fool you. <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em> is the good stuff. Mistwalker’s Hironobu Sakaguchi channels his early <em>Final Fantasy</em> roots to deliver a slick turn-based adventure that feels like it would have been right at home on the PS1. Amazon has the PS5 and Switch copies for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FANTASIAN-Neo-Dimension/dp/B0DHYGHQCJ?tag=kotaku01-20">just $30</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection</em></h2> <p>I’ve been meaning to pick this one up for a while and for some reason it’s just $20 right now <a href="http://Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection">on Amazon</a>. The games themselves are very similar but the hybrid strategy gameplay remains peak Game Boy Advance nostalgia.</p> <h2><em>Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age</em></h2> <p>I feel like <em>FF12</em> is a bit underrated these days. It’s pound-for-pound one of the densest entries in the series and the remaster does an excellent job of polishing up the PS2 visuals and improving some of the job board progression to make it feel more like a familiar job-based MMO system. It’s only $25 on both PS5 and Switch <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-XII-THE-ZODIAC-AGE/dp/B01GOQHDJ4?tag=kotaku01-20">at the moment</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster</em></h2> <p>Is the Pixel Remaster collection overpriced? Yes. Are the smoothmaster visuals a bummer? Also yes. But you can’t get too picky about owning a piece of history. Adding it to your collection <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-I-VI-Pixel-Remaster-Collection/dp/B0DCKFZ1V6?tag=kotaku01-20">for just $40</a> isn’t bad.</p> <h2><em>Super Mario RPG</em></h2> <p>You’ll probably never own the original SNES version of <em>Super Mario RPG</em>. Used copies start at $50. Nice ones are quite a bit more. The Switch remaster, which looks excellent and improves combat with a new ultimate system, is a great pickup <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nintendo-switch/products/super-mario-rpg---nintendo-switch/396423.html">at just $25 right now</a>.</p> <h2><em>Persona 3 Reload</em></h2> <p>The physical version for PS5 is currently just $17 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Persona-3-Reload-Standard-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CGFCC193?tag=kotaku01-20">Amazon</a> and only $25 a <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/persona-3-reload-launch-edition-playstation-5/">Best Buy</a>. It’s a stellar remake and probably my favorite game in the series at this point. Not as flashy as <em>Persona 5</em> but with way better melancholy teen vibes.</p>

              <p><span>Jonathan Bailey, the actor who plays </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wicked-for-good-scarecrow-fiyero-jonathan-bailey-reaction-2000646940"><span>Fiyero in the </span><i><span>Wicked </span></i><span>movies</span></a><span> and was </span><i><span>People</span></i><span>’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jonathan-bailey-sexiest-man-alive-people-final-fantasy-2000641145"><span>Sexiest Man Alive</span></a><span> for 2025, also voices a cat boy in </span><i><span>Final Fantasy XIV </span></i><span>named G’raha Tia. Bailey has really blown up in the years since he took on the role in Square Enix’s MMO, with featured roles in both </span><i><span>Wicked: For Good </span></i><span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-is-it-good-reboot-jp-film-1851785757"><i><span>Jurassic World: Rebirth</span></i></a><span> helping to make him the </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/columns/jonathan-bailey-top-grossing-actor-wicked-jurassic-world-1236610431/"><span>top-grossing actor</span></a><span> of 2025. But even as Bailey has become a household name, G’raha Tia has remained a major character in </span><i><span>FFXIV</span></i><span>. Now, the MMO has released its 7.4 update, and based on the way Fiyero’s voice sounds, fans are unsure if Bailey is still hopping into the booth for Square Enix.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1pnzopb/is_it_just_me_or_does_graha_tia/"><span>theories</span></a><span> about why G’raha sounds a little different this patch range from Bailey maybe being sick during his recording sessions, to him </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1pnzr6b/jonathan_bailey_in_74/"><span>having used a subpar mic</span></a><span>, to him having been recast due to scheduling issues as he’s busy promoting </span><i><span>Wicked: For Good </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Jurassic World</span></i><span>. However, neither Square Enix nor Bailey has said anything about the actor dropping the role. If you listen to some of the comparisons between the new material and the character’s previously existing dialogue, the difference can sound subtle. Still, it’s enough that I can hear why someone who has been listening to this character for years might think he sounds different. We’ve reached out to Square Enix and Bailey for comment on the situation, and will update the story if we hear back.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">So I did a quick little comparison between 7.0 and 7.4 G'raha Tia, it seems that he HAS NOT been recast, I just think he's recording his lines from his phone or a subpar mic setup, the EQ is sorta way more treble-y, when his voice is usually bassy with the studio mics they use. <a href="https://t.co/AYYZYadgWU">pic.twitter.com/AYYZYadgWU</a></p> <p>— Josefumi 🎙️ (@JosefumiVO) <a href="https://twitter.com/JosefumiVO/status/2000983922734457059?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">NO ONE TALK TO ME IM CURRENTLY IN MOURNING ROGHT NOW <a href="https://t.co/feYKV6ssvr">pic.twitter.com/feYKV6ssvr</a></p> <p>— 🦦 (@gothgirlswag) <a href="https://twitter.com/gothgirlswag/status/2000990491610112012?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>Bailey has been pretty open about how much he enjoys the role. Here’s a clip of him talking about how he had to record his </span><i><span>Final Fantasy XIV</span></i><span> lines in between shows while he was performing in the revival of </span><i><span>Company</span></i><span> from 2018 to 2019.</span></p>   <p><span>If Bailey was recast for the patch, hopefully it’s just a temporary measure until he’s done promoting </span><i><span>Wicked </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Jurassic Park</span></i><span>…and doing sexy photoshoots for the cover of </span><i><span>People</span></i><span>.</span></p>

              <p>Every classic game deserves a wild Game Boy version. Roblox has to clean up its platform predator problem before it can get a Marvel collab. And a record-breaking Charizard sale has me thinking of every paper collectible I ever threw in the trash. Which presents am I currently buying my children that might one day be worth a small fortune? Or is the nostalgia-fueled millennial collectible market just another bubble everyone will forget about a decade from now?</p> <p>Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture, which just broke its own record for the latest in the day it’s ever been published. Not quite as impressive as the Game Awards breaking its previous record for viewership with <a href="https://t.co/S6gFmiMa9w">over 170 million livestreams for this year’s show</a>, but who’s counting?</p>

 <h2>An incredible<em> Resident Evil</em> demake just resurfaced for the holidays</h2> <p>London-based studio HotGen’s journey to get a PS1 game playable on Game Boy Color was left incomplete, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-98-complete-version-of-the-cancelled-game-boy-color-resident-evil-port-has-been-shared-online/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a>. But preservationists <em>Games That Weren’t</em> has now shared what appears to be an almost entirely playable build of the fascinating curio from the turn of the century.</p>

 <p>“[We’ve] now preserved a final version of [the] game at the point of cancellation and we have it here for you today to check out thanks to Pete Frith providing everything,” the group <a href="https://twitter.com/fgasking/status/2001216784850927920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2001216784850927920%7Ctwgr%5E8948a42e68905b40041ecb0f0d37a081003ca5cc%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php">announced on X today</a>. “Again, it isn’t 100% complete (perhaps now 98% – based on Pete’s estimates) – but there is more content and it *might* actually now be completable. Due to time constraints, we’ve not been able to sit and play through the title fully to confirm, as there might be scenes that glitch/bug out – if you find that it is, please do let us know!”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our first big Christmas update is with an amazing recovery of the final build of Resident Evil on Gameboy Color. Hotgen's impressive conversion that got canned. This is much closer to completion, and seems completable too. Lots to discover!<a href="https://t.co/PqnSERyZuP">https://t.co/PqnSERyZuP</a> <a href="https://t.co/u2sPODb7dS">pic.twitter.com/u2sPODb7dS</a></p> <p>— Games That Weren't (@fgasking) <a href="https://twitter.com/fgasking/status/2001216784850927920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>Even Disney is quietly boycotting Roblox</h2> <p>The company, which was willing to license its IP to OpenAI and invest $1 billion in stock in the tech company, is not willing to put Mickey Mouse in a potential petting room. “Sources have told <em>Variety</em> this is not just because of Disney’s revenue tied to Epic, but because Disney does not think Roblox is a safe platform at this time,” <em>Variety</em> <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/roblox-fortnite-hollywood-collabs-safety-1236597852/">reported this week</a>.</p>

 <p>Meanwhile, a Roblox ban in countries like Russia has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/russian-ban-roblox-gaming-platform-sparks-rare-protest-2025-12-14/">provoked a rare outburst of protest</a>. Players there recently held up signs saying “Hands off Roblox” and “Roblox is the victim of the digital Iron Curtain.” Pissing off gamers is basically the 2025 equivalent of invading Russia during the winter.</p>

 <h2>A mint-condition Charizard card just sold for half a million at auction</h2> <p>The PSA 10 First Edition Base Set Charizard went for $550,000 including the buyer’s premium <a href="https://comics.ha.com/heritage-auctions-press-releases-and-news/-550-000-psa-10-charizard-breaks-record-leads-all-time-high-5.27-million-total-at-heritage-trading-card-games-auction.s?releaseId=5371">at a recent Heritage auction</a>. It breaks the <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game/news/charizard-holo-shadowless-pokemon-card-auctioned">previous record</a> of $420,000 set back in 2022, though it’s still a pittance compared to the $5 million an Illustrator Pikachu <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/content/article/The-20-Most-Expensive-Pok%C3%A9mon-Cards-Ever/4e15f8c9-b6eb-49c9-a5ee-3dc806693c3e/">once sold for</a>.</p>

I will never understand why you’re taking the IP and then sort of turning it around,” People Can Fly cofounder Adrian Chmielarz <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/painkiller/creator-remake-interview">told <em>PCGamesN</em></a>. “What’s the point here? You grab the IP because you believe the IP had something, but there’s no traces of the DNA of that IP in your game. That’s weird to me.”</p> <p>The new version includes co-op and a roguelike mode. It has less than 1,000 reviews on Steam and a middling rating of just 55 percent positive. “I didn’t play it,” Chmielarz said. “I played the beta when they had it, and I disagreed with every single thing they’ve done in it, and that’s it.”</p> <h2>Warner Bros. says no to Paramount</h2> <p>The company’s board of directors <a href="https://ir.wbd.com/news-and-events/financial-news/financial-news-details/2025/Warner-Bros--Discovery-Board-of-Directors-Unanimously-Recommends-Shareholders-Reject-Paramount-Tender-Offer/default.aspx">basically accused CEO David Ellison</a> of lying and saying he’s not good for the money. “Despite having been told repeatedly by WBD how important a full and unconditional financing commitment from the Ellison family was – and despite their own ample resources, as well as multiple assurances by PSKY during our strategic review process that such a commitment was forthcoming – the Ellison family has chosen not to backstop the PSKY offer,” it told investors. Netflix, meanwhile, promised to keep airing WB movies <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-welcomes-wbd-board-recommendation">in theaters</a> if it takes over.</p> <h2>ICYMI</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/sucker-punch-brian-fleming-ghost-yotei-playstation-2000653903">Sucker Punch’s cofounder is leaving as a new generation steps up across PlayStation Studios</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/larian-baldurs-gate-3-divinity-ai-swen-vincke-reaction-2000653934">Larian made everyone very unhappy with its CEO’s comments about AI</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-flaws-system-great-how-it-works-rpg-xbox-obsidian-2000653910"><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> has an amazing flaw system</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>
