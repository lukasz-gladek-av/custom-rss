              <p>Not all of us can buy a MacBook Pro or the new ASUS ROG gaming laptop. If your pocket is tight, there are surprisingly cheaper options that deliver just as much punch. One such option is the <strong>GMKtec M5 Plus</strong> gaming mini PC (Ryzen 7 5825U, 32GB RAM 1TB SSD), <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3868/">now available on Amazon at an unbeatable price of $319, originally priced at $400</a>. This is a great discount and with such a price, it’s an excellent opportunity to acquire a mini PC for both gaming and office use.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3868/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Gaming Mini PC</h2>
<p>The GMKtec M5 Plus comes with an AMD <strong>Ryzen 7 5825U processor which is a modern processor that offers 8 cores and 16 threads</strong>. The processor is 2.0GHz in base speed but is capable of turbo boosting up to 4.5GHz when energy mode settings are optimized. This is significantly more efficient than previous generations like Ryzen 7 5700U with about 35% more performance.</p>
<p>Within the memory division, the M5 Plus comes equipped with 32GB of DDR4 RAM that runs in dual channel which is a rich provision for a mini PC in this range. If you ever need to push it further, the system is expandable up to 64GB. With such a figure of RAM, you can go about office tasks, heavy browsing sessions, and gaming without feeling any delay. Storage won’t hinder you either, with a speedy 1TB PCIe 3.0 SSD.</p>



<p>Networking is also addressed quite nicely with dual NIC LAN ports providing 2.5Gbps Ethernet speeds. That is a big bonus if you need good internet to stream or play online games. The speed of Ethernet here is way more than usual gigabit connections, eliminating lag and buffering. With WiFi 6E thrown in, you’ve got solid, quick wireless that handles multiple devices easily and Bluetooth 5.2 keeps your headphones, mouse, and keyboard plugged.</p>
<p>Its graphics are processed by the on-board AMD Radeon Graphics 8-core processor with a speed of 2000 MHz. Its GPU is tuned for games at medium settings, video editing, and ultra-smooth playback of 4K material. Display-wise, three 4K monitors simultaneously can be supported using DisplayPort, HDMI, and USB-C ports.</p>
<p>You get a lineup with USB 3.2 and USB 2.0 ports, USB-C that delivers power and has display outputs, a DisplayPort, an HDMI 2.0, and a single headphone and microphone port.</p>
<p>At $319, it’s a good idea to grab the GMKtec M5 Plus if you want a powerful and budget-friendly PC that can handle work and gaming. If you’re looking for a mini PC that can handle your everyday demands without the Apple-level price tag, this deal definitely deserves a look. Just keep in mind this is a limited-time offer so don’t wait too long before it slips away.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon decided to spice up this Tuesday with some quick fire flash sales, and one of them is honestly hard to ignore. Portable chargers usually mean something small for your phone, but this deal is on a proper laptop-grade power bank from Anker.</p>
<p>It comes with a <strong>gigantic 25,000mAh capacity and three 100W USB-C ports</strong>. The kicker? It’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3864/">dropped to $94 from $135, which is an all-time low at Amazon</a>. Over <strong>60% of the stock is already gone</strong>, so if this interests you, you should probably get it while it’s available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3864/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Airline-Approved</h2>
<p>Most power banks are fine for topping off your phone a time or twice but the second you throw a MacBook (or even a Switch) into the mix, they fold over pretty easily. That is why this model is so coveted: You get <strong>three USB-C ports and each of them can do up to 100W of power</strong>. That means: you can really charge a laptop while out without keeping an eye on the battery draining otherwise.</p>
<p>With <strong>25,000mAh available</strong>, you’re looking at multiple phone charges or good laptop support for hours. If you’re a travel bug, that means extended flights or train trips with no worry of the battery going below 5% when you need it the most. And since this monster is smart about replenishing itself, it doesn’t take forever to refuel. With its 100W input system, you can charge to 30% in 22 minutes. That’s long enough to throw it on the charger while brewing your morning coffee before a flight and be ready to roll. And yes,<strong> it’s airline-approved, under the 100Wh boundary</strong>, so safe in overhead bins.</p>



<p>Unlike most chunky power banks, <strong>this has two internal USB-C cables inside</strong>. One extends up to 2.3 feet but retracts neatly when not being used and the other is a shorter cable that doubles as a strap for carrying the unit around. Both are tested for durability so they won’t deteriorate from regular use. No more digging through your bag or praying you had remembered to grab the right cord. The cords are preattached, which is the kind of little win that makes life a tiny bit easier.</p>
<p>You can definitely have more than two or three devices: <strong>Four devices can be charged at the same time by this unit</strong>: the two inbuilt cables, the extra USB-C port, and one standard USB-A port. That would mean that you could be charging a MacBook, a phone, a pair of headphones and some other device at the same time.</p>
<p>Anker has already established a reputation that is conducive to faith in its chargers, and this one does not disappoint in any way: massive capacity, bidirectional fast charging, intelligent design, and the ability of actually keeping a laptop alive. For $94, it’s a take-and-go type of deal you’ll be sorry not to have woken up to. The only real catch?<strong> Stock isn’t going to hold out for long</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This ASUS ROG Strix G16 Gaming Laptop (RTX 5060) Just Dropped in Price, Amazon Is Selling It at No Profit]]></title>

              <p>Gaming laptops do not come at bargain prices. If you’ve ever been walking around for one, you know that the instant you want to have powerful specifications, you’re facing a giant check. That’s why this Amazon sale is like a sweet surprise at the start of the school year. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3860/">2025 ASUS ROG Strix G16 ( has just dropped to $1,274, down from its $1,500 price point</a>, its all-time low.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3860/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fantastic Gaming Laptop</h2>
<p>This is a proper gaming machine, not a stripped-down entry-level model. At its heart, it’s powered by the new <strong>Intel Core i7-14650HX which is one of Intel’s latest 14th Gen laptop processors</strong> and built to handle demanding games. Pair that up with <strong>NVIDIA’s GeForce RTX 5060 Laptop GPU</strong>, based on the fresh <strong>Blackwell architecture</strong>, and you’re ready for modern titles with cutting-edge performance. It also supports DLSS 4, NVIDIA’s new AI-driven upscaling tech, so you can enjoy more frame rates from your favorite games without sacrificing visual quality.</p>
<p>Of course, however, power is just half the tale. You need speed and room for your stuff, and this box has both: It comes with <strong>16GB of DDR5 memory</strong> clocked at 5.6GHz, so running lots of different apps at once or streaming your games is silky-smooth. Storage is also generous: <strong>a 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD</strong> gives you speed and space. That’s space for a ton of current AAA games, plus your work, media, and files.</p>



<p>The screen on the ROG Strix G16 deserves some special mention as well: A <strong>16-inch FHD+ display with 16:10 aspect ratio and scorching 165Hz refresh rate</strong> ensures gaming is truly gratifying. That higher refresh rate doesn’t just help with competitive games: it’s also smoothes out scrolling websites, video watching, and even everyday motion. With a 3ms response time, ghosting and blur are reduced.</p>
<p>ASUS has also relied on its ROG Intelligent Cooling solution which involves a<strong> full vapor chamber layout, tri-fan technology, and liquid metal to help cool the CPU</strong>. Translation: you can push the hardware more aggressively without worrying about thermal throttling, and fans stay reasonably controlled compared to past versions. If you’re sweating out a marathon gaming session or exporting a video project, the machine has learned how to stay stable.</p>
<p>At $1,274, this deal really hits a sweet spot: You’re getting a brand-new 2025 model that combines powerful internals with thoughtful display features and cutting-edge cooling in a design that looks sharp. The biggest challenge may not be choosing it but catching it before Amazon runs out of stock!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After a weekend of online speculation, conspiracies, and jokes about President Donald Trump’s current state of health, the controversial leader held a conference in the White House that was technically about <a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-administration-news-09-02-25#cmf2wdo1d00053b6tx5yccrld">Space Command moving from Colorado to Alabama</a>, but served as a proof of life for many online. And when he appeared alive and mostly well, a lot of people were disappointed.</p> <p>Starting late last week, <a href="https://www.doomsdayscenario.co/p/it-s-time-to-have-a-serious-conversation-about-trump-s-health">rumors began to swirl online that something had happened to President Donald Trump</a>. Reports of music being played in the Rose Garden led some to speculate that it was covering up doctors shouting or the aging President crying out in pain. As the weekend continued, Trump seemed to spend most of the holiday inside the White House. When he did appear outside, photos showed a man who many claimed looked extremely tired, out of it, and sickly. It didn’t help that the White House and Trump shared a photo that claimed to be the President golfing over the weekend, but which was actually from earlier. <a href="https://x.com/adamscochran/status/1962233429770285093">A popular thread</a> spread on Twitter with all sorts of claims, including theories related to Trump keeping his mouth open more often and <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/article/trumps-hand-bruise-health-updates.html">bruises seen on his hands</a>.</p>   <p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/politics/live-news/trump-administration-news-09-02-25#cmf2biaiq00003b6sjz4wbr6o">So when the White House announced on Monday</a> that Trump was going to make an announcement about…something, people were extremely curious to see the president. Was he dead? Was he alive? Was he being puppeted by VP JD Vance? Sadly for those wishing for the worst, Trump appeared mostly fine and as stable as you’d expect during his Tuesday conference.</p>

 <p>On YouTube and Twitch, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/papapishu.bsky.social/post/3lxurt3xo4k2z">the chat quickly turned hostile</a> and disappointed when Trump appeared and began speaking without any signs of a stroke or other medical issue. And on BlueSky and other social media platforms, people expressed their disappointment that Trump was still alive and kicking. Others pored over every frame of him talking during the event to see if they could spot any signs of something wrong.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Update on the white house stream, chat is disappointed <a href="https://t.co/Y95jgJANYX">pic.twitter.com/Y95jgJANYX</a></p> <p>— RAYMAGEDDON‼️ (@Raymagedd0n) <a href="https://twitter.com/Raymagedd0n/status/1962951241513713695?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>          <p>At one point during the conference, which was primarily about Trump moving Space Command’s HQ from Colorado to Alabama, Trump was asked by a reporter about the rumors of his death and medical emergency over the holiday weekend. This didn’t go over well with Trump, who first denied hearing about this, and then seemingly confirmed he had heard the rumors about his untimely demise.</p>   <p>“I also did a number of Truths,” he said, referring to his posts on social media network Truth Social. “Long Truths, and I think pretty poignant Truths,” said Trump. “No, I was very active over the weekend.” Trump also claimed the media, aka “Fake News,” incorrectly reported on his death or illness, adding: “[The media asked] Is he okay? How’s he feeling? What’s wrong?”</p> <p>Here’s the video of the full conference, which, as of 3:15 pm EST, was still dragging as Trump talked about many other topics, including school shootings, elections, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864"><em>Perfect Dark</em></a> was one of the most anticipated blockbusters in the first-party Xbox portfolio when it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-reportedly-cancels-that-cool-looking-perfect-dark-1851785531">suddenly canceled</a> earlier this summer amid mass cuts at Microsoft. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-02/-perfect-dark-developer-lays-off-staff-after-funding-deal-falls-through?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NjgzNDY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzU3NDM5NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUMVoyQTRHUTdMRlEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.iGoAomXADlAaCsr4KgsTEy8oHTbv4k9XTSl7NVtRZXo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall"><em>Bloomberg</em> now reports</a> there was briefly an attempt to find the troubled game a new publisher so that it could still come out.</p> <p>Unfortunately, those talks apparently fell through, at least in part due to disagreements over IP rights. The idea was that Embracer-owned Crystal Dynamics, which was co-developing the stealth shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732">with now defunct Xbox studio The Initiative</a>, would complete the project under a new publishing deal with Take-Two. The two companies reportedly came “close” to a deal but one of the things that ultimately sunk talks was disagreement over who would own the <em>Perfect Dark</em> franchise, which currently belongs to Microsoft, over the long term.</p> <p>If <em>Perfect Dark</em> had been a success, the IP rights would have become way more valuable overnight with the potential for sequels or TV and movie adaptations. But for that to happen it would have had to come out. How much will the IP be worth with no new game in over 15 years?</p>

 <p>This deal falling through is seemingly why Crystal Dynamics announced new layoffs last week. “This decision was not made lightly,” the studio <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7366524687985594369/">posted on LinkedIn</a>. “It was necessary, however, to ensure the long-term health of our studio and core creative priorities in a continually shifting market.”</p> <p>Microsoft has found a way to give some of the casualties of its mass layoffs a second lease on life. <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> maker Tango Gameworks briefly shutdown in 2024 before <a href="https://kotaku.com/tango-gameworks-hi-fi-rush-revive-shutdown-krafton-xbox-1851619190">being resurrected</a> later that year under South Korean publisher Krafton. It’s a shame the tech giant couldn’t find a way to make that happen for <em>Perfect Dar</em>k, both for fans but most of all for the people who were working on it.</p>
