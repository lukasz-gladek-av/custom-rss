            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is there a disturbance in the force when it comes to <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>‘s week-one sales? Will Steam Deck compatibility help aid the Switch 2 on its road to becoming a handheld port machine? And why are <em>Sims 4</em> creators abandoning EA’s official affiliate program? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>People <a href="https://x.com/SuperSavajin/status/1981324284493443583">are once again</a> debating whether Nintendo should bring back Virtual Console instead of forcing fans to rent all of its games in perpetuity. While it’s true that people had been wanting Nintendo to do a low-cost Netflix-like retro service for a while, much of that was due to constantly needing to <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-virtual-console-switch-online-classic-retro-1851760770">re-purchase the games across non-backwards-compatible devices</a>. With the Switch 2, that’s no longer an issue. Personally, I’d prefer to just buy the original <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> again instead of pay $50 a year to play it.</p>

 <h2><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> is selling less than other recent games in the series</h2> <p>The Pokémon Company announced the latest entry sold 5.8 million copies in its first week, split roughly evenly between Switch and Switch 2. Sounds impressive, but it’s slightly behind other recent Pokémon games:</p> <ul> <li><em><strong>Pokémon Sword</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em><strong>Shield</strong></em>: 6 million copies in its first three days</li> <li><strong><em>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl</em></strong>: 6 million copies in its first week</li> <li><em><strong>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</strong>: </em>6.5 million copies in its first week</li> <li><em><strong>Pokémon Scarlet </strong></em><strong>and </strong><em><strong>Violet</strong>: </em>10 million copies in its first three days</li> </ul> <p>That’s a little surprising given the hype around a new console launch and the fact that it’s been three years since fans received a mainline Pokémon game. Are those viral videos about the bad graphics and how lifeless Lumiose City looks putting a damper on things? Are some fans aging out all these years later? Or is this just a momentary slip on the way to <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> still becoming one of the top-20 best-selling Nintendo console games ever?</p>

 <h2><em>The Simpsons</em>‘ takeover of Fortnite continues leaking</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">FORTNITE SIMPSONS SEASON (HD KEY ART) <a href="https://t.co/eL7l1skLRJ">pic.twitter.com/eL7l1skLRJ</a></p> <p>— Shiina (@ShiinaBR) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShiinaBR/status/1981479839564537972?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Now we have the key art which gives lots of clues for what to expect, including Homer with a magic TV remote that might spawn donuts, Bart in a mech suit, and Flanders flying in on a loaf of bread.</p>

 <h2>There’s a fresh rumor about <em>Baldur’s Gate III</em> coming to Switch 2</h2> <p>Leaker NateTheHate <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1980357667035181154#m">writes</a>, “Have heard something on BG3 for SW2 but need more verification on it before I can share.” Larian Studios recently went out of its way to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1nokvh1/baldurs_gate_3_hotfix_34_steam_deck_native_build/">make the RPG natively Steam Deck compatible</a>.</p> <h2>Some of the biggest <em>Sims 4</em> YouTubers are leaving EA’s creator program over the sale to Saudi Arabia</h2>  <p><em>PC Gamer</em> reports that James Turner, Jesse ‘Plumbella’ McNamara, and Kayla ‘lilsimsie’ Sims have all left what is essentially an affiliate program for the game run by EA where they can make money off of creating mods and other content related to the game.</p>

 <p>“Due to the recent sale, I have asked to leave the EA Creator Network and I will not buy or make content around any future release. I think taking this stand is the right choice for me personally, but I’m not going to judge anybody on their decision,” McNamara said. “I’m in a privileged position to be able to say I’m leaving so easily.”</p>

 <p>In a separate discussion, Sims said, “This situation is a nightmare for our community. Nobody supports this sale, and it is putting creators in a very difficult position. They have built their entire career and livelihood over a game that they have no control over.”</p>

 <h2><em>Factorio: Space Age</em> is already confirmed for Switch 2</h2> <p>The hit survival crafting assembly game sequel will be coming to the Nintendo console <a href="https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-439">around Christmas</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is secretly </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-npc-dialogue-funny-moments-lines-2000638295"><span>one of the funniest games of the year</span></a><span>, as I was reminded last night when I experienced something that was as annoying as it was hilarious.. I’ve finished the main story, and so I’ve been chipping away at all the remaining side quests, filling up my Pokedex, and trying to get everything in a place where I’m okay with putting the game down until the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC</span></a><span>. So I’m spending most of my time chatting up citizens, battling wild Pokémon, and checking off research assignments without a care in the world. But last night, something happened that now has me putting my guard up. I was trapped in a conversation with a child about their special interest, and it was one of the funniest scenes I’ve encountered in the game.</span></p>

 <p><span>In Lumiose City’s Rouge Sector, you’ll find a school called Académie Étoile. There are a few quests here, including one really cute one where you teach a group of curious kids about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>Mega Evolution</span></a><span>, but there’s one student who’s just hanging out in a corner by herself. This nameless child’s speech bubble exclaims, “I’ve memorized a bunch of people’s names!” As someone who has become terrible with names in his 30s, that’s impressive to me. If someone doesn’t have a name tag on, I </span><i><span>will</span></i><span> forget what they’re called when they tell me. That happens with anyone, and it’s nothing personal. I used to have a mind like a steel trap, and then everything started sliding right out of my skull once I got old enough to rent a car. So I talk to this kid, and she tells me she has a “super amazing memory” and can remember every name she’s ever seen, even if she only saw it once.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>She asks if I want her to show me, and I’m like, “Hell yeah, queen. Pop off!” because who wants to shoot down a child telling you about something they’re excited about? Then she asks me again if I’m sure because it’ll take her about six minutes to rattle off every Bob, Jan, and Jimbo she’s ever known. I fully expected the game to make me skip through a bunch of text boxes before we were interrupted by a teacher or parent who had been looking for this girl, but no, </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>did something even funnier: it started playing the game’s credits and would not let me skip or opt out of them.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>For six minutes, I watched the credits roll a second time, and just laughed at how good of a fucking bit this is. Anyone who’s interacted with children knows they love to talk your ear off about whatever they’re hyperfixating on. If you don’t know anything about it, you just gotta kinda smile, nod, and say “oh, wow!” now and then so they know it’s okay to be excited about things. Game Freak emulating this by making you watch the credits is such an efficient gag that I couldn’t help but giggle at the mess I’d gotten myself into. The kid told me exactly what she was going to do, and for some reason, it didn’t occur to me that she might actually deliver. Hopefully, she gets a job in comms because never forgetting a face or a name is an invaluable skill in that field.</span></p>

              <p>Being and adult can be a lot. We’re expected to work at least eight hours a day — usually more. For some of us it might take over and hour to commute to work, each way. When we finally get home, we have dinners to cook and dirty clothes to launder. To stay healthy, we should be getting in some daily exercised too. Plus, some of us have small humans to take care of, pick up from school, help with their homework — it’s never ending. If you fall behind on vacuuming your living room, that’s completely understandable with everything else going on. Though, you work so hard, you deserve to come home to a clean home every day. That’s why you got to jump on this Amazon limited time deal for a Eufy robot vacuum.</p>
<p>The Eufy C10 can be scheduled to clean up for you every day while you’re out so you can come home to a clean living space. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4991/">The robot vac is currently 54% off, saving your more than half. It normally is listed at $480, but the discount brings it down to just $220.</a> That’s a savings of $260 for a limited time.</p>

<h2>Self-Empty Station</h2>
<p>Not only does this vacuum clean your floors for you. It can also empty itself all by itself.

<p>This robot vacuum has a powerful suction with 4,000 Pa of sucking power. The rolling brush makes it so the vac can pick up all kinds of tough debris like pet hair, dirt, and crumbs embedded deep in your carpet.</p>



<p>The vacuum is designed to be a short 2.85 inches tall. This slim shape allows it to navigate under tight, hard-to-reach spaces like beneath a couch, bed, or desk.</p>
<p>Navigating your home comes easy to this robot vacuum. The Eufy C10 uses laser navigation to map out the layout of your home, analyzing and creating an optimal path to take for a thorough cleaning.</p>

              <p>Have you ever gone duck hunting? It’s terrifying. Somehow those birds are always watching, ready, hiding just out of plain sight ready to get you. Mmm. On second thought I might have that experience confused with something else. Regardless, murderous animals are funny and horrifying, and it seems a lot of folks on Steam are in agreement as duck-based indie shooter <i>Escape From Duckov</i> has just pulled ahead of EA’s big AAA shooter <i>Battlefield</i> <i>6</i> in concurrent players.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/theres-a-damned-good-reason-escape-from-duckov-has-sold-a-million-copies-in-a-week-2000638588">There’s A Damned Good Reason <i>Escape From Duckov</i> Has Sold A Million Copies In A Week</a></p> <p>Released on October 16, 2025, <i>Escape From Duckov</i> is a solo survival extraction shooter featuring ducks with guns who aren’t afraid to use them. It has that lovely charm that many indie games tend to get when they fuse an otherwise serious, <a href="https://kotaku.com/theres-a-damned-good-reason-escape-from-duckov-has-sold-a-million-copies-in-a-week-2000638588">well-executed</a> genre with a not-so-serious premise: in this case, ducks with guns. And it would seem (<a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/indie-shooter-escape-from-duckov-overtakes-battlefield-6-on-steam-3273511/">h/t <i>Dexerto</i></a>) that us extraction diehards or those who just enjoy silliness aren’t the only ones drawn to these funny birds; the game has recently outstripped <i>Battlefield 6</i> in concurrent players, successfully hopping over the popular milsim shooter in the <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/">top five most-played games</a> on Steam at the time of this writing.</p>

And, hey, maybe the broader gaming community is warming up to extraction shooters a bit more? I’d be totally here for that ahead of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325"><i>Arc Raiders</i></a>’ launch next week.</p>

While there was a moment where we thought we might have gotten a new Huntr/x banger that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-huntrix-spotify-new-song-mazatlan-by-night-2000632680"><span>turned out to be a Spotify hack</span></a><span>, Netflix hasn’t put out any new music from the fictional K-pop group yet. What’s a Huntr/x fan to do other than listen to the soundtrack on loop? Well, Ejae, the singing voice of lead vocalist Rumi, has finally put out her own debut single, and yeah, the girl can sing even when she’s not slaying demons.</span></p> <p><span>“In Another World” is a ballad that sounds like something you’d hear over a Disney musical’s end credits. It’s definitely giving the late 2000s/early 2010s adult contemporary diva, along the lines of Leona Lewis and Adele, so don’t come expecting a Huntr/x-style banger here. All that said, the song is a vocal showcase for Ejae, who soars over its chorus as she sings of an estranged relationship that’s fallen through. Check it out here:</span></p>   <p><span>Ejae’s career trajectory has been inspiring to watch unfold as </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ success has put her in the spotlight. She began training to be a K-pop idol at a young age in 2003, although she wasn’t approved for a debut for over a decade. Ultimately, she discontinued her idol training to pursue a career as a songwriter. After working with groups like Red Velvet and&nbsp; Le Sserafim, she was brought onto </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span> to write songs and record demos, then was asked to be Rumi’s singing voice in the final film. And now, she’s got some of the biggest songs of 2025 and is becoming a household name and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-tonight-show-golden-performance-ejae-2000633180"><span>performing on late-night talk shows</span></a><span>.

              <p>Upgrading to a new business laptop shouldn’t mean breaking the bank, but it also doesn’t mean settling for something basic just to save money. Ideally, your work laptop should be powerful enough to handle your busiest days, plus support some weekend fun like gaming or streaming without slowing down.</p>
<p>HP offers some of the best options on the market for this, though the performance usually comes with a higher price tag. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4992/">Thankfully, that changes today. Amazon is currently offering a mind-boggling 75% discount on the 17.3-inch HP touchscreen laptop, bringing the price down to just $750.</a> Honestly, that’s what you’d pay for most entry-level machines on a normal day, and the offer doesn’t end here. You’re also getting a free accessory kit worth almost $200 with your purchase. The only catch? The discount ends soon, meaning you don’t have a lot of time left to grab it. Snag it for less while the offer is still available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4992/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Powerful Processor for Impressive Multitasking</h2>
<p>Starting with the performance, you’re getting an AMD Ryzen 5 7430U processor that’s made to support heavier applications and creative tasks without lags. Along with that, there’s 32GB of RAM to take care of multitasking. Whether your day requires you to hop between multiple programs at once, use a ton of different tabs simultaneously, or test your sanity with longer, never-ending spreadsheets, it’s all going to be possible. Storage-wise, you’re covered with a 1TB SSD that’s spacious enough to house all your essentials, plus also ensures faster boot times.</p>



<p>The large 17.3-inch display is much bigger than most other options in this range, and gives you plenty of screen real estate for work and play. Visuals stay lifelike in all lighting conditions, thanks to its anti-glare coating. You’ve also got a full-sized keyboard that’s quite comfortable to use – you won’t be left with a sore wrist at the end of a long work day.</p>
<p>This machine runs on Windows 11 Pro, which comes pre-installed. The operating system is one of the most user-friendly ones out there, and Copilot integration takes the experience even further. You’re going to have an AI assistant ready to help you 24/7. Need help with a math problem? Ask away. Figuring out how long to bake that cake? It’s got you covered. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4992/">Other freebies include a wireless mouse, a USB hub, a 128GB USB flash drive, and a 7-in-1 cleaning kit.</a></p>
