            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Mark Gerhard, the co-CEO of </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>developer Build a Rocket Boy, has allegedly stated that a “very big American company” called Ritual Network, a YouTube and TikTok management agency which is actually based in the United Kingdom, is behind a more than $1 million campaign to continue smearing the critically panned 2025 open-world flop</span><span>.</span></p> <p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mindseye-ceo-alleges-1-million-sabotaging-its-game/"><i><span>Insider Gaming</span></i></a> reports that <span>Gerhard spoke about the alleged conspiracy </span><span>in an internal meeting with other Build a Rocket Boy staff. Per an </span><span>alleged recording of his remarks, Gerhard supposedly referred to Ritual Network as “a bunch of gangsters,” and also directly named YouTuber Cyber Boi as one of the “influencers” involved in the </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>smear campaign. </span></p>

 <p><span>Cyber Boi is the content creator who was recently threatened with a “formal cease and desist demand” by Gerhard, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-ceo-threatens-youtuber-after-epstein-video-2000665097"><span>via the </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>Discord server last week</span></a><span>, following the release of a now-deleted video about ex-Rockstar producer Leslie Benzies and the Epstein files (<a href="https://kotaku.com/leslie-benzies-epstein-allegation-gta-mindseye-2000665340">Benzies stated this week that he’s never met Epstein before</a>). </span><span><em>Kotaku</em> can confirm that an email address recently listed on Cyber Boi’s YouTube channel did belong to Ritual Network.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>However, Gerhard’s reported claim that Ritual Network is a “very big American company” appears to be false, as the company lists Scunthorpe, North Lincolnshire as its registered address. It seemingly employs fewer than 20 individuals. Also, Ritual Network’s publicly available tax returns state that its net current assets in February 2025, four months before <em>MindsEye</em>’s June 2025 release, were somewhere around £800,000, or roughly €920,000. That’s 80,000 shy of the 1 million euro sum reportedly alleged in the recording</span><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>According to <em>Insider Gaming</em>, Gerhard stated during the internal meeting that Ritual Network and the content creators they allegedly paid “will all be served in person, criminal complaints, shortly,” for criminal charges including “espionage, sabotage, and criminal interference.” The purported video call also made mention of an “enhanced cybersecurity software” called Teramind, which had been installed on Build a Rocket Boy employees’ work systems without their prior knowledge.</span></p>

 <h2>Turning YouTuber drama into future <em>MindsEye</em> content</h2> <p><span>If true, that sounds an awful lot like the sort of futuristic, dystopian side plot that could be featured within the narrative of </span><i><span>MindsEye</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span><span>Funnily enough, Gerhard also apparently stated that he wishes to use the names of those associated with Ritual Network in a <em>MindsEye</em> mission in the future. “Given this has happened to us, I’m gonna own this narrative,” he reportedly said. “We will use these people, these names and these facts for our own fun. We’re gonna put some of these names into our upcoming spy mission.” </span></p> <p><span>In an official statement to </span><i><span>Insider Gaming</span></i><span>, Ritual Network stated that they are “not involved in the matter” and that they are also unaware of “any legitimate legal action involving Ritual Network and have not been provided with any evidence supporting these claims.”</span></p>

 <p>Build a Rocket Boy isn’t backing down from its allegations, however. “Sadly, we do have evidence that there has been a coordinated campaign to purposefully and maliciously damage Build A Rocket Boy’s reputation and undermine confidence in <em>MindsEye</em>,” a spokesperson for the studio told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em>. “We are working with our legal team and taking steps to address this.”</p> <p>Build a Rocket Boy is ostensibly in the middle of trying to reboot the failed 2025 blockbuster. <span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-reboot-update-7-leslie-benzies-2000666008">A surprise February 4 update</a> was pitched as part of</span><span> “a reset for the brand and the title” which will kick off the beginning of a “new era” for <em>MindsEye</em>. The shooter still has a less-than-50-percent positive rating on Steam and, at the time of this writing, only 40 concurrent players in the game.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/drugs-magic-guns-and-the-egyptian-god-of-death-make-for-one-hell-of-a-great-game-2000666462</link>
            <guid>1428478</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A maze of hotel rooms stands in front of me. I have nothing but my sunglasses and my fists. I slide into the nearest door, slam a thug to the ground, take his baseball bat, and chuck it at another baddie on the other side of the seedy bedroom. Before the first thug can get back up, I execute him real fast, hop over the bed, and do the same to the other knocked-down enemy. This thrilling sequence happens in less than five seconds. Later, when I walk by the carnage on my way out, I see my partner in crime, Anubis, the Egyptian god of death, clad in a slick purple suit, weighing the souls of those dead losers. He’s a weirdo like that.</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3124230/Jackal/"><em>Jackal,</em> out now on Steam</a>, is a new top-down indie shooter that is clearly inspired by <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-hotline-miami-is-all-about-5955899"><em>Hotline Miami</em>‘s fast-paced one-shot-and-your-toast action</a>. But where <em>Hotline Miami</em> emulated the look of retro games,<em> Jackal</em> is a stylized 3D adventure that mixes realism with psychedelic art, Egyptian magic, lots of guns, and <em>Max Payne-</em>like noir voiceovers from the game’s coked-up “hero.”</p>

  <p>In <em>Jackal</em>, you have Anubis by your side. He’s a bit stoic and quick to criticize the main character, but does offer up spells that can be used during levels. These can stop time, blind enemies, or make you move really fast. Popping one of these during an ambush is a great way to get out of trouble, but you can only use a spell once during a mission, so knowing when to use it becomes part of the deadly puzzle-solving.</p> <p>Anubis and his magic aren’t the only strange parts of <em>Jackal</em>. It’s clear that this version of 1970s Las Vegas is oozing otherworldly vibes. The game’s cutscenes reinforce this with some truly trippy and wonderful uses of color, lighting, and sound. Of course, the main character is also fucked up on 20 different kinds of drugs and pills. So, how much of this is real and how much is in his rotting mind is an interesting question to ponder as you murder every gangster and cop in Vegas.</p>

 <h2>Yeah, Yeah, But What About The Killing?</h2> <p>As with any <em>Hotline Miami</em>-like game, what matters more than anything else is the movement and combat. Sure, the aesthetics and atmosphere are great in <em>Jackal</em>. But in these kinds of games, death must come swiftly, as well as the reloads. Likewise, action needs to move fast, but you should always feel like you have at least one option to get out of the chaos alive. <em>Jackal</em> nails all of this.</p>

 <p>Combat in this new indie shooter is all about being smart but relentless. Kick a guy down, grab his gun from the air, and shoot the other folks nearby; then, as he stands up, toss the gun back at his face, knocking him down again and letting you finish him with a quick execution.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000666480" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666480"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666480">©Transhuman Design / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>A lot of time in <em>Jackal</em> is spent tossing knives, bats, swords, guns, and more at enemies to stun them, and it always feels good. There’s also a lot of focus on making sure that you always know what’s going on. Enemies are pointed out via visual cues, guns are highlighted red so you know who to focus on, and when they run low on ammo, they go yellow. Smart choices like this help combat feel chaotic, sometimes out of control, but never messily or frustratingly so. And unlike in <em>Hotline Miami,</em> you can kick tables, chairs, and other items at enemies, which<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->along with the spells<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->adds a lot of useful options during fights.</p>

 <p>After about an hour and a half of playing <em>Jackal</em>, it looks like I’m about halfway through the game’s levels. So it doesn’t seem like this is a long experience, but there are many difficulty options, and nearly every level can be replayed with a new random layout of enemies, rooms, and weapons. That should offer a lot of replayability, especially for those chasing perfection. Just remember, someone is judging all those corpses you leave behind. And one day, will judge yours, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Epic Games shot down rumors that a </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>account sharing the same username as a YouTube account owned by Jeffrey Epstein belonged to the deceased financier.&nbsp; The company called it a “ruse” apparently orchestrated by random <em>Fortnite</em> players attempting to spoof the alias leaked in last week’s trove of Epstein files.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span> The clarification followed several viral conspiratorial posts online alleging Epstein was still alive because of a </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>account thought to be linked to him appearing to be active following his death back on August 10, 2019. </span><span>The most popular post regarding the littlestjeff1 </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>account came from user </span><a href="https://x.com/Pirat_Nation/status/2019449522460541048?s=20"><span>Pirat_Nation on X</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000666479" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000666479"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000666479">DOJ</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The post in question featured several screenshots of documents from the 3 million new Epstein files released by the Department of Justice on January 30 arranged in a pinboard-like fashion to claim something wasn’t adding up about the convicted felon’s death.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>One file revealed that Jeffrey Epstein had a YouTube account under the username littlestjeff1, and had purchased a film titled<em> Frenzy</em> using the account on October 25, 2014. Another file includes a $25.95 receipt for </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>V-Bucks on May 7, 2019 (although said receipt makes no mention of the littlestjeff1 username).</span></p>

 <h2>The littlestjeff1 <em>Fortnite</em> account was spoofed</h2> <p><span>A </span><i>Fortnite </i><span>account registered under the name littlestjeff1 was discovered using the website Fortnite Tracker. The account was in use during </span><i>Fortnite’s </i><span>Chapter 5, Season 1, which began on December 3, 2023. This led to the conspiracy that Epstein’s death was somehow faked and he was holed up somewhere in the world playing </span><i>Fortnite</i><span>. Suggestions that the account was active in Israel, leaning into speculation about whether Epstein at one point worked as a spy for the Israeli government, only added to the online drama.</span></p>

  <p><span>Things spread far and wide enough that the official <em>Fortnite</em> Status X account addressed Pirat_Nation’s post directly to </span><a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/2019817972831780952?s=20"><span>refuted the theory</span></a>. <span>“A few days ago, an existing <em>Fortnite</em> account owner changed their username from something totally unrelated to littlestjeff1, following the revelation of littlestjeff1 as a name on YouTube,” the company wrote on February 6. “These<em> Fortnite</em> trackers only display your current name, not any prior changes to it.”</span></p> <p><span>The company also clarified that it has “no record of the subject’s email addresses referenced in the public document existing in the Epic account system.” According to Epic, since the public document listing the littlestjeff1 account was released, several people have “created<em> Fortnite</em> accounts with similar-looking email addresses and user names.”</span></p>

 <p>While it’s still not clear who the <em>Fortnite </em>V-Bucks purchase in the Epstein files refers to, he did have an Xbox account. The Microsoft platform <a href="https://kotaku.com/emails-reveal-jeffrey-epstein-was-banned-from-xbox-live-2000664660">ended up banning him</a> after he became a registered sex offender.</p>

Lara Croft’s iconic dual pistols are strapped to her thighs, and she dons her classic small knapsack in green canvas with brown leather straps. The fit is tied together with a forearm brace, fingerless leather gloves, a belt outfitted with grenades, and, of course, Lara’s signature braid.

 <p><span>She continued, “I’ve learned I have a perpetual back problem, but I also realized that it’s much easier to kind of build muscle if you’ve ever worked out before in your life, which I never had, so it has taken me months and months and months to get into good shape.” She’s just like me for real.</span></p> <blockquote data-media-max-width="560"> <p dir="ltr" lang="en">Sophie Turner performs her own parachute stunt on the Lara Croft set! <a href="https://t.co/j8IzQN9Tpn">https://t.co/j8IzQN9Tpn</a> <a href="https://t.co/Ok2gOFTas2">pic.twitter.com/Ok2gOFTas2</a></p> <p>— TMZ (@TMZ) <a href="https://twitter.com/TMZ/status/2019815012726976672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The woodsy set is located in Surrey, according to the </span><em><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-15534645/Sophie-Turner-stunts-set-Tomb-Raider.html"><span>Daily Mail</span></a></em><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The series is being produced by Amazon MGM Studios and Crystal Dynamics, with </span><i><span>Fleabag</span></i><span> creator and star Phoebe Waller-Bridge helming the project.
