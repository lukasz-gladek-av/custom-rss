              <p>Valve is supposed to reveal pre-order options for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-valve-console-price-ps5-pro-2000643554">Steam Machine</a> in early 2026 but PC gaming prices are getting out of control. Ubisoft is already hyping up <em>The Division 3</em>. And a mystery game is set to appear at the first Xbox showcase of 2026. <em>Pentiment 2</em>? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>While it’s been the case for years now that physical games come with almost nothing inside the case but the disc, I still feel a brutal pang of disappointment <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1q7a7rg/the_excitement_of_opening_up_a_video_game_sure/">every time I encounter it</a>. I recently bought a handful of discounted games <a href="https://kotaku.com/rpg-sale-cheap-ff12-kingdom-come-2-ps5-switch-2000653958">over the holidays</a> and while their presence on my shelves pleases me, I can’t totally shake the disturbing void hiding within. It makes the rare game that does come packed full of inserts <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-binding-of-isaac-on-nintendo-switch-has-a-gorgeous-1793423566">all the more special</a>.</p>

 <h2>A Czech retailer has placeholder pricing for the Steam Machine starting at $950</h2> <p><a href="https://clawsomegamer.com/retailer-leak-puts-steam-machine-price-at-over-1000/">Clawsomegamer discovered</a> the detail in the source code for the web listing at Smarty.cz. That’s not an official retail partner for the device, making it extra unlikely that this is actually reflective of Valve’s pricing strategy rather than retailers just inserting placeholder guesstimates (Smarty.cz has $1,070 for the 2TB version). Still, it does have people worried about what kind of sticker shock they might eventually see as recent RAM shortages propel PC gaming component prices <a href="https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448">through the roof</a> at the start of 2026.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Big grain of salt:</p> <p>A Czech retailer (<a href="https://t.co/XIPdLHBOif">https://t.co/XIPdLHBOif</a>) has already put up a preliminary listing for the upcoming Valve Steam Machine (512GB) 👀</p> <p>The product page doesn't display a public price yet, but checking the site's source code via browser developer tools reveals a… <a href="https://t.co/QRqJxbnT6x">pic.twitter.com/QRqJxbnT6x</a></p> <p>— Clawsomegamer (@Clawsomegamer) <a href="https://twitter.com/Clawsomegamer/status/2009619612280017118?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Valve previously promised to reveal more information about its new living room console early this year, but those plans could be pushed back if the current supply chain issues are making it harder to get the first wave of devices manufactured at an affordable price point. While Valve has hinted that Steam Machines would be priced more like a gaming PC than a $500 console, no one knows if that means closer to $700 or closer to $1,000. The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-console-linus-skillup-valve-2000646965">did hint that it’s not going to be</a> using profits from Steam to subsidize the price.</p>

 <h2>An Xbox showcase later this month hides a mystery game reveal</h2> <p>A fourth game at the Dev Direct taking place on January 22 was first teased <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot36-oops-all-obsidian.1310962/page-215#post-149812867">by Shinobi602</a>.&nbsp;VGC corroborated the hint and <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-xbox-developer-direct-will-feature-a-secret-unannounced-fourth-game/">reports</a> that the mystery release is “a smaller-scale original game from one of Xbox Game Studios’ first-party developers.” That suggests it could be a side project in the mold of Obsidian Entertainment’s <em>Pentiment</em>.</p>

 <h2><em>Fable</em> will come to PS5, too</h2> <p>But there’s more! Alongside<em> Forza Horizon 6</em> and Game Freak’s <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em>, both already confirmed for PS5, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-xbox-developer-direct-will-feature-a-secret-unannounced-fourth-game/"><em>VGC</em> also reports</a> that <em>Fable</em> is in development for the Sony platform as well. Xbox exclusivity is dead, yes, but the question remains whether Microsoft will push to start getting these multiplatform releases out day-and-date or still stagger them where it sees fit.</p>

 <h2><em>Helldivers 2</em> kicks off its deadliest year yet</h2> <p>Strange new Illuminate structures <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1q7mfl4/new_squid_structures_23_seconds_into_star_of/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/after-helldivers-2-boss-teased-death-and-destruction-in-upcoming-update-new-illuminate-structures-ominously-appear-in-a-blink-and-youll-miss-it-moment-in-super-earth-media/">are popping up</a> in the extraction shooter after Arrowhead Game Studios promised players that 2026 would be even bloodier for the forces of space fascism. “A lot of Helldivers will die,” CEO Shams Jorjani recently teased on the game’s Discord when talking about the studio’s upcoming plans. Arrowhead will have its work cut out for it after fans spent the early part of last summer <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-eos-prosperity-china-steam-reviews-1851782983">beating back an invasion of Super Earth</a>.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Where Winds Meet</em> starts 2026 off strong</strong></h2> <p>The surprise open-world hit on console and PC has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfrGu8nZ3i8">dropped its 1.2 update</a> that adds a new boss fight, Guild Battles, and other activities ahead of additional chapters coming later this month and next.</p> <h2><em>The Division 3</em> is shaping up to be a “monster”</h2> <p>That’s according to executive producer Julian Gerighty. “It’s shaping up to be a monster,” he told fans in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiMJQkjV2M">new Ubisoft vidoc</a>. “I can’t really say anything more than that. But within these walls [at] Massive, we are working extremely hard on something that I think will [have] as big an impact as <em>The Division 1</em> was.” There’s no release date in sight for the sequel and Massive is still producing new content for <em>The Division 2</em>. Finding a way to combine the innovation and novelty of the first game with the gameplay polish and scope of the second could be a recipe for something special. Also something that takes a long time to make.</p> <h2>Warner Bros.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The companions who join you on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i></a><span>’s </span><i><span>epic journey along the Sword Coast</span></i><span> are a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-video-game-characters-of-2023-1851085884"><span>wonderful bunch</span></a><span>, but one character definitely got the short end of the stick: Wyll. The Warlock was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-character-creator-bear-romance-wyll-1850616671"><span>famously rewritten</span></a><span> ahead of the game’s launch in 2023 when developer Larian decided his story in the early access release wasn’t quite working. Some things stayed the same, such as his character design, Warlock status, and where the player would ultimately recruit him, but his story was completely revamped, his voice actor was changed, and he was given ties to other characters, such as Tiefling party member Karlach.</span></p> <p><span>In </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylf1wn/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=comment_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fbaldurs-gate-3-lack-of-wyll-content-larian-response%2F"><span>an ongoing Reddit AMA</span></a><span>, the team at Larian provided some insight into the process and also explained why Wyll has notably less content than other party members as a result. It turns out Wyll’s story was finally coming together right when most other members of the player’s traveling party were being solidified, and some storylines the team planned on implementing him into ended up being cut. Senior writer Kevin VanOrd also explains that he had health issues during some of those iteration phases, which meant that he lost precious time that was meant to be spent fleshing out Wyll’s role. Overall, it sounds like VanOrd loves the character but wishes he could have done more with him.</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><span>As you probably know, we weren’t connecting with Wyll’s Early Access recruitment and initial questing, so we started over at a point when most of the other companion stories were fairly solid. A lot of decisions came later in development than was ideal – and there was a key situation near Baldur’s Gate that I intended to heavily involve Wyll in (the Red War College) that got cut. That meant back to the drawing board again. We eventually tied him to Duke Ravengard and started to work on that element of his arc just in time for me to get unexpectedly ill. I was out of the office for quite a while, and again after the epilogue’s release.</span></p> <p><span>I think that Ansur’s lair was Swen’s idea – we did have the resources for a standalone dungeon, so we got to work on tying Wyll to the Wyrmway, but I couldn’t get more than a dungeon boss out of it. Once the situations were in place, that was that – I had to start writing them.</span></p> <p><span>Wyll’s content is sparser than I’d have liked as a result. He’s also split into two stories, really – the Mizora story and the Ravengard story, and that might have been a mistake in hindsight. I also wish I could [have] given him a stronger endpoint – it always bugged me that he can end up just as he started, as the Blade of Frontiers, without any meaningful difference. All that said, I love the Blade and I am really proud of him, his sincerity, his good nature, and his eager heroism. I’m truly sorry I didn’t give you more quality time with him.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>In the years since </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>, Larian has patched in some new content for Wyll and other companions, but he has always felt like he was a few steps behind the rest of the crew. But based on VanOrd’s explanation, it sounds like the character was mostly a victim of circumstance, though that may not satisfy his diehards who have watched other characters get more scenes, interactions, and love over the course of the game.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Conspiracy That Todd Howard Hates Fallout: New Vegas Is Absurd]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-doesnt-hate-fallout-new-vegas-season-2-canon-rumors-true-2000657238</link>
            <guid>1401805</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Recently, the topic of <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-new-vegas-things-never-say-fan-bethesda-xbox-1851467599">2010’s <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a> and Bethesda creative director Todd Howard came up during a New Year’s Eve party I attended. During the conversation, a few people, myself included, joked about how Howard doesn’t like <em>New Vegas</em>, a <em>Fallout</em> game developed not by Bethesda but by Obsidian. Look around online, and you’ll see plenty of others joking and suggesting the same thing. Howard hates <em>New Vegas.</em> Or is at least annoyed by its success.</p> <p>Here’s the thing: There’s no evidence this is true, and in fact, Bethesda’s famed creative director has stated multiple times publicly that he thinks <em>New Vegas</em> is great. And yet, this myth is so persistent that even I have to remind myself that it ain’t true.</p>

 <p>So what’s up with that? Why is this rumor so popular and so widely believed, to various degrees, by so many <em>Fallout</em> fans and gamers? And exactly how and when did it start?</p> <h2>The history of the Todd Howard hates <em>New Vegas</em> rumor</h2> <p>Looking around online, it doesn’t seem like this was a topic until a few years after <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> arrived. Specifically, after the launch of <em>Fallout 4</em> in 2015, you started to see discussion of this topic pop up online.</p>

 <p><a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/959557-fallout-new-vegas/72818844">Here’s a November 2015 GameFAQs thread</a> in which someone asks if Howard hates <em>New Vegas,</em> because he doesn’t talk about it much, and people complaining about <em>Fallout 4</em> being worse than Obsidian’s spin-off. And I think this is a key part of this myth. A lot of people were disappointed by <em>Fallout 4 </em>for&nbsp;feeling less like an RPG and more like an open-world shooter. And at this point, enough time had passed that 2010’s<em> New Vegas</em> was more fondly remembered as a cool RPG and not a buggy mess.</p>

 <p>Over time, this opinion that <em>New Vegas</em> was good and <em>Fallout 4</em> was bad has solidified online and helped convince many that Bethesda and Howard must surely be mad or jealous over the perception that their latest big installment in the franchise pales in comparison to Obsidian’s rushed-out spin-off. This belief even helped fuel the idea that season one of the TV show was removing<em> New Vegas</em> from the canon. (It wasn’t.) <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/orc0n5/does_bethesda_actually_resent_new_vegas/">And now it’s easy to find people</a> <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/22380/discussions/0/7625232196037861261/?l=greek">claiming Howard hates <em>New Vegas</em> online</a>.</p>

 <p>But if you look back over the last 15 years, there’s zero evidence that Howard and co. hate <em>New Vegas</em>. &nbsp;You can, however,&nbsp; find plenty of evidence that Howard doesn’t hate <em>New Vegas.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>All the evidence that Howard likes <em>New Vegas&nbsp;</em></h2> <p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/fallout_new_vegas/b/pc/archive/2010/05/04/what-you-should-know-about-fallout-new-vegas.aspx#:~:text=While%20we%20wouldn%E2%80%99t,I%20don%E2%80%99t%20care.%E2%80%99%E2%80%9D">All the way back in 2010,</a> in a <em>Game Informer</em> preview of the then-upcoming<em> Fallout: New Vegas,</em> Obsidian boss Feargus Urquhart and game director Josh Sawyer were speaking pretty positively about working with Howard. Here’s what Urquhart told the outlet:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“Todd [Howard] was awesome. I would say sometimes I was more resistant to some of the things [Josh] wanted to do than Todd was. Todd has a great way of looking at games. It’s all about the player. If we had ideas that we could all see would make it a lot more fun for the player, he was like, ‘Go kill that sacred cow—I don’t care.’”</p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Joshua_Sawyer_Formspring_posts/2011#:~:text=JESawyer%20responded%20to%20larzma,He%27s%20a%20great%20guy.">In 2011,</a> while answering fan questions about <em>Fallout: New Vegas,</em> Sawyer once again mentioned that Howard was a “great guy.” Then, in 2013, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/and-heres-obsidians-idea-for-fallout-new-vegas-2">Howard told <em>RPS</em> </a>that he thought<em> New Vegas</em> was great and he was open to doing more with Obsidian.</p>

 <p>In 2018, <a href="https://youtu.be/QKn9yiLVlMM?t=2937">a small moment from NoClip’s excellent Bethesda documentary</a> likely helped add more fuel to all this. The doc takes a small detour to talk about <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> and categorizes it as a corporate-mandated decision, says there aren’t many <em>New Vegas</em> posters around the Bethesda offices, and seems to imply that the studio was mostly hands-off on the project.</p> <p>But also, in that same year, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/jul/18/bethesda-games-interview-todd-howard-pete-hines-elder-scrolls-starfield">while speaking to <em>The Guardian</em></a> about <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em> and whether Bethesda would ever let another studio make a <em>Fallout</em> game, Howard said this:</p> <blockquote><p>“I wouldn’t say never. [But] now that our company is so big, it’s always better to keep stuff internal…it becomes less likely, but I could never say never. I thought the Obsidian guys did a fabulous job.”</p></blockquote> <p>In 2019, <a href="https://youtu.be/nPttE_fvjZM?t=3523">Howard reiterated in an interview with <em>IGN</em></a> that it was unlikely an outside studio would ever get to make <em>Fallout</em> again, but once more praised <em>New Vegas</em> and clarified that the only studio they trusted to make the game was Obsidian.</p>

  <p><a href="https://youtu.be/ygTFeCWOEZU">Jump forward a bit to 2024</a>. During an appearance on <em>Kinda Funny</em>, Howard was jokingly asked by host Greg Miller about how much he allegedly hates <em>New Vegas</em> and how Bethesda was removing it from the franchise’s canon via the show. Howard rolled his eyes and then said this:</p> <blockquote><p>“First, I’ll say, they did an amazing job with <em>New Vegas</em>. We see some of that, and I’ll say to everybody, that’s a game that we published, right? I will say Feargus, who runs Obsidian, is absolutely one of my favorite people in the video game industry…<em>New Vegas</em> is a very, very important game to us and our fans. We think [Obsidian] did an incredible job.”</p></blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/huge-respect-to-the-folks-at-obsidian-todd-howard-invited-obsidian-devs-onto-fallout-season-2s-set-so-they-could-see-new-vegas-in-the-flesh/">In December 2025,</a> ahead of <em>Fallout</em> season two on Amazon Prime, Howard told <em>PC Gamer</em> that he had invited the Obsidian devs onto the New Vegas set to let them see it in person. He added:</p>

 <p>“When we went to do [<em>New Vegas</em>], we were coming off of <em>Fallout 3.</em> We knew we were going to do <em>Skyrim</em>. We know the folks at Obsidian well, love their work, and so we reached out to them and said, ‘Hey, would you like to do this? We see something else coming off of <em>Fallout 3.</em>‘ This is what we asked them to do, right? And they just did an incredible job on <em>New Vegas.</em>”</p> <p>And most recently, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fallout/not-only-does-todd-howard-not-hate-obsidian-it-was-his-only-choice-to-take-up-fallouts-reins-in-the-wake-of-fallout-3/">in January of 2026,</a> Howard reiterated that Obsidian was “the only choice” for <em>New Vegas</em>. It was also revealed that the only mandate Bethesda put on the game was that it needed to include factions.</p> <p>Even after reading through all of this, I imagine there will still be people who will keep believing that Howard and Bethesda despise <em>New Vegas</em> or are jealous of its success.</p>

 <p>The thing is, I get why so many people will keep repeating this rumor. It is a very compelling story. Bethesda works really hard on <em>Fallout 3</em> and <em>Fallout 4</em>, spending years and years on each entry, but it’s Obsidian’s scrappy <em>New Vegas,</em> made in just 18 months, that has gone on to be the fan favorite. There is something almost David and Goliath about it. But just like that story, the idea that Howard hates <em>New Vegas</em> is a myth.</p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/todd-howard-doesnt-hate-fallout-new-vegas-season-2-canon-rumors-true-2000657238]]></content:encoded>
