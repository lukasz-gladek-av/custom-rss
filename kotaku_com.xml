I was polite as I can be the whole call.”<br></p><p>Martinez is part of a growing backlash to Steam and Itch.io purging thousands of games from their databases at the behest of payment processing companies.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>“Seeing the rise of censorship and claiming it’s to ‘protect kids,’ it sounds almost like the Satanic Panic, targeting people that have done nothing to anyone except having fun,” Martinez told <em>Kotaku</em>. “We’re already seeing the negative effect this has on people’s personal and financial lives because of such unnecessary restrictions. If parents are so concerned over protecting kids, then they should parent their own kids instead of forcing other people to meet their ridiculous demands.”</p><p>Indie horror game <em>Vile: Exhumed</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3890112/vile-exhumed-banned-from-steam/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bloody-disgusting.com/video-games/3890112/vile-exhumed-banned-from-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is one of the titles</a></span> that’s been banned from Steam by Valve. Released last year by Cara Cadaver of Final Girl Games, it has players rummage through a fictional ‘90s computer terminal to uncover a twisted man’s toxic obsession with an adult horror film actress, using this format to engage with themes of online misogyny and toxic parasocial relationships. “It was banned for ‘sexual content with depictions of real people,’ which, if you have played it, you know is all implied, making this all feel even worse,” Cadaver <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/dirtlord77.bsky.social/post/3lv2264j6sk2c&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/dirtlord77.bsky.social/post/3lv2264j6sk2c" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on Bluesky</a></span> on July 28.<br></p><p>Valve did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p><em>Vile: Exhumed </em>is a textbook example of what critics of the sex game purge always feared: that guidelines aimed at clamping down on pornographic games believed to be encouraging or glorifying sexual violence would inevitably ensnare serious works of art grappling with difficult and uncomfortable subject matter in important ways. Who gets to decide which is which? For a long time, it appeared to be Steam and Itch.io. Last week’s purges revealed it’s actually Visa and Mastercard, and whoever can frighten them the most with bad publicity.</p><p>“Things are definitely changing as reports of responses to calls have gone from ‘Sorry what are you talking about?’ to then ‘Are you ALSO calling about itch/steam’ to now some [callers] receiving outright harassment,” a 2D artist who goes by Void and who has helped organize a Discord for a reverse call-in campaign told <em>Kotaku</em>. It’s hard to have any clear sense of the scope of these counter-initiatives or what ultimate impact they might have on the companies in question, but anecdotally the effort seems to be gaining traction. For instance, callers are now needing to spend less time explaining what Steam, Itch.io, or “NSFW” games are to the people on the other end of the line. </p><p>“For calls I was originally focusing on Mastercard, but I ended up getting a lot of time out of Visa,” Bluesky user RJAIN told <em>Kotaku</em>. “Two days ago I had a call with Visa that lasted over an hour, and a follow-up call later on that lasted over 2.5 hours.  Those calls, I spoke with a supervisor and they seemed very calm and understanding.  Yesterday, the calls were different. The reps seemed angry and exhausted. They refused to let me speak to a supervisor and kept insisting that it is now protocol for them to disconnect the call on anyone complaining about this issue.”</p><p>Bluesky user snowlupinwood, an LGBT furry author whose work was impacted on itch.io, said calls were juggled between various managers until one earlier this week led to a 30-minute exchange with a manager reading from a script, while subsequent calls led to quickly getting disconnected. Another person who claimed to call at least 30 times said the interactions have also changed since last week when the purges on itch.io and Steam first happened. </p><figure id="" data-id="cdb956f129ecb431e093e7f8254b663c" data-recommend-id="image://cdb956f129ecb431e093e7f8254b663c" data-format="png" data-width="858" data-height="770" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows scripts advocates are sharing to speaking to credit card companies.

Others started cutting me off and started their ‘ending speech’ informing me they can no longer help me and to email.  Some even started mocking me and telling me that they recognize my number and they ask me before I said anything if I called before.  I am very concerned with my next phone call but I will be continuing to call until they change something. I am not scared of being yelled at, I’ve been working in customer service for almost 5 years now.”</p><p>Visa and Mastercard did not immediately respond to requests for comment. </p><p>Some say the exchanges have remained polite while others say they’ve been put on hold indefinitely. “It’s clearly having an impact,” RJAIN said. “They are changing how they deal with calls and they sound exhausted with the issue. There are often queue times when I call.” The ACLU, which has been critical of credit card companies being leveraged to censor sex work online, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/aclu.org/post/3lv4g32jhgc2p&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/aclu.org/post/3lv4g32jhgc2p" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also commented on the issue on Tuesday</a></span>, though it hasn’t shared any direct actions it might be pursuing on behalf of effected creators. </p><p>Some industry trade groups have also weighed in. The International Game Developers Association (IGDA) released a statement stating that “censorship like this is materially harmful to game developers” and urging a dialogue between “platforms, payment processors, and industry leaders with developers and advocacy groups.” “We welcome collaboration and transparency,” it wrote. “This issue is not just about adult content. It is about developer rights, artistic freedom, and the sustainability of diverse creative work in games.”</p><p>For the time being, that dialogue appears to mostly be taking place at Visa’s and Mastercard’s call centers, at least when they allow it. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steam-itch-io-sex-game-nsfw-censor-visa-mastercard-1851787281]]></content:encoded>

As such, Blizzard is using a new survey to gauge fan reaction to a whole host of brands it could potentially bring to <em>Overwatch 2</em>, and there are some wild picks in the mix.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,197589" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>A lot of these properties aren’t that surprising. Blizzard has collaborated with anime, video games, and even K-pop groups, ranging from fairly modern to “nostalgia bait for people of a different demographic than me,” so nothing’s really off the table. However, I do look at some of these hypotheticals and wonder, “Do we need this?” Crucially, just because a brand shows up on a survey doesn’t mean that Blizzard is actively considering an <em>Overwatch 2</em> crossover event. It’s all just vibes right now, and if we’re feeling those out, I’ve got some thoughts. While my preference is that <em>Overwatch </em>stop <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-street-fighter-skin-collaboration-crossover-1851779908&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-street-fighter-skin-collaboration-crossover-1851779908">becoming <em>Fortnite</em></a></span>, I don’t think that’s going to happen. So here’s my ranking of every hypothetical <em>Overwatch 2 </em>crossover Blizzard is proposing, ranked from “hell yeah” to “fuck no.”</p><h2 id="h343810"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Pokémon</strong></em></h2><p>What can I say? I’m a mark. If Soldier: 76 acknowledges that Pikachu exists in some way, I’ll clap like an absolute clown.</p><h2 id="h343811"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Batman</strong></em></h2><p>The survey says <em>Batman</em>, but I’m choosing to believe this hypothetical crossover would include all the DC heroes, so Echo can be a Green Lantern, and her transforming ultimate could be her using her ring. Reaper could be Batman since they’re both broody and wear black.</p><h2 id="h343812"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Evangelion</strong></em></h2><p>Unit-01 Ramattra. Enough said.</p><h2 id="h343813"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Baldur’s Gate</strong></em></h2><p>So many of the characters in <em>Baldur’s Gate 3 </em>map so well onto <em>Overwatch 2 </em>heroes that the collab writes itself. Junker Queen as Karlach? Widowmaker as Lae’zel? Lifeweaver as Astarion? Somebody call Larian.</p><h2 id="h343814"><a id=""></a><em><strong>One Piece</strong></em></h2><p>After 1000+ episodes, there’s quite a few <em>One Piece</em> characters to pull from, and fans have been making <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/54fsk4/one_piece_x_overwatch_crossover_post_from/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/54fsk4/one_piece_x_overwatch_crossover_post_from/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mock-ups of this for nearly a decade</a></span>.</p><h2 id="h343815"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Monsters Inc.</strong></em></h2><p>The only reason this extremely odd and not-timely choice is so high is because I need to see Winston in Sulley’s blue-and-purple fur.</p><h2 id="h343816"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Digimon</strong></em></h2><p>While the uninitiated probably look at this and think, “Wouldn’t this just be <em>Pokémon </em>again?” I’m here to say, “No, you absolute ninny.” <em>Digimon</em>’s character designs are so much more varied than those in Game Freak’s monster-catching series, and a lot of them even look human. Lifeweaver as Angemon and Mercy as Angewomon? Brigitte could be carrying Gallantmon’s shield? <em>Digimon </em>deserves such a spotlight.</p><h2 id="h343817"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Chrono Trigger</strong></em></h2><p>Square Enix’s classic fantasy RPG definitely caters best to characters like Reinhardt, Brigitte, and Genji who utilize fantasy-like weaponry, but also, Bastion as Robo would be sick.</p><h2 id="h343818"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Mortal Kombat</strong></em></h2><p>With the new movie coming out, I could see Blizzard trying to strike while the iron is hot with a <em>Mortal Kombat </em>collab. Doomfist as Jax is such an easy pull, but an inspired choice would be to make Roadhog Scorpion, as they both use chains to pull in their foes.</p><h2 id="h343819"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Alice in Wonderland</strong></em></h2><p>Blizzard has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/OWCavalry/status/1732308995036295405&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/OWCavalry/status/1732308995036295405" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">already shown concept art of this hypothetical</a></span>, so we’ll probably get an <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>-themed season somewhere down the line. Tracer as the white rabbit is such a good pick.</p><h2 id="h343820"><a id=""></a><em><strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong></em></h2><p>This is another franchise that feels most geared towards <em>Overwatch</em>’s knights, but Hanzo can also be Legolas, so at least there’s something there.</p><h2 id="h343821"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Adventure Time</strong></em></h2><p>I just want Junkrat in Jake the Dog onesie.</p><h2 id="h343822"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Akira</strong></em></h2><p>How many characters do you think will get the motorcycle slide highlight intro?</p><h2 id="h343823"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Dragon Ball</strong></em></h2><p>The <em>Street Fighter </em>collaboration got a lot of the martial arts vibes down, so a few of the more obvious picks are kind of taken if Blizzard doesn’t want to do a repeat. Genji as Trunks would work well, though.</p><h2 id="h343824"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Toy Story</strong></em></h2><p>Mercy as Bo Peep with her staff as her crook? I guess that could be okay.</p><h2 id="h343825"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Star Wars</strong></em></h2><p><em>Star Wars </em>has a lot of iconography to pull from, but there was also a point where <em>Overwatch 2 </em>did a legally distinct event <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-starwatch-star-wars-event-mode-pve-story-1850421313&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-starwatch-star-wars-event-mode-pve-story-1850421313">inspired by the films</a></span>, so I’m not too thrilled about a double dip.</p><h2 id="h343826"><a id=""></a><em><strong>Godzilla</strong></em></h2><p>I’m having trouble envisioning this one, considering there’s not much in <em>Overwatch </em>that cleanly mirrors the classic kaiju characters.

That convenience evaporates, though, when you realize you’ll have to download hundreds of gigabytes in order to <em>do</em> that very thing.

However, there’s more going on than you might initially expect. When you begin, you spawn in with a small amount of money and a large storage area. Around you are other storage areas owned by other players. And in the middle is a conveyor belt constantly offering up new “Brainrot Meme” characters to buy. (This is a very popular series of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-psn-playstation-store-ai-slop-brainrot-junk-spam-1851786494&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-psn-playstation-store-ai-slop-brainrot-junk-spam-1851786494">AI-generated creatures with fake Italian names that are hot online right now</a></span>. Don’t worry about it.) </p><p>These characters come in different rarities and have varying prices. Some are very cheap and affordable for new players, while others take millions of in-game dollars to buy. You buy some and they waddle over to your storage area where, every few seconds or so, they earn you money, with rarer ones earning a lot more per second. As you earn more money, you buy more and better characters. </p><figure id="" data-id="33575f47b00609acd694fa14f1125bd9" data-recommend-id="image://33575f47b00609acd694fa14f1125bd9" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Roblox / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="33575f47b00609acd694fa14f1125bd9" data-recommend-id="image://33575f47b00609acd694fa14f1125bd9" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.roblox.com/games/109983668079237/Steal-a-Brainrot&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.roblox.com/games/109983668079237/Steal-a-Brainrot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">If that was all <em>Steal A Brainrot</em></a></span><em> </em>was, I doubt it would have become popular enough to attract my attention. The real fun of the game lies in how you can steal from and screw over other players. For example, when you buy a character, someone else can run up and buy it before it gets to your storage area, effectively stealing it from you. You can then buy it back again, assuming you have the money, but back-and-forths like this can quickly leave you drained. You can also just run into someone’s storage area and steal one of their characters and bring it back to your place. And at any point, you can lock down your storage area for 60 seconds, keeping out thieves or trapping intruders. And then you can just walk out of your locked storage facility and go ransack their characters as they helplessly watch from afar. Complicating all this, you can pay real money via Robux to escape sooner, which feels like the cruelest way to squeeze money out of kids.</p><p>I have to admit, there is something very satisfying about running into an open storage room and stealing a high-priced character before the owner can come back and slap you with a baseball bat. This is why <em>Steal A Brainrot</em> has hooked so many people. </p><p>That was also one of the first things I did. </p><h2 id="h488653"><a id=""></a>The rise and fall of my meme empire</h2><p>Someone with a solid collection of brainrot characters went AFK for a bit, leaving their storage area unguarded and open. A few other players and I swarmed like locusts and robbed the poor person of everything. I snagged some alligator airplane hybrid thing that started earning me a thousand dollars a second. Soon, I had a sizeable fortune. I used it to buy a few more rare characters, and soon I had an empire.</p><p>However, this became a problem. It didn’t take long for other players to start hovering around my storage area. They were waiting for me to slip up. To leave without locking up or to stay out too long and leave my trophies for the taking. I’d smack them away, like swatting flies away from your food. But they would return.</p><p>Eventually, as my empire grew larger, I had to regularly deal with thieves. One entered and begged me for one of my rarest characters. They claimed they needed it for a special achievement and promised to give it back. I simply told them, “One does not keep an empire if they give it away.” They replied, “Bro, come on, be cool.” I would not be cool. I was building my future, one dumb meme character at a time. And I wasn’t going to give it up. </p><figure id="" data-id="308df047eda70fecd52884f4b337e8a6" data-recommend-id="image://308df047eda70fecd52884f4b337e8a6" data-format="png" data-width="1321" data-height="644" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Roblox / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="308df047eda70fecd52884f4b337e8a6" data-recommend-id="image://308df047eda70fecd52884f4b337e8a6" data-format="png" data-width="1321" data-height="644" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After about 40 minutes of saving carefully, buying only the rarest characters, and keeping my storage area locked down tight, I had become extremely rich. I could buy practically any meme I wanted. I was a king, and my storage room showed it. </p><p>Then came the fall. That person who tried to talk me into giving them a rare character snuck in while I got greedy. I spotted a very rare dog-banana-thing and went after it, forgetting to lock up. When I returned, the locusts were swarming my empire. My riches were gone. I tried to stop them. I failed. </p><p>And so ended my short-lived but grand empire in <em>Steal A Brainrot</em>. For a moment I thought about rebuilding, but then I realized that in that 40-minute span, I had done everything the game offered. </p><p>I’d stolen a few characters, racked up riches, got into a few fights, and found a couple of super rare memes. I had no reason to keep playing <em>Steal A Brainrot</em>, a very ugly and boring-looking game. I can imagine a younger kid developing favorite memes and holding onto them tightly. And I’ll admit that when that bastard stole one of my rarest brainrots, I felt a flash of anger. I see why some children are crying and throwing tantrums after losing beloved memes. I’m not excited to play more of it, but yeah, I get why this thing has over 1 million players and a ton of clones. </p><p>I’m not a fan of one of the most popular games among kids being all about grinding forever to make more money and betraying people to win big, but who can deny the allure of building up something bigger than yourself? Even if it’s just a collection of Italian brainrot memes.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steal-a-brainrot-roblox-empire-review-popular-memes-1851787027]]></content:encoded>
