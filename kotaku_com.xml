              <p>Last week, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>‘s</em> Season One Reloaded update hit the game on all platforms and added a lot of <em>Fallout</em>-themed content as well as some new multiplayer maps. One of these, Meltdown, is now at the center of some online shouting as some fans find the cleaner, more realistic version of the map in&nbsp;<em>7</em> inferior to the OG one first seen in <em>Black Ops 2.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>On January 9, <em>BLOPS7</em>‘s big new update added a lot to the online shooter. For <em>Fallout</em> fans, there’s a lot of content ripped right from the TV show on Amazon, including cosmetic skins based on the Ghoul and other characters. <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2026/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-warzone-season-01-reloaded#Maps">You can read the full blog post here</a> to see the impressive amount of new stuff that Activision has shoved into<em> Black Ops 7.</em></p>

 <p>But what has a lot of people online talking is the new map, Meltdown. This map, set inside a nuclear power plant facility, was extremely popular in the original <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</em> back in 2012 on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC, where I spent many hours playing it. So naturally, I was excited for its return in <em>BLOPS7</em>. But, well, this ain’t exactly the same Meltdown from 14 years ago.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Made a full yt video about the Meltdown graphics downgrade thing I've been seeing everyone talk about.<a href="https://t.co/aTe4jPQjmZ">https://t.co/aTe4jPQjmZ</a></p> <p>But TL;DW — I'm mostly fine with the lighting/color changes. I think it just looks too clean. <a href="https://t.co/ZalIsAvQjS">pic.twitter.com/ZalIsAvQjS</a></p> <p>— Replay Mode (@ReplayModeYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/ReplayModeYT/status/2011190255412457838?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This new remastered version of Meltdown features “updated visuals” and “dynamic lighting,” according to Activision. But, as seen in a comparison video posted online by YouTuber Replay Mode, the updated visuals seem to be cleaner and less grungy, with textures and props that are missing many of the old details like puddles, signs, exposed wiring, chainlink fencing, and warning decals.</p>

 <p>Replay Mode wasn’t the only person to notice this. <a href="https://www.threads.com/@dexerto/post/DTb11ZFDP1-/a-call-of-duty-fan-compared-how-meltdown-looks-in-black-ops-and-black-ops-via">If you look online</a>, <a href="https://x.com/itsHunterTV/status/2010914954690641981">you can spot</a> many people posting comparisons on social media of <em>Black Ops 7′</em>s version of Meltdown and the older original version of the map.</p> <p>In the comments, there are plenty of people arguing that the older map looks better, pointing out the fancier sky box and messier aesthetic. Meanwhile, other players say the new map looks better and provides better visibility.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Black ops 7 vs Black ops 2 .. <a href="https://t.co/MBsiDXWeJu">pic.twitter.com/MBsiDXWeJu</a></p> <p>— 1S Ghofy (@Ghofys) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ghofys/status/2010553685479207178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“How do you take a nuclear power plant and somehow make it look even more drab and lifeless?” asked one player.</p> <p>“Incredible how they’ve just completely sucked all the vibe and life out of the current <em>Call Of Duty</em> games. At least Zombies in <em>BO7</em> has some personality,” posted a person on Twitter.</p>

 <p>“The time of day makes the BO2 version look better, even though BO7 is most likely pushing far greater tech,” commented a player on Threads.</p> <p>“The fact that a 2012 game has better graphics is unbelievable,” said an upset fan.</p>

 <p>“Although&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em>&nbsp;has better fidelity, I think&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 2′</em>s version has a better art direction by miles.&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em> feels and looks so hollow,” posted another player on Twitter.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The map still plays well, but idk how they could look at the new map and not realize the lighting and skyboxes are is a downgrade. Shadows are very harsh in BO7 compared to BO2 as well <a href="https://t.co/kxxoyR27PP">pic.twitter.com/kxxoyR27PP</a></p> <p>— MrGoldenGamer (@MrGoldenGamerr) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrGoldenGamerr/status/2010931109757141272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>From what I can tell, the map changes made to Meltdown seem to be focused entirely on making it easier to spot enemies and react to threats. The old map features lots of walls that contain extra details and dark colors, which look nice but add extra clutter. These kinds of details can sometimes make it harder to spot an enemy player, so I can understand Treyarch removing them. Valve has made similar changes to old and new <em>Counter-Strike</em> maps over the years, too.</p> <p>Still, it does feel like the developer has picked clarity and esports balance over vibes and art style, and while I get that in 2026 many players demand perfectly balanced games with all the rough edges sanded down to keep things even, I think this “downgrade” is a good example of how we lose a lot in the pursuit of making everything fair.</p>

              <p><span>After four years of development, the launch of an open beta for </span><i><span>KYBER</span></i><span>, a community-hosted multiplayer game launcher for EA’s </span><i><span>Star Wars Battlefront II,</span></i><span> is proving to be a hit with the same fans who </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-2017-best-selling-game-may-2025-1851785893"><span>desperately campaigned</span></a><span> for EA to start making </span><i><span>Star Wars Battlefront III </span></i><span>last year.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>In June 2025, EA’s </span><i><span>Star Wars Battlefront II</span></i><span> received an </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-andor-sequel-steam-ps5-cheap-1851784922"><span>unprecedented uptick</span></a><span> in players on Steam. Having previously peaked at an all-time player count of 10,489 in January 2021, </span><i><span>Star Wars Battlefront II</span></i><span> more than tripled this figure with an all-time peak of 35,892, thanks in part to a bargain bin sale price of $5 at the time.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The sudden surge in player count was attributed to a fan campaign on Reddit by members of the r/StarWarsBattlefront community, following the success of </span><i><span>Andor’s </span></i><span>second season. The community’s goal was simple; they wanted to convince EA and Disney that a potential </span><i><span>Star Wars Battlefront III </span></i><span>sequel would be a success.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">At KYBER, we like pineapple on our pizza🍍🍕</p> <p>In other news, Star Wars Battlefront 2 got its first content update of 2026 on PC, and you can play it right now!</p> <p>Go to the website in our bio to play KYBER for free 🎮 <a href="https://t.co/csAqDU6e2t">https://t.co/csAqDU6e2t</a> <a href="https://t.co/Cb4AErk3D1">pic.twitter.com/Cb4AErk3D1</a></p> <p>— KYBER: Battlefront II Custom Servers (@KyberServers) <a href="https://twitter.com/KyberServers/status/2011111218514178553?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The community’s plea seemingly went ignored, as neither EA nor <em>Star Wars</em> rights holders Disney have expressed any intention to develop a new multiplayer shooter. Obviously, it was never going to be that simple, but the attention did seemingly galvanize Armchair Developers, the team behind </span><a href="https://kyber.gg/"><i><span>KYBER: Battlefront II</span></i></a><span>, into action.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Although </span><i><span>KYBER </span></i><span>had already been in development for several years before this point, the project’s community manager, Ethan Clark, </span><a href="https://aftermath.site/star-wars-battlefront-2-kyber-resurgence-day/"><span>revealed that the team</span></a><span> “worked nonstop all week, doing our best to help the content and mod creation communities fire on all cylinders” following the success of the May 24th “Resurgence Day” </span><i><span>Star Wars Battlefront II</span></i><span> campaign.</span></p>

 <h2><em>Battlefront 2</em> with more guns and classes</h2> <p><i><span>KYBER </span></i><span>is an “all-in-one launcher” for </span><i><span>Star Wars Battlefront II</span></i><span> that adds a wealth of player-requested features to the game, including proximity voice chat, a spectator mode, and even fully integrated Discord support. Of course, the real draw here is the newly added characters and the expanded mod support, </span><a href="https://screenrant.com/kyber-star-wars-battlefront-mod/"><span>including the likes of</span></a> <i><span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor’s </span></i><span>Cal Kestis and </span><i><span>Star Wars: The Clone Wars’</span></i><span> Asajj Ventress.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The open beta for </span><i><span>KYBER </span></i><span>started on December 20 and, according to a post from the </span><a href="https://x.com/KyberServers/status/2003468237728628963?s=20"><span>official KyberServers team account</span></a><span>, resulted in “61,169 unique players” and “1,339,489 sessions” within the first 48 hours of its release. Unsurprisingly, the r/StarWarsBattlefield community </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ptxtyo/kyber_has_been_a_huge_success/"><span>also seems thrilled</span></a><span> with how the player test has been going. </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ptxtyo/comment/nvl1pod/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>As one user</span></a><span> on the subreddit explained, “it’s like</span><i><span> Battlefront 2</span></i><span> but with more classes, guns, some balance changes too.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The open beta doesn’t seem to have a hard end date yet, and Armchair Developers announced that they have big plans for the project down the line. </span><a href="https://kyber.gg/news/kyber-open-beta-free-on-pc-20-december/"><span>They’ve promised</span></a><span> that the source code for </span><i><span>KYBER </span></i><span>“will be made available to the public” later this month, and that further balance patches are already in the works. </span><span>It’s not quite </span><i><span>Star Wars Battlefront III</span></i><span> yet, but with a couple of extra characters and a few more new maps, it certainly could be. Hopefully someone at EA or Disney is paying attention.</span></p>

              <p>I’m currently exploring, crafting and building my way through&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>-like <em>Hytale</em> to find out what this long-delayed blocky survival sim does to differentiate itself from its obvious inspiration. But in the meantime, let’s take a look at what’s already happened in the game’s first 24 hours since releasing into early access.</p> <p><em>Hytale&nbsp;</em>very nearly didn’t happen. The cuboid sandbox game has been in production since 2015 from Hypixel Studios, with financial support from Riot Games for the first few years until the massive company bought Hypixel outright in 2020. However, big twist: in June 2025 Riot cancelled the whole project, leaving its future in serious doubt. But then another twist: in November of last year, the game’s original founder Simon Collins-Laflamme bought the entire IP back from Riot <a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-riot-minecraft-hypixel-revived-cancel-shutdown-2000645248">and revived development</a>. Just two months later the game is out in early access, making Riot’s decision all the more peculiar.</p>

 <p>It’s not nearly finished, it’s fair to say. If <a href="https://hytale.com/">you buy the game now</a> you’ll find its central hub area is mostly various buildings with “Under Construction” signs on them, and the game’s “Adventure” mode is yet to be added alongside Survival and Creative. However, you’ll also find a very familiar style of game if you’ve ever played <em>Minecraft</em>, but with much higher-fidelity graphics, a far more complex array of crafting tables, and the slightest touch of creature collecting. So how’s it going so far?</p>

 <p>Well, pretty well! In the first 24 hours&nbsp;<em>Hytale</em> became <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/hytale-surges-to-the-most-watched-game-on-twitch-attracting-over-420-000-viewers-with-its-long-awaited-launch/">the most watched game on Twitch</a>, with 420,000 viewers across many, many streams. And perhaps more significantly, Collins-Laflamme took to X just before launch to say pre-orders have been so successful that the game has already secured a further two years of development costs.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pleased to announce that we have officially secured the next two years of development costs through pre-purchases. Combined with my personal commitment of ten years, we are looking very strong for the future ❤️</p> <p>Thank you all for the support.</p> <p>Hytale is saved.<br>We are almost home.</p> <p>— Simon (@Simon_Hypixel) <a href="https://twitter.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2010691717637222614?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>Yay Patch Notes!</h2> <p>The game <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hotfixes-13-january-2026">has already received its first hotfix</a>, aimed at fixing crashes caused by eyebrows, squelching a bug that stopped Norwegian people from launching it, and preventing buckets from breaking the game. Of course, this being early access, Hypixel are keen to communicate that the game is still going to be packed with issues and bugs. In <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hytale-is-finally-here">a blog post celebrating the pre-release of the game</a>, the team asks people to keep in mind the following:</p>

 <ul> <li>Early Access – many features are still missing, and bugs are expected</li> <li>It’s only been two months since we reacquired <em>Hytale</em> – and that’s how long we’ve had to prepare the game and rebuild the team from the ground up</li> <li>Demand has exceeded our expectations, which means launch week will be bumpy, but we’ll get everyone in</li> </ul> <p>The game, which is currently only available for PC but plans to make its way to PS5 and Xbox, does already allow modding and as such, people are already getting creative. Perhaps the most stand-out example would be <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/one-modder-has-already-got-doom-running-inside-the-voxel-sandbox-hytale-and-its-not-even-out-yet-it-plays-a-bit-like-a-broken-keyboard/">someone getting&nbsp;<em>Doom</em> running in the game</a> before it even released. As <em>PC Gamer</em> spotted, it’s achieved by importing a Java version of id’s shooter, then having it rendered via color-changing blocks within <em>Hytale</em>. Or witchcraft.</p>

 <h2>Exploration Motivation</h2> <p>The Exploration mode is the “proper” way to play the game just now, where the procedurally generated collection of biomes contains really elaborate structures to discover, and also all the core ingredients for the <em>Minecraft</em> survivalist. So you can build homes (I’ve made a lovely log cabin!), grow crops, craft ever-more useful tools, and do all this solo or with chums. Digging down proves similarly elaborate, with big underground structures to explore, and of course mobs to battle. There are also the vestigial beginnings of the game’s story, with a hub area you can teleport to once you find the Forgotten Temple, speak to a couple of NPCs, and begin a task to identify as many species of creatures as you can in order to unlock new crafts.</p>

 <p>The forthcoming Adventure mode appears to promise a lot more RPG-like elements that will hopefully better distinguish the game from its inspirations, but in the meantime the focus is really on venturing far from where you spawn and discovering its much more detailed landscapes and the mobs within.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Asus TUF Gaming Desktop PC (Nvidia GPU, 512GB SSD) Is So Cheap You’ll Want to Buy It Instantly]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-asus-tuf-gaming-desktop-pc-nvidia-gpu-512gb-ssd-is-so-cheap-youll-want-to-buy-it-instantly-2000659757</link>
            <guid>1406041</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Yes, you can game on most standard PCs out there, but these options aren’t designed to provide you with an immersive gaming experience that brings your favorite titles to life. If you’re looking to play better in 2026, a dedicated gaming PC is a must-have.</p>
<p>Like all nice things, the best gaming PCs on the market can cost a pretty penny, but that’s not the case today. Amazon just dropped the 2025 ASUS TUF T500 PC by 11% which <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6757/">brings its $900 price to $800 – an impressive $100 discount</a>. There are no complicated coupon codes to enter or long checkout steps to worry about, either. Just add the PC to your cart, and the discount applies automatically.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6757/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See offer</a></p>

<h2>Premium Look, Incredible Performance</h2>
<p>The PC flaunts a stunning, mecha-inspired design with bold lines, yellow accents, and a transparent side panel. It gives off a rugged, anime-inspired look that’s instantly going to catch the attention of anyone and is sure to turn heads. The clear side panel offers a stunning view of your rig with RGB lighting. The lights are customizable, so you can choose the color you want. Maybe go for yellow for a premium feel, or something a bit more vibrant if you want your PC to make a statement.</p>
<p>It runs on an Intel Core i5-13420H CPU that offers a great balance of performance and price. Paired with the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 GPU, it can run most modern games smoothly, and even lets you work on resource-intensive creative projects with ease. There’s a modest 16GB RAM that keeps things snappy as you push through tasks. We’re talking casual gaming with friends while streaming, and juggling demanding tasks like video editing and 3D design without slowing down.</p>



<p>The 512GB PCIe Gen 4 SSD storage makes it easy to keep all your favorite gaming titles, plus other media content and projects close, in a single place. SSDs are also known to be much faster than their traditional counterparts in terms of performance. What does this mean for you? Speedy file transfers and much quicker application launches throughout the day. Despite all this performance, the PC stays cool as it works. That’s thanks to its custom copper heatpipes and a 90mm fan, both of which come together to offer optimized airflow. This keeps the temperatures in check and also prevents noisy operation, even when things get a bit intense.</p>



<p>Exceptional durability comes from the PC’s MIL-STD-810H certification against shock, vibration, heat, and altitude. Basically, it’s going to support your gaming adventures and creative projects for years to come. Speaking of long-term use, you’ll also appreciate the tool-less side panels and the spacious interior, which make it easy to upgrade and maintain your system over time. It’s built to grow with you as your needs change.</p>
<p>To wrap it up, if you’ve been on the lookout for a reliable, muscular gaming PC that can handle pressure well, the ASUS TUF T500 is an excellent option to consider. It’s now down to $800, after Amazon generously took $100 off its usual price. We highly recommend grabbing it as soon as you can, as the price can shoot back up at any moment now.</p>
