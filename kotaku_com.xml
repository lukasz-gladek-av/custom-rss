They chose to make it so good, and so comprehensive, that it removed the need to make any more. It has now been over ten years since <em>Mario Kart 8</em> first released, more than double the length that’s ever come between an entry in the series before. Honestly, they could re-re-release <em>8</em> for the Switch 2, and it’d still sell millions. Given this, here’s an idea: why not do something <em>dramatically </em>different with <em>Mario Kart 9</em>?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196599,196001" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>All I’m saying is make it into an RPG.</p><p>It’s really hard to underline properly how unprecedented is the success of <em>Mario Kart 8</em>. This game was first released for the Wii U in 2014, then re-released for the Switch in 2017 as <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>. Now, it was an embellished version, with all previous DLC, new characters, let you hold two items, and a rejuvenated battle mode, but it was still very much the same game. The Wii U version is thought to have sold almost 8.5 million copies, and the Switch release is one of the best-selling games ever made, at an astonishing 64 million copies. With frequent new content, and endless fixes and tweaks, the game is still receiving patches even since what appears to be its final content update when it hit version 3.0.0 in November 2023.</p><p>It’s been such a phenomenon that Nintendo has very wisely not attempted to usurp it, doubling the longest ever gap between entries, the previous longest stretch being from 1996's <em>Mario Kart 64</em> to 2001's GBA title, <em>Mario Kart: Super Circuit</em>. And listen, remember when Nintendo formerly announced the Switch 2 last week, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-9-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-trailer-1851740833&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-9-nintendo-switch-2-announcement-trailer-1851740833">everyone spent a couple of hours arguing over whether the game footage shown was <em>Mario Kart 8</em> or something new</a></span>? People seemed like they’d be happy with just some more of <em>8</em>.</p><p>So why not? May as well just tip that numeral over and call it <em>Mario Kart ∞</em>. Add a whole bunch more tracks, update something else, call it a day. And for <em>Mario Kart 9</em>, let’s go deep.</p><p>One of my all-time favorite games is 2004's <em>Mario Golf: Advance Tour</em>. I have never played a real game of golf in my life, and have no interest in golf games in general, but that Game Boy Advance game was utter joy from start to finish. You played as one of two kids, Neil or Ella, who join the Marion Clubhouse as potential star golf students. There you meet an eclectic mix of humans and <em>Mario</em> characters, with the ultimate aim of beating Mario himself in the final championship. And it’s wonderful! Utterly bonkers, with splendid writing, the vast majority of the time you’re actively playing the core golf game, but all within a narrative, and surrounded by RPG elements.</p><p>When developers Camelot returned with 2014's <em>Mario Golf: World Tour</em>, I was so excited! Ten years later there was to be another entry! And then I found out this was a follow-up to the GameCube’s <em>Toadstool Tour</em>, no RPG at all, and I went off and sulked. I went through much the same in 2021 with <em>Mario Golf: Super Rush</em>. I’m still sulking now. But I still hold hope in my heart. I still believe that every single <em>Mario</em> game can be massively improved by being an RPG. So let me sell you on this idea for <em>Mario Kart</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="c980208198f4af5e679f637b8700851c" data-recommend-id="image://c980208198f4af5e679f637b8700851c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="667" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario Golf Advance Tour, with Mario about to hit a ball." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mario Golf Advance Tour, with Mario about to hit a ball." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c980208198f4af5e679f637b8700851c" data-recommend-id="image://c980208198f4af5e679f637b8700851c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="667" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario Golf Advance Tour, with Mario about to hit a ball." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You pick a character, whether it’s a Neil or an Ella or a Toad, and you get your first kart. You have just arrived at the Marion Gran Prix Academy, a location that has four local racetracks, Luigi Raceway, Moo Moo Farm, Koopa Troopa Beach and Kalimari Desert. You’re tasked with completing various training races, learning skills like jumping and skidding, as well as how best to use the various item drops. Once you’ve completed these tasks, you can take part in each track’s big race, and once you’ve won trophies in all four, you unlock access to the next site, the one that has Toad’s Turnpike, Frappe Snowland, Choco Mountain, and Mario Raceway.</p><p>Along the way, you gain levels, letting you spend points in speed, drift, bounce, steering, and the all-important luck. You develop your character according to your own preferred approach to <em>Mario Kart</em>, the relatively minor tweaks letting you lean in to your own skills.</p><p>Each site has <em>Mario</em> characters scattered about, people to talk with, little secrets to discover. And each has its own unique bonus rounds, time trials, and extra challenges. The ultimate goal is, of course, to beat Mario on the Rainbow Road, but that’s a distant dream when you begin. You’ll need to have developed your kart into something really special to manage that, tweaked its brakes and drift to your ideal settings, and gained the best skills in a starting boost.</p><p>Obviously this is the greatest idea anyone has ever had, but alongside my rightfully being given a million-billion dollars and a crown, I imagine there are a few ne’er-do-wells who would argue, “But I want a PROPER <em>Mario Kart 9</em>!” That’s because they didn’t read the first half of this perfect argument properly, and realize they just already have it. It’s <em>Mario Kart Infinite</em>, remember? When Nintendo is building me my throne made of Master Swords, I’ll remind them they have to make that Switch 2 upgrade for <em>8</em>/<em>Infinite</em>, with the handful of new tracks, and that’ll keep them distracted while the rest of us have <em>the best time ever</em>.</p><p>Glad we could get this sorted.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the final season, the show introduced a confusing parallel timeline where the stranded characters live normal lives, only to find out it wasn’t a parallel timeline but some sort of purgatory-like afterlife where they can all reunite. We never find out why all that weird stuff happens on the island, what the deal was with all of those numbers, or where Jacob (Mark Pellegrino) got the powers to grant immortality and leave whenever he wanted. </p><p>Erickson promises <em>Severance</em> won’t turn into <em>Lost</em>, but dances around fully committing to answering all of the show’s mysteries. “I promise the show will not literally turn into <em>Lost</em>. We won’t put them on an island and have Sawyer show up. No—we’re very conscious of that fact that we need to know where we’re going, and we need to reward people’s patience and faith.”</p><p>That <em>Severance </em>fan theories multiplying quicker than Apple can pump out episodes almost guarantees there will be questions unanswered, mainly because they were questions Erickson never posed. The series can have a satisfying ending without explaining how many departments there are in the Lumon building that houses the main cast, or why there is a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/miss-huang-severance-season-2-apple-tv-1851738787&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/miss-huang-severance-season-2-apple-tv-1851738787">child working on the Severed Floor</a></span><em>. </em>Those mysteries are ancillary and not central to the drama of the show. But, there remain quite a few mysteries they’ll need to clear up by the end of the series if they want to avoid <em>Lost</em> levels of ignominy. </p><p>We need to know what these severed workers are actually working on, and what Lumon’s ultimate plan is. The whereabouts of Ms. Casey (Dichen Lachman) seem to be a focal point of the current season, but we also need to know if and how Lumon faked her death given the facts Mark S (Adam Scott) says he identified her body. Under no circumstance can this series end without explaining what the fuck is the deal with the goats. </p><div><p>Those are just a few of the core mysteries that need to be resolved but the time the show wraps up. Lucky for us <em>Severance </em>fans, Erickson says Season 3 shouldn’t have the nearly three-year wait Season 2 had. Let’s just hope this whole series isn’t all just happening in Kier’s comatose mind in some Lumon nursing home. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

What happens when supernatural and unstoppable forces take over the place that is meant to be your sanctuary? How can you escape when this is where you are meant to stay? These spectres–often ghosts or something demonic—are mostly unseen, appearing only when they need to drive others out, typically seeking revenge. </p><p>Horror movies tap into the unsettling idea that something evil can lurk within our walls.They turn everyday objects and environments, like creaking floorboards or long hallways, into sources of fear. Any tragic events that occur within these confines can have ripple effects on all future residents. Let’s step inside some of the best haunted houses ever to be put on screen.</p></div></div><div><p>The visionary Guillermo del Toro helms this sumptuous Gothic melodrama with haunted house themes. The newly wed Edith Cushing moves into her husband Sir Thomas Sharpe’s mammoth yet crumbling estate, Allerdale Hall, along with his sister, Lucille. Edith warily navigates the mansion, drenched in midnight blues, where the only light comes from flickering candelabras. As she moves through the hallways, she searches for the source of the unsettling whispers and creaking floors. The ghosts are unlike any you’ve seen before—spindly creatures with red skin stretched taut over their bones, bent limbs, and dark, hollow eyes. The slow-moving, moaning creatures hold the key to the nefarious Sharpe family history. </p></div><div><p>At first, <em>Insidious </em>feels familiar, another story about a married couple (Rose Byrne and scream king Patrick Wilson) and their young children moving into a new home, only to experience unusual, supernatural occurrences—randomly blaring alarms, bloody handprints on the children’s bed, and eerie noises. James Wan meticulously crafts his horror scenes with subtlety. In one memorable scene, the camera follows Renai as she goes about the house doing mundane chores, like taking out the garbage, while the unsettling children’s song “Tiptoe Through the Tulips” warbles on a record player. </p><p>Through the window from a distance, she catches a barely noticeable shadow of a little boy in period clothing, dancing to the song. It’s little moments like these that make <em>Insidious </em>so frightening. There’s plenty of jump scares, as well, like the sudden appearance of a red-faced demon that will leave your heart in your throat. The most inventive and chilling part of <em>Insidious </em>is The Further, a dark, foggy dimension where lost souls and demonic entities wait for the living. </p></div><div><p>While director Takashi Shimizu’s Japanese original is arguably superior, he also directs the American version of <em>The Grudge</em>, and both are well worth watching. The English version follows Sarah Michelle Gellar as an American nurse who encounters a haunted house in Tokyo. The way Japanese horror depicts ghosts gives you goosebumps—long-haired, pale figures with wide, black eyes that stare at you with a laser focus, appearing out of nowhere. </p><p>One of the scariest scenes is when a ghost crawls down the stairs, its limbs contorted into jagged angles and making a god-awful croaking noise. Another appears directly on top of someone beneath the covers. <em>The Grudge</em> transforms the emotional pain of a person’s life on Earth into a curse that claims all those who enter the space where these traumas occurred—creating an endless cycle of torment.</p></div><div><p>There’s some 1970s-era cheese in <em>The Amityville Horror</em>, but it’s still one of the OG haunted house movies and a must-see. Based on a true story, the Lutz family moves into a New York home where Ronald DeFeo Jr. slaughtered his entire family. The famous arched windows truly look like eyes, as if the house is sizing up its next victims. </p><p>Satanic occurrences plague the new residents, such as being swarmed by flies, waking up at the same early hour that the DeFeos were murdered, and seeing the piercing eyes of a pig outside the second-story window. <em>The Amityville Horror</em> makes the menacing assertion that the dark events tied to the land where our homes are built, as well as the history within a house’s walls, can manifest in evil ways.</p></div><div><p>Despite being championed by Steven Spielberg and Martin Scorsese as one of the scariest movies of all time, <em>The Haunting</em> doesn’t rely on jump scares or terrifying monster reveals, unlike the hokey 1999 remake. Instead, Robert Wise’s film takes its time and revels in ambiguity, never allowing the viewer to truly know what’s behind the swaying chandeliers, the loud banging, or the sounds of a girl crying. We learn that the stately mansion does have a tragic backstory when a group is brought there for a paranormal study, including a psychic (Claire Bloom) and a lonely woman who claims to have personal experience with the supernatural (Julie Harris). </p><p>What<em> The Haunting </em>lacks in traditional frights makes up for in atmosphere: ominous low angles, a sharp monochromatic palette, and the ornate Gothic surroundings of the sprawling manor. The camera itself has a ghostly presence, observing the characters from afar with a curious tension, using widescreen to capture the lopsided rooms, always leaving us uncertain whether something strange will appear.</p></div><div><p><em>Paranormal Activity </em>became a cinematic sensation thanks to its viral marketing that included trailers with night vision clips of terrified audience members and a campaign urging people to demand the film be shown in their theaters. Similar to <em>The Blair Witch Project</em>, the identities of the actors were kept hidden, making it feel as though this footage was truly found. <em>Paranormal Activity </em>is one of the best haunted house movies because of its simplicity; most of the film is observing the couple Katie and Micah (Katie Featherson and Micah Sloat) sleeping in their new home, unaware that an invisible demonic presence is also watching them and waiting to strike. </p><p>It makes you wonder what happens in your own home while you’re fast asleep. We are filled with dread every time the video camera time clock reaches 3AM, when the vengeful supernatural forces pull comforters, slam doors, or drag someone into a pitch-black hallway. The lo-fi aesthetic and practical special effects make the scares feel more personal and tangible, culminating in a cruel and devastating ending. </p></div><div><p>Nicole Kidman delivers yet another arresting performance as Grace, a buttoned-up, devout mother who will do anything to protect her pale, delicate children with a rare condition that makes exposure to the sunlight painful. This means that the inside of the stately Gothic estate on the English countryside is cloaked in shadow and lit by candlelight throughout the film, which only heightens the tension of the ghostly happenings such as a piano playing by itself or doorknobs randomly jiggling. </p><p>One of the most terrifying scenes is when Grace finds an elderly woman wearing her daughter’s communion dress and playing with puppets but speaking in her little voice. There’s an antiquated eeriness to <em>The Others</em> in the depictions of seances and nineteenth-century photographs of corpses, all building to a surprising twist ending that completely turns the haunted house genre on its head.</p></div><div><p>Tobe Hooper, who directed the grimy <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em>, and producer Steven Spielberg, the king of suspenseful blockbusters, join forces for Poltergeist, which follows the Freeling family living in a suburban California home. The film is filled with bold and unforgettable visuals: a knotted tree that comes to life and bursts into a child’s bedroom, a creepy clown doll, a face melting into bone, a little girl sucked into a television set, and a pool filled with skeletons. </p><p>The family enlists a team of paranormal experts, including a psychic, to try to rescue Carol Anne (Heather O’Rourke) and exorcise the sinister and restless spirits that haunt their home. They eventually discover a macabre truth about the land their home was built on. While <em>Poltergeist </em>is certainly scary, it also has a playful side, offering a thrill ride that gleefully drags its characters through a chaotic, rollercoaster-like experience.</p></div><div><p><em>The Orphanage</em> blends a traditional haunted house ghost story with a missing persons thriller, set in a decaying estate that was once an orphanage. After living there as a child, Laura Rodríguez (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=1deeb23685599852&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1096US1097&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIL9cBdHiD0DdNNVZq1Pt-tN934XMA:1737143797822&amp;q=Bel%C3%A9n+Rueda&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLSz9U3MCorMk6vUuIEsS2yq5KytISyk6300zJzcsGEVXJicckiVh6n1JzDK_MUgkpTUxIB3Jb3aTwAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi5tfj3xP2KAxW2E1kFHRENFrkQ9OUBegQIEhAE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=1deeb23685599852&amp;rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS1096US1097&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIL9cBdHiD0DdNNVZq1Pt-tN934XMA:1737143797822&amp;q=Bel%C3%A9n+Rueda&amp;stick=H4sIAAAAAAAAAONgFuLSz9U3MCorMk6vUuIEsS2yq5KytISyk6300zJzcsGEVXJicckiVh6n1JzDK_MUgkpTUxIB3Jb3aTwAAAA&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi5tfj3xP2KAxW2E1kFHRENFrkQ9OUBegQIEhAE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Belén Rueda</a></span>) returns to the orphanage with her husband Carlos (Fernando Cayo) and their seven-year-old son Simón (Roger Princep), planning to transform it into a haven for children with disabilities. </p><p>Soon, Simón claims to have befriended a boy named Tomás, who wears a disturbing sack with a painted-on smile. Laura also sees him appear throughout the grounds. Shot in muted colors, <em>The Orphanage</em> carries a deep sense of melancholy. After Simón mysteriously goes missing, the film moves toward a tragic and shocking ending that reveals the creepy children cliché is more than it seems. </p></div><div><p>James Wan is a master of horror because he knows exactly how to carefully and slowly form heart-jumping, inventive scares with haunting images. They often strike you when you least expect it, like the sudden appearance of a foot dangling from a ghastly pale body hanging from a tree, or a craggy, snarling witch perched on top of a dresser. <em>The Conjuring</em> is one of his best films, based on the true story of the Perron family, who move into a house where strange occurrences begin—waking up at 3:07AM every morning, bruises appearing on the mother Carolyn’s (Lili Taylor) body, and an unseen figure lurking in a pitch-black bedroom corner. </p><p>The way Wan reveals the ghosts—slow and steady, yet quick and lacerating—is truly terrifying. <em>The Conjuring</em> also turns the real-life demonologists Ed and Lorraine Warren, who also worked on the Amityville Horror case, into compelling protagonists with a romantic love story. It also gives them a connection to the film’s surprisingly moving themes of motherhood. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
