Personally, that’s part of the appeal, having 20+ ways to play, and not all of them rely on twitch reflexes and precise aim. But still, there are folks who are going to bounce off of all 20 of those playstyles, and just have to watch their friends play and laugh and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962">bitch about Jeff</a></span> from a distance. But don’t worry. It’s not like those folks are starved for options. Here’s a few options for those folks who want to make theirs Marvel, without all that pesky K/D ratio talk. <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d31a0ac6182fa5db834b045cd367238d" data-recommend-id="image://d31a0ac6182fa5db834b045cd367238d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Marvel and Capcom characters are arranged in a hero image." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Marvel and Capcom characters are arranged in a hero image." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d31a0ac6182fa5db834b045cd367238d" data-recommend-id="image://d31a0ac6182fa5db834b045cd367238d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Marvel and Capcom characters are arranged in a hero image." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’ll grant, this is mostly just trading one labyrinthine set of mechanics for another that’s even more likely to result in you getting pieced up in infinite combos by someone who hasn’t seen the touch of a gentle hand or the light of the day star since Obama was in office. But the magic of the <em>VS</em> titles is just how much can be had just randomly screwing around with characters and team builds, and wacky moves without ever having to take the games online. Seeing Magneto, M. Bison, and Dr. Doom get absolutely destroyed by a team composed of a Little Red Riding Hood, a Japanese schoolgirl, and The Mad Titan Thanos is just one of those innate charms that never gets old, solo or with friends. Best of all, there’s now three different flavors of experience to be had, with the announcement that some absolute maniacs have spent a preposterous amount of time and energy into <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXorZjVETFQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXorZjVETFQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">revamping the reviled <em>Marvel vs Capcom Infinite</em> into a respectable game</a></span>. <br></p></div><div><p>Nothing about <em>Midnight Suns</em> is my jam on paper. Card-based/deck-builder games just don’t click with my brain, <em>Balatro </em>notwithstanding, and <em>Rivals </em>aside, real talk, there’s a lot of licensed Marvel trash floating out there to be avoided at all costs. And that’s to say nothing of the fact that I was around when the <em>Midnight Sons</em> arc started back in the early 90s, trying to cash in on the dark, and edgy undercurrent running through all comics, which was the style at the time. Even being the exact age when edgy comics should’ve hit my teenage brain like a wrecking ball, these guys just didn’t do it for me.</p><p>So when I tell you that I fell head-over-heels in love with <em>Midnight Suns</em>, you know how hard that game is working to get me to care. It helps that it’s from developer Firaxis, bringing its A-game to the strategic aspects of gameplay. But there’s also some absolutely delightful deep cut Marvel lore and character work going on there between the strategy. Fighting Lillith and whatnot? Sure, I guess. Making sure Blade and Carol Danvers hook up? I will MOVE MOUNTAINS. <em>Midnight Suns</em> was apparently a huge flop for Firaxis, but it’s never too late to get more people on that deeply underrated bandwagon. </p></div><div><p>Speaking of deeply underrated. It’s hard to blame anyone for giving Crystal Dynamics’ <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> game the side-eye after Square Enix’s <em>Avengers</em> debacle poisoned the well. Anyone who’s actually spent time playing it, however, knows the truth. <em>Guardians</em> is just a damn fine third-person action title that really puts in some serious work making the <em>Guardians</em> feel like a caring-but-dysfunctional family that Star-Lord has to manage. It helps, too, that Star-Lord is an infinitely more likable, thoughtful scoundrel than Chris Pratt who, even when faced with a crucial, branching choice, finds a way to keep his family together. It helps even more that he doesn’t get himself in a scenario where all he has to do is wait till the goddamn Gauntlet is off and then he can combo up Thanos all he wants but <em>nooooo, </em>he has to get his smackdown on while everybody else is trying to save the goddamn universe from being snapped, and because of him it fails, and it’s his fault, and he is scum and you know what, I may still have anger issues about that. Let me make note of that for my therapist.</p></div><div><p> It feels like all the rizz has gone out of this one since <em>Balatro</em> took its place as the de facto card game in everyone’s hearts this year. But make no mistake, the mobile card-battler is still going strong with constant updates, and is still just as fun as it’s ever been. In fact, the game’s current season includes a crossover with <em>Rivals</em>, bringing some of that game’s character art to the deck, as well as introducing Galacta into the mix. Sure, you’ll be bitching about balancing issues here too, but it’s hard to stay mad at a game you can be done with during the fifth time that accursed Wegovy commercial they keep running on a loop on Hulu plays out. <br></p></div><div><p>Of course, if you’re looking to cross enemy lines to DC, you’ve played all the <em>Arkham</em> games, and you value your time and dignity too much to play <em>Gotham Knights</em> and <em>Suicide Squad</em>, you can actually try something a little different that won’t demand much aside from time and commitment. <em>DC Universe</em> is one of the few survivors of that time when every studio wanted their own <em>World of Warcraft</em> instead of their own <em>Overwatch</em>. No game survives this long without having something going for it, and in this case, with <em>City of Heroes</em> effectively a ghost, superhero MMOs a dying breed altogether, and the price being right–as in, <em>free</em>–to fool around in a big expansive superhero universe that, while it does have the usual MMO grind problems, does understand its assignment as a DC superhero simulator.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Well, they didn’t.

Sure, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.acer.com/gb-en/handheld-gaming/nitro-handheld-gaming/nitro-blaze-11&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.acer.com/gb-en/handheld-gaming/nitro-handheld-gaming/nitro-blaze-11" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nitro Blaze 11</a></span> has two USB-C ports, a 3.5mm audio jack, a USB- A port (nice!), and a microSD card slot. It also includes solid internal specs with an AMD Ryzen 7 8840 chip, Radeon 780M graphics, 16GB of RAM and up to 2TB of SSD storage. </p><p>But come on, <em>look </em>at that image above. This might be a powerful gaming device, but it’s not portable. I mean, I guess if your definition of portable is simply “You can technically carry it around by yourself,” then sure, the Nitro Blaze 11 counts as a portable PC. Still, I’m not sold on the idea that many people will want a Steam Deck-like device that’s bigger than a cat. It goes against one of the biggest selling points with these things: You can take them anywhere and play all your games easily. </p><p>Acer seems to understand that this is probably not a product for everyone and will also offer smaller, more Steam Deck-sized portable PCs. The Nitro Blaze 8 features similar specs but with an 8-inch screen and will be priced at $900. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.acer.com/acer-debuts-its-first-handheld-gaming-pc-the-nitro-blaze-7&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.acer.com/acer-debuts-its-first-handheld-gaming-pc-the-nitro-blaze-7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A slightly smaller and less powerful Blaze 7</a></span> will also be available later this year for $800. </p><p>And for those of you out there who want to lug around a desktop PC crammed into a medium-sized container, the Acer Nitro Blaze 11 and its comically massive screen will be available for $1,100. At that point, you might just want to buy an actual gaming laptop.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A ton of major games still don’t have specific release dates, and some of the biggest potential releases—a new 3D <em>Mario </em>from Nintendo, for example— haven’t even been officially announced yet.

I was drawn to the attention to detail the team at Ritual Studios took to make every note and strategic choice I made in its music-based battles feel like a part of the world. The music would change depending on what instrument I wielded, each card had a different melody attached to it as I used it in battle, and because each of those cards and guitars came with different functions, I was given plenty of reason to switch between them and hear different music throughout the brief time I got to play.

Perhaps the only person who can answer that question is the one who directed the first game, Hideo Kojima. I loved <em>Death Stranding</em>. I loved its earnest tale of post-apocalyptic bond-building and cooperation; I loved the way I felt the terrain of its world under my feet; I loved the way its asynchronous multiplayer went hand-in-hand with its thematic concerns.
