              <p>Dell is one of those omnipresent American brands that dominate the mass laptop market, and if you need to gear up for back-to-school or switch out your office configuration, Amazon just debuted a deal that’s hard to pass up.</p>
<p>Now, the Dell Inspiron <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3962/">15-inch touchscreen laptop (Intel 10 Core i5 1334U, 32GB DDR4 RAM, 1TB PCIe SSD) can be purchased for $699, down from its usual $2,699 price tag</a>. That’s a <strong>huge 74% discount</strong> and it brings a premium-level device into a price range that feels almost unbelievable. On top of that, you’ll get a <strong>free 8-in-1 USB-C hub</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3962/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Yet Affordable</h2>
<p>The heart of this device is its <strong>13th Gen Intel Core i5-1334U processor which has 10 cores and 12 threads</strong> to make multitasking responsive without slowing you down. Toss in generous 32GB of DDR4 RAM and you have the room to run all your day-to-day applications and resource-intensive tasks simultaneously without skipping a beat.</p>
<p>The 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD also offers plenty of space for files, movies, and downloads, and keeps start-up quick and applications snappy. No longer just sitting around waiting for stuff to load: everything just opens up immediately. For students with speedy access needed to class material or businesspeople working on large projects, that kind of performance is a huge difference in everyday use.</p>



<p>And of course, the screen is a major part of the experience and Dell hasn’t cut corners on it: This Inspiron laptop<strong> features a 15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen</strong> with an anti-glare finish and narrow borders so you enjoy sharp images and vibrant colors without distracting reflections. It’s the kind of screen that makes video calls clear and day-to-day browsing easier on the eyes. Combined with Intel Iris Xe graphics, you’ll also enjoy smoother graphics for light gaming or creative use like photo editing.</p>
<p>WiFi 6 is offered in this laptop, so you’ll get faster and more stable internet connections which is perfect if you spend a lot of time streaming, working from home, or on video calls. On top of Bluetooth and a solid port set, like Type-C, Type-A, HDMI, and even an SD card reader, you already have enough flexibility to attach your favorite peripherals or extend your setup with ease. And to top it all off, <strong>the bundle includes an 8-in-1 USB-C hub</strong>&nbsp;so more ports to connect external monitors, storage devices, or even wired broadband with RJ-45.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro in S Mode comes pre-installed with business-ready features available along with a personal and streamlined environment. That is, you can upgrade your workflow from day one without the additional time of configuring. And yet the device depends on performance and functionality without compromising on a sleek, modern design in black that slices well on a desk or on the move.</p>
<p>Deals like this don’t tend to linger long during high-demand periods like back-to-school, so if you’ve been considering an upgrade, this price drop makes the decision an easy one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For too long <em>Pokémon</em> games have set us as rivals to other trainers, forced to complete against the likes of N, Leon and Marnie, rather than provide them with what they truly need: support and love. But thankfully that’s all about to end with the arrival of trainer plushies on the Pokémon Center store.</p> <p>It’s quite something that this hasn’t happened before. But as The Pokémon Company continues its true purpose—<a href="https://kotaku.com/mega-evolved-pokemon-plush-gengar-gardevoir-2000618808">creating plushies of everything imaginable</a>—its attention has finally turned to the human component of the games. Five trainers have arrived on the store in snuggly form: Lillie (<em>Sun</em> and <em>Moon</em>)<em>,</em> Cynthia (<em>Diamond</em> and <em>Pearl</em>)<em>,</em> N (<em>Black</em> and <em>White</em>), Leon, and Marnie (both <em>Sword</em> and<em> Shield</em>). Each is depicted in a chibi style, rather than their more lifelike appearance in the games, between seven and nine inches tall.</p> <p>There do seem good reasons to have gone for the short, big-headed chibi approach, given the somewhat <em>problematic</em> nature of some fans’ relationships with the human characters in&nbsp;<em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>games. Characters like Lillie, for instance, are 11, while people like Marnie and Cynthia are ambiguously aged, most likely a teenager and a 20-something respectively. Within the world of the card game, such characters tend to fetch the highest resale prices, with the grim term “waifu tax” usually applied. (N is 20, and Leon is “an adult” for what it’s worth, while Leon’s little brother Hop surprisingly isn’t included in this first set.) Life-size plushies of any of them would be…a whole thing, and even to-scale renditions could get weird. Certainly even more troubling ground than the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-life-sized-gardevoir-plush-import-center-buy-1851752663">$449 life-size Gardevoir</a> that’s as <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/product/72-10419-101/gardevoir-poke-plush-63-in">sold out</a> as you’d expect.</p>

 <p>Anyway, the result is super-cute human plushies for the very first time. Leon seems like a great choice, especially if you buy a Charizard to go with him, but I imagine N and Marnie will be the two most popular, given the former was such a charming rival in&nbsp;<em>Black&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>White</em> as the leader of Team Plasma, while Marnie’s meanness and Dark-type preferences made her the most entertaining rival in&nbsp;<em>Sword</em> and&nbsp;<em>Shield</em>.</p> <p>It does rather raise the question of which other game characters should receive the plushie transition. My preference has to be&nbsp;<em>Diamond</em> and&nbsp;<em>Pearl</em>‘s Barry, but purely because “Barry” is such a funny name for a child to have. It is a name only allowed to truck drivers in their 40s. No child should ever be called Barry. Carmine from&nbsp;<em>Scarlet&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Violet</em>‘s DLC is another obvious choice, because she was just so damn cool. Oh, and to state the obvious, Misty and Brock! Oh, and please may we not forget Opal. Presumably the only reason there’s no Grusha in this first set is because it’s impossible to capture that beautiful boy in any doll.</p> <p>Oh it got weird again.</p> <p>These new trainer plushies are currently available on the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-au/category/new-releases">Australian</a>, <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/category/new-releases">UK</a> and <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-nz/category/new-releases">New Zealand</a> stores, and will appear on <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/category/new-releases">the U.S. store</a> in the next couple of hours.
