And it’s kind of funny, because the [<em>Fallout </em>show] is the furthest into the future. So there’s a lot of room where we don’t necessarily need to overlap. There are some things that we could overlap the stories, that could exist, but we largely try to keep those pretty simple.”</p><p>Rush explained that the show is “great” at telling a <em>Fallout </em>story as it is made by “big fans” of the franchise. As such, the games and shows go “together really well.” And that brings people from the Amazon series to the games. And some of these people will likely be expecting some content from the series, which Rush teased might be happening. </p><p>“Lining things up with the seasonal releases of the show, it’s stuff that we talk about all the time, and we do have plans for things here and there,” said Rush. “I’m not going to go into detail on any of those now, but the two teams do talk to one another.” </p><p>So I doubt Lucy will appear in <em>Fallout 76</em>, the timeline doesn’t support it. And fans are already mad about the <em>Fallout</em> timeline as it is. But it does sound like everyone involved with the show and games understands this time around how huge the series is and that doing some crossover content would be smart. There have been rumors for a while now about a <em>Fallout 3 </em>or <em>New Vegas</em> remaster. And season two of <em>Fallout </em>will feature New Vegas. Hmmm... something to think about. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-fallout-76-crossover-new-vegas-update-1851786026]]></content:encoded>

Their answer was a perfect window into how game development often seems to work at Nintendo, with each new decision occurring as a response to previous ones rather than as a top-down structure superimposed upon the project from the start. While Pauline was suggested as a possible sidekick for the game early on, she wasn’t there from the beginning (<em>Bananza </em>started development as a Switch game, the pair confirmed). </p><p>“I think the moment we actually realized we would go in that direction came about as a result of an artist who created some concept art of the zebra transformation,” Motokura said. “We saw that image and thought it was really fun, so we immediately prototyped it to try it out in the game. And when our composer saw that, they decided to create specific music just for that transformation.”</p><p>He continued, “And the music for it was so good, we thought we could expand on this and turn it into a song and maybe Pauline would be a good choice to sing that song. And so we then asked the composer to create songs for each of the transformations and I think that’s what really cemented Pauline’s place.”</p><p>From there, a lot of other parts of the game started falling into place. <em>Donkey Kong</em> can’t speak but Pauline can, providing a narrative guide to Ingot Isle where the game takes place. Pauline’s music also became a clever way to mask game mechanics like pointing out which direction the player is supposed to go in. Co-op, meanwhile, lets a second player control her voice to stun enemies as DK is running along. Pauline is in the game because her character fits with cool gameplay ideas, not because Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-lore-pauline-cranky-kong-how-1851784745?_gl=1*wduhkz*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTIxNjAyNTckbzQxJGcwJHQxNzUyMTYwMjYwJGo1NyRsMCRoMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-lore-pauline-cranky-kong-how-1851784745?_gl=1*wduhkz*_ga*NjgyMDU5NjUzLjE3NTAwODIwMTA.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTIxNjAyNTckbzQxJGcwJHQxNzUyMTYwMjYwJGo1NyRsMCRoMA..">cares about the <em>Donkey Kong</em> timeline</a></span>. </p><p>That doesn’t mean there’s no room for fun speculation about characters and crossovers, like whether <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is secretly a prequel to <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. Motokura was asked point blank how old <em>Donkey Kong</em> is, but he demurred. “I think that’s another one that maybe is good fodder for player theories,” he said. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pauline-donkey-kong-bananza-timeline-dk-lore-1851786019]]></content:encoded>

Absolutely no one has heard of it, despite its being one of the best things on TV right now. So here I combine my roles into one. Season two of the Peacock show wraps this week, meaning right now is exactly the correct time to start binging it all.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>You don’t have to work hard to sell <em>Poker Face</em>. It goes like this: “You know the guy who does the <em>Knives Out</em> movies, Rian Johnson? Well, he also has a TV show, modeled on <em>Columbo</em>, but it’s Natasha Lyonne in the main role.” At this point, most people are already in. For others you need to add, “Yeah, from <em>Russian Doll</em>. And, sure, <em>American Pie</em>.”</p><p>When I say “modeled on <em>Columbo</em>,” that’s not me being cute. <em>Poker Face</em> follows the Peter Falk show’s format from concept through to title fonts. So, as with the ‘70s/’80s classic murder mystery, you know who the killer is from the beginning of each episode, the murder shown in a pre-titles vignette before Lyonne’s Charlie Cale appears. Titles and credits then appear in the familiar yellow text, and in season one, Lyonne is even perpetually holding a cigar and walking with the same peculiar gait. It’s a <em>joy</em>.</p><p>However, <em>Poker Face</em> is also very much its own show, too. Charlie Cale is an itinerant amateur detective, on the run from the mob after getting far too involved in the machinations of a Laughlin, Nevada casino. Cale, you see, has an innate ability to tell when anyone is lying. Not a practiced skill, not something she’s learned from years of the study of micro-expressions or whatever, but just a superpower. She has an almost involuntary response of “bullshit!” whenever she hears a lie. Which makes her an excellent poker player, but not well liked by those trying to keep dark secrets.</p><p>Each episode, Cale shows up in a new town, mostly living out of her car, trying to get work and inevitably becoming entwined in the lives of the murder victim, or indeed the murderer. After the opening scene showing the crime, the episodes almost always skip back some hours or days to then show how Charlie fits into the situation, followed by her reluctantly solving the killing.</p><figure id="" data-id="14178115791f1ef231bd9c3841c728f7" data-recommend-id="image://14178115791f1ef231bd9c3841c728f7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Charlie Cale smoking a cigar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Charlie Cale smoking a cigar." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Peacock / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="14178115791f1ef231bd9c3841c728f7" data-recommend-id="image://14178115791f1ef231bd9c3841c728f7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Charlie Cale smoking a cigar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The show is exquisitely well written, and beautifully directed. Natasha Lyonne is a force, her take on Columbo a constant delight, always feeling like a distinct homage rather than an aping impression. And wow, the rest of the cast. Given Cale’s nomadic impermanence in any one spot, there are only a few occasionally recurring characters, meaning most episodes build the cast up from scratch. The program seems to have its pick of any actor it wants, with massive names appearing week after week. To name very few: Adrien Brody, Awkwafina, Jospeph Gordon-Levitt, Richard Kind, Katie Holmes, Giancarlo Esposito, Nick Nolte, John Mulaney, John Cho, Carol Kane, Lili Taylor, Method Man, Kumail Nanjiani...</p><p>The real skill of the show is to be able to bring in so many famous names, and have no one stick out like a Guest Star, but rather immediately establish deep, meaningful characters. Despite episodes lasting just 45 minutes to an hour, it paces itself so ideally, allowing you to get to know these people and to grow invested in Charlie’s relationships with them.</p><p>Because Charlie’s not a cop, it also frees the show to be far more morally ambiguous. This isn’t necessarily about capturing the evil killer and seeing justice dealt—while it sometimes definitely is that, there’s also room for far more nuance. Or, as is sometimes the case, for Lyonne just to find a resolution within the situation before moving on that doesn’t involve anyone being hauled away in handcuffs.</p><p>The mood of the show can also swing in some deft and impressive ways. While it’s <em>always</em> funny, that humor can become a lot darker, or a lot lighter, with incredibly breezy episodes between storylines that really take their toll on Charlie. She’s not asking for any of this, almost always dragged into a situation after she accidentally (and quite literally) calls bullshit. She hears the lie, and then can’t let it go. Sometimes that leads to excellent shenanigans, other times to losing newfound friendships. And sometimes she’s solving the murder of a school hamster.</p><figure id="" data-id="81851f6bf0ee59baa9bd864e04ca4a5b" data-recommend-id="image://81851f6bf0ee59baa9bd864e04ca4a5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Charlie covered in mud and blood in a wooden cabin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Charlie covered in mud and blood in a wooden cabin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Peacock / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="81851f6bf0ee59baa9bd864e04ca4a5b" data-recommend-id="image://81851f6bf0ee59baa9bd864e04ca4a5b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Charlie covered in mud and blood in a wooden cabin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of the 21 episodes that have aired, with one more appearing today, July 10, there hasn’t been a dud. There’s none that feel like a drag, or that felt phoned in. As such, if you’ve not watched at all, then there’s no need to suggest you begin with a particular highlight, or offer a suggested list—just start with the first and blitz your way through. There <em>are</em> chronological elements to the overall arc, so it benefits from watching through in order, even if each episode also successfully stands alone.</p><p>Rian Johnson’s love of ‘70s and ‘80s crime drama and televised whodunits helped make <em>Knives Out</em> and <em>Glass Onion</em> so incredibly fun, with Daniel Craig’s detective Benoit Blanc a sort of amalgam of all their protagonists, perhaps with the heaviest dose of <em>Murder, She Wrote</em>’s Jessica Fletcher. In <em>Poker Face</em>, he draws from the same well, but with <em>Columbo </em>as that main source instead. And its respect for those programs hides no embarrassment, no sense that it needs to pastiche or satirize, but instead proudly delivers a modern version of the same. Yes, there’s cursing, and it’s perhaps a touch more brutal in some of the murders than you’d have gotten away with on ‘70s network TV, but the spirit is the same. And no, Lyonne doesn’t turn around every episode and say, “Ah, just one more thing...”—although there are very occasional lovely allusions toward it.</p><figure id="" data-id="5feca1066d5c8708e1dfe00f08730e37" data-recommend-id="image://5feca1066d5c8708e1dfe00f08730e37" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Charlie in her casino outfood, looking bemused." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Charlie in her casino outfood, looking bemused." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Peacock / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5feca1066d5c8708e1dfe00f08730e37" data-recommend-id="image://5feca1066d5c8708e1dfe00f08730e37" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Charlie in her casino outfood, looking bemused." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Likely the reason so few are on top of this incredible show is because it’s on Peacock, and, well, unless you’re after the <em>SNL</em> archives, there’s not a great deal of other motivation to pay yet another monthly subscription. But with the second season wrapping up today, now is the perfect moment to find a free trial, or pay a one-off to get it for a month. (Make sure to set a reminder to cancel it a couple of days before it’s due to renew—you’ll forget otherwise, you know you will.)</p><p>You’ll love it. You’ll love everything about it. It’s so funny, and warm, and just so incredibly well made. It’s kind of unbearable to know that after today, it’ll likely be a year before we get to see any more—and that’s <em>if</em> it’s picked up for a third run, on which there’s no word yet. So, if nothing else, watch it just so you push up the numbers and I get to see some more. For me.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/poker-face-peacock-natasha-lyonne-rian-johnson-columbo-1851786010]]></content:encoded>
