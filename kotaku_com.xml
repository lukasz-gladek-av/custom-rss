              <p><span>Nintendo says it’s actively monitoring the impacts of tariffs and the rising prices of RAM as an AI-fueled scramble spikes computing costs around the world.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The comments came in a rare interview the </span><i><span>Mario</span></i><span> maker’s president, Shuntaro Furukawa, gave to </span><em><a href="https://www.kyoto-np.co.jp/articles/print/1631945"><span>Kyoto Shimbun</span></a></em><span>, which was translated </span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-is-monitoring-high-ram-prices-and-tariff-impacts-very-closely-president-shuntaro-furukawa-says/"><span>by </span><i><span>VGC</span></i></a><span>.&nbsp; In it, the executive noted that the possibility of raising the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 due to future costs is hypothetical and didn’t commit one way or the other. However, he did acknowledge that AI data centers requiring large amounts of RAM, and the scarcity this situation creates, may become a concern in the future.</span></p> <p><span>When asked about the current challenges for keeping Switch 2’s profit margin lower than that of its predecessor, Furukawa explained, “Hardware profitability depends on factors like component procurement conditions, cost reductions through mass production, and the impact of exchange rates and tariffs.”&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>The executive previously told investors that Switch 2 pricing was safe for now unless there was another Trump trade war blowup. “While we are aware that the costs of various materials are rising, we also anticipate some areas where cost reduction may be achieved for Nintendo Switch 2 through ongoing mass production efforts,” Furukawa </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-sale-discount-2000642086"><span>said in November</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <h2>Is 2026 the year Switch 2 goes to $500?</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803"><span>The rising costs of PC parts</span></a><span> aren’t only concerning for gaming firms like Nintendo but also for average people. It’s become pricey and challenging to purchase RAM and graphic cards for PCs. </span><span>It’s gotten so bad that NVIDIA </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-rtx-3060-returning-2026-dram-shortage-gpus-expensive-prices-2000656687"><span>is reportedly</span></a><span> considering making its older RTX 3060s graphics cards available again to meet demand.</span></p>

 <p><span>During the interview, the Nintendo president also said that the game company had projected a negative impact from tariffs last year which ended up costing it tens of millions in the first half. </span><span>“This is a crucial period for our game business as we promote the adoption of new hardware and maintain the momentum of our platforms. We are working on this while carefully considering the situation,” he said.</span></p>

 <p><span>While Nintendo is monitoring these rising costs and market changes, it has already responded to them over the last year. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-inflation-tariffs-2000614220"><span>In August of 2025</span></a><span>, the gaming firm increased the prices of its original Switch console. The U.S. price for the nearly decade-old Switch console rose from $299 to $339, the Switch OLED from $349 to $399, and the Switch Lite from $199 to $229.</span></p>

 <p><span>At this time, it’s unclear what decisions Nintendo will make due to the market conditions of RAM costs and the tariffs. However, during the interview, President Furukawa said, “While it’s difficult to accurately gauge the future impact, our basic policy is to recognize tariffs as a cost and pass them on to prices as much as possible, not just in the US.”</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/good-boy-indy-astra-award-best-performance-dog-horror-2000658943</link>
            <guid>1403629</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>When </span><i><span>Good Boy</span></i><span>, the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/good-boy-does-the-dog-die-horror-movie-indy-showtimes-2000631497"><span>dog-led horror movie starring Indy the retriever</span></a><span>, premiered last year, I said we should give the titular good boy an Oscar for his performance. That was just an offhand comment made in jest, but now that we’re in award season, Indy has actually been winning awards for his performance, though most of them have been against other animal actors. That is, until the Astra Awards on Friday, January 9, where he won the award for Best Performance in a Horror or Thriller, which was met with both happiness for the dog and a surprising amount of cynicism about the state of award shows.</span></p> <p><span>It’s important to note that Indy had no awareness that he was even “acting” in any real sense of the word. Director Ben Leonberg said in a behind-the-scenes mini-doc accompanying the film that Indy is not a trained canine actor, and the film is edited such that shots recontextualize moments where Indy is just looking at something off-screen as Leonberg makes noise behind the camera.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><span>Indy has won animal performance awards from the South by Southwest Film &amp; TV Festival, the San Diego Film Critics Society, and the Boston Society of Film Critics. However, the Astra Award is the first he’s won against actual human actors, and there were some pretty big standouts in the category:</span></p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Alison Brie – </span><i><span>Together</span></i><span> as Millie Wilson</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Ethan Hawke – </span><i><span>Black Phone 2</span></i><span> as The Grabber</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Sally Hawkins – </span><i><span>Bring Her Back</span></i><span> as Laura</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Sophie Thatcher – </span><i><span>Companion</span></i><span> as Iris</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Alfie Williams – </span><i><span>28 Years Later </span></i><span>as Spike</span></li> </ul>  <p><span>Now, if you look at the comments under Leonburg and Indy’s acceptance speech video, you’ll see an outpouring of support for Indy’s win and his handsome little bowtie. If you look elsewhere, however, you’ll find that both fans of the other nominees and general award season followers are viewing it through a much more cynical lens. Honestly, the more I think about it, the more Indy winning out against excellent human actors sounds like the plot of a Disney Channel Original Movie in which a young kid’s canine companion makes trouble for their owner’s no good, mean-ass bullies by beating them at the local talent show. It’s the kind of move that feels like it was made for the sake of the meme rather than to actually recognize the performance that displays the most craft, skill, and artistry.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Incredibly so,” AdhesivenessFar5588 responded. “Especially since in the ‘making of’ at the end of the movie, they literally say that he’s not acting. There is no performance. It’s simply recording over and over again until you get the reaction you were looking for, and then splicing it together with other scenes. This would be like giving an award to an actor who had to wear an ear piece with their dialogue fed to them line by line. Like, it’s cute in theory to give the dog an award, and incredibly insulting when you think about it for more than 10 seconds.”</span></p>

 <p><span>As some have pointed out, this is an especially annoying move for an award celebrating the horror genre, which is rarely recognized during awards ceremonies, and it’s unlikely several of these actors will be nominated in more general categories throughout awards season.</span></p>

 <p><span>“This kinda sucks, [not gonna lie],” 1080TJ wrote. “Horror performances are barely awarded outside of these specialized categories and it would’ve been nice for any of these actors to get some acknowledgement for their work. Alfie Williams in particular was amazing.”</span></p> <p><span>I’m of the mind that </span><i><span>Good Boy</span></i><span>’s most award-worthy aspects are in its editing and directing, especially once you realize Indy has no formal training as an acting dog and it’s Leonburg’s directorial debut. Indy can sweep the animal actor awards, but pitting him against the likes of Ethan Hawke and Sophie Thatcher and giving him the trophy is pretty unserious. </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/comparing-legos-new-200-pikachu-set-to-mega-bloks-50-version-2000658904</link>
            <guid>1403593</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When fans learned that <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-pokemon-pikachu-date-price-mega-bloks-teaser-1851770713">Lego had finally snagged the Pokémon license from a rival brick-based brand</a>, there was a lot of excitement. But now, some fans aren’t happy about the higher prices and the build differences between each company’s Pikachu sets.</p> <p>After teasing it in 2025, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-lego-sets-release-date-price-pikachu-charizard-2000658895">Lego has finally revealed its first upcoming Pokémon sets</a>, which include an Eevee and a Pikachu. However, these aren’t the first officially licensed brick-based toy products based on Game Freak’s famous franchise ever to hit store shelves. For years, Mega Bloks, a Lego competitor, had the license and released over 100 different Pokémon sets. Mega Bloks has produced a lot of different Pokémon sets and themes in various sizes and packages. So to keep this fair, we are going to focus on the two most comparable sets from Mega Bloks: Jumbo Pikachu and Jumbo Eevee. These sets are roughly the same size as Lego’s upcoming Pikachu and Eevee sets and seem the fairest to compare.</p>

 <p>First up, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/building-poseable-character-Building-Exclusive/dp/B079KNH886?tag=kotaku01-20">from 2022, it’s the Mega Bloks Jumbo Pikachu</a>. When it arrived on shelves a few years ago, this 12-inch-tall Pikachu cost $50, though you could often find it on sale if you looked around. It contains 806 pieces and features posable arms, legs, ears, and a movable head. It is also a chunkier Pikachu, more closely resembling the OG “fat Pikachu.” Honestly, a pretty solid, good-looking set, though there were complaints at the time that the build had some issues with pieces falling off. All you get in the set is the Pikachu and nothing else.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000658926" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658926"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658926">© Mega Bloks / Game Freak</figcaption></figure> <p>Let’s compare that set to Lego’s newly announced Pikachu set. <a href="https://jaysbrickblog.com/news/first-lego-pokemon-sets-officially-revealed-for-27-february-2026-launch/">This set is going to cost $200</a> when it launches in February, which is four times as much as Mega Bloks’ version. Ouch. And when directly comparing them, I’m struggling to see why. Lego’s set is technically 13 inches tall, but that’s only when it’s set up on the included brick-built stand.</p>

 <p>The actual Pikachu build appears to be around 11 inches or so tall, so around the same size as the old Mega Bloks set. And yet it costs $150 more. It also includes over 2,000 pieces. Lego’s Pikachu is cleaner looking for sure, with fewer exposed studs, but that might be a negative for some folks. I think the biggest downgrade is that the Lego Pikachu seems far less posable. Though I greatly prefer Lego’s version of Pikachu’s hands, which look like cute paws instead of the blocky, ugly human-like hands found on the old set from 2022. Lego’s set also includes a brick-built Poké Ball, which is neat, but I could have done without.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000658927" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658927"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658927">© Lego / Game Freak</figcaption></figure> <p>Meanwhile, the comparison between Mega Bloks’ Jumbo Eevee and Lego’s Eevee set is much less interesting. They both appear to be about the same size and are similarly priced. Mega Bloks wanted $50 for Eevee back when it was released in 2020. Lego is going to sell its Eevee for $60. A $10 increase for more pieces and a nicer-looking build. That works for me.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000658933" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000658933"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000658933">© Mega Bloks / Lego / Game Freak / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>On the flipside, the Lego Pikachu does seem like a very pricey set that seems somewhat of a downgrade compared to Mega Bloks’ spin on Pikachu. I appreciate the cleaner look and the included stand, but the Pokeball seems like wasted pieces, and I wish, for that price, Lego included more posable limbs and joints.</p>

 <p>Ultimately, I’d say if you are desperate to get your hands on a brick-built Pikachu for your desk or bedroom shelf, but don’t want to fork over $200, then buying a new Mega Bloks Pikachu for $50 or less will get you a solid alternative, and you’ll have money leftover to buy Lego’s cheaper Eevee set.</p>

              <p>As we sit in the comfortable denial that lets us believe it’s games like <em>Arc Raiders</em> and <em>Battlefield 6 </em>that are the most popular out there, earning the most attention and the most play time from the most players, pesky reality maintains its own truth, in which truly gargantuan numbers of people are playing Roblox and&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em> fan-games you’ve likely never heard of. <em>Fish It!</em>, a&nbsp;Roblox game, <a href="https://romonitorstats.com/experience/121864768012064/">saw nearly 28 million players yesterday</a>, with 1.4 million playing at the same time. At the same time, <em>Fortnite</em>‘s creator-made&nbsp;<em>Steal the Brainrot</em>, itself a version of a wildly popular Roblox game, saw a record 1.09 million concurrent players. And as of last week’s changes to <em>Fortnite</em> which allow creators to implement microtransactions, it also introduced both super-expensive items and gambling!</p> <p>In a game called&nbsp;<em>Steal a Brainrot</em>, it’s perhaps hard to expect anything less. The original Roblox game<!--StartFragment --><span>—which you’ll note has a slightly different title than its <em>Fortnite </em>imitator<!--StartFragment -->—<!--EndFragment --></span>was based on the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/italian-brainrot-ai-italian-animals">Italian brainrot meme</a> that was big in 2025. In the game, players could either buy or steal weird-looking animals, which generated in-game money through ownership.&nbsp; At one point it saw a record-breaking 25 million concurrent users—more than half the number of players <em>every game on Steam</em> has ever seen at once. And <a href="https://kotaku.com/steal-a-brainrot-roblox-empire-review-popular-memes-1851787027">it’s ghastly</a>—ask anyone with a kid who played it and you’ll hear tales of their distraught misery after their most expensive Brainrots were stolen. This, of course, is by design.</p>

 <p>The game manifested in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>as <em>Steal the Brainrot</em> in July of last year and immediately became one of the most popular player-created games, doing a lot to raise awareness that <em>Fortnite</em> even offered such options for creators. But until this weekend, it could only offer a money-less simulacrum. Within 24 hours of a change to the game’s regulations allowing microtransactions in user-created games, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-fortnite-enables-third-party-microtransactions-steal-the-brainrots-developer-is-slammed-by-fans-for-immediately-adding-45-premium-bundles-and-gambling-style-mechanics">as reported by <em>IGN</em></a>, <em>Steal the Brainrot</em> was charging 4,900 V-Bucks (around $35) for the “Lucky Rot” bundle, a lootbox option that only <em>might&nbsp;</em>contain a rare brainrot animal-thing.</p>

   <p>Epic’s approach to&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em> and the ways in which players are able to create their own game modes is very much modeled on the eye-watering popularity of Roblox. But until very recently, Epic wasn’t allowing its audience to monetize those creations, giving Roblox a hefty edge among those hoping to catch the incredibly brief flashes of lightning in a bottle. Last Friday, that changed, and in that recognizable Epic style, the option was launched with a far better cut of the profits for developers than is typically offered elsewhere. (The Epic Games Store takes 12 percent of a game’s sales, compared to Steam and others’ 30 percent.)</p>

 <p>Known as “islands” on&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, those player-created games have been given access to developer tools for adding microtransactions <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/tools-for-in-island-transactions-now-available-to-fortnite-developers">since November of last year</a>, with the switch-on date set for January 9, 2026. Deliberately aimed at scooping Roblox, 100 percent of the value of V-Bucks spent in a given game will go directly to creators until January 31, 2027, dropping to a still solid 50 percent after that. (Confusingly, this isn’t representative of actual spend due to platform fees—<a href="https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/fortnite/in-island-transactions-overview-in-fortnite?lang=en-US#monetizationandpayouts">the full breakdown is here</a>, but it essentially works out to 74 percent of money spent for the first year, then 37 percent afterward, largely due to the 30 percent cut taken by console owners.)</p>

 <p>Alongside&nbsp;<em>Steal the Brainrot</em>‘s new lootboxes is a straight-up gambling wheel. As&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/fortnite-gambling-feature-outrage-483800-20260112"><em>Gaming Bible</em></a> notes, many are calling this out as unambiguously being a slot machine. You spend 100 V-Bucks (roughly a dollar) and you get to spin the wheel, with prizes including in-game items or currency. And given <em>STB</em> is obviously primarily aimed at children, this is…it’s not great, is it?</p>

While it certainly is popular with a younger demographic, it still has a sizeable adult audience too. But when it comes to stealing brainrots, let’s be real: it’s overwhelmingly pre-teens being encouraged to play the odds, shelling out cash for a spin of the wheel or a box that&nbsp;<em>might&nbsp;</em>have something of use in it.</p>

              <p><span>Every year needs its marquee bad game, and just two weeks into 2026, it looks like the new yeare might already have a contender. </span><i><span>Code Violet </span></i><span>is a survival horror game from TeamKill Media, the team who made the apparently also awful </span><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/quantum-error/"><i><span>Quantum Error</span></i></a><span> from 2023. Both games are currently sitting at a 40 on review aggregate site Metacritic, and given that </span><i><span>Code Violet </span></i><span>only has a handful of reviews thus far, there’s still time for the dinosaur-shooting </span><i><span>Resident Evil </span></i><span>knockoff to tumble down farther in the ranks.</span></p> <p><i><span>Code Violet</span></i><span> mixes the claustrophobic corridors and over-the-shoulder shooting of games like </span><i><span>Resident Evil 4 </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Dead Space</span></i><span> with the dinosaur-infested setting of </span><i><span>Dino Crisis</span></i><span>. Or it tries to, at least. From the sound of it, the game doesn’t pull any of this off anywhere near as well as the games it’s clearly trying to emulate, and its simplistic shooting never quite manages to make its dinosaur foes feel terrifying enough to overpower you.</span></p>

 <p><span>“In a straight up skirmish with these scaly foes, a well-timed dash back can really befuddle the raptors, shattering their simple gameplan of running at you, taking a big swing, pausing, and doing it again,” Jarrett Jawn writes at </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/code-violet-review"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>. “There’s limited space before you hit a wall or a door that might have automatically closed behind you, though, so you can only backdash so much before making yourself a much easier snack to catch. The camera will collide with these barriers far sooner than [protagonist] Violet will, rendering any encounter that doesn’t take place in the dead center of the room a completely unintelligible mess for as long as it takes you to get the camera refocused.”</span></p>

  <p><span>Several reviewers state that everything about </span><i><span>Code Violet</span></i><span>’s combat seems undercooked in a way that makes it hard to even interpret visually or through audio cues. </span><i><span>PushSquare </span></i><span>reviewer John Cal McCormick, meanwhile, described the shooting as “limp” and its guns “weightless.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Shotguns should boom, but firing one in </span><i><span>Code Violet</span></i><span> feels like when you bite the end of the paper off a McDonald’s straw and blow through it so the wrapping flies off,” McCormick writes.&nbsp; </span><span><br> </span><span>“Less of a boom, and more of a wildly unsatisfying thwip. Hit boxes seem erratic, and visual feedback is largely non-existent. It’s often unclear if you’re actually hitting your target or not until the dinosaur you’re shooting at unconvincingly keels over.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Outside of the actual pointing and shooting, several reviewers noted the odd tonal dissonance between the game’s survival horror setting and the way it frames its protagonist Violet, with her&nbsp; fanservice-driven wardrobe and </span><i><span>Code Violet</span></i><span>’s insistence on giving players an unimpeded view quickly growing tiresome, corny, and at odds with the moment at hand.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Although the character model is highly detailed, it is done so in a sexualised manner, which is further enhanced through the array of revealing costumes that you can dress her in at save points,” </span><a href="https://cogconnected.com/review/code-violet-review/"><i><span>COGConnected</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> Jaz Sagoo writes.</span></p> <p><span>“In a pivotal moment in the story, Violet bawls at the death of a comrade,” McCormick says. “The comrade was killed by a space dinosaur, incidentally. And as the tears stream down her face, and the voice actor puts their all into each wail, the camera pans back to reveal Violet is dressed like a sexy cowgirl complete with arse-less chaps.”</span></p>

 <p><span>If you scroll down to the comments on most of these reviews, you’ll find that a lot of folks aren’t terribly surprised by this, given </span><i><span>Quantum Error </span></i><span>was also a certified stinker. There are also plenty of people saying what they really want is for Capcom to bring back </span><i><span>Dino Crisis </span></i><span>so we can get a real dinosaur horror game instead of these knock-offs. But from the sound of it, you’re better off waiting for Capcom to pull the franchise out of cold storage than playing </span><i><span>Code Violet</span></i><span>.</span></p>
