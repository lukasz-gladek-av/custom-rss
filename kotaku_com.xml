So if, in the midst of all that, you didn’t happen to catch the video game reference in the show, you can be forgiven for missing it. That’s right, Lamar put a direct reference to PlayStation in his performance.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/true-story-behind-kendrick-lamar-super-bowl-halftime-show/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wired.com/story/true-story-behind-kendrick-lamar-super-bowl-halftime-show/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Wired</em></a></span> has a deep dive into the making of Lamar’s show, including interviews with the performance’s art director Shelley Rodgers and creative director Mike Carson, who explained that the premise of the show’s staging was to portray Lamar’s life “as a video game.” This included spaces on stage that were made to look like the face buttons of a PlayStation controller; a triangle, circle, X, and square. </p><p>“I think the [video game theme] was symbolic, his way to reach young people,” Rodgers told <em>Wired</em>. “A lot of it is showing his journey, traveling through the American dream.”</p><p>The performance itself wasn’t too overt with the video game motif, with Carson saying the team wanted to stay “clean and minimal.”</p><p>“We went with a monochromatic concrete look and allowed the video game motif to come alive through dialogue, lighting, choreography, and music,” Carson said.</p><p><em>Wired’</em>s story has a lot more behind-the-scenes information, including some photos of the stage being built. After noticing the PlayStation buttons in the set, some fans are saying the video game motif adds another layer to the ongoing feud between Lamar and Drake, essentially making this a “game over” moment for the Canadian rapper.</p><p>The whole show felt like a victory lap for the incredible year Kendrick’s had. Between winning the Drake feud by a landslide, releasing an excellent album in <em>GNX</em>, and co-headlining an upcoming tour with R&amp;B goddess SZA, the guy can’t stop winning.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He’ll stretch his arms out to hit enemies in close and medium range and it will be your go-to for dealing “filler” damage when Spore Bomb is on cooldown.</p><p><strong>Strangling Prison:</strong> This Ultimate grabs nearby enemies and pulls them together to wherever you aim the ability, dealing steady damage for a while. It’s a great opportunity to group enemies up so they can be taken out by Iron Man, Scarlet Witch, and many other Ultimate abilities.</p><p><strong>Thornlash Wall:</strong> This ability places a small wall at the target location. You have several charges of this one, so multiple walls can be placed. It can be angled several different ways and will Awaken when Groot is nearby, causing it to attack nearby enemies. Use it to block off locations and, ideally, separate healers from the rest of their team. Divide and conquer, baby. If a Duelist gets too greedy and runs ahead of the pack, place a wall behind them to make them easy to knockout.</p><p><strong>Ironwood Wall:</strong> This ability places a larger Ironwood Wall at the target location. You can only place one of these at a time, so think strategically. It can also be angled, and when Groot is nearby, the Ironwood wall will awaken to grant Groot and his nearby allies bonus health based on the damage they deal. While the Thornlash Wall is good to keep nearby, you definitely want to keep Ironwood near points you are guarding.</p><p><strong>Furious Flora:</strong> This is Groot’s melee attack. Hold this down and Groot will perform a three-hit melee combo. The last hit launches into the air, but there isn’t really a reason to use this instead of Vine Strike.</p><p><strong>Spore Bomb:</strong> - This is a grenade-like projectile that explodes, dealing AOE (area-of-effect) damage. Three smaller explosives spread out and detonate again, making this a great tool to throw into groups of enemies. With a short, 6-second cooldown, you should use this basically every time it’s available.</p><p><strong>Flora Colossus (Passive):</strong> This passive awakens spawned walls near Groot, activating their secondary abilities.</p><p><strong>Friendly Shoulder (Team-Up Ability: Passive):</strong> If Jeff the Land Shark or Rocket Raccoon are on your team, they can ride on Groot’s shoulders, taking less damage than they otherwise would. It’s also incredibly cute, which is a bonus all by itself.</p><h2 id="h680372"><a id="play"></a>How should you play Groot?</h2><p>Groot is one of the best Tanks in the game if played correctly. He can solo Tank with steady healers and has lots of versatility due to his ability to create walls. The most potent part of his kit, and the one which takes the most practice, is creating line-of-sight obstructions to cause problems for healers on the opposing team. </p><figure id="" data-id="b7295457df6d84c5a5801286495f5816" data-recommend-id="image://b7295457df6d84c5a5801286495f5816" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Groot summons a wall before another character." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Groot summons a wall before another character." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b7295457df6d84c5a5801286495f5816" data-recommend-id="image://b7295457df6d84c5a5801286495f5816" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Groot summons a wall before another character." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Use walls to defend key points, forcing enemies to waste time attacking your wooden constructs to make it through narrow hallways.

It definitely happened. However, it was still a fairly rare occurrence and most big-name actors were careful about appearing in too many. For example, Tommy Lee Jones and other Hollywood stars would <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/LE21qQHlOLQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/LE21qQHlOLQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fly over to Japan and other countries to do commercials</a></span> so nobody over here in the States would see them. There was still a fear that if you sold out <em>too </em>much and <em>too </em>often you’d look desperate and signal that your career was ending. And this was the case for decades. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD7D6B263E852D5FA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLD7D6B263E852D5FA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Then Super Bowl commercials became bigger and bigger in the 2000s</a></span> and companies spent more and more to create a viral, popular ad. And as this was happening, the lines between TV, movies, and internet content started to blur, while streaming services and YouTube grew in popularity. Hustle culture—the belief that as long as you were getting paid it was worth it—also grew during this time.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/WytGsPMPs24?list=PLCeYpRAW8Efo9ZormvxTt70EhGHCoQlHN&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/WytGsPMPs24?list=PLCeYpRAW8Efo9ZormvxTt70EhGHCoQlHN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> I remember people in 2015 cheering Kim Kardashian</a></span> for appearing in a big Super Bowl ad and celebrating that she “got paid!”</p><p>That has led us to 2025 and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly every damn Super Bowl ad</a></span> including famous people to help sell soda or crackers. And it’s all so sad. Watching Harrison Ford, an actor whom I really like and who has turned in some incredible performances, try to connect being a hero to owning a Jeep made me want to throw my TV out the window. Being assaulted with 20 different variations on “Actors and celebs behaving wacky while holding branded products” made me want to throw my phone out the window. </p><p>I think what really drives me nuts about these ads is how transparently greedy it all is. A lot of the people appearing in these commercials don’t need the money and yet, they likely got paid quite a bit to appear. And they just don’t care anymore about even pretending to look like artists or creators with backbones and morals.</p><p> They know that most people don’t care anymore. Everything we watch appears on the same tiny phone screen. The delineation between movies and TV and random viral videos is gone. It’s been gone for awhile. And that means there isn’t anything stopping someone like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/LC5V4aIoWes?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/LC5V4aIoWes?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barry Keoghan appearing in an ad for Square Space</a></span>. It won’t ruin his career or cost him fans or make him less of an artist anymore. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/RIXB-7RHjBY?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/RIXB-7RHjBY?list=PLCeYpRAW8EfqOdmUc9Z0QIFT4mCuDUEYB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Actors can freely dig up past roles and characters</a></span>, skin them, and prance about for 30 seconds recreating some moment you might remember, and get paid a lot to do it while suffering no negative consequences.</p><p>You might wonder “Who does this hurt?” or “What’s the harm of celebs getting paid to do commercials?” And to be clear, none of this is really hurting anybody. There are certainly bigger problems in the world right now. But that doesn’t change that it sucks shit—it hurts <em>art</em>. Hawking products for cash makes you a salesperson, not an artist.</p><p>So my suggestion is simple: Let’s start making fun of celebs for selling out and reminding them that its gross. It’s going to take a few years to build up momentum and change anything, but if we pull this off and we go back to making actors and artists feel shame again, we all might be able to avoid shit like Seal appearing as a seal in a fucking soda ad. </p><p>Doesn’t that sounds like a future you want to live in? <br></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some of the biggest games of 2025 are out this month, as well as some of the longest, with February bookended by massive RPGs that many players may spend all year slowly chipping away at. </p><p>Fans of open-world games are getting a slight reprieve.<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>was originally also going to drop this month but was pushed to March at the last minute. That will free players up to take on sprawling adventures like <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>, <em>Avowed</em>, and <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> instead. But there are a lot of cool-looking smaller games to checkout this month as well, at least a few of which could become sleeper GOTY contenders in their own right. Here are all the major game releases in February 2025:<br></p></div></div><div><p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> is one of those sequels that takes the first game and tries to make it bigger, more detailed, and more immersive in every way. Based on early reviews, it basically accomplishes that. The medieval RPG sim is bursting with detailed side quests and gameplay friction that makes merely surviving a challenge. It’s been topping the Steam charts this month, even if its grueling realism won’t be everyone’s cup of tea. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Warhorse Studios</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Deep Silver</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p>The Nintendo Switch exclusive is now on PC. Where <em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em> was a rhythm-based dungeon crawler,<em> Rift </em>is a more familiar <em>Guitar Hero</em>-style puzzle adventure. It takes the enemy pattern recognition of the previous game and applies the escalating anxiety of combat that doesn’t end until the song’s over. It’s really great. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Brace Yourself Games, Tic Toc Games</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Klei Publishing</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Switch, PC</p></div><div><p><em>Momodora: Moonlit Farewell</em> is the latest entry in the <em>Momodora</em> series. Released on PC last year, the 2D, magic-infused anime Metroidvania is now on consoles as well. In a crowded genre, it manages to stand out thanks to beautiful art and fun exploration. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Bombservice</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Playism </p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p><em>Civilization VII</em> is the first new 4X game in the franchise in roughly a decade, and looks to streamline some of the strategy series’ gameplay while also making important changes like altering how historical eras work and adding new crisis events that can upend how things progress. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/civ-7-civilization-6-steam-reviews-ui-early-access-1851757977&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/civ-7-civilization-6-steam-reviews-ui-early-access-1851757977">Early players have hammered it</a></span> for its UI and other elements feeling “unfinished,” but it has a strong foundation to build on. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Firaxis Games</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> 2K</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p><em>Urban Myth Dissolution Center </em>is a visual novel in which you investigate cursed relics and paranormal anomalies against the backdrop of creepy, lo-fi cutscenes. As Azami Fukurai, you take on the role of detective, working for a <em>Ghostbusters</em>-like organization where you scrape social media to unravel urban legends. I hope it’s basically <em>X-Files</em> with cool psychedelic pixel art.</p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Hakababunko</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Shueisha Games</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p>Slimes are usually introduced early on in RPGs as the easiest enemies to kill. In <em>Slime Heroes</em>, however, you actually play as one. It’s a souls-like action-RPG platformer in which you collect gems to unlock new abilities and enact your revenge on a colorful, uncaring world. There’s also local and online co-op. Slime buddies unite!</p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Pancake Games</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Whitehorn Games</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p><em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II</em> is the latest turn-based RPG in the sprawling <em>Trails</em> series. It takes place directly after the events of the first game, and includes cameos from veteran characters that will be harder to appreciate unless you’re up to speed on the previous entries. But if you’re looking for a long, intricate JRPG, this one’s for you. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Nihon Falcom</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> NIS America </p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p>The second batch of remastered classic <em>Tomb Raider</em> games has arrived. <em>Tomb Raider IV–VI Remastered</em> charts the action-adventure series’ shift from PS1 to PS2 and will include some of the bumpier games in the series history. Hopefully, the remastered elements make them easier to appreciate in a new light. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Aspyr, Crystal Dynamics</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Aspyr</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p>It’s been a while since we had a big, meaty first-person fantasy RPG. <em>Avowed,</em> from the studio behind <em>Fallout: New Vegas </em>and <em>The Outer Worlds</em>, will combine <em>Skyrim</em>-like gameplay with the world and lore of <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, with a heavy emphasis on side quests and negotiating between various factions. It’ll be on Game Pass day one for PC and Ultimate subscribers. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Obsidian Entertainment </p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Xbox Game Studios</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p>Four friends reunite later in life to retrace their memories of a pivotal summer long ago. <em>Lost Records</em> seems like <em>It</em> for ‘90s kids, leaning more into tech-fueled alienation than occult horror. It’ll be out in two parts with the first one coming this month. I don’t normally mesh well with narrative-driven adventure games but this one has me more intrigued than most. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Dontnod </p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Dontnod</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p>  “War is over. War is just beginning.” That’s the slogan of <em>Stories from Sol: The Gun-Dog</em>, a retro sci-fi love letter to ‘80s anime where you manage a patrol ship on the edge of space investigating a strange new anomaly. It’s narrative-focused, so be ready for lots of reading, but the pixel-art animations of everything from ship console controls to mechs fighting in space look incredible. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Space Colony Studios</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Astrolabe Games, Meridiem Games</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, PS4, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p>When it comes to <em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>, you either know or you don’t. If you don’t, all that matters is it’s a real-time action spin-off taking place after the events of <em>Infinite Wealth</em>. It follows beloved side-character Goro Majima as he sails around to various islands taking on the local criminal underworld. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Sega</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p>The once-forgotten Game Boy Advance exclusive is finally back. Action platformer <em>Ninja Five-O</em> was one of the Nintendo handheld’s most underrated games. Now players can once again step into the shoes of ninja Joe Osugi as he takes down a group of mystical terrorists in retro side-scrolling levels. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Limited Run Games</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Konami</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, PS4, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p>With an emphasis on wild movement, <em>The Local </em>is a first-person open-world shoot-em-up that looks super rad. All your favorite movement types are here including rail grinding,  sliding, wall running, climbing, air strafing, and bunny hopping. There’s also multiplayer and a leaderboard for chasing high scores. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Tobey Gronow</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>JINC</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC</p></div><div><p>It’s time to duel! Yugi Mutou returns to card battling in a collection of over a dozen of the franchise’s earliest games, now with online play, save anywhere, rewind, and other modern quality-of-life features. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Digital Eclipse </p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Konami </p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PC, Switch</p></div><div><p><em>Monster Hunter </em>is finally makings its current-gen debut with <em>Wilds</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>built from the ground up for modern high-end consoles and gaming PCs. If you’ve never hopped on the monster hunting train before, now is probably the time. <em>Wilds</em> is shaping up to be one of the more visually impressive and mechanically rich entries in the action-RPG series. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Capcom </p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Capcom </p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p>The biggest (and only real) golfing franchise returns this month with its latest entry.<em> PGA Tour 2K25</em> overhauls the MyPlayer creation options and adds new swing settings and other tweaks. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> HB Studios</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> 2K</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But sandwiched between the game’s four quarters was a spectacular performance by rapper Kendrick Lamar. Lamar’s performance transcended sports circles and was the talk of the internet last night. For most, it was a final nail in the coffin of the rapper’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kendrick-drake-beef-rap-battle-memes-internet-reactions-1851458972&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kendrick-drake-beef-rap-battle-memes-internet-reactions-1851458972">highly-publicized beef with Canadian rapper Drake</a></span>, but it also had a lot of commentary on the state of America, with President Donald Trump in the audience.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Let’s get the collective cultural catharsis out of the way first. The viral moment of the show was Lamar performing his now five-time Grammy-winning song “Not Like Us.” The song is one of many Lamar released during a public feud with Drake back in 2024, and has become a cultural phenomenon. With over a billion streams and multiple clips of entire crowds performing it (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HtmXTNn2Rw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HtmXTNn2Rw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">including the Grammy’s audience</a></span>), millions of people are celebrating a song that accuses Drake of being a culture vulture pedophile in reference to years of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.stylist.co.uk/people/millie-bobby-brown-drake-texting-relationship-friendship-stranger-things-grooming-twitter-controversy-paedophile-metoo-backlash-celebrity-news/228170&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/people/millie-bobby-brown-drake-texting-relationship-friendship-stranger-things-grooming-twitter-controversy-paedophile-metoo-backlash-celebrity-news/228170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">allegations of grooming young women</a></span> in the entertainment industry. The song is a scathing diss on its own, but when it goes on to become a record-breaking, award-winning hit, that’s when you know you’ve lost the rap battle.</p><p>Lamar’s performance of “Not Like Us” was a big moment for the show in a few ways. At the midpoint of the show, Lamar had a brief intermission with some of the show’s dancers, during which he said he wanted to “perform their favorite song, but you know they love to sue,” while the instrumental “No Like Us” briefly played. This was seemingly a reference to Drake’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/drake-UMG-defamation-complaint.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/drake-UMG-defamation-complaint.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple lawsuits regarding the song</a></span>, and at first, it seemed to imply that Lamar was barred from playing it at the show. He then transitioned into a medley of “Luther” and “All the Stars” featuring the immaculate R&amp;B singer SZA, my queen, and it seemed like that was it. Lamar would omit his biggest hit seemingly to avoid further controversy…until about three minutes later, when he went to chat with his dancers one more time, said this was “bigger than the music,” and that someone “tried to rig the game, but you can’t fake influence.” Again, this was seemingly about Drake’s lawsuit trying to muzzle the song’s cultural impact.</p><p>Then he starts rapping and the crowd goes wild. In Super Bowl halftime shows, artists have to trim down their songs to maybe a minute or two, and the section of “Not Like Us” Lamar chose to perform is the most explicitly aimed at Drake, even calling him out by name. One popular meme is the point when Lamar looks into the camera with a devilish, shit-eating grin and says, “Hey Drake, I hear you like ‘em young.” The word “pedophile” was left out of the song, replaced by a wordless shout in the live show, but he still had the entire Caesars Superdome crowd singing along to, “Trying to strike a chord and it’s probably A Minor.” Fatality.</p><p>Lamar’s cocky strut while he smiles into the camera became an instant meme, but the entire show was a victory lap in a year-long campaign to bury Drake.</p><p>Hopefully not lost in the sauce is that this was also a commentary on the state of the United States and its attempts to silence Black voices. Samuel L. Jackson made multiple appearances during the show as the U.S. propaganda character Uncle Sam. He starts off emphasizing that the Super Bowl is “The Great American Game,” followed by Lamar rapping the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7liwdjvhWc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7liwdjvhWc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GNX </em>teaser</a></span> that was released before his latest album, but has yet to be put on streaming services. However, he included a new lyric: “The revolution about to be televised. You picked the right time but the wrong guy.” This was seemingly a dig at fear-mongering President Donald Trump, who was in the audience but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-super-bowl-chiefs-eagles-b2695214.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-super-bowl-chiefs-eagles-b2695214.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">left during the second half</a></span>.</p><p>Uncle Sam returns after Lamar performs “Squabble Up,” one of his more rap-heavy tracks, and calls it “too loud, too reckless, too ghetto.” Then Lamar’s dancers, dressed in red, white and blue, arrange themselves to look like the American flag while he raps. Uncle Sam shows up a few more times to berate Lamar for not playing up what America believes the Super Bowl to be about. After the SZA medley, Sam appears one more time to say that “nice and calm” melodic songs are “what America wants.” He then proceeds to drag Drake across an entire football field. . As incredible as it was to see Drake get bodied on the biggest stage possible, this was a critique of the current state of America and the country’s history of policing Black art and voices. A lot of fans are hoping the overarching message of the show isn’t lost.</p><p>Lamar has had an incredible year and isn’t slowing down. Both he and SZA are preparing to embark on a co-headlining tour starting in April, and after seeing this show I might be about to buy tickets. Stream <em>GNX</em> and also SZA’s <em>Lana</em>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
