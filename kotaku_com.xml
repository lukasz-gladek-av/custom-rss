              <p>Gaming with friends is only fun when everyone has a controller in hand: There’s nothing worse than wanting to jump into a co-op session or host a game night only to realize you’re one controller short. That’s where having an extra Xbox controller becomes essential and right now, Microsoft is practically giving them away: The 2025 <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/">Carbon Black edition (and many more colors) has dropped to just $49 on Amazon, down from its usual $64 price tag</a>. This is a record low that didn’t even happen during Prime Day, which tells you Microsoft is seriously clearing inventory.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The 2025 model keeps everything gamers loved about previous versions while refining the experience: The Carbon Black finish looks sleek without showing fingerprints as easily as glossy controllers, and the ergonomic design ensures your hands won’t cramp during those marathon gaming sessions. The textured grip on the back and triggers provides better control during intense moments.</p>
<h2>Cross-Platform Liberty that Actually Functions</h2>
<p>This single controller does it all <strong>seamlessly between Xbox One, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Windows PCs, Android smartphones and tablets, iOS smartphones and tablets, FireTV Sticks, Smart TVs, and yes, VR headsets too</strong>. By being cross-platform, you’re not bound to just a single ecosystem. Need to continue your game session on your laptop when someone prefers to use the TV? Just sync the controller via Bluetooth (which does it in a few seconds) and you’re good to continue. With a <strong>wireless range of up to 30 feet</strong>, you have full liberty to sit anywhere comfortably in your front room and never have to worry about losing a signal.</p>



<p>Special mention must go to the battery life since this directly affects how you play games: It <strong>uses two AA batteries and provides you with about 40 hours of play time before replacement</strong> which translates to just over two months of moderate usage. It lasts longer than many rechargeable controllers that lose capacity after a year. You can, of course, use rechargeable AA batteries if you are that kind, and that provides you flexibility depending on how you have things set up. When you use it with Xbox consoles, the wireless uses the <strong>proprietary Xbox protocol and that provides you lower latency than ordinary Bluetooth</strong>. It does make a huge difference if you are playing competitive games and reactions are measured in a few milliseconds.</p>



<p>The button arrangement conforms to the classic Xbox design that millions of players already intuitively know: The hybrid direction pad handles sweeping motion and exact eight-way input equally well and is suitable for both fighting games and platform games. Analog sticks have enhanced sensors that have fewer dead zones, so your character reacts to the softest movement.</p>
<p>For just $49 down from $64, you’re getting a controller that has a 4.6-star rating among over 20,000 reviewers and currently tops the bestseller chart among Xbox Series X and S controllers. This all-time low makes it the best time to acquire another controller in your arsenal.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most people need a laptop that covers the basics reliably: smooth web browsing, comfortable document editing, video calls that don’t freeze and enough screen space to actually see what you’re working on. This HP laptop checks every box on that list and delivers a spacious 17.3-inch FHD display, an Intel i3-N305 8-core processor, 16GB of DDR4 RAM, and a generous 1TB SSD. Right now, t<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4710/">his machine is down to $639 on Amazon, slashed from its typical $2,199 price</a>. This all-time low didn’t even show up during Prime Day last week.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4710/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Intel i3-N305 processor has a surprising amount of muscle to deliver for an i3 chip. With the ability to run 8 cores and 8 threads and turbo speeds that can hit as high as 3.8GHz, this processor can handle office workflows, multimedia, and multitasking situations that would slow older budget notebooks to a crawl. Those 8 cores enable you to have dozens of browser tabs and video conferencing programs running, edit docs, and stream music and still never have a slowdown. By delivering responsive speeds to heavy duty programs like photo editing or analyzing a spreadsheet, this notebook has the capacity to do much more than simple web browsing and email.</p>
<h2>A Display that makes Everything Easier to View</h2>
<p>That 17.3-inch diagonal display transforms your computer experience in ways you may not anticipate until you’ve experienced it. Additional screen real estate translates to less scrolling to documents, effortless use of windows side-by-side and real productivity boosts working in spreadsheets or graphics applications. FHD resolution of 1920×1080 maintains text sharp and images clear and IPS panel technologies deliver true colors over extremely wide viewing angles.</p>
<p>Anti-glare coating <strong>minimizes eye strain when you’ll be sitting for long periods</strong> which is essential when you’ll be looking at the display for hours on end. Narrow bezel design makes maximum use of the screen real estate without making the laptop too large and innovative lift-hinge design raises the keyboard when you open the lid to form a steeper and more upright typing angle that minimizes wrist strain.</p>



<p>The 16GB DDR4 RAM has enough headroom to handle current computing needs: This memory capacity allows you to have several applications running smoothly, jump between applications quickly without loading times, and hold dozens of web pages without slow downs. The 1TB PCIe NVMe solid-state drive provides incredibly fast boot times, normally propelling you from power button to desktop in less than 10 seconds. File transfers occur virtually right away, and programs launch the moment their icons are clicked. Storage capacity also allows you to have your complete digital library stored right on the laptop without having to constantly manage it or rely on external storage units.</p>



<p><strong>Battery life can go as long as 8 hours</strong> due to the use of HP Fast Charge technology and it allows you to work throughout a day of meetings or travels and not have to search for outlets. HP True Vision HD camera provides clear video resolution even when you are in a low-light environment which eradicates the universal headache of having grainy, dark video calls while working in darkened rooms.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 11 Pro comes standard with the built-in Copilot AI assistant</strong>&nbsp;which can be accessed via a specialized keyboard key. This AI aide can provide answers to questions, summarize documents, create text, and automate many other tasks, all without having to leave your workstation. A full-size keyboard, complete with a numeric keypad that every person working with numbers or performing data entry will love, comes included as well.</p>
<p>With that $639 purchase price, you’re receiving a laptop that normally costs over three times as much.</p>
