Except the most important 30 milliseconds.” He goes on to say that remake developer Vicarious Visions “completely botched how jumping works.” That’s fighting words where I come from (Hillcrest, represent). But he’s got some numbers to back him up. Here’s his explanation of the difference between how jumping works in <em>Crash </em>1996 and the recent remakes:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>On the original PlayStation, we only had digital buttons–pressed or not pressed. No analog sticks. Players needed different height jumps, but we only had binary input [...] So we built something borderline insane. The game would detect when you pressed jump, start the animation, then continuously measure how long you held the button. As Crash rose through the air, we’d subtly adjust gravity, duration, and force based on your input.</p></blockquote><p>He sums this up by saying “Let go early = smaller hop. Hold it down = maximum height. [The game] intercepted your intent across those 30-60 milliseconds and translated it into analog control using digital inputs.”</p><p>This is the difference. But I’m kinda skeptical this morning, the 17th of July in the year of our lady 2025. <em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Andy Gavin for more details.</p><p>After some quick testing, I’m either missing some delicate nuance that I’d go so far as to say is negligible, or, Andy, I have to wonder if we’re playing the same remake? Check your LinkedIn messages, I’m curious about the specific differences in actual gameplay instances. </p><p>Granted, I tested things out on a PC with a Bluetooth Xbox controller using a backup of the original game’s image running in RetroArch with a Beetle PSX core. I then timed my jumps in each game to a metronome and jumped every “whole note” (I’m a musician, that’s how you’re going to get accurate timing from me). Some of you are probably freaking out: This is a horribly inaccurate way to drill down into the specifics of a 30-60 millisecond. Until I can devise a <em>Mythbusters</em>-grade testing unit complete with a robot that times a button press at an exact specified time (and then something that blows it all up), I can’t say for certain, but the jumps feel more similar than Gavin’s assertion that the remake only contains “maximum height” jumps. I mean, here’s another gif showing smaller jumps in motion on both games: </p><figure id="" data-id="df0c66046bfa99b115fab801a3476ad2" data-recommend-id="image://df0c66046bfa99b115fab801a3476ad2" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A side-by-side gif shows Crash Bandicoot jupming in the original game vs. the 2017 remake." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A side-by-side gif shows Crash Bandicoot jupming in the original game vs. the 2017 remake." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Left: Remake.

But also, as my colleague and <em>Kotaku</em> senior reporter Ethan Gach mentioned in our work Slack, <em>Mario</em> had different jump heights based on how long you held the button, so how unique is the <em>Crash </em>jump anyway? I also recently replayed these remakes. I and many other long-time <em>Crash</em> fans typically admit, this collection feels very accurate to the original 1990s-era experience.</p><p>I’ll get back to you if and when I learn more about <em>Crash</em>’s attempts to defy gravity.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/crash-bandicoot-naughty-dog-vicarious-visions-jump-1851786482]]></content:encoded>
