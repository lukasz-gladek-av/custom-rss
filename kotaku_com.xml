              <p>Earlier this year, Microsoft ramped up the price of its current-gen consoles. The 512GB Xbox Series S jumped up from $300 to $380, with all the models above it seeing similar price hikes. Well, <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">Microsoft is at it again</a> as the company decided to tack on an extra $20 to make it an even $400 as of October 3. This comes alongside the announcement that the various levels of Xbox Game Pass are getting some light rebranding along with, you guessed it, price increases. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4524/">However, looks like someone forgot to tell Amazon because right now, you can score the 512GB Xbox Series S for just $329.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4524/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>All-Digital Gaming Console</h2>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4524/">This Xbox gaming consoles comes packed with one controller and an internal storage of 512GB</a>. A full 1TB version is available but that one is not on sale at the moment. This game system is disc-free meaning all the games you play will need to be downloaded onto the consoles or onto an external SSD which can be purchased separately. Some games are avail to be streamed from the cloud with the right Game Pass subscription as well.</p>
<p>The console does not support 4K gaming, but it still produces a resolution higher than the standard HD, rendering at 1440p. Through apps and streaming subscriptions like Netflix, HBO MAc, and Disney Plus, you can enjoy TV and movies in full 4K. It’s got HDR support to really make sure those dark spots stay dark and that vibrant colors brightly pop. A game like the newly released <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> looks awesome in HDR on a proper screen as so much of that game exists in solid black areas with radiant colors sprinkled throughout.</p>



<p>You can even play&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>for free with a subscription to Xbox Game Pass. This does come with the small caveat of that price jump announced earlier this week. The top tier of this video game subscription service just went up from $20 a month to $30. A 50% price increase to the premiere game service alongside price increased for consoles across the board doesn’t exactly feel great. There are however some great titles on the Essential tier of Game Pass which is just $10 per month. On that tier you’ll find games like&nbsp;<em>Slay the Spire</em>,&nbsp;<em>Psychonauts 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tunic</em>,&nbsp;<em>Control</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</em>. You may not be getting day one first party launches there but there is a deep treasure trove of awesome titles waiting to be played.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Lenovo 15.6″ Laptop (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) Crashes to Nearly Free After 82% Cut, Early Prime Day Exclusive]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazons-giving-away-this-brand-new-loaded-2199-lenovo-laptop-for-practically-nothing-2000631661</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-lenovo-15-6%E2%80%B3-laptop-16gb-ram-512gb-ssd-crashes-to-nearly-free-after-82-cut-early-prime-day-exclusive.1317496/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When is something both overpriced and a massive bargain? When it’s a brand-new 15.6-inch FHD Lenovo laptop with an Intel N4500 processor, and Windows 11 Professional pre-installed, and it has a kinda-crazy original price tag that’s marked down in a <em>huge</em> way at Amazon. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4530/">This limited-time deal knocks 82% from the (overpriced) $2,199 original cost to a (massive bargain) $400.</a></p>
<p>Toss that original price and look at what the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 packs into a $400 package, and the quality of this Amazon deal becomes obvious very quickly. Simply, this is a stalwart everyday laptop that can handle serious work while giving you ample options to play. Lenovo’s longstanding reputation for building durable laptops enhances the broad appeal of the IdeaPad 1 for professionals, students, or just casual PC users.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4530/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Solid as a Rock</h2>
<p>From end to end, everything about the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 speaks to absolute reliability. There are faster laptops, there are laptops with more memory than the IdeaPad 1’s 16GB of RAM and more storage than the IdeaPad 1’s 512GB — although both are easily and inexpensively expanded — and there are laptops with bigger and more spectacular displays. But the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 isn’t lacking anywhere — the Intel Celeron N4500 processor can reach 2.8GHz in speed, the FHD display (1920 x 1080 resolution) has anti-glare treatment, and the Intel UHD Graphics chip pairs with the monitor to deliver a solid and reliable performance.</p>
<p>When it’s time to put the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 to the test with a video conference or video call, it comes ready with a 720p HD webcam with built-in Privacy Shutter, and two Dolby Audio speakers. The rest of your everyday productivity is made easy by the preloaded Windows 11 Professional OS, which includes Microsoft Copilot for an ultra-fast AI assist whenever you need it.</p>



<h2>Connections For All</h2>
<p>The Lenovo IdeaPad 1 has all the connections you need, and perhaps even more. Start with the Wi-Fi 6 11ax 2×2 and Bluetooth 5.2 hookups that make your browsing and streaming life a cinch, and the USB ports — a 2.0 Type-A, a 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, and a 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C for fast data transfers — HDMI 1.4b port, and card reader present all the options you need for peripherals and external monitors.</p>
<p>We’re not really sure who came up with the original $2,199 price tag on this Lenovo 15.6-inch IdeaPad 1. It’s certainly not a price we’d ever recommend for an exceptionally solid and reliable laptop from a leading manufacturer. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4530/">But for just $400 after Amazon’s jaw-dropping 82%-off limited-time discount? </a>We’re all in on that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been looking for a way to share your Formula 1 enthusiasm with your kids while keeping them entertained with quality building toys, LEGO has created exactly what you need. The <strong>LEGO F1 collectible race cars pack</strong> brings the excitement of the racing circuit straight to your living room and right now, Amazon is offering this set at a record low price during Prime Big Deal Days: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4535/">Down from $30 to just $20, this mystery box collection has climbed into the top 10 best-selling LEGO sets</a> on the site.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4535/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Twelve Teams, Virtually Limitless Possibilities</h2>
<p>The allure of this set is its mystery box structure: <strong>Six randomly picked mini F1 race cars out of a total of 12 varying models</strong> are received, which makes for a different combination with each purchase. The available roster consists of <strong>RB20, Mercedes-AMG, Ferrari, McLaren, Aston Martin, Alpine, Williams, VCARB, Sauber, Haas, a generic F1, and an F1 Academy car</strong>. Each model is incredibly small (being a few inches in length) which makes them ideal for little hands to hold on to and operate for creative race scenarios. The<strong> randomness provides for a surprise that children dearly enjoy</strong>&nbsp;and creates a fuss around the unboxing alone as children see which teams ended up in their individual collection.</p>



<p>LEGO did not skimp on details here: Each car comes decorated in <strong>genuine team colors with actual team logos emblazoned</strong> directly onto the bodywork so that young supporters will have the opportunity to recognize their favored teams at a glance. A <strong>team helmet occupying each cockpit</strong> adds another note of realism which F1-fixated youngsters will love.</p>
<p>The wheels spin smoothly, too, which makes these from passive display pieces into dynamic racing toys. Children can push them around the floor, prepare racing grids on the table top, or devise elaborate race scenarios pitting disparate teams against one another for the championship crown. At a total of 174 pieces divided between six cars, individual assemblies, which take between 10-15 minutes, remain small enough for little ones but still encounter enough challenge to be satisfying.</p>



<p>They’re compact enough that you can toss a few into a purse for restaurant waits, road trips, or flights when you’d like something to amuse kids without wasting valuable luggage space. They’re ideal birthday party favors when you’re hosting a racing-themed party, too. Instead of gaudy-cheap pieces of plastic that snap off after a few hours, guests depart with actual LEGO constructions they’ll be able to use repeatedly and treasure.</p>
<p>At $20 for a six-car pack, you’re out about $3.33 per model, which is extremely cheap considering each one is a complete buildable set complete with actual F1 branding. Because there are 12 distinct cars overall, acquiring two 6-packs provides a good likelihood of assembling a majority or all of the released models. As built, the little racers look great lining a shelf in your child’s bedroom, on a starting grid layout, or assembled into team alliances.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Last week, The Pokémon Company partnered with GameStop to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-shiny-koraidon-miraidon-gamestop-codes-scalper-2000629926"><span>give out free codes for </span><i><span>Pokémon Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet </span></i><span>players</span></a><span> that would give them free Shiny versions of Koraidon and Miraidon. The dragons are the mascots of the Switch RPGs, and these alternate-colored versions of these monsters had not been made available through legitimate means until now. Like most </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>events, the whole thing ended up being a disaster since these codes, rather than being distributed digitally, were printed on limited cards that GameStop could only give out so many of, and that scalpers could sell for profit. The event was nearly salvaged when GameStop received additional codes that it could print out and give away, but then artificial scarcity got in the way.</span></p> <p><span>GameStop announced on Sunday that it had received a second wave of codes and that these wouldn’t be limited to a set number of cards. However, they are still limited, despite being printed on receipts, as the retailer claims The Pokémon Company only supplied each store with approximately 50 codes. GameStop’s statement says, as diplomatically as it can, that the decision to send a set number was a Pokémon Company decision, rather than one made by the retailer.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Regarding Shiny Koraidon and Shiny Miraidon codes <a href="https://t.co/FXYPfwjmkX">pic.twitter.com/FXYPfwjmkX</a></p> <p>— GameStop (@gamestop) <a href="https://twitter.com/gamestop/status/1974975785548296590?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>In a </span><a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1974637403609718984"><span>reply to the </span><i><span>It’s Super Effective Podcast </span></i><span>on X</span></a><span>, GameStop confirmed much more plainly that this was “not [its] decision.” </span><a href="https://x.com/JoeMerrick/status/1974702192474071259"><span>Some are skeptical</span></a><span>, however, considering retailers in other countries that are also part of the distribution are not enforcing these limits. Whatever the case, scalpers are still taking advantage of what was supposed to be a free offer by putting their codes up on sites like </span><a href="https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=shiny+koraidon+and+miraidon&amp;_sacat=0&amp;_from=R40&amp;_trksid=p4624852.m570.l1312"><span>eBay</span></a><span>, with asking prices ranging from a couple of bucks to up to $50.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Whoever is enforcing this, the whole thing reeks of artificial scarcity, as the Shiny legendaries are a digital product, and thus shouldn’t be limited in the first place. Redeemable codes are not a physical product you can only hand out so many of, so there’s no reason to exclude anyone, especially if it’s unlikely these Pokémon will be available again anytime soon.</span></p>
