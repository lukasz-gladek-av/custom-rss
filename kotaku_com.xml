              <p>Budget soundbars that cost between $100 and $200 make bad TV speakers sound better by adding basic audio enhancements. However, they are still limited by cheap drivers, low processing power and simple audio architectures that make sound louder without actually improving quality. Premium soundbars like the <strong>Sonos Arc Ultra</strong> cost more because they use acoustic engineering that rivals dedicated home theater systems, and they have advanced driver arrays, proprietary technologies like Sound Motion that change the way speakers work, and processing that can make real spatial audio instead of just fake effects.</p>
<p>Right now,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6065/"> the Sonos Arc Ultra is on sale for $879 on Amazon on Black Friday, down from $1,099</a> and it is a record-low 20% discount that makes Sonos’s flagship soundbar available at prices close to those of mid-range options that don’t perform as well. The <strong>9.1.4 channel Dolby Atmos</strong> makes soundscapes that sound like they’re coming from above, beside and behind you. No matter what the marketing says, budget bars can’t do this.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6065/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Sound Motion Technology</h2>
<p>The proprietary Sound Motion transducers use new architecture to move air more efficiently in much smaller sizes, getting rid of the need for traditional cone-based speaker design. This new technology makes it possible to fit more powerful drivers into slim soundbar profiles without the big boxes that physics usually requires for good bass reproduction. The end result is a small unit that sits quietly under TVs and fills the room with sound, unlike bulky alternatives that need their own furniture to be placed in front of them.</p>



<p>The 9.1.4 channel setup with 14 carefully placed drivers makes real overhead sound effects that put helicopters, rain, and other sounds above the listener instead of just pretending to do so with psychoacoustic tricks. Dolby Atmos content mixed for height channels shows details and immersion that stereo soundbars can’t reproduce. This changes action scenes, nature documentaries, and atmospheric thrillers by using directional audio that matches what you see. The spatial accuracy lets you hear exactly where sounds are coming from in three-dimensional space, as opposed to the vague left-center-right positioning that flat soundbars give you.</p>
<p>AI-powered Speech Enhancement looks at conversations in real time to make voices clearer without making everything sound fake or compressed, like basic “voice mode” settings on cheap soundbars. The processing finds the frequencies of human voices and boosts them while leaving music and effects alone. This keeps the audio balanced instead of making everything sound like talk radio. This is very helpful during movies when mumbled dialogue or strong accents make sense without needing subtitles or having to change the volume all the time.</p>
<p>The Sonos app uses Trueplay room calibration to look at the acoustics of your room and find the best EQ settings for it by measuring how sound bounces off of walls, furniture, and other surfaces. Trueplay will record sound from different places while you walk around with your phone. Then, you’ll see how automatic adjustments fix problems in the room that would make static settings sound bad. To keep the sound from being too harsh, hard-surfaced rooms get treble reduction. To make up for this, carpeted rooms get boosts. This makes sure that the sound is always the best it can be, no matter what kind of interior design choices you make that affect acoustics.</p>
<p>The HDMI eARC connection lets you listen to lossless audio formats like Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD Master Audio, which streaming services compress into lossy formats. This means you can hear the full quality of Blu-ray collections or high-bitrate streaming sources. The single cable makes setup easier than optical connections with limited bandwidth, and the fact that it works with TV remotes means you don’t have to learn new controls or deal with multiple remotes, which can make setting up a budget soundbar more difficult.</p>
<p>Adding a Sonos Sub for deep bass and Era 300 rear speakers for true surround sound makes systems that are as good as home theater systems that cost $5,000 or more, but are much cheaper and easier to set up. You can start with just the Arc Ultra and then add more pieces as your budget allows, instead of having to buy the whole system all at once. Because the components connect wirelessly, you don’t have to run speaker wires across rooms, which makes installing traditional surround systems a nightmare.</p>
<p>The soundbar is more than just a TV sound enhancer because it can stream music over WiFi, Bluetooth, AirPlay 2, and Spotify Connect. The sound quality when playing music is as good as that of dedicated wireless speakers, which makes systems that combine TV sound and music into one platform. With multi-room audio, you can add Sonos speakers to different rooms in your home so that they all play the same thing or you can control each room separately.</p>
<p>The sleek design, with clean lines, high-quality materials, and little branding, fits in with entertainment centers instead of standing out with loud colors. The slim design fits under most wall-mounted TVs without blocking the screen or looking out of place. It also works well on a tabletop with built-in feet.</p>
<p>At $879, the lowest price ever for Black Friday, Sonos’s flagship soundbar with real 9.1.4 Dolby Atmos, Sound Motion technology, and AI-powered dialogue enhancement is hundreds of dollars cheaper than when it first came out, and it sounds better than any other budget option. The combination of spatial audio, room calibration, an expandable ecosystem, and music streaming at 20% off retail price makes this a great deal. This deal makes Sonos engineering available at prices that have never been seen before, so you can get home theater audio that justifies its high price through actual performance instead of just specs.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[LG 48″ OLED evo C4 Series Gets “Hidden Price” on Amazon, 45% Off Price Violates LG’s Display Rules]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/lg-48-oled-evo-c4-series-gets-hidden-price-on-amazon-45-off-price-violates-lgs-display-rules-2000648469</link>
            <guid>1367797</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LG is the leader in the OLED TV market because of decades of experience with display panels that competitors can’t match. They stay on top even though Samsung, Sony, and Chinese manufacturers are always trying to take them down. Every year, the company comes out with new generations of TVs but some models become bestsellers that last longer than the yearly refresh cycles because they offer great value by balancing performance and price.</p>
<p>Right now, a 48-inch OLED C4 TV is currently on sale <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6064/">for $876 on Amazon on Black Friday, and it is a 45% drop from its original price of $1,599</a> which makes flagship OLED technology available at mid-tier LED prices. The pricing proves so aggressive that Amazon displays it as <em>“hidden price”</em> requiring cart addition before revealing the actual cost. Amazon explains this policy through manufacturer agreements: “<em>Because our price on this item is lower than the manufacturer’s suggested retail price, the manufacturer does not allow us to show you our price until you place the item in your shopping cart.”</em></p>

<h2>OLED pixels that light themselves up to make perfect blacks</h2>
<p>The main benefit of OLED is that the self-emissive pixels can turn completely off to make true blacks: This gives <strong>OLED TVs infinite contrast that LED TVs with backlights bleeding through LCD panels can’t match</strong>. LED TVs with local dimming come close to this with backlight zones but blooming and haloing around bright objects on dark backgrounds show the compromise that OLED gets rid of completely with per-pixel control.</p>



<p>The <strong>Gen7 α9 AI processor looks at each frame of content to improve picture quality</strong> by recognizing scenes, reducing noise and upscaling lower-resolution content to near-4K quality. Firmware updates keep the processor learning and getting better which means that picture quality will always be better than what the hardware can do at the time of purchase.</p>
<p>With <strong>VRR and HDMI 2.1 on all four ports and a 120Hz refresh rate</strong>, the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X consoles can take full advantage of next-gen features and perform at their best. The near-instantaneous response time stops ghosting during fast motion, the high refresh rate lets you play competitive games at 120 frames per second, and variable refresh rate synchronization stops screen tearing that breaks immersion.</p>



<p><strong>Dolby Vision IQ automatically changes the brightness of HDR</strong> based on the amount of light in the room which is measured by built-in sensors. This keeps the picture quality at its best no matter what time of day or how bright it is. Different tone mapping is used for bright daytime viewing and dark evening viewing and makes sure that content looks the way it was meant to, not washed out by sunlight or too dim in the dark.<strong> Dolby Atmos audio processing makes three-dimensional soundscapes</strong> through the TV’s built-in speakers which act like overhead and surround channels.</p>
<p>The <strong>webOS smart platform</strong> makes it easy to navigate through thousands of streaming services such as Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, Prime Video, and more, all from one interface that doesn’t lag. Using the <em>Magic Remote</em> with pointer control is like using a mouse instead of having to deal with directional buttons that make typing hard. You can use voice commands to search for content, control your smart home, and ask questions through the built-in Google Assistant and Alexa.</p>
<p>The record-low Black Friday pricing at $876 versus $1,599 launch makes LG’s OLED technology cost approach premium LED TVs delivering fraction of the picture quality through inferior backlight-based contrast. If you want OLED picture quality without waiting years for depreciation or accepting smaller sizes, this hidden price deal makes flagship display technology accessible at unprecedented Black Friday costs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday is a great time to stock up on essentials, plus treat yourself to purchases that are a little hard to justify during the rest of the year. We’re spotting hundreds of discounts across almost every single category you could think of, including games. Titles have dropped in prices, and so have the consoles.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to surprise your little ones with something that gets them moving in your living room, we might have just found the best gaming deal of the season. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6060/">Nex Playground — a cube-like console — is currently sitting at $199 on Amazon, after a 20% discount on its close to $250 price tag</a>. You’ll also get $25 back in Amazon credit with your purchase, which brings the total down even further. Note that both discounts are only valid till supplies last, and that might not be long. To avoid any last-minute disappointments, it’s best to get your orders in fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6060/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Interactive Motion Games</h2>
<p>Nex Playground looks quite like a mini projector, but in a fun way. It connects to your TV and lets you play interactive motion games using just your body. There are no controllers needed, as the built-in wide-angle camera uses AI to scan your movements to register them in games on its own.</p>
<p>Multiplayer setup is supported. Up to four people can hop in at the same time to get some workout in. Five games are packed for free, including Fruit Ninja, Starri, Whac-a-Mole, Go Keeper, and Party Fowl; showcase your chopping skills with the fast movement of arms, or put that adrenaline to good use by nailing down as many moles as you can. For a bit more variety, you can purchase a 3-Month or 12-Month Play Pass, both of which cost $49 and $89, respectively. These get you instant access to a full catalog of games, plus enjoy new games each month. Games include Barbie, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, How to Train Your Dragon, Peppa Pig, Care Bears, Elmo, Miraculous Ladybug, Gabby’s Dollhouse, Kung Fu Panda, and more, so there’s going to be something for everyone. It encourages kids to move around, and is perfect for playdates or family game nights. Honestly, we won’t judge if you want to get a solo session in after putting the little ones to sleep. It’s also appropriate for kids of all ages, since it doesn’t support ads or in-app purchases. They can play their favorite games without needing you around!</p>



<p>Getting started couldn’t be simpler. Nex Playground connects to your TV using a single HDMI cable. Plug the power supply cord into the console and then plug the adapter into an outlet. Switch the thing on, and manage it using your TV remote; simple as that.</p>
<p>All things considered, this console offers a fun way to get your family moving together. Your living room is going to turn into a mini playground (or a battlefield) without a console or tons of other accessories. Just connect it to your TV, and get the party started. You’re getting five games included for free, but will need to purchase the Play Pass to unlock more.&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6060/">The current Black Friday deal drops the price down to $199, letting you save a nice $50 on it. Additionally, you can get $25 back in Amazon credit, which brings the price down even further.</a> Just note that the promotional credit is added automatically to your account 30 days after shipment, so you might not be able to access it right away.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="65" data-end="603">This Black Friday,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6058/"> the Microsoft Surface Pro has seen a massive 36% price drop, now available for just $900 (down from its original price of $1,400)</a>. You end up saving a whole $500. This sleek, versatile device blends the functionality of a laptop with the convenience of a tablet, making it a great choice for both professionals and creatives alike. Whether you’re looking for a portable option for work or a device just for entertainment and casual web browsing, the Surface Pro is worth considering—especially with this Black Friday discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6058/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="605" data-end="630">Stunning OLED Display</h2>
<p data-start="632" data-end="1208">The 13-inch OLED touchscreen delivers stunning visuals with deep, rich blacks and vibrant colors, making it ideal for both productivity tasks and entertainment. Doesn’t matter if you’re editing photos, streaming a new TV show, or putting together a presentation, the OLED panel ensures that every detail pops with crisp clarity. Unlike standard LCD screens, OLED technology offers better contrast and more vivid colors. The blacks look like real black, not that weird dark blue you get on LCDs.</p>
<p data-start="1210" data-end="1621">With 120Hz refresh rates, you can scroll through web pages, flip through apps, and interact with media without any lag. This makes the Surface Pro ideal for tasks that require precision, such as graphic design or video editing, as well as for casual activities like gaming or watching movies.</p>
<p data-start="1210" data-end="1621">You can connect to additional displays using either of the two (or both) USB-C ports. These can allow for up to 4K resolutions with refresh rates of up to 60Hz.</p>


<h2 data-start="1623" data-end="1650">Impressive Battery Life</h2>
<p data-start="1652" data-end="2208">The Surface Pro offers up to 14 hours of life on a single charge, depending on your specific usage patterns. This long-lasting battery is perfect for on-the-go professionals, students, or travelers who don’t want to be tied down to an outlet. It offers fast and flexible charging of 65W. You can charge the Surface Pro over either its Surface Connect port or simply using is USB-C port.</p>
<p data-start="2497" data-end="2963">Under the hood, the Surface Pro is powered by the Snapdragon X Elite 12-core processor, which offers both efficiency and power for multitasking and demanding applications. It’s good for bouncing between multiple tabs, editing videos, or working with any other kind of resource-heavy software. This chip along with the 16GB of RAM ensures that your device won’t slow down. This Surface Pro ends up clocking in even faster than the MacBook Air powered by the M3 chip. The device is also equipped with up 256GB of solid-state storage, giving you a decent amount of space to store files.</p>
<p data-start="2497" data-end="2963">As most new products in the last couple years, Microsoft is toting how this combination laptop and tablet is built for the AI era. It comes equipped with Copilot_ which can be used to help with searching through documents, drafting emails, creating images and more. That’s all optional, of course.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Kindle Paperwhite Drops to Record Low, E-Reader Now Cheaper Than Buying a Few Physical Books]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/kindle-paperwhite-drops-to-record-low-e-reader-now-cheaper-than-buying-a-few-physical-books-2000648434</link>
            <guid>1367629</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Kindle e-readers have evolved into reading experiences that rival physical books through <strong>e-ink displays mimicking printed paper and provides instant access to over 15 million titles that would fill entire libraries</strong>. The convenience proves transformative through lightweight portability replacing heavy books in bags, immediate downloads eliminating bookstore trips, and adjustable lighting enabling reading anywhere regardless of ambient conditions.</p>
<p>The newest <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6054/">Kindle Paperwhite with 16GB storage (and ads) costs $124 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $159</a>, and hits a record-low price where Amazon removes profit margins completely on their own hardware. The ad-supported version saves money through occasional lock-screen advertisements, though <strong>spending an extra $20 for the ad-free model proves worthwhile</strong> if promotional content bothers you.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6054/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The fastest page turns that are like real books</h2>
<p>The next-generation processor makes <strong>page turns 25% faster than older Paperwhite models</strong>: This gets rid of the short lag that made earlier e-readers feel slow compared to flipping through real pages. The speed boost is especially noticeable in scenes with a lot of dialogue or action, where quick page turning keeps the story moving instead of making fake pauses that break the immersion.</p>



<p>The <strong>7-inch glare-free screen gives you a lot of reading space</strong> in a small package: It can fit more text on the screen while still being portable which is something that bigger tablets give up. The anti-glare coating makes it possible to read in direct sunlight where phone and tablet screens wash out completely which means that you can read at the beach, in an outdoor cafe, or at a sunny window seat without having to squint or move around like you would with reflective screens.</p>
<p>The <strong>adjustable color temperature changes from bright white light for reading during the day to warm amber tones for reading at night</strong>: This lowers blue light exposure, which can affect sleep quality. The warm light lets you read before bed without the blue light that phone and tablet screens give off, which keeps your natural sleep patterns going instead of messing them up.</p>



<p>The<strong> IPX8 waterproof rating</strong> means that the device can be submerged in water for up to two meters for 60 minutes. This means you can read by the pool, relax in the bathtub, or spend time at the beach without worrying about your electronics getting wet. The device won’t break if it falls into a pool, gets splashed by waves, or gets rained on, so you don’t have to be as careful with it when it’s wet, like you do with most expensive electronics.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery lasts for 12 weeks on a single charge</strong> so you don’t have to charge your phone or tablet every night, which can make them feel like they need constant care. Read every day for months without needing to charge, take vacations without bringing chargers, or keep reading without worrying about the battery running out like you do with devices that need daily power. The USB-C charging makes it easier to charge when needed because it doesn’t need special cables like older Kindles did.</p>
<p>The<strong> 16GB of storage can hold thousands of books</strong> which is much more than what most readers read before they upgrade their devices. The storage is especially useful when traveling internationally, when buying books can be difficult.</p>
<p>If you’ve thought about getting an e-reader but were put off by the usual prices, this is the perfect time to make the switch from physical books.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Lenovo Idea Tab Hits an All-Time Low, Now the Cheapest Android Tablet With Pencil and Case Included]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/get-a-headstart-on-your-2025-holiday-tech-shopping-with-the-ai-powered-lenovo-idea-tab-2000636961</link>
            <guid>1367626</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The digital device in pretty much every student’s backpack doesn’t absolutely have to be an expensive laptop computer. The apps and tech that make digital note-taking, research, and AI-assisted writing and coursework has filtered down not just to high-end tablets, but also some of the more affordable models as well. That’s where the Lenovo Idea Tab sits — an 11-inch Android tablet armed with everything a student needs, including Lenovo AI Notes, but without the hefty price tag that comes with a laptop. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/">It’s on Black Friday sale right now at Amazon for just $180 (-25%).</a></p>
<p>Odds are the Lenovo Idea Tab is going to outperform most if not all other $180 tablets for academic and productivity purposes. It comes with the Lenovo Tab Pen and a folio case, both of which are almost always added expenses with tablets. Google’s Circle to Search feature is built in as well, along with Lenovo’s AI Notes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Clear Picture</h2>
<p>The Lenovo Idea Tab comes with four apps that are tailor-made for academic performance: Squid, the powerful paper-replacing Android app for handwritten notes, PDF markups, and other tasks; MyScript Notes (formerly Nebo), a great freehand-sketching app; MyScript Calculator, which can solve your handwritten numerical equations; and Lenovo AI Note, which transforms your handwritten notes into AI-generated quizzes, and can also use AI to expand on your notes with greater insight.</p>
<p>Whether you’re working or playing, the 11-inch 2.5K screen on the Lenovo Idea Pad isn’t going to let you down. The MediaTek Dimensity 6300 octa-core processor ensures that the images on that screen come through smoothly, and the seemingly inexhaustible battery is good for up to 12 hours of video playback.</p>



<h2>All the Tablet, Without the Price</h2>
<p>Everything else you would ask of the tablets in the higher price brackets — fast internet, smooth streaming, quality built-in camera and Dolby Atmos quad speakers for video calls, and total portability (just 6.5 x 10 x 0.28 inches in size and 1.05 pounds in weight) — are here with the Lenovo Idea Pad, and don’t forget the included-in-price Lenovo Tab Pen and folio case.</p>
<p>The Lenovo Idea Pad might be considered to be an “entry-level” tablet by some, and to be fair, we wouldn’t throw it in the ring against the latest iPad Pro or Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra. But you’re certainly not getting anywhere near either of those heavyweights for $210, and the differences between them and the Lenovo Idea Pad probably don’t quantify the $1,000-plus price difference. Long story short, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/">you’re getting far more tablet than you would expect for $180 from the Lenovo Idea Pad, so this Amazon Black Friday deal is a solid thumbs-up.</a></p>
