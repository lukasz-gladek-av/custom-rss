              <p><span>Game engine maker Unity is, like most other tech companies, fully embracing generative AI technology in its products (making the already bloated engine even more slow and annoying to use). Still clinging to the AI hype — even after it </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/video-game-stocks-down-take-two-gta-nintendo-roblox-unity-google-ai-game-maker-2000664594"><span>made their own stock plummet</span></a><span> — Unity is promising to unveil a new version of its AI tool that will supposedly eliminate the need for coding entirely.</span></p> <p><span>As </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/programming/unity-says-its-ai-tech-will-soon-be-able-to-prompt-full-casual-games-into-existence-?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=bluesky"><span>reported</span></a><span> by GameDeveloper, the new Unity AI beta is planned to launch at the GDC Festival of Gaming in March. In </span><a href="https://investors.unity.com/financials/quarterly-results/default.aspx"><span>a recent earnings call</span></a><span>, Unity CEO Matthew Bromsberg stated, “AI-driven authoring is our second major area of focus for 2026. At the Game Developer Conference in March, we’ll be unveiling a beta of the new upgraded Unity AI, which will enable developers to prompt full casual games into existence with natural language only, native to our platform — so it’s simple to move from prototype to finished product.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“This assistant will be powered by our unique understanding of the project context and our runtime, while leveraging the best frontier models that exist. We believe together this combination will provide more efficient, more effective results to game developers than general-purpose models alone.”</span></p> <p><span>Half of game developers attending GDC this year think generative AI is </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/one-third-of-game-workers-use-generative-ai-but-half-think-it-s-bad-for-the-industry"><span>bad for the games industry</span></a><span>. Some game developers also report that using generative AI </span><a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-video-game-development-art-vibe-coding-midjourney/"><span>actually makes their jobs harder</span></a><span>. Developers are already struggling to get attention for their games in a market where <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/a-terrifying-20-282-games-were-released-on-steam-in-2025-and-just-608-managed-to-get-1-000-reviews-expert-finds-we-might-be-in-a-bit-of-an-indie-golden-age/">20,000 new releases</a> came to Steam last year. AI threatens to flood digital storefronts with even more noise.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Our goal is to remove as much friction from the creative process as possible, becoming the universal bridge between the first spark of creativity and a successful, scalable, and enduring digital experience,” Bromsberg said.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The distaste for generative AI extends to players as well. In a </span><a href="https://quanticfoundry.com/2025/12/18/gen-ai/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email"><span>survey</span></a><span> taken by nearly 2 million players, over 85% have a negative attitude toward generative AI in video games.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>During the Q&amp;A segment of the earnings call, Bromsberg said there will eventually be “tens of millions of more people creating interactive entertainment” using AI tools, and that Unity plans to spearhead that hypothetical movement.</span></p> <p><span>Basically, the AI revolution is coming any day now.
