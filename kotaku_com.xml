              <p>We’re closing in on Prime Big Deals Day. This is Amazon’s sales even taking place next week on October 7 and October 8. You can expect to see all sorts of deals covering a range of consumer tech, kitchen appliances, apparel, and more. Even though it’s not quite here yet, some deals have already started pouring in. Take a look over the the Fire HD 10. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4448/">This Amazon tablet built for relaxation and fun normally is currently as much as 56% off.</a></p>
<p>There are four different versions of Amazon’s latest tablet. You can choose between having 32GB or 64GB of capacity as well as whether you want to put up with lock screen ads or not. If you don’t mind being bombarded with Alan Ritchson’s beefy shoulders and chiseled face promoting&nbsp;<em>Reacher&nbsp;</em>every time you reach for your tablet, you can get the Fire HD 10 for as low as $70. The 32GB is down to that from $140 while the 64GB is down to just $80 (originally $180). If&nbsp; you’d prefer not to have to look at ads on a device you own whenever you use it, you’re looking at a price point of $85 for the 32GB model and $95 for the 64GB model. If you end up going with the ad-enabled version but change your mind later, no worries. You can pay a one-time fee of $15 to have them removed after the fact.</p>

<p>As you can surmise from the name, this Fire HD 10 comes with a 10-inch HD 1080p screen (well, 10.1 inches to be precise). It makes for a terrific gift for the holidays for any friend, family member, or loved one.</p>
<h2>Bring Your Movies and Shows Anywhere</h2>
<p>This tablet supports a battery life of up to 13 hours. You’ll be able to binge an entire season or more of a TV show in one charge (at least a modern TV show from after we stopped making 24-episode long seasons).</p>



<p>The Fire HD 10 is both light and durable, allowing you to take it with you anywhere easily. This tablet makes for a great travel companion as you’re able to download your favorite stuff to take along with you so you can watch movies or shows without having to pay for the in-flight Wi-Fi.</p>
<p>It’s equipped with a front-facing 5MP camera so you can keep in touch with family and friends using Zoom or any of the other video conferencing apps.</p>
<p>Choose between three different colors. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4448/">The Fire HD 10 is available in your choice of black, lilac, or ocean.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Federal investigators and researchers at the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) are brushing up on gaming. A reportedly leaked briefing document shows the agency born out of 9/11 to combat global terrorism is taking a closer look at what&nbsp; “violent extremist US teens” are doing in online gaming platforms ranging from <em>Fortnite</em> to Battle.net.</p> <p>Published by <a href="https://danboguslaw.substack.com/p/leaked-intel-brief-shows-feds-terrified">independent journalist Dan Boguslaw</a>, the alleged NCTC document lists a bunch of different places people play games and each one’s functionality. The full list includes Battle.net, Discord, <em>Fortnite</em>, PlayStation Network,<em> Roblox, </em>Steam, Twitch, and Xbox Live. Discord, which the gunman who allegedly <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-steam-library-valve-discord-radicalization-2000626897">assassinated Charlie Kirk</a> used to discuss the murder, is the only platform that’s listed as checking every functionality box: “text chat,” “voice chat,” “video chat,” “image sharing,” “friend lists,” and “discoverable communities.”</p>

 <p>“Some violent extremist US teens probably play online games or use gaming-affiliated networks and applications (apps), and could use these apps to communicate with like-minded individuals, conduct plotting, or spread terrorist messaging, judging from a past report of extremist use of online gaming to enable terrorist activity,” the leaked memo reads.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Seems pretty clear the government is coming for Discord users <a href="https://t.co/SFc4yApeAU">pic.twitter.com/SFc4yApeAU</a></p> <p>— Ken Klippenstein (NSPM-7 Compliant) (@kenklippenstein) <a href="https://twitter.com/kenklippenstein/status/1973463700918116392?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>You’ll note that the document isn’t concerned only with the plotting of potential terrorist activities but also “terrorist messaging,” whatever that is. Following the assassination of Charlie Kirk, gaming-affiliated platforms like Discord, Twitch, and Steam have been called <a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-discord-politics-helldivers-memes-2000626029">to testify before Congress</a>. President Trump <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/09/designating-antifa-as-a-domestic-terrorist-organization/">recently proclaimed</a> Antifa a terrorist organization and the Heritage Foundation right-wing think tank <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/heritage-foundation-uses-bogus-stat-to-push-a-trans-terrorism-classification/">called on the FBI</a> to officially label “Transgender Ideology-Inspired Violent Extremism,” or “TIVE,” as a domestic terrorism threat category.</p>

 <p>The reported NCTC memo is quick to point out in a footnote that “the mere presence of an individual on one or more online gaming platforms is not indicative of any nefarious activity,” and that “law enforcement action should not be taken solely on the basis of the exercise of constitutionally protected rights.” But it does say that communication on these platforms could be grounds for further investigation if authorities “observe suspicious behavior.”</p> <p>There are a few notable absences on the sheet. YouTube is not mentioned at all, despite a wealth of gaming content and an algorithmic engine for pointing users toward it like a fire hose. Nintendo Switch Online is also missing despite the fact that the Switch 2 just rolled out video sharing and GameChat. I guess the country’s terrorism experts don’t think anyone is plotting political violence inside <em>Mario Kart World</em>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-24-odyssey-g3-gaming-monitor-goes-for-peanuts-at-nearly-50-off-even-cheaper-than-last-prime-day-2000631001</link>

              <p>Technically, you can use your standard office monitor for gaming, but is it the same as a dedicated screen that’s built to chase enemies with exceptional refresh rates and near-instant response time? Not really.</p>
<p>You need gear that keeps up, and right now, you can upgrade without paying the full price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4447/">Amazon has dropped the Samsung 24-Inch Odyssey G3 (G30D) to just $110, which is a massive 45% off.</a> You’re saving $90 on a display that’s going to make you feel like you’re in the middle of the action, but the discount ends soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4447/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Mind-Boggling Refresh Rate, Stunning Screen</h2>
<p>Lags and blurs are frustrating. You can’t just sit and wait for your screen to catch up while your opponent gets away. Odyssey G3 packs an impressive 180Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time for ultra-fast visuals that give an in-game advantage. Jumping on an enemy squad the moment you spot them, or slipping away from a close fight, becomes much easier.</p>
<p>Bid farewell to image tearing and mid-action interruptions, too, because AMD Radeon FreeSync makes sure your monitor and graphics card stay in sync – always in real time. There’s Black Equalizer to brighten dark areas in the game, and Virtual Aim Point to line up shots more precisely. Basically, whether you’re checking dark corners for bad guys or going for the clutch shot, this monitor keeps up. Even better, blue light is actively minimized to keep your eyes comfortable, and reduced screen flicker makes it easier to fight the demons for longer.</p>



<p>As for the screen itself, you’re getting a decent 24-inch FHD display that pushes stunning, vibrant visuals. The 3-sided borderless design offers maximum space to play, and will also come in handy when you run a dual-monitor setup. The monitor’s height can be fully adjusted, and you can tilt, swivel, or pivot it to match your ideal setup. Port-wise, you’ll find a Power port, Headphone IN, HDMI IN, and a DisplayPort IN around the back.</p>
<p>If you’ve been playing on your standard monitor or laptop and want to upgrade to something more powerful, the Samsung 24-Inch Odyssey G3 (G30D) is an excellent option to consider. It gets you an exceptional display with an even better refresh rate and response time, which are sure to take your gaming experience up a notch. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4447/">The monitor usually retails for $200, but this deal brings it down to $110, which is a much more affordable price point.</a></p>
