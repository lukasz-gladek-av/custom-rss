After reporting broke earlier this year that Beahm had been banned from Twitch back in 2020 for messages exchanged with a minor on the platform, the Trending Gamer of the Year winner at The Game Awards 2017 admitted to “inappropriate” contact but maintained that nothing illegal ever happened. He lost his advisory role at the game studio he co-founded, was cut loose from various sponsorships, and was eventually demonetized on YouTube.

The result was months of calls, blind audio tests, and even comparisons of the audition recordings to the sound waves of Harrison Ford’s original performances from the movies.</p><p>“I did <em>not</em> want you for this,” he reportedly told Baker during his final audition, “but you won every time.
