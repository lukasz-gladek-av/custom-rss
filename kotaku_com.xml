According to an update from Nintendo, most big games and all first-party titles (with one tiny exception) will work on Switch 2, though you might need an update or an old Joy-Con. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-backwards-compatibility-list-start-up-issues-1851774297&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-backwards-compatibility-list-start-up-issues-1851774297">Back in April</a></span>, Nintendo revealed that over 120 Switch games would have compatibility issues on the upcoming Switch 2 console. At the time, it wasn’t clear what Nintendo meant when it listed some games as having start-up issues and other titles as having in-game compatibility problems. It seemed like Nintendo was saying that a small portion of the console’s massive library wouldn’t work very well, or at all, on the new machine. Now, we have some more clarity, and some good news for people wanting to play<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doom-eternal-the-kotaku-review-1842471145&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doom-eternal-the-kotaku-review-1842471145"><em>Doom Eternal</em></a></span> on their Switch 2 next month. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On May 27, Nintendo posted new Switch 2 backward compatibility lists</a></span> alongside some more in-depth information about what will and won’t work on the new console. The good news: Only one first-party Nintendo game, <em>Nintendo Labo Toy-Con 04: VR Kit, </em>is completely unplayable on Switch 2. The console maker says this comes down to the fact that Switch 2 is too big and can’t be “inserted into the Toy-Con VR Goggles.”</p><p>All other first-party Switch games, including the other Labo titles, will work on Switch 2. However, some titles, like <em>1-2 Switch</em> and <em>Ring Fit Adventure,</em> will only work on Switch 2 if you connect an OG Switch Joy-Con to the new console.  It should also be noted that<em> Fitness Boxing,</em> also published by Nintendo, will need an update to work on Switch 2.</p><p>As for third-party titles, Nintendo has tested more titles and worked with publishers to create new lists. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-compatibility_issues_EN_05272025.pdf?_gl=1*wsyydv*_gcl_au*MTgyMDM4MDcxMy4xNzQ3MzM5Mjcz*_ga*OTY3MzU2MjczLjE3MjI0NDc4Mzg.*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*czE3NDgzNzMwNDEkbzQ5JGcxJHQxNzQ4MzczMDc5JGowJGwwJGg4Njg0MTY5ODc.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://media.nintendo.com/switch-2/pdf-compatibility_issues_EN_05272025.pdf?_gl=1*wsyydv*_gcl_au*MTgyMDM4MDcxMy4xNzQ3MzM5Mjcz*_ga*OTY3MzU2MjczLjE3MjI0NDc4Mzg.*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*czE3NDgzNzMwNDEkbzQ5JGcxJHQxNzQ4MzczMDc5JGowJGwwJGg4Njg0MTY5ODc." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">118 games are still listed as having</a></span> “start-up issues” on Switch 2. Meanwhile, 50 games  “start up on Nintendo Switch 2 but include some in-game compatibility issues,” and 54 games have in-game problems, but a patch is planned to fix these issues at launch or soon after. In April, the list of games with “start-up issues” was 130. Looking at the lists, over 20 of these games are now set to be updated and should work better on Switch 2, including <em>Doom Eternal </em>and <em>Pizza Tower. </em></p><p>Interestingly, some software like Hulu and Crunchyroll won’t be compatible on Switch 2 at all. It remains to be seen if that’s because there are new versions of those apps coming to Switch 2 in the future or because the companies behind those streaming apps just don’t see a point in supporting the new hardware. </p><p>Regardless, it’s great to see nearly the entire Switch library will be playable on Switch 2, even if I’ll have to dig out an old Joy-Con to play games like <em>Nintendo Switch Sports. </em></p><p><em> .</em><br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It shows an apparent Switch 2 box sitting on a table next to the existing Switch.

More videos might follow, though Nintendo will surely be looking for any reason it can find to keep a lid on the new hardware until it’s officially out later next week. </p><p>A big software update for the Switch 2 was previously reported by<em> The Game Business</em>’ Chris Dring,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-review-day-one-patch-delay-nintendo-mario-kart-1851780793&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-review-day-one-patch-delay-nintendo-mario-kart-1851780793"> who listed it as one of the potential reasons</a></span> why media and content creators won’t be getting much early access to the hardware to test it for pre-release reviews. Unlike with previous hardware launches, Nintendo reportedly won’t be making the Switch 2 available to many in the press until a day before launch at the earliest. </p><p>“Another person shared with me that they have a Nintendo Switch 2 as well,” gaming news and deals insider Wario64 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1927439153144160682?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1927441748923457581%7Ctwgr%5E4022a80cd63719586d7afa409296771744b241d3%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkinja.com%2Fembed%2Finset%2Fiframe%3Fautosize%3D1id%3Dtwitter-1927441748923457581&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1927439153144160682?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1927441748923457581%7Ctwgr%5E4022a80cd63719586d7afa409296771744b241d3%7Ctwcon%5Es2_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkinja.com%2Fembed%2Finset%2Fiframe%3Fautosize%3D1id%3Dtwitter-1927441748923457581" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on X</a></span>. “I have no permission to post pics but can share that when they try to boot a Switch 1 game, a message prompts ‘Please connect to the internet and update your system.’  Needs update to boot a game.”</p><p>It’s possible the Switch 2 consoles currently sitting in storage rooms (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/target-switch-2-consoles-cage-early-store-floor-walmart-1851782518&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/target-switch-2-consoles-cage-early-store-floor-walmart-1851782518">or the middle of the aisle at Target</a></span>) could require an internet connection and download before they can start playing any games. That would be bad news for fans already frustrated that Nintendo is leaning into Game Key Cards and other initiatives this console generation that place less emphasis on physical media and products that work directly out of the box without the need to connect to the<em> Mario</em> maker’s servers. </p><p>But it’s also possible the nature of the required update might only lock the console from being used prior to a set date and time, but let it work normally after that period even without the day-one patch.

You’ll constantly outdo yourself as you level.</p><p>The Barbarian’s heavy reliance on gear is its one downside. At first, without a sufficient kit, you’ll feel weak. Plus, the early-game dragsto the point where you might want to surrender and play another class, like the Spiritborn or Necromancer.

It’s a great way to get quick healing without having to chug some potions in the middle of a hunt.</p><p>As a restorative mantle, Mending will work for whatever setup you have.

It applies an armor effect that negates damage reactions, reduces how much damage you take, and boosts resistances against roars, tremors, and wind pressure. Taking damage will decrease the amount of time you have left.</p><p><strong>Rocksteady is the mantle to choose if you want to feel like a tank</strong>.

Depending on what weapon you’re using, you might receive unique follow-up attacks as well.</p><p>Try to get those last moment dodges in as much as possible to keep refreshing the attack boost. Weapons that have special dodge mechanics, such as the Bow or Dual Blades, are a perfect fit. You’ll likely trigger the Evasion Mantle’s effects more often with these.

A PS6 is already rumored to be in the works for as early as late 2027. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Despite this, almost all of them have been box-office hits, so there’s no real incentive on Disney’s part to rethink its strategy of dropping artistically bankrupt live-action slop every year or so.

The major changes the live-action movie makes to both stories have not sat well with many fans of the original. The easier issues to unpack concern the changes to Stitch’s side of the movie. The not-dog alien is a genetic experiment created by Jumba (Zach Galifianakis), a mad alien scientist who has created hundreds of these little freaks. Once Stitch escapes to Earth and lands in Hawaii, Jumba is sent to our planet to retrieve him. In the original film, Jumba ends up siding with his creation and becoming part of his extended family alongside Lilo, her sister Nani, and others. He becomes the family’s eccentric uncle and is shown to be a caring guy, even though he created some horrific genetic monsters.</p><p>The movie, meanwhile, turns him into the villain of the whole thing. In the animated original, the major antagonist is another alien called Captain Gantu, whom the rest of the squabbling cast band together to fight. Director Dean Fleischer Camp defended the change to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cinemablend.com/interviews/lilo-and-stitch-director-explains-why-gantu-isnt-in-new-movie&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cinemablend.com/interviews/lilo-and-stitch-director-explains-why-gantu-isnt-in-new-movie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Cinema Blend</em></a></span>, saying that the buff shark-like alien “didn’t work” in live-action.</p><p>“We explored it a bit, but ultimately we had to make the decision,” Fleischer Camp said. “And also I do stand by the decision ‘cause I feel like a lot of the things that in trying to ground these characters more and tell a story with a little more emotional depth, especially between the sisters, I feel like you have to free up real estate to allow that breathing room to do those things.”</p><p>With Gantu off the table, the live-action remake instead makes a sudden left turn in the final act, turning Jumba into the antagonist. He captures Stitch and plans to erase the critter’s newfound love for his Hawaiian family and turn him into an unfeeling living weapon. It’s a far cry from who the character was 23 years ago, and it robs him of his arc of discarding his selfish scientific ambitions in favor of treating his creations like his children, much to the chagrin of some long-time fans.</p><p>In an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ew.com/why-captain-gantu-isnt-in-live-action-lilo-and-stitch-11741269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ew.com/why-captain-gantu-isnt-in-live-action-lilo-and-stitch-11741269" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Entertainment Weekly</em></a></span>, Fleischer Camp said that Jumba made more sense to him as the villain than Gantu, who was mostly disconnected from the plot beyond chasing after Stitch.</p><p>“You want your main antagonist to also be the representative of the theme of the film,” he said. “It seemed like an opportunity to do that as opposed to just there’s a big bad boss that comes down and is shooting lasers at everyone.”</p><p>The changes to Jumba are sad, especially if you’re a fan of the extended franchise, like the sequel movies and the television series in which Jumba’s role in the family makes him a major pillar of the cast. The alterations Disney made to Lilo and Nani’s story, however, are much more damning, and when viewed in a certain light, can be read as sinister. After the death of their parents, Nani is Lilo’s primary caretaker, and much of the elder sister’s story revolves around her trying to maintain custody as social workers threaten to place the younger sister in the foster care system. Nani’s unflinching desire to stay with her sister is rooted in the Hawaiian concept of “ohana,” which refers to family, and underlines that no one gets left behind. The original film illustrates how Nani was able to finally make it work when she had true support from the girls’ found family in Jumba, Pleakley, and others. Against all odds, the sisters can stay together, and Lilo gets to live a normal life surrounded by people who love her.</p><p>The live-action movie, however, significantly alters Nani’s arc, and it has fans up in arms. In this version of the story, Nani gave up her dreams of becoming a marine biologist to take care of Lilo, and as she tries to provide for her sister, the social worker on her family’s case gives her a series of goals to help her maintain custody of her sister, including paying off several unpaid bills and getting health insurance set up for the two. When Stitch, with all his destructive tendencies, lands on Earth and throws their lives into chaos, Nani loses her job, and Lilo is put in the hospital without insurance. The only way Nani can pay for her medical care is to give her up to the state.</p><p>The movie ends with Nani giving up Lilo to her neighbor, an extended member of her found family, allowing her to pay off the medical debt and also live out her dream of becoming a marine biologist. <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch </em>frames this as an empowering moment for Nani, as she’s able to leave Lilo with her ohana, go to school on the mainland, and visit whenever she wants, thanks to some cool <em>Portal</em>-ass guns the family has. However, given the real-world experiences of Native Hawaiians, fans aren’t buying it.</p><p>The original <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch </em>framed the state’s interference in their family dynamic as a disruptive, malicious force. This plays into a larger commentary on the way that mainland American culture and tourists encroach upon the island state. This thread runs through the entire film, like when you see Lilo taking pictures of white tourists to give them a taste of their own medicine. The live-action movie is notably lacking in these elements, and now that it presents giving Lilo to the foster system as a good thing, many feel it’s undermining the original themes and feels disrespectful to the animated movie’s commentary on the Native Hawaiian experience and cultural values. Some are even going as far as to call it colonialist propaganda.</p><p><em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> has made a lot of money already, already surpassing the original’s $273 million box-office total in just one weekend. So even with all these criticisms, Disney got what it wanted. As long as people go see these live-action remakes, Disney will keep pumping them out, even if they trample on the themes of the originals. Some of these remakes make changes to modernize the stories, but the distinctly Native Hawaiian issues <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch </em>explored in 2002 are still very much problems the island’s people face to this day. Now, Nani’s story doesn’t feel empowering; it feels out-of-touch, as if the film is just using Hawaiian aesthetics instead of telling a truly Hawaiian tale. <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch </em>has a few references to the sequels and television series, so it’s entirely possible Disney double dips and makes a sequel. If so, we’ll see if the company takes any of this criticism seriously.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
