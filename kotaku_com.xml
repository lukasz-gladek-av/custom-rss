              <p>Amazon blew away Black Friday price expectations by lowering the price of the <strong>Fitbit Charge 6 to an all-time low</strong>, and this made high-end fitness tracking suddenly affordable for everyone. The big store decided to match that big discount for Cyber Monday and shows that it really wants to take over the fitness tracker market this holiday season.</p>
<p>The Charge 6 is a slim wristband that doesn’t look like a fitness tracker like bigger smartwatches and it has accurate heart rate monitoring, built-in GPS, Google app integration, and full health tracking. Right now, Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5344/"> has this fitness powerhouse on sale for $99, down from its usual price of $159</a> (which is a new record low).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5344/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Heart Rate Monitoring</h2>
<p>The Charge 6 has the <strong>best heart rate monitoring of any Fitbit ever made</strong>, and it has better optical sensors and smarter algorithms that get rid of motion artifacts. That level of accuracy is important because the tracker can now send your heart rate directly to gym equipment that works with it via Bluetooth. This means you don’t have to wear chest straps like many cardio machines do for heart rate training programs. The <strong>built-in GPS keeps track of your outdoor runs, walks, and bike rides</strong> with the same level of accuracy as dedicated running watches.</p>
<p>The <strong>Fitbit Charge 6’s touchscreen</strong> interface lets you control YouTube Music, navigate Google Maps and make payments with Google Wallet right from your wrist. That ecosystem connection makes the tracker a useful everyday device instead of just a workout buddy. You can switch songs while you run, get turn-by-turn directions to new places, or pay for coffee without taking out your wallet.</p>



<p>Comprehensive health tracking goes beyond just counting steps as it also keeps an eye on heart rate variability, blood oxygen levels while you sleep, changes in skin temperature, and stress management through guided breathing exercises. <em>Zone of Activity Minutes</em> count how long you spend in high heart rate zones during workouts, so you get credit for intensity as well as duration.</p>
<p>With normal use, <strong>like 24/7 heart rate monitoring, daily GPS workouts, and notification sync</strong>, the battery lasts about seven days. This means you don’t have to charge it every night like most smartwatches do. You can track your sleep every night without worrying about the battery dying because it lasts for a week. You only need to remember to charge it once a week. The slim design fits comfortably under shirt cuffs and doesn’t get caught on clothes or make pressure points when worn all day.</p>



<p>Smart notifications keep you connected by <strong>showing calls, texts, and app alerts on the color touchscreen</strong> of the tracker. However, the only way to respond on Android devices is with quick replies. In addition to fitness features, calendar alerts, weather updates, and timer functions make the device useful every day. The Fitbit app lets you sync the <strong>device wirelessly with both iOS and Android phones</strong> and it also has detailed analytics, trend tracking, and social features that let you compete with friends through challenges.</p>
<p>When you think about how much similar fitness trackers cost (between $150 and $200 without Google integration or heart rate broadcasting from gym equipment) getting the Fitbit Charge 6 for $99 is a great deal. For less than $100, you can get a tracker that will help you train smarter, learn more about your body, and stay in touch all day long.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-airpods-pro-3-for-cyber-monday-liquidates-black-friday-leftovers-at-record-low-price-2000648949</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple just came out with the AirPods Pro 3 a few months ago, and as usual, the company won’t directly discount its newest high-end earbuds. Amazon really stepped up on Black Friday with a big price drop on these great wireless earbuds and the good news is that the store decided to keep the discount going and even make it bigger for Cyber Monday. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">Amazon has them marked down to $219 right now, reduced from Apple’s standard $249 price</a>, creating the best deal we’ve seen on these earbuds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Double Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>The <strong>AirPods Pro 3 block out twice as much unwanted noise as the already great AirPods Pro 2</strong>, and they create isolation that is as good as that of over-ear headphones, but in a small in-ear package. That better noise cancellation works by using microphones that pick up sounds from the outside world and computer-generated audio that creates exact anti-noise in real time.</p>
<p>When<strong> you turn on transparency mode</strong>, the earbuds let outside sounds in so you can hear conversations and environmental cues without taking them off. Apple improved this mode by adding active hearing protection that automatically lowers loud sounds from the environment like construction noise or subway screeches, while still letting normal sounds through.</p>



<p>The new acoustic architecture changes the sound quality by <strong>giving the bass more depth, making the voices sound</strong> incredibly clear across the frequency range, and making the vocals sound incredibly present. <strong>Dynamic head tracking and spatial audio</strong> make three-dimensional soundscapes that put sound sources around you in space. This makes movies and supported music feel more immersive than traditional stereo can.</p>
<p>Heart rate sensing is a real game-changer for earbuds because they have built-in sensors that track your pulse while you work out without needing chest straps or wrist-based monitors. The earbuds keep track of heart rate and calories burned <strong>during more than 50 different types of workouts</strong>, and they then automatically sync this data to Apple Health for full fitness tracking. When you connect your iPhone, you can use the activity rings, step counting, and the new Workout Buddy feature powered by Apple Intelligence that gives you personalized training suggestions.</p>



<p><strong>Apple Intelligence’s live translation</strong> feature makes it possible to talk to people who speak different languages by providing real-time translation. The feature works by processing speech on your iPhone and translating between supported languages, and the translation plays through your earbuds while the other person hears their native language through your phone’s speaker. This conversational translation works well enough for travel, business meetings, or casual conversations where language differences would normally make it hard to communicate.</p>
<p>When you turn on active noise cancellation, the battery lasts for eight hours. When you use transparency mode with the hearing aid feature on, the battery lasts for up to ten hours. That runtime lasts through full workdays, long flights, or long listening sessions without needing to charge the case. The USB-C charging case lets you charge your device multiple times, <strong>and gives you more than 30 hours of total listening time</strong> before you need to plug it in. <strong>Five different ear tip sizes</strong> make sure that everyone can find a secure, comfortable fit that creates the right acoustic seal for the best noise cancellation and bass response.</p>
<p>When you think about how these just came out a few months ago and Apple never directly discounts new products, getting the AirPods Pro 3 for $219 is a good deal. These earbuds are on sale for Cyber Monday for $30 less than their regular price, and they have features that other products won’t have for years.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Roborock Q7 Max+ With 9 Weeks Self-Empty Crashes to Record Low, Cyber Monday Goes Zero Profit for Final Clearance]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-q7-max-with-9-weeks-self-empty-crashes-to-record-low-cyber-monday-goes-zero-profit-for-final-clearance-2000648933</link>

              <p>Roborock makes a lot more than just the high-end flagship $1000+ models that get a lot of attention in tech reviews and forums for fans. The brand makes cheaper models that still have important features like self-emptying docks and these are some of the best value options on the robot vacuum market.</p>
<p>For instance, the Q7 M5+ has 10,000Pa of suction, two brushes that don’t tangle, LiDAR navigation and a base that empties itself and holds up to seven weeks of debris – and it costs a lot less than some flagship models. The good news is that Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/">has just cut the price of this combo to $219 for Cyber Monday, down from its usual price of $359</a> and this is the lowest price ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easy to empty yourself without the high price tag</h2>
<p>The<strong> RockDock Plus base station automatically empties the robot’s dustbin</strong> into a sealed bag <strong>that holds about seven to nine weeks’ worth of dirt, pet hair</strong>&nbsp;and other debris, depending on how big your home is and how messy it is. Because of that extra space, you can basically forget about taking care of your vacuum for almost two months.</p>
<p>Instead of emptying dustbins after every cleaning session, you can just check in every so often to change bags. The sealed bag system keeps allergens and fine dust particles from getting into the air when you empty it by hand and it makes it perfect for homes with allergies or sensitivities. When the bag is full, you can quickly lift it up and put it back down again without making dust clouds or having to touch the dirt that has built up.</p>
<p>The<strong> 10,000Pa HyperForce suction picks up everything from fine dust on hardwood floors to pet hair</strong> that has been stuck in carpets without needing to go over the same area more than once: That level of suction is comparable to models that cost twice as much, and it works well on all types of floors. Roborock made the dual anti-tangle system with JawScrapers’ main brush technology which stops hair from getting stuck in the roller and it also has a side brush that won’t get tangled even when cleaning up long human hair or shedding from double-coated dogs.</p>



<p>PreciSense LiDAR navigation makes precise floor plans of your home and shows where rooms and furniture are so that you can clean them more quickly. Unlike older models,<strong> this vacuum doesn’t bump around your space at random</strong> and instead, it follows planned paths that make sure it covers everything without going over the same area more than once. You can also use the Roborock app to set no-go zones so that the vacuum doesn’t go near pet food bowls, delicate rugs, or places with cables. Virtual walls make boundaries without needing to put up physical barriers.</p>
<p>This <strong>combination vacuum and mop can pick up both dry and sticky messes</strong> in one pass: It automatically switches between modes based on the type of floor and your preferences. With three adjustable water flow settings, you can choose how much water to use when mopping. For example, you can use light moisture on sealed hardwood or heavier flow on tile and laminate that can handle more water.</p>



<p>The vacuum works just as well on carpets as it does on hard floors because it automatically adjusts the suction power when it detects rugs or carpets and lowers it on hard surfaces to save battery life. The edge cleaning works well because the side brush can get into corners and along baseboards where dirt builds up. The <strong>design is small enough to fit under furniture and around chair legs</strong>&nbsp;which lets it get to places that upright vacuums can’t.</p>
<p>For $219, you can get the Roborock Q7 M5+ with its self-emptying dock and it is a great deal because similar systems from iRobot or Shark usually cost between $400 and $600. Here you can get a robot vacuum system that makes it easy to keep your floors clean every day.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/macbooks-survived-black-friday-and-apple-went-even-lower-new-record-low-for-cyber-monday-2000648940</link>

              <p>Apple avoids running direct promotions on its products but Amazon has taken matters into its own hands with aggressive discounting throughout this shopping season. The online giant crushed MacBook Air M4 sales during Black Friday after slashing prices significantly, but Cyber Monday brings an even deeper cut that pushes the deal into record territory.</p>
<p>Right now, the 2025 MacBook Air with the M4 chip, 16GB unified memory, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">256GB storage is going for $738, down from Apple’s standard $999 price</a> and undercuts even the Black Friday deal by roughly $10<strong> to hit an all-time low for Cyber Monday</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M4 Chip Performance</h2>
<p>The M4 chip has desktop-level performance that can handle tough tasks like editing 4K video, doing complicated spreadsheet calculations, or running multiple virtual machines without breaking a sweat. Apple’s second-generation 3-nanometer architecture packs more transistors into less space while using less power which means that it can process data faster and use less power than the already impressive M3 generation.</p>
<p>The 16GB of unified memory is a big step up from the 8GB base model that Apple used to ship and makes it easy to multitask across dozens of browser tabs, creative apps, and background processes. That <strong>memory architecture lets the CPU and GPU share resources</strong> without the slowdowns that happen on regular laptops when the graphics and processor have to fight for separate memory pools.</p>
<p>The<strong> battery lasts about 18 hours of normal</strong> use so you can get through a whole day of meetings, document editing, and web browsing without having to look for outlets. That level of performance stays the same whether you’re running on battery or plugged in, which is a problem with many Windows laptops when they’re unplugged. The MacBook Air is completely silent when it’s running because it doesn’t have a fan.</p>



<p>The <strong>13.6-inch Liquid Retina display can show one billion colors and is 500 nits bright</strong> so photos and videos look great with bright colors and deep contrast. Text looks sharp at the native resolution, which is easier on the eyes than lower-resolution displays when reading or coding for long periods of time. That screen space gives you enough room to work on multiple things at once while keeping the laptop small enough to fit in most bags without taking up too much space.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Intelligence integration adds AI features</strong> directly to macOS without needing cloud processing or paying for basic features. The system helps with writing, making content, and productivity workflows, and it does all of this on the device to protect your privacy. Your data never leaves your machine because it is processed locally. This solves privacy issues that come up with cloud-based AI services. Two Thunderbolt 4 ports let you transfer data at lightning speed and drive up to two external displays at the same time.</p>



<p>The <strong>MacBook Air runs macOS without any problems</strong> and all of your important apps, like Microsoft 365 Copilot, Adobe Creative Cloud, and Google Workspace, work perfectly thanks to Apple Silicon optimization. iPhone integration works great with features like iPhone Mirroring, which lets you control your phone from your Mac, Universal Clipboard, which lets you copy content between devices, and Continuity Camera, which turns your iPhone into a wireless webcam.</p>
<p>When you think about how much Apple charges for this exact configuration directly, $999, getting the MacBook Air M4 for $738 is a great deal. This Cyber Monday price is $261 less than retail and gets you professional-level performance and a high-quality build. It’s the perfect time to upgrade from old Intel MacBooks or cheap Windows laptops.</p>
