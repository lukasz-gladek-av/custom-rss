              <p><span>Last week, a Portland protestor named Seth Todd showed up at the ICE protests in the Oregon city dressed up in an inflatable frog costume. Footage of armed soldiers backing up as the protester confidently walked toward them went viral on social media, along with a video of an agent spraying pepper spray into the costume’s air filter. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/trump-autism-tylenol-press-conference-reaction-jokes-2000627950"><span>President Donald Trump</span></a><span> has been trying to </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/09/us/portland-oregon-trump-history"><span>paint a grim picture of the protests</span></a><span>, saying the city has become “war-ravaged,” but seeing a protestor dressed in a frog costume tells another story. Now, the frog costume has inspired dozens of other Portland citizens to dress up as animals as they continue to fight against ICE and America’s continued descent into fascism.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><i><span>The Oregonian</span></i><span>, a local outlet in Portland, interviewed several protesters last night, October 9, who came to the ICE facility dressed up as frogs in an act of solidarity.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">OMG LMAO there is now a Portland Frog Brigade outside of the ICE facility <a href="https://t.co/0jCvc6SXnc">pic.twitter.com/0jCvc6SXnc</a></p> <p>— Wu Tang is for the Children (@WUTangKids) <a href="https://twitter.com/WUTangKids/status/1976497220611666134?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“The frog has become a symbol of what’s going on down here,” one costume-wearing protestor told </span><i><span>The Oregonian</span></i><span>. “[We’re here to protest] the insane government overreach that’s going on in this place and the fact that they’re calling Portland an ‘explosive fire-ridden warland.’ Which it’s not, because we’re here.”</span></p>   <p><span>While some protesters are showing up in frog costumes as a direct homage to the original, many Portland residents are simply dressing up in whatever inflatable costumes they can find. </span><i><span>The Oregonian</span></i><span>’s video shows people dressed as a shark, bear, peacock, and a dinosaur. The outlet reports that the armed federal officers “retreated” without interacting with the costume party outside.</span></p>

 <p><span>The Portland ICE protests have been ongoing since June, and while the Trump administration would have you believe that Portland citizens have become violent and dangerous, videos keep popping up showing that the people aren’t the ones instigating any violence. Instead, they show things like costumed protesters doing a dance battle.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>The videos and photos of Seth Todd’s original appearance as the frog at a protest have spawned art, with supporters calling the character a new symbol in the fight against ICE and American fascism.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Shout out to the Portland frog 🐸 <a href="https://t.co/fhkimqH3bY">pic.twitter.com/fhkimqH3bY</a></p> <p>— Not Krime (@NotKrime_1) <a href="https://twitter.com/NotKrime_1/status/1976236960575521142?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">“𝐏𝐨𝐫𝐭𝐥𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐅𝐫𝐨𝐠 🐸 vs 🧊❄️”<br>I stand with frog dude…</p> <p>also, tell me why they pepper sprayed his air hole???<br>how is any of this real life???????</p> <p>Stay strong <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Portland?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Portland</a> <a href="https://t.co/EDoAmcUVaq">pic.twitter.com/EDoAmcUVaq</a></p> <p>— NIKKOLAS SMITH (@4NIKKOLAS) <a href="https://twitter.com/4NIKKOLAS/status/1975656953109225944?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>       <p><span>Todd has said in follow-up interviews that the pepper spray, while “immature” and “unnecessary” on the agent’s part, only gave him a brief coughing fit and discomfort.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-doesn%E2%80%99t-have-a-smartphone-this-tiny-and-cheap-even-100-still-gets-you-change-back.1321939/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Let’s rewind time for a moment. Remember when cell phones first passed that threshold where they stopped being a luxury and became something that just everyone had? They weren’t smart yet, they were just phones. And for those first several years, each iteration got smaller and smaller. Screens weren’t important. Customers prioritized the convenience of being able to fit your phone in any pocket. They only started trending upwards in size when we started to be able to access the internet, and watch videos. Social media became phone-first in design and manufacturers began making the screens bigger to accommodate a better experience when glued to your screen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4691/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>
<p>Though, the advent of the smartphone has not eliminated the benefits of a smaller device. Some of us still would prefer to have something less intrusive. It might also help us reduce our embarrassingly high screen-times to switch over to a phone that isn’t designed to keep out attention for 24 hours a day. That’s where the NanoPhone shines. It’s on sale over at StackSocial at the moment. It’s already starting as an extremely affordable price relative to other smartphones on the market — $200 — but has come down to less than half that. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4691/">For a limited time, you can snag yourself this mini 4G smartphone for only $90.</a></p>

<h2>The Size of a Credit Card</h2>
<p>The NanoPhone is a fully functional smartphone that comes in an incredible compact form factor Its touchscreen only measures in at three inches across, but it still presents in HD. It weighs under three ounces and can be fit reasonably into your pocket without taking up the whole thing.</p>
<p>The cameras are perfectly serviceable for a phone at this price point. You’d be working with a 5MP lens on the back of the device with a 2MP selfie cameras on front for quick pics and video calls. The phone’s 2,000mAh batter will last your through the day and the phone recharges over the now standard USB-C cable.</p>



<p>This phone supports 4G LTE and data plans with most cellular providers. It’s SIM card-ready right out of the box, able to be set up with Verizon, AT&amp;T, T-Mobile, and all other US carriers. You can even use it with budget and no-contract service providers including Cricket, Boost, Visible, and Mint.</p>
<p>The phone is running Android 10 so you can use a whole slew of your favorite apps like WhatsApp, Instagram, X (The Everything App), YouTube, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you had been hoping to snag yourself some cool new tech gadget on sale during Amazon’s Prime Big Deals Days, you’re not out of luck just yet. While the event only extended from October 7 to October 8, some products are still on sale.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4690/"> This Logitech webcam for example is normally listed at $40, but right now has been marked down by 36% off. That ends up saving you $14 as the price comes down to only $26 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>The Logitech Brio 101 is a Full HD 1080p webcam that comes in your choice of either black or white and can be mounted easily on top of your monitor, TV, or laptop screen. The camera utilizes auto-light balance which can on the fly boost brightness and reduce shadows to allow folks you’re on the video call with to see you crystal clear, regardless of the lighting conditions of the room you’re in. Then when no longer in user, the cover slide can be closed over to ensure your privacy when you’re not on a video call.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4690/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The webcam has a built-in microphone so you can cut down on the number of peripherals needed to join and Zoom or Discord call with colleagues, friends, or family. It is also compatible with Microsoft Teams, Google Meet, and a number of other video conferencing applications.</p>
<h2>Compatible with Nintendo Switch 2</h2>
<p>Nintendo’s follow-up to the immensely successful Switch saw some of the lightest changes from its predecessor. That’s not a bad thing. Many Nintendo fans just wanted more of the same, just on better performing hardware, though Nintendo can’t help themselves but to squeeze in one or two new gimmicks.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 features all new chat functionality including the ability to have video calls with friends. Some games even support integrating your video feed to the gameplay, super imposing your video onto in-game elements. Nintendo has its own proprietary USB camera and a handful of — but not all — third party cameras support the Nintendo Switch 2. Luckily, the Logitech Brio 101 is one of those that is supported on the Nintendo Switch 2, so you can enjoy gaming and chatting with your friends with a webcam at a fraction of the price Nintendo sells its for.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Camera is listed at $55.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4690/"> The Logitech Brio 101 webcam is usually $40, but with the 36% discount, it comes down to just $24.</a> That’s less than half the price the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera sells for.</p>

              <p><span>When </span><i><span>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</span></i><span> was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-dark-knight-arkham-new-game-2000618481"><span>revealed at Gamescom earlier this year</span></a><span>, the trailer looked like a blocky version of the </span><i><span>Batman: Arkham </span></i><span>games, which we haven’t gotten a proper sequel to in a decade. Yeah, the name </span><i><span>Arkham</span></i><span> has been slapped on VR spin-offs and mobile apps, but there hasn’t been an honest-to-god open-world </span><i><span>Batman </span></i><span>action game since </span><i><span>Arkham Knight </span></i><span>in 2015. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gotham-knights-batman-batgirl-nightwing-dlc-wb-games-1850378621"><i><span>Gotham Knights</span></i></a> <span>came close, but was weighed down by loot nonsense and a miserable grind. Rocksteady, the developer of the original trilogy, pivoted to the loot shooter </span><i><span>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</span></i><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-justice-league-review-is-it-good-batman-1851222047"><span>which didn’t go over well</span></a><span>. So there’s been a dearth of interesting </span><i><span>Batman </span></i><span>games in recent years, and while I figured it would come to an end at some point, I just expect the next to come from </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>developer TT Games.</span></p> <p><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight</span></i><span>’s trailer showed the mini-figure version of the Caped Crusader grappling around Gotham, descending upon unsuspecting baddies, and investigating crime scenes just like he did in games like </span><i><span>Arkham City</span></i><span>. I played about 30 minutes of the game, and even though I hadn’t played any of the </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>games in a decade, my muscle memory kicked in when I was surrounded by a group of minifigure goons and the parry prompt appeared over one of their heads. People joke that </span><i><span>Arkham</span></i><span>’s beat-em-up combat is a rhythm game because every action, whether it be a punch, the swing of a bat, or the firing of a gun, has an equivalent QTE prompt response coded into Batman’s arsenal of moves. When you really get into the groove, Batman is practically dancing across a battlefield as he dodges, parries, and punches, and even with the more snappy </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>movement, it still feels fluid and rhythmic. It is quite literally an </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>game, albeit with the slapstick </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>flair you’ve come to expect from its parodies. Batman’s finishing moves are less of the “you expect me to believe that man isn’t dead?” brutality we see Bruce Wayne dish out in </span><i><span>Arkham</span></i><span>, and more silly stuff like covering an enemy’s head with a trash can. Foes still break apart like any Lego character would, but I guess if you can just rebuild anything in these games, that’s not </span><i><span>technically </span></i><span>Batman breaking his no-kill rule.</span></p>

  <p><span>The </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>comparisons don’t stop at fights, as </span><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>also has an open world to grapple and glide around. Though the pieced-together Gotham City might not be as atmospheric and dour as Rocksteady’s, getting around the crime-ridden Lego metropolis is just as satisfying. It’s easy to get distracted grappling to every high platform or gliding around with Batman’s wings spread over the city, but </span><i><span>Legacy </span></i><span>has enough of the random crime missions and collectibles that even a detour from your original objective is usually rewarded with something to do. You’re also able to ride around the city in the Batmobile, but I was so caught up in flying around the rooftops that I actually forgot to head to the ground level and drive around. My bad.</span></p>

 <p><span>Though </span><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>clearly has a lot of </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>influence, it still has </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>foundations. The game can be played with couch co-op or by swapping between characters on the fly if you’re riding solo. The section I played, which had Batman and Commissioner Gordon infiltrating an Ace Chemicals plant, had puzzles that required both characters to solve. Batman’s gadgets can clear certain obstacles–his grappling hook, for instance, letting you pull locks off walls and crates–while Gordon has a gun that can stop up air vents or leaking pipes to clear the way for you to move forward. It’s easy enough to go back and forth between characters, but I imagine those segments will feel more rewarding when you have a second player next to you and it actually feels like a team effort. Gordon is one of several buddy characters Batman will team up with in </span><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>People might have an image of </span><i><span>Lego </span></i><span>games in their minds as games with simple co-op action and a lot of referential humor, and </span><i><span>Legacy of the Dark Knight </span></i><span>has all of that. But it’s also the closest thing to an </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>game we’ve gotten in years, and what I played so far makes it feel like a competent one. We’ll see how well it holds together or breaks apart when it comes to PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch 2 in 2026.</span></p>
