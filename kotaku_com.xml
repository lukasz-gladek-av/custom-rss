              <p>A father visiting <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-world-fourth-death-in-one-month-disneyland-2000641756">Disneyland</a> with his family was reportedly attacked after calling out someone cutting a long ride line. The father ended up bloodied and received stitches, but was able to stay in the park and enjoy some rides.</p> <p>On December 30, <a href="https://people.com/father-injured-in-bloody-disneyland-altercation-over-reported-line-cutting-11880120">as reported by <em>People</em></a> and confirmed by Disney and Anaheim police, a family started cutting the long line for the Indiana Jones Adventure ride at around 2 p.m. At one point, the family of line cutters tried to pass by another family, but the father of this group didn’t appreciate this, and a loud argument erupted. This argument allegedly turned into a physical assault, with the man leading the group of line cutters punching the father multiple times in front of his wife and 17-year-old daughter.</p> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneyland/comments/1q06z6f/comment/nxzj3zp/">According to one Reddit user</a> who claimed to have witnessed the attack, it lasted about 30 seconds and “there were several people intervening to stop the guy.” The same user claimed the attacker “managed to get some hits in even with people blocking.” The aggressive line cutter then reportedly stopped, and when people backed off, he “jumped in for one last sucker punch, which drew blood, and then he ran off with his family following.”</p>

 <p>A Disneyland spokesperson confirmed with <em>People</em> that on January 6, a&nbsp; “physical altercation” involving two male guests did occur, and one of them was treated by the park’s medical team. The alleged attacker “fled the scene and has not been located,” according to local police.</p>

 <p>A woman on Reddit claiming to be the wife of the man who was attacked says that he didn’t fight back because he didn’t want to get his family kicked out of the park or be charged with assault. The wife also says her teen daughter recorded the entire incident. As for the father, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneyland/comments/1q06z6f/comment/nx4gqzl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">a photo shared by the wife</a> shows him with multiple stitches above his right eye. It was also reported that he was covered in blood, and Disneyland provided new clothes while also giving his kids, 17 and 26, Lightning Lanes for the entire day.</p>

 <p>The father and his family stayed in the park, and another image shared by someone claiming to be the daughter <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneyland/comments/1q0pyhn/comment/nx4hy4d/?context=3&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">showed the father in line at Disney with a bandage over his eye.</a></p>

              <p><span>Razer, the company best known for its RGB-infused keyboards, cat-ear headsets, and over-priced gaming chairs, has just revealed that its “AI gaming copilot” Project Ava will be used in its latest invention: an AI anime waifu that sits on your desk, named “Kira.” She’ll be powered by Elon Musk’s Grok.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The 2026 Consumer Electronics Show kicked off in Las Vegas this week and, unsurprisingly, AI-powered tech is everywhere. Razer announced its </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24338016/razer-project-ava-ai-gaming-copilot-coach"><span>AI gaming assistant, Project Ava,</span></a><span> at last year’s show, alongside a prerecorded video of the copilot program suggesting tips to help a player navigate a boss fight in </span><i><span>Black Myth: Wukong</span></i><span>.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Razer’s Project Ava has now returned in physical form. The newly unveiled “AI Desk Companion” version comes equipped with a built-in webcam (which Razer states is for its “human-like vision” and “full contextual awareness”), a series of customizable RGB LEDs, a USB-C port, and, most notably, a “swappable” 5.5-inch-tall 3D holographic avatar.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="fr" dir="ltr">Razer Holographic AI Voice Assistant Kira (Project Ava) CES 2026 Demo <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Razer?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Razer</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2026?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CES2026</a> <a href="https://t.co/ah54Us7QMJ">pic.twitter.com/ah54Us7QMJ</a></p> <p>— Shacknews (@shacknews) <a href="https://twitter.com/shacknews/status/2008539048328171561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>According to the press release, Project Ava’s holographic companion currently comes in five varieties. These include the default, amorphous green blob Ava, the aforementioned cat-ear wearing anime waifu Kira, and a buff “gaming wingman” called Zane. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The other two holograms are actually 3D recreations of real people: the South Korean eSports legend Lee “Faker” Sang-hyeok and the J-Pop idol Saori “Sao” Araki, the latter of whom exploded in popularity last year following her viral “Office Lady” meme.</span></p>

 <p><span>As detailed in a report by </span><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/sony-razer-project-ava-ai-gameplay"><i><span>Inverse</span></i></a><span>, the physical version of Project Ava will be powered by xAI’s Grok, which recently </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrn054nxe7o"><span>started posting CSAM online</span></a><span>. If you’re curious how it will perform as Grok races </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/musk-s-grok-ai-generated-thousands-of-undressed-images-per-hour-on-x"><span>to seed social media with deepfake porn</span></a><span>, several outlets, including </span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/razer-made-its-ai-gaming-assistant-into-a-waifu-hologram-2000705679"><span>both </span><i><span>Gizmodo</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854705/razer-ai-anime-waifu-hologram-desk"><i><span>The Verge</span></i></a><span>, were less than complimentary about its implementation.</span><span><br> </span></p>

 <p><i><span>Gizmodo’s </span></i><span>James Pero stated that his experience with Project Ava was “as wonky as chatting with any other AI chatbot out there,” and </span><i><span>The Verge’s</span></i><span> Antonio G. Di Benedetto noted that the anime AI assistant Kira “kept incessantly filling gaps in communication with annoying chatter.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>If you’re still keen to get your hands on one of these regardless, </span><a href="https://www.razer.com/gb-en/concepts/project-ava"><span>the FAQ</span></a><span> on Razer’s Project Ava website states that it’s “expected to be available in the second half of 2026” and that folks in the United States can already reserve one of the units by putting down a $20 deposit. The company still hasn’t revealed how much the full Grok-powered holograms will cost.</span></p>

              <p>Christmas might be over, but that won’t stop retailers and digital stores from offering up deals themed around wintertime. Case in point: GOG’s big new Winter Classics Promo, which features over 1,000 heavily discounted old PC games.</p> <p>Kicking off on January 6, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/20260106-winter-classics-promo?order=desc:trending">the new GOG Winter Classics Promo</a> sees the storefront dedicated to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">selling and preserving games</a>, offering up some of its older titles for up to 95 percent off.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-halifax-shutdown-unionized-rainbow-six-mobile-2000657752</link>
            <guid>1399618</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Ubisoft Halifax, the Nova Scotia-based mobile team in Ubisoft’s stable of studios, announced that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-lawsuit-kotor-2-switch-divinity-2000655351"><span>it was unionizing back in December</span></a><span>. Ubisoft swears up and down that what came next was decided before 61 of its 71 employees joined the Game &amp; Media Workers Guild of Canada, and if that’s actually the case, Ubisoft sure stepped on a massive rake by shutting down the studio just weeks after organizing members made the union official.</span></p> <p><span>In a statement to </span><a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/"><i><span>Gamesindustry.biz</span></i></a><span>, Ubisoft said the call came not from a cruel union-busting effort, but as part of years-long cost-cutting initiative on the </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed</span></i><span> company’s part.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“Over the past 24 months, Ubisoft has undertaken company-wide actions to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs,” the statement reads. “As part of this, Ubisoft has made the difficult decision to close its Halifax studio. 71 positions will be affected. We are committed to supporting all impacted team members during this transition with resources, including comprehensive severance packages and additional career assistance.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Even if this is the case, the optics are bad. Ubisoft has been undergoing a lot of reorganization in the past few years, with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-massive-layoffs-division-3-star-wars-outlaws-2000638264"><span>layoffs at subsidiaries like </span><i><span>Star Wars Outlaws </span></i><span>developer Massive</span></a><span> and top level personnel </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-says-he-didnt-jump-ubisoft-pushed-2000636542"><span>leaving the company</span></a><span> as it continues to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-ubisoft-sold-ai-2000646161"><span>drastically reduce its workforce</span></a><span> after Tencent bailed it out </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796"><span>to the tune of $1.25 billion</span></a><span>. So yeah, it might not be union busting, but the whole thing still deserves your “boos” and tomatoes.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Ubisoft Halifax had developed two free-to-play games based on some of Ubisoft’s biggest properties:</span><i><span> Rainbow Six Mobile </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed Rebellion</span></i><span>. It’s unclear how this will affect </span><i><span>Rainbow Six Mobile</span></i><span>, which was set for a global release on February 23. </span></p>
