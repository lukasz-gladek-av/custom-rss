              <p><span>After two years of dating, the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-life-of-a-showgirl-announcement-cover-date-2000617177"><span>music industry’s greatest game master</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-tortured-poets-department-dark-souls-1851439461"><span>Taylor Swift</span></a><span>, is engaged to Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Swift announced their engagement on her Instagram account with the caption, “Your English teacher and your gym teacher are getting married.” While the comments are turned off (as they are with every post on her profile), as you can imagine, the internet is losing its mind. “Why are you writing about Taylor Swift on a video game website?” </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-shakes-her-polys-in-band-hero-5329622"><span>She was in </span><i><span>Band Hero</span></i></a><span>, leave me alone.</span></p> <p><span>Love them, hate them, or feel nothing for them, Swift and Kelce are America’s sweethearts. The general public is already greatly invested in Swift’s love life, since her songs and the mythos around her have etched the 35-year-old pop star’s romantic ups and downs into modern pop culture folklore, and seeing her in a relationship that seemingly lacks the kinds of dramatic complications you write albums about has prompted fans to root for this relationship to be the one that works out. A lot of people have been tuned into the lore for years, and for those who have treated Swift’s love life as a story they’ve been watching unfold, it’s basically like watching a slow-burn romance finally reach its next stage.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">me telling everyone I know that Taylor Swift got engaged <a href="https://t.co/MpS8BLPOZj">pic.twitter.com/MpS8BLPOZj</a></p> <p>— Siobhan ✨ (@Siobachka) <a href="https://twitter.com/Siobachka/status/1960389888366219708?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I AM SO HAPPY FOR MY CLOSE AND PERSONAL FRIEND TAYLOR SWIFT <a href="https://t.co/O2gBDwphSa">pic.twitter.com/O2gBDwphSa</a></p> <p>— pippa (@piptweets) <a href="https://twitter.com/piptweets/status/1960388307847631020?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">literally crying for my close and personal friend taylor swift <a href="https://t.co/65TZrdVhVq">pic.twitter.com/65TZrdVhVq</a></p> <p>— burcu ❤️‍🔥 (@thatsoburcu) <a href="https://twitter.com/thatsoburcu/status/1960388498931769581?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">taylor is finally living her fairytale dreams that she would write songs about as a teenager someone SEDATE ME <a href="https://t.co/NcQraMZkUZ">pic.twitter.com/NcQraMZkUZ</a></p> <p>— Taylor Swift Updates (@SwiftNYC) <a href="https://twitter.com/SwiftNYC/status/1960391657104294356?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">how do i explain to my nervous system that i’m not being held at gunpoint and it’s just taylor swift announced her engagement?

This may change in October when she releases her next record, </span><i><span>The Life of a Showgirl</span></i><span>, which is her first album to be recorded entirely during the two’s relationship. Swift announced the album on Kelce’s podcast </span><i><span>New Heights</span></i><span>, and described it as “exuberant and electric and vibrant,” a stark contrast from the moodier and more introspective </span><i><span>Tortured Poets Department</span></i><span>. The album will launch on October 3.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-responds-to-identity-crisis-by-not-letting-ugly-skins-carry-over-to-black-ops-7.1281090/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Activision and Treyarch are making a big change to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-opening-night-live-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trailer-2000618479"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a>, just under 12 weeks before its launch in November. All those wacky cosmetics from <em>Black Ops 6</em> will no longer carry over to the new sequel as previously promised. The devs behind <em>Call of Duty</em> say the change is to ensure <em>Black Ops 7</em> is “authentic to <em>Call of Duty</em> and its setting.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-community-update-august-2025">On August 26</a>, in a lengthy community update posted on the official <em>Call of Duty</em> website, Treyarch thanked fans for all the feedback and acknowledged the ongoing conversation online surrounding crossover skins and wacky cosmetic items in video games.</p> <p>“We know there’s been a lot of conversation recently about the identity of <em>Call of Duty,</em>” said the studio. “Some of you have said we’ve drifted from what made <em>Call of Duty</em> unique in the first place: immersive, intense, visceral and in many ways grounded. That feedback hits home, and we take it seriously. We hear you.”</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="COD x Beavis &amp; Butt-Head | Call of Duty: Warzone &amp; Black Ops 6" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gjaKA57mnu8?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Players were worried that the weird cosmetics and crossover skins from <em>Black Ops 6</em> would immediately turn<em> Black Ops 7</em> into a <em>Fortnite</em>-like experience. That’s because the plan was to let skins from <em>BLOPS 6, </em>which now includes characters like Beavis and Butt-Head, carry over to <em>BLOPS 7</em>. But that’s no longer happening.</p> <p>“Operators, Operator Skins, and Weapons from <em>Black Ops 6</em> will no longer carry forward into <em>Black Ops 7</em>,” announced Treyarch. <em>“Black Ops 7</em> needs to feel authentic to <em>Call of Duty</em> and its setting. That is why<em> Black Ops 6</em> Operator and Weapon content will not carry forward to <em>Black Ops 7.</em> Double XP tokens and GobbleGums will still carry forward, because we recognize your time and progression are important.”</p> <p>The developers of <em>Black Ops 7</em> also claimed that a “ton of feedback” has already been implemented into the game. And the studio explained that future cosmetic bundles and items added to <em>BLOPS 7</em> will be “crafted to fit the <em>Black Ops</em> identity.” Treyarch further added: “We hear the feedback. We need to deliver a better balance toward the immersive, core <em>Call of Duty</em> experience.”</p>

 <p>Activision did confirm that <em>BLOPS 6</em> skins will still move over to <em>Warzone</em>. So your strange collection of characters can still go enjoy battle royale.</p> <h2>Why <em>Call of Duty</em> is making this big change</h2> <p>People have been yelling online for years about <em>Call of Duty</em> skins and cosmetics going too far and feeling out of place. So why the sudden change now, just a few months before the next game’s launch?<a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-crossover-skins-rick-morty-call-of-duty-1851786919"> Well, it’s likely because of <em>Battlefield 6.</em></a> EA’s upcoming shooter held an open beta earlier this month, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-call-of-duty-record-2000616838">and it was immensely popular</a>. It is also a more grounded, gritty, and realistic war game compared to recent<em> Call of Duty</em> entries. And when EA DICE design director Shashank Uchil was asked if the studio planned to add crossover skins like Beavis and Butt-Head or Goku to <em>Battlefield 6,</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-goofy-skins-call-of-duty-nicki-minaj-2000614447">he claimed that wasn’t going to happen</a>.</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Battlefield 6 Official Multiplayer Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFGEMfyAQtI?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>“It has to be grounded,” said Uchil. “That is what<em>&nbsp;BF3</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>BF4</em> was—it was all soldiers, on the ground. It’s going to be like this. I don’t think it needs Nicki Minaj. Let’s keep it real, keep it grounded.”</p> <p><a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/battlefield-6-skins-cosmetics/">Another DICE developer told <em>Comicbook</em></a>:&nbsp; “What I will say is what’s really important to us is that things feel grounded, and we want people to express themselves and to have cool skins and peacock in a way like ‘I look pretty cool and I have this great weapon skin.’ But we want it to feel authentic to the franchise, that’s the approach we’re thinking.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912">following last week’s reveal of a very wild-looking</a> and not at all grounded<em> Black Ops 7</em>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-devs-paying-attention-to-community-feedback-on-goofy-skins"><em>IGN</em> asked the game’s creative director</a>, Miles Leslie, about wacky crossover skins. His answer was a big nothing burger that didn’t really commit to anything, vaguely claimed the studio would “calibrate” future skins based on feedback, and promised that all fans would “feel represented.” This answer went over poorly. And, after today’s big news that <em>Black Ops 7</em> will feature more grounded skins and won’t let <em>Black Ops 6</em> cosmetics carry over as planned, it seems the folks in charge of <em>Call of Duty</em> are trying to get the train back on the tracks in the face of October’s <em>Battlefield 6.</em> Will it be enough? I’m not sure, but it is interesting to watch <em>Call of Duty</em> react to the first serious competition it’s faced in years.</p>

              <p>Electronic Arts and developers Full Circle announced that <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-skate-4-reboot-release-date-early-access-2025-pc-ps5-1851650367">after years of waiting</a> and fans begging for a new game, the upcoming <em>Skate</em> reboot will launch in September in early access on consoles and PC.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/skate/status/1960371890570023372">On August 26</a>, EA posted a short trailer for the next <em>Skate</em> game, which is confusingly just titled <em>Skate</em>, and finally confirmed an early access release date. Previously, the publisher had teased that it would be out sometime this year and later promised it would be out this summer. But now we know that the new, online-only <em>Skate</em> reboot is launching on September 16. Mark your calendars and set aside some time to kickflip. Or crash. You’ll probably be crashing a lot.&nbsp; Here’s the new trailer:</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are so hyped to announce that skate. will release in Early Access September 16th, 2025. See you in San Vansterdam! 🛹 <a href="https://t.co/3tR3onovwb">pic.twitter.com/3tR3onovwb</a></p> <p>— skate. (@skate) <a href="https://twitter.com/skate/status/1960371890570023372?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This new <em>Skate</em> reboot will be an online-only multiplayer-focused open-world adventure <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-reboot-ea-servers-150-players-100-songs-seasons-summer-2000618257">featuring over 100 songs and up to 150 players</a> skating together in a single session. The game is set in San Vansterdam, a city built from the ground up by EA and Open Circle to be the dream playground for all skateboarders.</p> <p>It’s been a long wait for this new <em>Skate</em> game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-has-finally-announced-a-new-skate-game-1844087679">EA first revealed it was working on a new <em>Skate</em> in 2020</a> after years of fans begging them to make it. Since then, the game has been <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-ea-leaked-alpha-beta-build-pc-devs-1849176399">leaked a few times</a>, and EA has put out early, unfinished footage of <em>Skate</em> as part of a plan to be more transparent about the open-world skateboarding game’s development. <em>Skate</em> has also been playtested by fans in the lead-up to its launch. The new <em>Skate</em> arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on September 16.</p>
