The game is being positioned as the future of <em>Pokémon</em>’s competitive play, as evidenced by the teaser trailer showing players using items like Game Boy link cables to battle, all culminating in a modern-day battle between a Switch user and a mobile player in <em>Champions</em>. While the average trainer is probably most excited to return to Kalos in <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, <em>Champions </em>could fundamentally change how competitive <em>Pokémon </em>operates, and by extension open up a design space for RPGs like <em>Z-A</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,195519,195618" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Let’s start with what we know. <em>Pokémon Champions </em>is a battle simulation game that won’t be tied to a specific RPG. Right now, competitive players battle in whatever the current mainline <em>Pokémon </em>is, so the best trainers in the scene are battling in <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> in official tournaments. This naturally limits the Pokémon players can use, as well as the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-best-gimmicks-mega-evolution-tera-types-1850736746&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-best-gimmicks-mega-evolution-tera-types-1850736746">gimmick mechanics</a></span> they can utilize. <em>Champions</em>, meanwhile, will not be tied to a specific game and can import different Pokémon from the <em>Pokémon Home</em> storage app (though The Pokémon Company makes clear <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pokemon.gamespress.com/POKEMON-EXPANDS-ENTERTAINMENT-OFFERINGS-WITH-NEW-WAYS-TO-PLAY-IN-THE-P&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pokemon.gamespress.com/POKEMON-EXPANDS-ENTERTAINMENT-OFFERINGS-WITH-NEW-WAYS-TO-PLAY-IN-THE-P" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in its press release</a></span> that there will be some restrictions). The trailer also shows that <em>Champions</em> supports different gameplay mechanics like Mega Evolution and Terastallization, indicating that it might be possible to use different strategies that aren’t beholden to a game-specific rule set.</p><p>Just how freely we’ll be able to customize rules and party compositions remains to be seen, but The Pokémon Company creating an officially licensed battle simulator similar to the third-party ones used by competitive pros that aren’t limited to the current generation is a huge deal. This means professional players and the average fan will no longer be tied to one another. Official <em>Pokémon </em>tournaments won’t be limited to specific RPGs’ rosters, and mainline games could get more experimental without being chained to a competitive scene.</p><p><em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus </em>is one of the most innovative games the series has released in the past decade. It has new battle mechanics like the agile and strong style moves that let you choose to prioritize speed or power, which would be considered “broken” in competitive play. But <em>Legends: Arceus </em>doesn’t have multiplayer battles and doesn’t have to design its turn-based gameplay around whether or not something is fair to a rival trainer. As a result, some of the game’s big story battles are among the most challenging and interesting the series has ever put out. As a non-competitive player, some of the most strategic plays I’ve ever had to make in a <em>Pokémon </em>game’s main story involved making decisions about whether or not to use agile attacks to try and get in a few extra hits, or put everything I had into a strong one in hopes of knocking an enemy out in one shot. </p><p>This was a simple tweak to long-established <em>Pokémon </em>mechanics, but if Game Freak can develop RPGs without having to account for a completely different way they might be played in tournaments, it could mean cool innovations like this in future games. <em>Legends: Z-A</em> even introduces its own spin on <em>Pokémon</em> battles by incorporating positioning and area-of-effect to make use of the walkable 3D combat zones. Cool changes like this are only possible if we stop worrying about competitive viability and make space for innovative RPG design.</p><p>Severing competitive tournaments from the RPGs is a good thing for everyone, and some of the biggest names in professional <em>Pokémon </em>battling have expressed that having their own space to play and experiment could be a game changer for the scene.</p><p>There are still a lot of questions for both competitive and casual players, but the potential possibilities <em>Pokémon Champions</em> could bring to all sides of the community make it the most exciting part of the Presents showcase. I’m stoked for <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, but in the long run, I’m even more interested in how the <em>Pokémon </em>series could keep changing for the better.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Maybe it’s only recently that the manufacturing costs came down enough to make that viable. After all, why would Sony want to lose money on headsets for an ecosystem that’s barely growing? At the same time, games sell consoles, and without the clear backing of Sony the PS VR2 library never took off. How can others place big bets on the hardware if the company that made it doesn’t seem willing to do the same? </p><p> That doesn’t mean here are no games for PS VR2. Sony notes in today’s blog post that <em>Alien: Rogue Incursion</em>, <em>Skydance’s Behemoth</em>, and<em> Metro Awakening VR</em> all recently arrived on the platform, with <em>Hitman World of Assassination</em>, and others still on the way. For now though, there still doesn’t seem to be a killer app coming down the road anytime soon. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was the start of nine months of nonstop reveals of the 120 new creatures being added to the Pokédex, alongside excitement about the Nintendo Switch’s second mainline entry, following 2019's <em>Sword</em> and <em>Shield. </em>And while it <em>was</em> a surprise announcement in the sense that Nintendo had kept it under wraps until that point, it was also expected that a new game would be announced, because there’s a new game every three years, right?</p><p>That’s actually only been true since 2010, following the launch of <em>Black </em>and <em>White. </em>By 2013 we had <em>X </em>and <em>Y </em>(as well as the bonus of the first and only sequels, <em>Black 2</em> and <em>White 2 </em>in 2012). Then, like clockwork, 2016 gave us <em>Sun</em> and <em>Moon</em>, before 2019's <em>Sword </em>and <em>Shield</em>, and 2022's <em>S&amp;V.</em> That’s five mainline entries in a row, each three years apart, rather giving the impression that this was to be the norm. And it almost is; aside from  2006's <em>Diamond </em>and <em>Pearl </em>and 2010's <em>Black </em>and <em>White</em>, each coming out four years after the previous, it’s always been three years.</p><p>Seemingly, 2025 is to be another of those exceptions. What’s so odd is the complete quiet about it all. No one seems to have noticed?</p><h2 id="h895"><a id=""></a>The Three-Year Itch</h2><p>As an observer, it really rather looked like Game Freak had little choice but to get a mainline game out every third year—to the point where the clearly unpolished <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em> would surely have been given more time under any other circumstances. But there’s a <em>vast</em> industry built around those games, and missing its release date would have knocked over a row of dominos that could have cost Nintendo, Game Freak, Creatures and The Pokémon Company (a confusing collection of companies who all overlap in the middle) billions.</p><p>Think about the <em>Pokémon TCG</em>. Every three years for the last 15, a new era of cards is launched, themed around the name and region of the most recent game, and highlighting the Pokémon introduced in the new generation. Those cards have to be in production long before the game’s even released, given—for instance—Japan’s first set of <em>Scarlet &amp; Violet</em> era TCG cards were released in January 2023, just two months after the game came out. The artwork alone would have been commissioned months ahead, and the intricacies of the game design based on all the new monsters worked out well in advance, too. If the game slipped, the cards would either have to be enormously expensively delayed, or come out ahead of the game and ruin twists and surprises,  and in turn knock down the next domino: merchandise. </p><p>So to shift to a four-year development cycle (and let’s be clear, they absolutely should, or even a longer one, because Game Freak employees deserve the time and space to avoid crunch and make the best game possible) has enormous implications. Ones that must be planned for, presumably years in advance. Nintendo, Game Freak, et al, are all so notoriously tight-lipped about <em>everything</em>, and it’s wildly unlikely they’d ever tell anyone such intentions, so we’re left to just guess. And my guess would be that the reaction to <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>’s dubious (and ongoing) technical state caused decisions to be made within to do two different things:</p><p><strong>1)</strong> Take longer to make an open-world game that isn’t cracking at the seams</p><p><strong>2)</strong> Make it for the Switch 2 only</p><p>That latter one would have been very difficult to get away with in 2025. Sure, it’d have been an <em>amazing</em> way to sell Switch 2s over the 2025 holiday season, but the console would still be six months old at most, and most people would expect a game announced today to work on the console they own today. But next year? It’s an easier sell. In fact, it’s pretty much bog-standard for a new <em>Pokémon </em>game to release a year or two after the latest Nintendo hardware.</p><h2 id="h896"><a id=""></a>Domino Rally</h2><p>The implications are still interesting, however. The <em>PTCG </em>is going to need to run <em>SV</em> for an extra year, and it’s already looking a bit worn out. The ex era is being revamped later this year with the addition of mega evolution cards, but while that’ll change up the meta a bit and obviously give them a chance to take advantage of the current ludicrous boom in sales to sell a gazillion Mega Charizard-themed boxes, it still leaves 2026 and the first half of 2027 to fill with Generation IX. That explains 2025's year-long release of Prismatic Evolution special sets, a year earlier than you’d have expected given how the <em>Sword &amp; Shield</em> era ended with a full year of Crown Zenith sets—it’s clearly a mid-point thing, rather than an ending. We can expect some sort of ex-celebrating bonanza next year, maybe?</p><p>Anyway, there you go. Just in case you too were thinking how weird it is that no one’s talking about this.</p><p>Unless of course they go and surprise-announce it in the April Nintendo Direct, and make me look like a complete fool.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
