              <p>Apple manages impressive <a href="https://kotaku.com/apple-swallows-its-pride-macbook-air-falls-to-all-time-low-and-goes-2x-cheaper-than-pro-2000646450">25% discounts on MacBooks through Amazon during Black Friday</a>, but this HP laptop just shattered discount records with a massive 71% price drop.</p>
<p>Amazon dropped this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5860/">HP laptop to an all-time low of $859 for Black Friday, down from its usual $2,999 price tag</a>. For this price, you get a <strong>13th Gen Intel 10-core i5 processor, 17.3-inch Full HD display, 32GB of RAM, and 1TB SSD storage</strong>. Windows 11 Pro comes preloaded with Copilot AI, and HP includes a backlit keyboard plus fingerprint reader for security.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5860/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>10-Core Intel Power That Handles Real Work</h2>
<p>The 13th Generation Intel Core i5-1334U processor has <strong>10 cores that turbo boost up to 4.6GHz if you need that extra horsepower</strong>. The hybrid architecture splits the cores between performance and efficiency, throwing the heavy lifting of demanding tasks to powerful cores while background processes run on efficient cores. You can open multiple Chrome tabs, Microsoft Office applications, video conferencing software, and photo editing programs all at once without any lag.</p>
<p>The 32GB DDR4 RAM removes memory bottlenecks that plague laptops with 8GB or 16GB configurations. You keep dozens of browser tabs open, switch between heavy applications, and work with large datasets without seeing the dreaded spinning wheel. Virtual machines run smoothly for developers or IT professionals who need to test software across different environments.</p>



<p>The <strong>1TB PCIe NVMe SSD provides read speeds to make the entire system snappy</strong> and responsive. It boots up Windows in seconds, launches applications almost instantly, and complete file transfers in no time. The storage capacity holds an entire work library of documents, presentations, spreadsheets, photos, videos, and software installations without the constant management of the drive.</p>
<p>The<strong> 17.3-inch Full HD display provides serious screen real estate at 1920×1080 resolution</strong>. You can view full spreadsheets without horizontal scrolling, edit documents with toolbars visible, and run applications side-by-side comfortably. The anti-glare coating reduces eye strain during marathon work sessions and makes the screen readable in bright offices or near windows.</p>



<p><strong>Fingerprint reader security</strong> provides instant login without the need to type passwords every time one opens the laptop. Biometric authentication works quicker and more reliably than passwords, while it offers better security compared with simple PINs. You unlock the laptop with a quick touch of your finger, jumping right into work without delays in authentication. The fingerprint data remains stored locally on the device rather than in cloud databases.</p>
<p><strong>Wi-Fi 6 gives you faster wireless speeds</strong> and greater performance in crowded networks than ever before. Fast transfer of bulky files, smooth video streaming, and jitter-free video conferencing are now possible. <strong>Bluetooth 5.3</strong> connects your wireless mouse, keyboard, headphones, and other accessories with greater range and reliability. USB Type-A and Type-C ports support existing peripherals and accessories along with newer ones without the need for dongles.</p>
<p><strong>Windows 11 Pro</strong> incorporates enterprise features, remote desktop access, and domain joining for business users. Integration with Copilot AI will help users brainstorm ideas, organize tasks, create drafts of content, and answer questions directly in Windows. The AI assistant simplifies your workflow by automating routine tasks for you and displaying relevant suggested actions based on how you work.</p>
<p>This 17.3-inch laptop delivers 10-core Intel performance with 32GB RAM and 1TB SSD for nearly $2,000 off its usual price, at just $859.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-qrevo-curvx-drops-to-all-time-low-22000pa-beast-with-auto-hot-water-cleaning-falls-to-record-pricing-2000646746</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock holds the same premium position in robot vacuums that Dyson commands in traditional vacuums, with flagship models regularly exceeding $1,500 to $2,000. These luxury cleaning machines pack technology that separates them from budget competitors flooding the market.</p>
<p>The good news is that Amazon just dropped one of Roborock’s best-sellers<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5859/"> to an all-time low of $849 for Black Friday, nearly half off from its usual $1,499 price tag</a>. The <strong>Qrevo CurvX</strong> delivers 22,000Pa suction, zero-tangling design, reactive AI obstacle recognition and 80°C hot water mop washing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5859/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Technology That Solves Real Cleaning Problems</h2>
<p>The<strong> 22,000Pa HyperForce suction</strong> creates enough force to pull deeply embedded dirt from carpet pile and pulls debris from gaps in hardwood flooring. You can immediately tell the difference compared with a vacuum that has only 8,000-10,000Pa-suction power and tends to push dust instead of picking it up. Pet hair, long human hair up to 40cm, cereal crumbs, and tracked-in dirt-all get pulled into the dustbin in one pass. The zero-tangling design stops hair from tangling around the brushes, thus doing away with the maintenance nightmare of standard robot vacuums where you end up spending 15 minutes each week cutting tangled hair off rollers.</p>
<p>The <strong>ultra-slim profile, at only 3.14 inches, makes this the thinnest Roborock ever</strong> manufactured-just 7.98cm tall. This reduced height lets the robot glide under sofas, beds, and cabinets where dust bunnies really collect. Traditional robot vacuums with raised LiDAR domes get stuck or completely skip whole sections below furniture. This Roborock reaches those forgotten spaces and captures hidden dirt that ruins air quality even when visible floors appear clean.</p>



<p>Reactive AI obstacle recognition relies on structured light and an RGB camera to detect and avoid 108 different object types. It <strong>works both in bright and dark environments</strong> and navigates around toys, cables, pet bowls, shoes, and even furniture legs without getting stuck. You don’t have to preclean your floors before running the vacuum, which really changes the vacuum from a scheduled maintenance tool into something you can turn on spontaneously.</p>
<p>AdaptiLift Chassis is industry-first technology that <strong>can lift the entire robot up to 4cm or individually according to terrain</strong>. The system raises the front to climb high thresholds, adjusts side wheels to navigate around furniture legs, and lowers for tight clearances. This adaptability prevents the ‘stuck’ notifications which interrupt other robot vacuums in mid-clean.</p>
<p>The 80°C hot water washing of the mop dissolves stubborn stains and grease left by cold water. The dock heats water to 176°F before washing the mop pads to make sure they are thoroughly cleaned and sanitized after each use. Warm air drying at 113°F prevents mildew and odors from forming on damp mop pads. This focus on hygiene means your robot will never spread dirty water around on your floors in the course of subsequent cleaning.</p>



<p>The automated maintenance tasks handled by the<strong> Multifunctional Dock 3.0 Thermo+ mean you barely touch the robot</strong>. Auto dust emptying transfers collected debris to the dock’s larger bag, holding weeks of dirt. Auto tank refilling keeps the water reservoir full for mopping sessions. Intelligent dirt detection analyzes mop pad contamination and adjusts washing intensity accordingly. The dock performs self-cleaning with hot water, preventing the buildup that makes other docking stations smell terrible after a few weeks.</p>
<p>At $849, this Roborock delivers flagship cleaning technology and hot water mop washing for $650 off the usual price. You are getting premium features that normally would call for an outlay in excess of $1,500+, skimping on very few minor conveniences.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-solix-makes-ecoflow-and-jackery-look-overpriced-2-000w-power-station-selling-for-pocket-change.1362409/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>While EcoFlow, Anker and Jackery were all fairly aggressive in their Black Friday pricing on Amazon, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/">only Anker provides 2,000W output at $349</a>. Competitor power stations in the $350-$400 price range top out at 1,500-1,800W which gets you less power for similar money.</p>
<p>Amazon has just dropped the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/">Anker SOLIX C1000 (second gen) to an all-time low of $349, down from its usual $449 price tag</a>. You get <strong>2,000W continuous output with 3,000W surge capacity</strong>, a 1,024Wh LiFePO4 battery lasting 10 years and it can recharge fully in just 49 minutes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4782/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>2,000W Output Powers What You Need</h2>
<p>The 2,000W continuous output handles high-draw appliances that kill weaker power stations instantly. You can<strong> power up space heaters, window air conditioners, power tools, electric kettles, and other demanding devices</strong> without triggering overload shutdowns. The 3,000W surge capacity absorbs the startup power spikes that motors and compressors create when they first kick on. Refrigerators, well pumps, and air compressors all draw massive current for a few seconds during startup, and this power station handles those surges without flinching.</p>
<p><strong>Ten output ports</strong> spread the power across various devices at once, without having to prioritize what charges first. The port selection <strong>includes AC outlets</strong> for the standard household devices, <strong>USB-C with fast charging for phones and laptops, USB-A for the older gear</strong>&nbsp;and a car outlet for the 12V accessories. You can power a full remote work setup with laptop, monitor, router, and phone charger while running a mini fridge and fan during power outages.</p>



<p>The <strong>49-minute recharge time using HyperFlash technology at 1,600W input</strong> redefines how you use portable power stations. The traditional models take 6-10 hours to recharge from empty, creating overnight charging rituals which make the power station unavailable when you need it. This Anker charges over a lunch break or during a quick stop at an RV park and is ready for another full day of heavy use. You enable HyperFlash mode through the Anker app when you need maximum charging speed, or use standard charging for quieter operation.</p>
<p>LiFePO4 battery chemistry<strong> offers 10 years of reliable performance with 4,000 charge cycles</strong> before capacity drops to 80%. Traditional lithium-ion batteries degrade much faster; many lose a large portion of their capacity after 500-1,000 cycles. The longevity transforms this from a disposable gadget into a legitimate long-term investment that keeps working through years of regular use. The battery is much safer while charging and discharging than a standard lithium battery due to a lower risk of fire and higher thermal stability.</p>



<p>UPS functionality with<strong> under 10-millisecond switchover</strong> keeps sensitive equipment running during power transitions. CPAP machines, computers, modems, and medical devices never experience interruption when grid power fails. The power station detects outages and seamlessly takes over power delivery before the connected devices even notice anything happened.</p>
<p>At 14% smaller and 11% lighter than other 1,000Wh class products on the market, this compact unit makes transport and storage easier. You can also move it between rooms, load it into vehicles for camping, or stash it in closets without excessive effort.</p>
<p>This $349, 2,000W power station offers more output capacity and 49-minute recharging, while its usual price is $100 lower than the normal. Other competitors charge similar prices for less powerful 1,500-1,800W models with slower charging.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sonos made its name with speakers that promise high-quality sound without the complexity of a traditional hi-fi system. The Era 300 is its most ambitious speaker yet, <strong>using spatial audio technology to create sound that moves around you</strong> rather than just blasting from one direction.</p>
<p>Amazon just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5858/">dropped it to an all-time low of $379 for Black Friday, down from its usual $479 price tag</a>. You get six strategically positioned drivers that support Dolby Atmos Music and create <strong>wall-to-wall and floor-to-ceiling sound projection</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5858/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Six Drivers That Create Dimensional Sound</h2>
<p>Placement of Era 300 drivers on the front, sides and top projects sound in multiple directions at once. This configuration serves as the sonic environment Dolby Atmos content needs to operate. Instruments and vocals are placed in locations around your listening space. You hear guitar riffs coming from your left, vocals centered in front, and ambient effects floating overhead.</p>
<p>Custom waveguides tailor the sound dispersion of each driver to make sure you get audio coming from the correct right, left, forward, and above positions. The waveguides serve as acoustic lenses, focusing sound with directional control. You get a wide stereo soundstage that immerses the whole room, instead of a narrow sweet spot where everything sounds good. You can walk around the room without killing the effect, unlike what happens with traditional stereo speakers that only sound right when you’re seated perfectly centered.</p>



<p><strong>Dolby Atmos Music leverages these spatial capabilities</strong> when you stream compatible content from services like Apple Music and Amazon Music. Artists and producers mix Atmos tracks with height and surround channels, placing different elements in a three-dimensional sound field. Listening to Atmos mixes reveals details and separations you never noticed in stereo versions. Drum fills circle around you, backup vocals float distinct from lead vocals, and instrumental layers occupy their own space rather than competing for attention.</p>
<p><strong>Wi-Fi streaming provides stable, high-quality audio</strong> from all major music services, including Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, Tidal, and dozens more. The Sonos app controls everything: You can browse catalogs, create queues, and manage multiple speakers throughout your home. Bluetooth pairing adds flexibility for devices or services that work better with direct connections. The Sonos Line-In Adapter lets you connect turntables or other audio sources, bringing analog gear into your wireless system.</p>



<p>Regular software updates mean that features and integrations are added over time and keep the speaker current as the streaming landscape evolves. Sonos has a great track record of supporting older products with updates years after you’ve bought them. Updates happen automatically in the background without any need for manual intervention or compatibility concerns.</p>
<p>The speaker <strong>works as a standalone device or incorporates with bigger Sonos systems</strong> across several rooms. You can group speakers together for synchronized music playback throughout your home or control each independently to have different audio in every space. The system scales from a single speaker up to whole-home audio, with no complicated wiring or technical expertise.</p>
<p>At $379, this spatial audio speaker delivers Dolby Atmos Music and multi-directional sound for $100 off its usual price. You’re getting Sonos build quality and future software support at a price that makes experimenting with spatial audio reasonable.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-selling-30w-power-bank-for-pocket-change-10000mah-battery-pack-now-costs-almost-free-2000646730</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-selling-30w-power-bank-for-pocket-change-10-000mah-battery-pack-now-costs-almost-free.1362391/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cheap power banks die after a few months or charge so slowly you’re still stuck glued to walls for several hours. The Anker <em>Zolo</em> power bank provides<strong> legitimate 30W fast charging to rival wall outlets</strong>, yet still brings the same durability Anker has built a name on. Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5857/"> just dropped it to an all-time low of $19 for Black Friday, down from the usual $25</a>.</p>
<p>You get here <strong>10,000mAh capacity good for two full iPhone charges</strong>, a baked-in USB-C cable tested for 10,000 bends and bidirectional charging that tops up the power bank itself in reasonable time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5857/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>30W Charging That Matches Your Wall Charger</h2>
<p>The <strong>output of 30W gives double the charging speed of the conventional power banks</strong>-5V/3A-that crawl at 15W. Your iPhone 16 Pro Max hits 50% in just 27 minutes, matching what you’d get from plugging into a wall outlet with Apple’s fast charger. Conventional power banks take more than an hour to reach the same charge level, which makes using them an exercise in frustration for a quick top-up between meetings or during short breaks.</p>
<p>The<strong> 10,000mAh capacity will yield nearly two full charges for an iPhone 17</strong>, 1.94 charges for a Samsung Galaxy S25, and two full charges for an iPhone 14 Pro before recharging the power bank. You should be able to make it through long days of traveling, outdoor activities, or power outages without feeling anxious that your phone is going to die on you. The capacity also delivers about 10 full charges for the AirPods Pro 3 and keeps your earbuds powered for weeks of commutes.</p>



<p>Eliminate the frustration of forgetting charging cables at home or digging through bags to find them <strong>with the 5.4-inch-long built-in USB-C cable</strong>. It’s attached to the power bank and is ready whenever you need it. <strong>Anker tested this cable through 10,000 bend cycles</strong> and they ensure the cable survives wrapping, twisting, or stuffing into a pocket thousands of times.</p>
<p><strong>Bidirectional 30W charging</strong> means the power bank recharges quickly through the same USB-C port it uses to charge your devices. The 20W input fills the battery much faster than older power banks that take six hours to recharge from empty. You can top up the power bank during lunch breaks or short charging windows rather than leaving it plugged in overnight. The convenience of fast recharging makes the power bank practical for daily use rather than something you charge once weekly.</p>
<p>The<strong> compact 4.32 x 2.58 x 0.98-inch dimensions</strong> slip easily into pockets, purses, or laptop bags without creating noticeable bulk. The power bank weighs less than your phone, making it comfortable to carry on any commute or travel.</p>



<p><strong>Additional USB-C and USB-A ports</strong> allow you to charge multiple devices at the same time using your own cables. The USB-A port remains compatible with older devices and accessories that haven’t transitioned over to USB-C. You can also charge your phone via the built-in cable while powering earbuds or a smartwatch through the extra ports. This multi-device capability proves useful when traveling with a lot of gadgets.</p>
<p>Anker backs the power bank <strong>with an 18-month warranty</strong> to cover defects and performance issues. The company’s customer service responds rapidly to problems, normally replacing faulty units with minimal hassle. This value-added support comes into play well beyond the price paid, since you are covered when problems crop up.</p>
<p>At $19, this 10,000mAh power bank offers 30W fast charging with a rugged built-in cable for well below the competition, which usually carries worse specs at higher prices.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Mini PCs solve the desktop dilemma where full-sized towers waste space and energy while delivering more power than most people actually need. The <em>Kamrui GK3Plus</em> puts a complete Windows computer inside a 5.1-inch cube that fits behind monitors or tucks into entertainment centers.</p>
<p>Amazon just dropped it to $189, and with the<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/"> exclusive Prime promotion code 47DA9QPV66FE, you save an additional 10% off that price to bring the final cost down to $170 instead of the usual $229</a>. For this price, you get a <strong>12th Gen Intel N95 processor, 16GB of RAM, 512GB SSD storage, and triple-display support with 4K output</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3768/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Delivers Real Performance</h2>
<p>The Alder Lake N95 processor runs at a base frequency of 1.7GHz, <strong>and turboes up to 3.4GHz when needed</strong>. This will smoothly handle everyday computing tasks. The quad-core chip with 6MB L3 cache outperforms the older N5105 and N5095 processors by about 35% in CPU tasks and about 78% in GPU performance. You can just go ahead and browse dozens of browser tabs, edit documents, manage spreadsheets, and stream video without any slowdowns.</p>
<p>The 16GB DDR4 RAM keeps multiple applications running simultaneously without forcing your computer to swap data to slower storage. You can have Chrome open with 30 tabs running, Microsoft Office applications running in the background, stream music and have video calls going on with no memory bottlenecks. The generous RAM capacity future-proofs the system as software continues demanding more memory.</p>



<p>The 512GB M.2 SSD offers fast boot time and application loading and makes the entire system seem responsive. Windows boots in seconds, applications launch almost instantly, and file transfers are quick. The SSD includes ample room for operating system, applications, and personal files without the need for constant storage management.</p>
<p><strong>Triple-display support via two HDMI and one VGA port</strong> lets you connect three monitors simultaneously for massive workspace. The HDMI outputs support 4K at 60Hz, which means text and color on modern displays come out sharp. You can dedicate one screen to email and messaging, another to your main work, and a third to reference materials or monitoring dashboards. The VGA port keeps compatibility with older monitors and projectors that haven’t transitioned to HDMI.</p>
<p><strong>VESA mounting brackets</strong> let you attach the mini PC directly to the back of your monitor, creating an all-in-one computer setup that saves desk space. The compact 5.1 x 5.1 x 1.96-inch dimensions disappear behind displays, keeping your workspace clean and cable management simple. This small form factor fits perfectly in crowded workstations, home theaters behind TVs, digital signage installations, or anywhere space is limited.</p>



<p><strong>Gigabit Ethernet</strong> provides stable wired network connections for consistent speeds and low latency. Dual-band Wi-Fi features both 2.4GHz and 5GHz networks for wireless flexibility where Ethernet isn’t practical. <strong>Bluetooth 4.2 connects wireless keyboards, mice, speakers, and headphones</strong> without dongle clutter. Several USB ports handle peripherals, external drives and accessories simultaneously.</p>
<p>The <strong>cooling fan keeps the processor at optimal temperatures</strong> during sustained workloads and cools quietly during normal operation, only spinning up when performing more computationally intensive tasks. The cooling system keeps thermal throttling at bay, which would slow performance with jobs such as video encoding, code compilation, or running multiple demanding applications.</p>
<p>At $170 after stacking discounts, this mini PC offers modern Intel performance, 16GB of RAM, and triple 4K display support for a lot less than budget laptops with far worse specifications. You’re getting a complete desktop replacement that handles work, entertainment, and even creativity without the bulk or cost of traditional towers.</p>
