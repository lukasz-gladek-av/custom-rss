              <p>Halloween is a great time to catch up on some Wizarding World magic, or even better, bring your favorite moments home. Lego has quite a few Harry Potter sets for the fans out there, and right now, you can pick one up for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4867/">The Harry Potter Hagrid’s Hut: An Unexpected Visit set is currently going for just $47 on Amazon, after a steep 37% off its regular price of $75</a>. This is the lowest we have seen this set drop to in a long while, but the deal is going to wrap up soon. Whether you’re treating yourself to some weekend fun or introducing your kids to the classics, now’s the time to jump in.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4867/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Build Both the Insides and Outdoors</h2>
<p>This set gets you a total of 896 pieces, and it’s designed for children ages 8 and up. You will build Hagrid’s cozy hut, plus the dog house. The hut itself opens up and has a removable roof. The insides have Hagrid’s foldout chair, an umbrella stand, and even a dragon egg. There are also two collectible Hogwarts portrait tiles, which are randomly selected from a set of 14. You can display these inside Hagrid’s hut, or add them to your collection if you’re building one.</p>
<p>Mini figures include Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Draco Malfoy, and Hagrid, along with Norbert the dragon and Hagrid’s Dog Fang. You can recreate multiple scenes; maybe have Hagrid relax on his chair inside, while the curious kids look for trouble, or have them all outside preparing to fight the unknown.</p>



<p>The set comes with a detailed instruction book that takes you through each step one by one. If that sounds too complicated, you can also download the Lego app on your phone for 3D instructions. You can also track your progress through the app to get started right where you left off.</p>
<p>Altogether, this set is a great option if you want to keep some of your favorite Harry Potter memories close. It’s not just fun to build, but also a little nostalgic, especially for those who grew up watching the movies. The mini figure selection is impressive; you’re getting most of the key characters. You could treat yourself to it, or gift it to a fellow fan this Halloween! Just be sure to grab the set fast, as we don’t expect this offer to last long. It could wrap up anytime now.</p>

              <p>There are times buying in bulk is a super smart move, and then there are times when you wonder if filling your basement with 600 buckets of survivalist food was really worth the money. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">This Amazon deal, thankfully, is one of the super smart moves, since it’s offering you a 4-pack of Apple AirTags for just $65</a>, just half a buck more than the all-time low price for a 4-pack. The math says that nets out to $16.25 per tracker tag, while the price of an individual AirTag at Amazon is $25 even while it’s also on sale.</p>
<p>Considering just how many uses there are for AirTags, buying just one would be a little odd to begin with. Even if you travel with just one carry-on bag, your backpack, purse, or wallet would benefit from an AirTag as well. And there are so many third-party AirTag holders available now that you can track anything from your car keys to your cat. (No, really,&nbsp;<em>your cat</em>.) Finding uses for four AirTags is a cinch.</p>

<h2>Simply the Best</h2>
<p>If you’re an iPhone or iPad user, you absolutely cannot beat the AirTag for keeping track of your stuff. With one-tap setup, the AirTag goes from unboxing to fully running and linked to as many as five users in minutes. The disc shape and compact size mean you can put it basically anywhere, either with one of those specially designed keychains, wallets, or other holders, or just loose if you’re placing it in a suitcase or backpack.</p>
<p>When it’s time to call upon the AirTag to locate a lost item, it gets the job done whether the missing object is wedged between the couch cushions mere inches away from you, or if it’s thousands of miles away. In close range, you can use the Find My app to have the tag play a sound for you to locate, or use the app to lead you to the AirTag with accurate measurements down to the foot. At long range, the millions-strong Find My network can locate your AirTag and show its current location, even if it’s on the other side of the world.</p>



<h2>Safety All Around</h2>
<p>Not only is the ability to quickly locate a missing item a good safety feature, there’s also the fact that even the Find My network is deployed to help find your missing item, it’s done with complete anonymity. The whole network is encrypted for privacy, and the AirTags themselves never store location data or history.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">This Amazon deal on a 4-pack of Apple AirTags for just $65 comes at a great time</a>, probably just as you’re thinking about or actively planning your holiday travel. It’s a great price and a small investment for the ability to track not only your own stuff, but also to help keep tabs on the family’s bags as you brave the holiday crowds.</p>
