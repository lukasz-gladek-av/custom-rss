              <p>Over the weekend, Ubisoft’s&nbsp;<em>Rainbow 6 Siege </em>suffered a major hack that saw players flooded with billions of dollars worth of in-game credits. As a result, Ubisoft pulled the game and its marketplace offline. Only in the last few hours has it begun allowing players back in.</p> <p>Ubisoft posted to <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2004917731829948808"><em>Rainbow 6</em>‘s official X account</a> on December 27 that it was “aware of an incident” and “working on a resolution.” A couple of hours later another update added, “<span>Siege and the Marketplace have been intentionally shut down while the team focuses on resolving the issue.”</span></p>

 <p>The incident was an apparent attack on <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/status">the&nbsp;<em>R6</em> servers</a> that saw not only billions of in-game money distributed among players, but also super-rare weapon skins landing in some people’s lockers, Renown being handed out like candy, and Alpha Packs showing up in inventories as well. At the same time, some players reported having their in-game finances entirely wiped out.</p>

 <p>Unfortunately, there followed an ominous five hours of silence from the Ubisoft team, during which all manner of rumors spread among the game’s community, including that the attack was a cover for stealing all of Ubisoft’s source code (there is no evidence for this), and that anyone who spent the vast amounts of new money they now found in their account would be banned.</p>

 <p>The latter rumor became extremely prevalent across social media and Reddit largely because before the shutdown, an in-game ban ticker had been spamming announcements across players’ screens for huge numbers of bans! When Ubisoft finally updated its X account, it was to make clear this was not true.</p>

 <p>“Nobody will be banned for spending credits received,” said the post, noting “any messages seen were not triggered by us.” But for those thinking Christmas had happened all over again added, “a rollback of all transactions that occurred since 11 AM (UTC time) is underway.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">➡️ Nobody will be banned for spending credits received. A rollback of all transactions that occurred since 11 AM (UTC time) is underway.</p> <p>➡️ The ban ticker was turned off in a past update. Any messages seen were not triggered by us.</p> <p>➡️ An official R6 ShieldGuard ban wave did… <a href="https://t.co/zbPYDJQa3O">https://t.co/zbPYDJQa3O</a></p> <p>— Rainbow Six Siege X (@Rainbow6Game) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2005018314431447283?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>With the game offline, Ubisoft again went very quiet, this time for 21 hours. (Social media teams: please don’t do this! Even if you have no news, post to say so! Reassure people it’s being worked on. Yes, you’re all in a crazed panic, but someone can write a sentence on X and stave off a <em>vast</em> amount of misinformation and player distress. Have you never had a flight delayed?) Sunday at lunchtime, <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2005329908105359712">a post appeared</a> explaining that<em> Rainbow Six Siege</em> was being rolled back to its pre-hack state followed by “extensive quality control tests” to ensure “the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes.” The update continued, seemingly addressing nearly a day’s panic from the <em>R6</em> community,</p>

 <blockquote><p>“<span>The team is focused on getting players back into the game as quickly as possible. Please know that this matter is being handled with extreme care and therefore, timing cannot be guaranteed. We will provide another update as soon as we know more. Thank you all for your patience and understanding as we continue to tackle this.”</span></p></blockquote> <p>Seven hours later, the tests were complete, and a soft launch began, allowing a few players back in to see if anything exploded. Then by last night, <em>Rainbow 6 </em>was re-opened to everyone, with the game’s state rolled back to early Saturday morning. All purchases made, whether legitimate or with the unexpected pirate bounty, were undone, and freebies handed out were removed from accounts. It was also noted that “<span>A small percentage of players may temporarily lose access to some owned items. Investigations and corrections will continue over the next two weeks.”</span></p>   <p>The Marketplace, however, remains offline “as further investigations continue.”</p> <p>This isn’t the first time&nbsp;<em>Rainbow 6 Siege</em> has taken a big hit in 2025. Back in June, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/earnings/ubisoft-sales-miss-forecasts-as-rainbow-six-siege-glitch-takes-toll-fd2a6519">another glitch involving prepaid cards</a> that saw in-game money inflated cost Ubisoft significant losses, and this holiday attack could do much the same.</p>

 <p>It was, given the scale of the attack, an impressively swift repair, all done and dusted within 48 hours. The only issue, as appears to always be the case in such incidents, was a lack of regular communication with players to quash rumors and disinformation. It does, of course, raise significant questions over the security surrounding&nbsp;<em>R6 Siege X</em>, given that this was possible in the first place. There has been no announcement either way about whether player account information was seen or stolen, but people with accounts might want to change their passwords just in case. There has also been no information about what actually allowed the attack, and whether it can happen again.</p>

<h2>Comfortable, stylish headphones with fantastic audio</h2>
<p>Immediately upon trying on the Beats Solo 4, you’ll recognize how comfortable they feel due to their lightweight design and soft padded ear cups.

The Bass is deep and punches, the Midrange is clear and defined and the Treble remains bright and crisp even when turned up high.

<p>The Beats Solo 4’s battery life is also quite good for wireless on-ear headphones and should give you plenty of time to listen to your favorite content for hours before needing a charge.

They give you reliable connectivity if you’re on the iOS ecosystem, they fit well, and they’re comfortable to wear for long periods of time. If it matters to you, they’re also very stylish. Grab a pair while you still can now that the holidays are drawing to a close.</p>
