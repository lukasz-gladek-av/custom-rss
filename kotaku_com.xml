              <p>The next <em>Fire Emblem</em> is called <i>Fire Emblem: Fortune’s</i> <em>Weave</em>, it arrives on Switch 2 in 2026, and it’s taking fans back to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-the-kotaku-review-1836675912">world of </a><i><a href="https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-the-kotaku-review-1836675912">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a>.&nbsp;</i>The strategy RPG’s reveal trailer showed students embarking on a bloody new classroom: a Roman Empire-style Colosseum.</p> <p>While there’s no official mention of <em>Three House</em>s in <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-september-2025-switch-2-mario-yoshi-pokemon-2000625264">today’s Nintendo Direct announcement</a>, house crest stones from the 2019 tactics game for the original Switch are clearly visible on some of the weapons in the reveal, suggesting <i>Fortune’s</i><em> Weave</em> will be another game set in that world. Otherwise we don’t get a whole lot of detail about the upcoming game beyond the idea that teams will be competing in Colosseum-style games while also battling other threats outside the city walls. A ruler called the “Divine Sovereign” promises to grant the wish of whoever wins the tournament.</p> <p>Here’s our first look:</p>  <p>Yes, <em>Fire Emblem</em> is back, with characters as cool and grid-based combat UI as ugly as ever. The trailer also ends with a surprise: Sothis sitting on a throne. The mysterious green-haired girl from<em> Three Houses</em> had the ability to manipulate time, and appeared in both younger and older forms. That leaves it to fans to speculate as to whether <em>Fortunte’s Weave</em> will act as a sequel or prequel to the original.</p>

 <p>Arriving just three years <a href="https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-games-ranked-three-houses-engage-awakening-1850234583">after <em>Fire Emblem Engage</em></a>, it perhaps shouldn’t be too surprising that Intelligent Systems’ next entry in the long-running tactics franchise doesn’t look like a complete graphical overhaul. The cinematic animations, character art, and cutscenes all look excellent for the series’ Switch 2 debut, though I’m hungrier for a deeper reworking of the isometric battle views fans spend most of their time looking at while actually playing the game.</p> <p>Still, it’s clear Intelligent Systems is still holding a lot back about this newest entry. Given all of the cool character interactions and cozy-sim systems in <em>Three Houses</em>, I’m excited to see how those aspects of the game evolve in <em>Fortunte’s Weave</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The weather is cooling down. The leaves will be changing soon. And football season has officially begun. Any true fan it’s going to have some memorabilia of their favorite team. Most of them just sit there for display, but not this. <strong>Amazon’s Echo Dot now comes bundled with miniature NFL helmets.</strong> There are 32 different options, one for each NFL team in these limited-edition bundles. And then beyond that, you have your choice of color for the Echo dot itself, coming in either charcoal, glacier white, or deep sea blue.</p>
<p>Amazon currently has a sale going on for the NFL Echo Dot bundle, but not for every team. Between each helmet and Echo Dot color, I’ve taken on the tedious task of clicking on all 96 combinations to confirm which are on sale and which are still full price. After going through the full league, I can confirm only one set is on sale—the Green Bay Packers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4087/">All three color options for the Wisconsin team are $25 off, bringing the price down to just $85.</a> Cheeseheads get to live large this week. Sorry all other NFL fans in the country, but you’ll be paying full price for your team’s limited-edition NFL Echo Dot bundle.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4087/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Vibrant Sound, Small Package</h2>
<p>Why even get an Echo Dot in the first place? Well this smart speaker, despite it’s small stature, is capable of producing powerful sound with a rich and deep bass. It’s got a front-firing 1.73-inch speaker which pumps out room-filling audio.</p>
<p>Streaming from you Echo Dot, be it music, podcasts, or audiobooks, comes through with clear vocals. It uses lossless HD audio from a handful for streaming services, Amazon Music HD included. Beyond Amazon’s own stuff, the Echo Dot can play from Apple Music, Spotify, SiriusXM, and more. Control the volume or start and stop the track with simple voice commands.</p>



<p>Not just a speaker, the Echo Dot is first and foremost a smart home hub. You can control other smart products in your home by just asking Alexa. Use it to adjust settings on your TV. Change the lights from off to on or dim them without getting up from the couch. You can set cooking times, ask questions, create calendar events and so much more. You can even connect with family and friends who also have an Echo device or even just the Alexa app on their phone. Use multiple Echos to communicate between rooms of your house if you so please.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4087/">Come grab the NFL Echo Dot bundle (exclusively the Green Bay Packers edition) for the reduced price of $85.</a></p>

              <p>Today, Nintendo treated us to a lovely September Direct, kicking things off with a focus on the 40th anniversary of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>&nbsp;Where does the time go? Naturally, we saw some&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> games expected to arrive on our Switch 2s and got our first glimpse of next year’s big-screen outing for the Bros. But there was also so, so much more.</p> <p>If you weren’t up at the crack of dawn to watch it yourself, allow us to give you the rundown. Let’s get to it.</p> <hr> <h2><em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em></h2>  <p>Oh hey, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-spring-2026-2000625274">there’s a new&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>movie on the way</a>. We got the briefest of looks today at&nbsp;<em>The </em><em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie.&nbsp;</em>There wasn’t a whole lot shown or revealed besides the title and a quick camera sweep through the colorful world of Mario and the announcement that several cast members would be returning including, ugh, Chris Pratt.</p>

 <hr> <h2><em>Super Mario Galaxy&nbsp;</em>&amp;&nbsp;<em>Galaxy 2</em> Arrive On Switch</h2>  <p>If you were hungry for some Wii-era nostalgia, or just <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-2-switch-remaster-release-date-2000625275">missed out on the&nbsp;<em>Galaxy</em> games</a> of the era, Nintendo has good news you for you as it showed off the return of these two beloved titles and some new amiibos based on these adventures.</p> <p><strong><em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> &amp;&nbsp;<em>Galaxy 2&nbsp;</em>land on Switch on October 2.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><em>Mario Tennis Fever</em></h2>  <p>Mario and tennis go back a long way, and some of his outings on the court have been pretty great. Today we got a look at <em>Mario Tennis Fever </em>which includes not just a <em>Mario</em>-ified tennis experience as you might expect, but also an adventure mode that tasks the cast with surviving a tennis-themed adventure as babies.</p>

 <p><strong><em>Mario Tennis Fever </em>arrives on Switch 2 on February 12, 2026.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> Switch 2 Edition</h2>  <p><em>Wonder</em>‘s wonderfully surreal experience is coming to Switch 2 via a new edition. There’s a ton of new content coming to this version as well when it arrives next year. And Nintendo has produced some physical talking flowers which, um, will spontaneously talk on their own. Fascinating.</p> <p><strong><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> Switch 2 edition arrives in Spring 2026.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em></h2>  <p>Can Yoshi read? Turns out he can! <a href="https://kotaku.com/yosh-mysterious-book-yoshi-island-nintendo-direct-september-switch-2-2000625273">In <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em></a>, Yoshi’s gonna have to piece together the mysteries of a strange book that’s arrived. But what’s particularly cool about this game, aside from its interesting environmental puzzles, is its quasi-stop-motion-animation style that looks really nice.</p>

 <p><strong><em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em> arrives on Switch 2 in Spring 2026.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><em>Storm Lancers</em></h2>  <p>Played solo or in couch co-op, this side-scrolling platformer is coming to the original Switch.</p> <p><strong><em>Storm Lancers&nbsp;</em>arrives on the original Switch today.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><em>Dinkum</em></h2>  <p>Oh hey! It’s a survival sim! You know the drill, gather stuff, watch out for—holy shit—sharks! Okay, I’m actually really into the blocky animal designs here. I think I’ll spend more time with them than the actual people.</p>

 <p><strong><em>Dinkum</em> launches on the original Switch on November 5, 2025.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><em>Popucom</em></h2>  <p>This multiplayer-only, colorful third-person shooter puzzler looks like a neat time with friends. Hopefully you have friends?</p> <p><strong><em>Popucom</em> arrives on the original Switch this holiday season.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em></h2>  <p>This weird thing. I don’t say that disparagingly. Today’s Direct showed off <em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</em>‘s character creation and the various activities you can engage in across the island. These voices will end up in your Lynchian nightmares.</p>

 <p><strong>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream launches in Spring 2026 for the original Switch.</strong></p> <hr> <h2>Partner Showcase 1</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000625365" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625365"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625365">© Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Following the OG Switch games, Nintendo showed off the following games, some of which we have seen before, but in case you wanted a quick rundown of the release dates, here ya go:</p> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BkfiiLG4e0M"><em>Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</em></a>, arriving on Switch/Switch 2 digitally on October 30, 2025 and physically on December 12, 2025</strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z4Adz7SlvT4"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em></a>, arriving on Switch 2 on January 22, 2026</strong></li> <li><strong><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ex2cdvYWB7o">Lynked Banner of the Spark</a>, </em>arriving on Switch/Switch 2 later today</strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-release-date-1-0-patch-switch-2-pc-early-access-2000625272"><em>Hades II</em>, arriving on Switch/Switch 2 on September 25, 2025</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SJWif3ijbVI"><em>Kirby Air Riders </em></a>(with new Amiibos), arriving on Switch 2 on November 20, 2025</strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCPm1ndruFc&amp;pp=0gcJCckJAYcqIYzv"><em>Hyrule Warriors Age of Imprisonment</em></a>, arriving on Switch 2 on November 6, 2025</strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzPYFvHzx6Q"><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em></a>, arriving on Switch/Switch 2 February 5, 2026</strong></li> </ul> <hr> <h2><em>Nintendo Today</em> app</h2>  <p>Nintendo’s exclusive Nintendo news app is getting a&nbsp;<em>Kirby</em> theme.

In <em>Pokémon Pokopia</em>, you’ll play as a Ditto disguised as a human and, hopefully, build a paradise for the poor little critters that those darn “trainers” keep abducting to force into battle. See? They don’t <em>need</em> human owners.</p>

 <p><strong><em>Pokémon Pokopia </em>arrives on Switch 2 in 2026.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></h2>  <p>Don’t worry, if you need to exert your will over creatures we can clearly see are capable of independent, sovereign existence, <em>Pokémon</em><em>&nbsp;Legends: Z-A</em> is on the way for you to get your battles on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today was the first big <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-september-2025-switch-2-mario-yoshi-pokemon-2000625264">Nintendo Direct</a> to happen since the company <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-review-best-things-list-hate-love-nintendo-1851783873">launched the Switch 2 earlier this year</a>. 2025 is also the 40th anniversary of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> So I was excited that the pre-recorded event started with a whole section dedicated to Mario. And then I was very sad.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-odyssey-the-kotaku-review-1819856086"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> launched all the way back in 2017</a> as a very early Switch game. And it was great. A truly wonderful 3D platformer. There wasn’t a more perfect time than today for Nintendo to announce the next mainline 3D <em>Mario</em> game. But that didn’t happen.</p> <p>Instead, Mario’s dad, Shigeru Miyamoto, came out and talked about a marathon, some ticket designs, a theme park, a lightshow, an art museum, and then revealed the first look at the new <em>Mario</em> movie. I’d be fine with all that, except after showing off <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie,</em> Miyamoto said this:</p>

 <blockquote><p><a href="https://youtu.be/tpso9KkjylY?t=2039">“The movie will be the main event of the Super Mario Bros. 40th Anniversary event.”&nbsp;</a></p></blockquote> <p>Oh… well, uh, I guess that’s one way to celebrate video gaming’s most iconic character. And don’t worry, Chris Pratt is back to voice him.</p> <p>The rest of the section dedicated to Mario’s 40th Anniversary was a bit better. <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-2-switch-remaster-release-date-2000625275">Super Mario Galaxy 1+2</a></em> are coming to Switch and Switch 2. <em>Super Mario Wonder</em> is getting a Switch 2 upgrade and new co-op modes. And <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em> was revealed.</p> <p>But then, Nintendo had one more announcement. Finally, it was time to end this section all about Mario’s big milestone with the thing we all wanted. And then Nintendo announced… a (very cute-looking) Yoshi game.</p>

 <p>Welp, I guess no 3D <em>Mario</em> game is coming anytime soon. That’s a shame. And while I understand that<a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-dlc-roguelike-mode-out-today-switch-2-direct-2000625314"><em> Donkey Kong Bananza</em> likely is the reason,</a> and that game is awesome and I love it, I can’t help but feel like Mario’s 40th anniversary event was a dud.</p> <p>Call the police. Call the Mushroom Kingdom’s law enforcement agency. Put out a missing person report. Mario is missing folks, for real this time, lost in the ever-expanding ambitions of Nintendo, a company once dedicated to games, that now has its fingers in so many other things.</p>
