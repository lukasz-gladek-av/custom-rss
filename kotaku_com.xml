              <p>Gamers, is there anything worse than having to delete a game just to make space for a new one? There isn’t and thankfully, you don’t have to deal with such problems. Game file sizes are growing, which calls for a storage solution that’s not just spacious, but also fast. The Seagate storage expansion card (1TB) offers all that and more, and you can now grab it without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3767/">It’s currently sitting at $130 on Amazon, which is 19% off its regular price</a>. We know it’s not a massive drop, but considering how it doesn’t go on sale that often, it’s definitely worth grabbing. The only catch is that the discount might not be around for long, so it’s best to grab it quick.</p>

<h2>Fast Load Times, No Annoying Lags</h2>
<p>This card is designed in partnership with Xbox, so you won’t run into any frustrating compatibility issues. It also uses the same Xbox Velocity Architecture, meaning every title runs exactly as it would from internal storage. Expect faster load times, smooth gameplay, and an overall immersive environment without any slowdowns. Whether you’re playing an Original Xbox game or experimenting with the latest Series X|S release, this card handles it all. Quick Resume support means you can switch between games from both the internal SSD or the expansion card in literal seconds, and pick right where you left off.</p>



<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3767/">This version gets you 1TB of storage, which is more than enough to house all your favorite titles and then some.</a> This capacity should be enough for most gamers out there, but if you need more, Seagate also offers 2TB and 4TB options. Of course, these are priced a bit higher but the good news is that both are discounted right now too, with the 2TB version at $220 and the 4TB at $430.</p>
<p>Setting things up and getting started is fairly simple. There are no complicated procedures to follow, and you should be ready to play in just a few minutes. Seagate also includes <strong>a 3-year limited warranty</strong> with your purchase, so you will have that extra peace of mind if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>Altogether, if you are looking to bid annoying storage problems goodbye and play without feeling limited, this Seagate storage card can be a great investment. It’s built in partnership with Xbox, and offers plenty of space to store all your favorites. The deal might not be around for long, so grab it soon.</p>
