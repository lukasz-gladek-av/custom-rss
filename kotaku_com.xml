              <p><i><span>2XKO</span></i><span>, Riot Games’ free-to-play </span><i><span>League of Legends</span></i><span> fighting game, released on PC, PS5 and Xbox Series consoles yesterday after roughly 18 months of closed beta tests. While it’s too early to comment on the overall quality of </span><i><span>2XKO’s</span></i><span> gameplay, PlayStation 5 players aren’t too impressed with its performance.</span></p> <p><span>After roughly 18 months of closed betas and “Alpha Lab” playtests, Riot Games has finally released its beginner-friendly, free-to-play (but microtransaction-heavy) fighting game </span><i><span>2XKO </span></i><span>in full. There’s no critical consensus regarding </span><i><span>2XKO</span></i><span> yet. At launch there aren’t even <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/2xko/">any reviews of the console version</a>.&nbsp; B</span><span>ut I sunk a couple of hours into it this morning and can confirm that it’s still just as good as it was during the last closed beta.</span></p>

 <p><span>Little caveat there: I played on PC. </span><i><span>2XKO </span></i><span>has technically been available on PC in early access since October 7, 2025, but only officially launched on Xbox Series S/X and PS5 on January 20. This is relevant because, according to the numerous posts that have popped up on the r/2XKO subreddit over the past 24 hours, the PS5 version of the game has a few performance-related issues.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">2XKO on PS5 might be the roughest I’ve ever seen a fighting game launch. Extreme screen tearing in fights, lags in matches and in lobbies, horrible monetization.</p> <p>There’s a great fighting game here but it’s dying by 1000 cuts. <a href="https://t.co/w4jT0pyN5m">pic.twitter.com/w4jT0pyN5m</a></p> <p>— reyna cervantes (@Jfcdoomblade) <a href="https://twitter.com/Jfcdoomblade/status/2013843486512947644?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>As detailed in the most active PS5-related </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/2XKO/comments/1qinnhu/game_runs_like_total_ass_on_the_ps5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>thread</span></a><span> on the subreddit, titled “Game runs like total ass on the ps5,” PlayStation players have reported that they’re experiencing crashes, frequent FPS drops and, most commonly, heavy screen tearing.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I’m not having FPS drops (though I’m on PS5 Pro), but the screen tearing is horrendous,” writes user </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/2XKO/comments/1qinnhu/comment/o0t6r6l/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>trugay</span></a><span>. “It’s the worst I’ve ever seen on a console title. It makes this a fairly disappointing release. I’m enjoying the game and its mechanics, but this is really dampening the experience.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Over on Twitter, user </span><a href="https://x.com/Jfcdoomblade/status/2013843486512947644"><span>Jfcdoomblade</span></a><span> uploaded a clip of the FPS drops in action and stated that “2XKO on PS5 might be the roughest I’ve ever seen a fighting game launch.”</span></p> <p><span>Oddly enough, I was unable to find any similar complaints from Xbox Series users. In fact, the only Xbox-related </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/2XKO/comments/1qir40k/having_a_blast_on_xbox_so_fun/"><span>thread</span></a><span> I could find was from one user gushing about how much fun they’re having.</span></p> <p><span>It’s important to note here that the screen tearing issue can’t be properly replicated through recorded footage, as screen tearing occurs through the monitor used to display the image. PS5 owners have theorized that the screen tearing issue in </span><i><span>2XKO </span></i><span>may only occur when the game is played on a 120hz screen.</span></p>

 <p><span>If you’re confused as to why the same issue isn’t popping up for PC players who are using 120hz monitors, PS5 users have </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/2XKO/comments/1qinnhu/comment/o0tfyys/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>further theorized</span></a><span> that this may be due to an issue with how v-sync has been implemented on the PlayStation 5 version of </span><i><span>2XKO</span></i><span>.</span></p>

              <p>The very first design for Pokémon mascot Pikachu was a delightfully chubby little fellow. Chunkachu, as it’s lovingly known, was Mitsuhiro Arita’s original drawing for the 1996 Japanese Pokémon card, and it gave the yellow mouse a lot more to love than he has in most modern renditions. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of <em>Pokémon</em> this year, Takara Tomy is releasing a proper chungus of a plushie in that original design.</p> <p>It’s going to be a very busy year for&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em>. 2026 is the 30th anniversary of not only the release of the very first&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> games, Japan’s <em>Pocket Monsters </em><em>Red</em> and&nbsp;<em>Green</em> on February 27 of 1996, but also the very first Japanese <em>Pokémon TCG</em> cards with October 20, 1996’s 1st Starter &amp; Expansion Pack, meaning the celebrations are going to last the whole year. And that’s a very good excuse to remember how Pikachu used to look, both in the game and on the cards, before he got the Mounjaro.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000661887" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661887"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661887">© Tomy / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The new plush comes not from The Pokémon Company and isn’t available on its various Pokémon Center stores, but rather is being sold by toy giant <a href="https://takaratomymall.jp/shop/g/g8202602097181/">Takara Tomy</a>, and currently only in Japan. The extremely cuddle-able stuffed toy is 7,480 yen, or about $47, which isn’t too bad for a 40 cm tall cuddly. At the time of writing it’s sold out on Tomy’s site, though more expensive options for purchase still seem to pop up on <a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B0GG8Y6125?th=1">Amazon’s Japanese site</a>.</p> <p>Chunkachu has been celebrated across the decades in <em>Pokémon</em>, not least with the design of the monster’s <a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/vmaxclimax/46.jpg">VMAX incarnation</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.serebii.net/card/25thanniversarycollection/1.jpg">updated versions of the original artwork</a> appearing during the 25th anniversary celebrations. But for the most part, the far more slimmed-down rendition of Pikachu is the recognizable emblem of the entire franchise. And fair enough—name a beloved cartoon character that didn’t look all kinds of weirdly different in their first form than the version we got used to. Oh my dear god, original Garfield.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000661873" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661873"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661873">© Jim Davis</figcaption></figure>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Announces A Brutal New Restructuring With More Investment In Gen AI And Further Job Cuts]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869</link>
            <guid>1412194</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The French publisher behind <em>Far Cry</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> is planning <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-layoffs-division-3-massive-tencent-2000659368">even more cuts</a>, delays, and pivots as part of a brutal new restructuring. Ubisoft announced on Thursday that a company-wide reset will include a new creative structure, “rightsizing of the organization,” and more investment in things like “player-facing Generative AI.”</p> <p>The latest shifts come <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-skull-bones-delay-assassins-creed-far-cry-cuts-1849975925">amid a challenging five-year stretch</a> for Ubisoft in which big blockbusters like <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em> and <em>Far Cry 6</em> were few and far between while big bets like <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> and <em>xDefiant</em> failed to pay off. In <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf">its January 21 earnings press release</a>, the company promised a “radically new value-creation model” based around a “more gamer-centric organization.” This will include “business units with faster, decentralized decision-making and a greater ability to quickly adapt to players’ expectations” and a “rightsized and more agile organization, delivering improved structural efficiencies over time.”</p>

 <p>A management consultant company like McKinsey &amp; Company couldn’t have written it better. For those not versed in 21st century corpo-speak, that means a slow disassembly of the global AAA factory that Ubisoft spent the 2010s building up and more studio closures and layoffs. The move will also include delays of many big games and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-2000661866">cancellation of others like the<em> Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</em> remake</a> that’s been in development for years. Ubisoft says it will double down on open-world games and games-as-a-service while boosting investments in things like “player-facing Generative AI.”</p> <h2>Ubisoft fragmented into “creative houses”</h2> <p>Instead of the integrated co-development model that has led the company to churn out massive games with armies of studios from around the world contributing to them, the new model suggests a series of siloes within the company based around individual IPs and genres. The first is a Tencent-backed subsidiary called Vantage Studios that owns <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, <em>Far Cry</em>, and <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em>. The second will own <em>The Division</em>, <em>Ghost Recon</em>, and<em> Splinter Cell</em>. The third will own<em> For Honor</em>,<em> The Crew</em>, <em>Riders Republic</em>,<em> Brawlhalla</em>, and <em>Skull &amp; Bones</em>. The fourth will own <em>Anno</em>, <em>Might &amp; Magic</em>, <em>Rayman</em>,<em> Prince of Persia</em>, and <em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em>. The fifth will own<em>&nbsp;Just Dance</em>, <em>Idle Miner Tycoon</em>,<em> Ketchapp</em>, <em>Hungry Shark</em>, <em>Invincible: Guarding the Globe</em>, <em>Uno<span>,</span></em> and Hasbro-branded games like <em>Hasbro Game Night</em>.</p>

 <p>“Each Creative House will benefit from dedicated leadership with a clear creative mandate and accountability,” Ubisoft claims. “These leadership teams will include high-profile talent coming from the industry. They will be tasked with attracting and developing top-level, specialist talent, and supported by incentive schemes aligned with creative success, player engagement and long-term value creation.” Will that actually streamline things though, or just add a whole new layer of bureaucracy?</p>

 <h2>More closures, cuts, and layoffs</h2> <p>No restructuring is complete with out firings. The company cites recently announced closures of its Halifax mobile studio and Ubisoft Stockholm, as well as layoffs at Abu Dhabi, RedLynx, and Massive. This is part of an ongoing $117 million cost reduction, but the company has now also committed to an additional $234 million of cuts over the next two years.</p> <p>“We will also selectively close several studios and continue restructurings throughout the Group,” CEO Yves Guillemot confirmed. “While these decisions are difficult, they are necessary for us to build a more focused, efficient and sustainable organization over the long term.” He’s also open to selling more IP and studios if buyers are interested.</p>

 <p>But even those not getting explicitly laid off will face tough choices as Ubisoft end most remote work. “To support the effective implementation and operation of this new model, the Group also intends to return to five days per week on site for all teams, complemented by an annual allowance of working-from-home days,” the company wrote. While Ubisoft argues that it’s necessary to get its creative groove back, the policy will also likely lead to mass “quiet quitting” among those who can find a hybrid work schedule somewhere else.</p> <h2>Delays, delays, and more delays</h2> <p>This reset has basically exploded Ubisoft’s upcoming game release pipeline. Six games have been canceled outright. Outside of the <em>Sands of Time</em> remake, which was rumored to be coming early in 2026, the company ended development on five other games that didn’t meet quality standards. Those include “four unannounced titles,” of which three were “new IPs” and one was a “mobile title.” For those counting at home, that’s one game short of the total six that were canned. What’s the mystery cancelation?</p> <p>Ubisoft also delayed seven of its upcoming games “to ensure enhanced quality benchmarks are fully met and maximize long-term value creation.” The company didn’t clarify which of those are announced or unannounced, but did specify that one of the delays was an unannounced game planned for launch in the next two months, which indicates it may be the rumored remake of<em> Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em>.</p>

 <p>Other big games that remain MIA are the next <em>Ghost Recon</em>, a multiplayer game called <em>Assassin’s Creed Invictus</em>, and, of course, <em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em>.</p> <h2>More gen AI NPCs?</h2> <p>Ubisoft revealed a lot of upcoming pain to shareholders on Wednesday, like a $386 million gross margin reduction for its current fiscal year ending March 31. So it’s hard to know whether the company’s tease of more gen AI investment is just an attempt to throw them a bone, or something it’s actually serious about as an exercise in “value creation” for gamers. The company promised “accelerated investments behind player-facing Generative AI.”</p>

 <p>After failing to cash in on emerging technologies like cloud streaming and blockchain NFTs, Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/5qXdxhshJBXoanFZApdG3L/how-ubisofts-new-generative-ai-prototype-changes-the-narrative-for-npcs">promoted LLM chatbot NPCs at GDC 2024</a>. It then returned to the idea late last year with AI-powered squadmates in <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-ai-fps-temmates-genai-nfts-gameplay-snowdrop-reveal-2000646251">a tech demo that looked very Tom Clancy-ish</a>. “Games of tomorrow will listen, understand, and react to players far more than today, and our research gives a glimpse of what adaptive, generative play could add on top of proven game systems,” Ubisoft director of GenAI gameplay Xavier Manzanares <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/ubisoft-generative-ai-game-teammates-neo-npc-developers-1236588038/">told&nbsp;<em>Variety</em></a> at the time. “It’s the first time we’ve shared an experiment this early with players, but our goal is to pave the way with a strong technology layer so our creators can start imagining the value it could bring to their project and players.”</p> <p>Whether that value becomes real or stays imaginary, things seem likely to get tougher for Ubisoft before they get better.</p> <p><em>Update: 1/21/2026, 1:17 p.m. ET: Added more information, including about changing remote work policies.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mio: Memories In Orbit: The Kotaku Review]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mio-memories-in-orbit-review-metroidvania-ps5-switch-2000661850</link>
            <guid>1412137</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Mio: Memories in Orbit</span></i><span> is a reminder that games can be all killer, no filler, for better or worse. A stylish side-scrolling Metroidvania, </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>marches to a familiar beat and wraps things up well before it could potentially grow tiresome. Its world is alluringly illustrated, and its gallery of rogues and weird little robots have their charms. Despite that, I do wish there was a bit more going on in its composition. I wish it felt denser and more layered. I’d have appreciated a bit more variety in instrumentation. I wish its lyricism hooked me more. And in the absence of these things, I found I kind of missed the filler, the noise that could have been constructed around that central, thrumming beat.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The first thing one is likely to clock about </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>is how gorgeous it is. It’s </span><i><span>very </span></i><span>easy to stop and stare at the landscapes in the background of nearly every one of its scenes. The Vessel, the spaceship on which </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>takes place, recalls the hostile and beautiful alien world of </span><i><span>Scavengers Reign</span></i><span>. It’s (almost) never as trippy, but it does often feel as dangerous. One second you’ll be in a lush, vegetative, and deadly jungle with strong purple hues and the next you’ll be in an azure metropolis that appears to have frozen over. Regardless of where you are, though, </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>is a stunner to look at, and its visuals are half the reason I explored the Vessel as deeply as I could.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><em>Mio</em>‘s movement: Solid fundamentals, not enough evolution</h2> <p><span>The other reason to play </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>is because it feels really damn good. Metroidvanias emphasize exploration, but it’d be no fun to move and fight through them if the game felt sluggish and if the combat were so-so. Luckily, </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>nails the fundamentals out of the gate. It’s got all the tricks one might hope for up its sleeve: a double jump that looks more like an elegant mid-air pirouette, a hookshot used for both platforming and shooting yourself across arenas in combat, an instantaneous dodge move that feels almost as satisfying as a </span><i><span>Sekiro </span></i><span>parry, a reliably weighty (and expressively animated) combo string, and more.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>This mixture of silky-smooth movement and combat abilities most prominently figures into </span><i><span>Mio</span></i><span>‘s solid boss battles. Though none of the ones I ran into ever ran away with the show–there are plenty of hidden encounters along the game’s periphery, as well as the route to the game’s secret ending–I still had plenty of fun with each of them. Whether they were a drill-nosed mole creature burrowing into the arena or a mechanical murder doll complete with a saber and laser gun, each was stylistically distinct and demanded that I learn how to best use </span><i><span>Mio</span></i><span>‘s movement tech to navigate their numerous hazards long enough to see and capitalize on an attack window.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000661853" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661853"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661853">©Douze Dixièmes</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I did, at times, find myself wishing that some of these encounters and arenas stood apart more. While the bosses never tread the same ground aesthetically, most of the stages themselves felt pretty same-y and the fights hit a lot of the same notes. At the end of the day, most of the arenas were square rooms with a few grapple points (save for one notable exception that breaks from this rhythm of boss fights) and most of these fights were one-on-one duels. Very few of the boss fights I did see featured environmental hazards and traps that could complicate matters and present interesting new wrinkles, and I would’ve preferred more of that variation throughout.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Maybe I’m just a masochist who really likes punishing games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review-hornet-team-cherry-2000639568"><i><span>Silksong</span></i></a> <span>and its ilk, but one thing those games I love get </span><i><span>really </span></i><span>right is their variety and breadth of enemies and encounters, and that sort of spice is sadly missing from </span><i><span>Mio</span></i><span>. Considering the lengths that </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>goes to in order to feel adjacent to the </span><i><span>Souls </span></i><span>lineage–there are bonfire-like checkpoints here,</span> <span>and more than enough enigmatic worldbuilding to go around–it’s a bit of a shame it doesn’t go that step further, especially on the game’s most obvious and critical path.</span></p> <p><span>Speaking of a lack of variety, I was disappointed in how little </span><i><span>Mio</span></i><span>‘s combat ever grows. There are modifications you can make that alter certain attributes, like one upgrade that allows Mio to do a heavy attack immediately after landing a hookshot, but besides that, you never earn new techniques or weapons. There is no additional</span> <span>combo to learn by traveling off the beaten path. There is no projectile with which to occasionally pepper an enemy from afar.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Samus has missiles to complement her pea shooter. </span><i><span>Castlevania</span></i><span>‘s numerous protagonists can begin the game with a great variety of weapons, like axes, swords, or whips. Mega Man absorbs the powers of the robot masters he defeats. Juan of </span><i><span>Guacamelee </span></i><span>gains entirely new wrestling techniques and Ori regularly picks up stunning new magical powers. The Knight of </span><i><span>Hollow Knight</span></i><span> can use charge attacks as well as a highly-effective magic blast and a dive move with a massive area-of-effect, and Hornet gains new traps, tools, and crests that fundamentally alter her moveset.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>By comparison, </span><span>Mio </span><span>is stuck with their same little saber and three-attack combo for the entirety of the game. The lack of imagination here doesn’t significantly take away from the game, but I did find myself less enthused with the prospect of combat in </span><i><span>Mio</span></i><span>‘s late stretches, in large part because it had plateaued so early.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>A mystery without mystique</h2> <p><span>And while I’m speaking of aspects of the game that regrettably fall flat, I really wish </span><i><span>Mio</span></i><span>’s narrative went…anywhere. The Vessel is an ark ship meant to ferry a colony and their robots (who look a </span><i><span>lot </span></i><span>like Pascal from </span><i><span>Nier: Automata</span></i><span> and fill the ranks of the game’s cast) across the stars in search of a new world. Partway through the journey though, the Voices—AI that served as deities and guides to the robots and are named after body parts like the Spine and the Hand—cease function, allowing the Vessel and its inhabitants to fall into disrepair as the ship drifts. The great mystery of the game is figuring out what exactly happened to cause the AIs to stop and go quiet.</span></p>

 <p><span>Despite its early promise, though,</span><i><span> Mio</span></i><span>‘s writing just didn’t hook me. The game’s story is largely explained in lore tomes found through exploration and following the game’s main story path, but even these missives fail to inject the proceedings with a sense of urgency or dramatic tension. Normally, I’d fear that I just don’t get the story, but in the case of </span><i><span>Mio</span></i><span>, I do, save for whatever revelations the game’s out-of-the way “true” ending might hold. However, the morsels of story that </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>delivered never quite lived up to the mystique that it spent so long building up, and I found myself quite disappointed in the answers and resolutions afforded to the conflicts and characters by the tale’s end.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“Lo-fi beats to Metroid to.”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>developer:</p>                 <p>Douze Dixièmes</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>type of game:</p>                 <p>Metroidvania</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Arresting visual style, fluid combat and movement, really fun boss battles.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Story fails to build any momentum, lack of variety in combat.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p> PC (played on), PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch.  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date: </p>                 <p>January 20, 2026</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Rolled credits at about 17 hours, but spent about 20+ hours working towards the secret ending before moving on.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>Its characters, what little there are in settings like Metropolis and the Haven, feel like one-note bit players in the game’s grander machinations. The Voices themselves are less pronounced throughout the story than I’d hoped for. Even</span><i><span> Mio</span></i><span>‘s allies fail to leap off the page. Despite my initial efforts to see as much of the game as possible and give it the chance to change my mind, I simply could not feign any more interest in securing a more hopeful resolution to the ills of a cast that felt so amorphous and under-developed.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Suffice it to say, </span><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>doesn’t quite tick off all the boxes of what I’m looking for in a Metroidvania. It’s got mystery and intrigue enough to incentivize you to look in corners and dart around its imaginatively rendered sci-fi utopia gone awry, but not quite enough to pay off the threads it establishes early on.</span><i><span> Mio</span></i><span>’s middle action is defined by a great run of abilities that make cutting a path through the Vessel a joy in the moment, as well as bosses that pose an admirable challenge despite their humdrum layouts. But as the journey comes to a close, the sameness of its encounters and simplistic combat closes out the story on a bit of a whimper where a bang might’ve felt more appropriate.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Mio </span></i><span>is stylish and elegant to boot, but that and a decent grasp of the fundamentals are not enough to deepen my appreciation of what’s ultimately a pretty by-the-numbers Metroidvania. It’s an adherent to the form, but I rarely like the tune it sings, and don’t quite love it despite my efforts to.&nbsp;</span></p>
