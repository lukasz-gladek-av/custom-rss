              <p>Shooting guns in <em>Highguard</em> is fun and feels very good. But the most satisfying thing to do in the newly released free-to-play raid shooter doesn’t involve guns. Instead, it happens whenever I get a chance to smash some crystals using a minigame that rewards perfection in a smart way.</p> <p>In <em>Highguard</em>, which is out now on PC, PS5, and Xbox, you have the chance to visit shops during your match to buy shields, guns, ammo, upgrades, and other gear. But nothing in this world is free. Well, I guess <em>Highguard</em> is free, but whatever, my point is that you need some cash to buy this stuff. Actually, not cash but blue crystals. Bits of blue crystals, to be more precise. You get some from killing enemies and raiding or defending bases, but a fast and efficient way to get a lot of crystal shards is to mine the large deposits that litter the map. And mining these larger veins of crystal is satisfying.</p>

 <p>On PS5, you click the right stick to begin a simple timing minigame that lets you quickly smash through a big crystal deposit with a satisfying series of sounds and a big crushing blow at the end. Every time I do this perfectly, I feel good. I love it. I sometimes take a moment to break a few more crystals, even if I don’t really need to, because smashing them perfectly is such a joy. I may at one point have been caught off-guard and quickly killed by two enemy players because I was distracted while mining crystals. Awkward.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000663552" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663552"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663552">©Wlidlight / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>What really helps make this process feel good, besides the wonderful “<em>dink, dink, crash</em>” noises and timing minigame, is that when you perfectly nail it, the game gives you a reward: The next crystal you mine will break instantly. Oh, buddy, you better believe that feels good.</p>

 <p>Now, I would like to point out that I actually have to go mine for crystals during the middle of a long match so I can buy some shields, which isn’t my favorite part of <em>Highguard</em>. In fact, a lot of the economy around mining crystals and spending them likely needs to be tweaked to make it less annoying early on and less of a pain in the later part of a long round. But that doesn’t change the fact that the actual act of mining in <em>Highguard</em> makes me feel good. I love it. They should add a mode all about harvesting crystal shards and taking them back to your base, and whichever team has the most after five minutes wins. I’d play the heck out of that.</p>

              <p><span>Mega Starmie, the long-legged starfish alien(?) mega-evolved Pokémon that debuted in </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> has been a surprising breakout star since October. Many fans </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-patrick-star-jokes-2000636057"><span>couldn’t stand the thing’s goofy design</span></a><span>, but it’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-jokes-memes-videos-art-2000638556"><span>actually kind of a beast in the game</span></a><span>, so folks are coming around on the meme machine. However, after making its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-horizons-anime-mega-starmie-friede-episode-2000654235"><span>horrific anime debut</span></a><span>, Mega Starmie has now made its way to another side of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community where it has started wreaking havoc: competitive TCG play.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663535" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663535"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663535">© The Pokémon Company / Bulbapedia</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The </span><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Mega_Starmie_ex_(Nihil_Zero_21)"><span>Mega Starmie ex card</span></a><span> launched as part of the Japanese Nihil Zero booster set last week, and in just a few short days, it’s becoming a staple in competitive tournaments overseas. As </span><a href="https://www.wargamer.com/pokemon-trading-card-game/mega-starmie-ex-decks-winning"><i><span>Wargamer</span></i></a> <span>lays out, the card is consistently helping players place in Japanese tournaments thanks in no small part to its Jet Blow attack, which does a whopping 120 damage to the opponent’s active Pokémon as well as 50 damage to one on their bench. As such, Mega Starmie ex puts constant pressure on your opponents in a way that sounds kind of broken. </span></p>

 <p><span>Some are even using it alongside the </span><a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Risky_Ruins_(Mega_Evolution_127)"><span>Risky Ruins stadium card</span></a><span> which damages monsters on the bench for an additional 20 HP, so you can feasibly wipe out some benched cards pretty quickly with the right combo. Mega Starmie itself is pretty bulky, too, with 330 HP, so knock it off the field can take some time, and by then, you might already have taken too much damage.</span></p> <p><span>Mega Starmie’s off-putting design and weirdly human mannerisms give it the air of an absolute gremlin troublemaker, so I guess it makes sense that every time it shows up in a different </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game it’s a menace. The Mega Starmie ex card has three variants, including a secret illustration that makes it look like some kind of kaiju monster stomping over a city. It’s fun to see The Pokémon Company leaning into this thing’s chaos energy.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguards-small-team-sizes-are-a-problem-2000663511</link>
            <guid>1417645</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136"><em>Highguard</em></a> is out now after a really weird period of time in which it seemed like everyone had an opinion on a game that we’d only seen two minutes of <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">via a Game Awards finale trailer</a>. Anyway, it’s finally here, and I’ve played about six hours of the new free-to-play FPS so far. While I’m not an expert, I have put enough time in solo and with friends to come to one conclusion: 3 players versus 3 players is a problem.</p> <p>How a match in <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-launch-pc-ps5-free-to-play-servers-is-it-good-titanfall-apex-2000663135"><em>Highguard</em></a> works is that two teams of three spend a bit of time setting up defenses at a base, then everyone rushes out into a big map to find loot, and eventually they all race to a large sword that forms somewhere and which can be used by one team to break into the other’s big base. Then a raid happens, with the attacking team trying to blow up key locations like in a match of <em>Counter-Strike</em> with limited respawns, while the defenders try to take them out and stop the assault. Eventually, one team will win, and the other will lose. These matches can be tense and come down to one awesome play by one player. And this is a problem in a 3v3 format.</p>

  <p>I think a key aspect of online competitive multiplayer games that doesn’t get talked about much is that you need enough players to let people “blame” someone else.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em>,</a> for example, is really good at providing you and your friends plenty of other people you can blame for losses or slow victories. And even <em>Call of Duty</em>, which has smaller lobbies, still has more than 3v3 in most modes, which lets less skilled players feel less pressure to perform perfectly. “It’s okay, there are a few other people. I’m not ruining the match!” And as someone who is good at some shooters and bad at others, being able to blame others or not feel like I’m the sole reason we lost is very helpful.</p>

 <p><em>Highguard’</em>s 3v3 format and focus on tactical teamwork means there’s nowhere for people who are learning or less-skilled players to hide. I had a match in which a teammate I’d been randomly matched with seemed to be still getting the hang of the game, which makes sense as it just launched, but they failed in some team fights and screwed up a key 1v1 battle, and it led to us losing. The other rando I was with wasn’t kind on the mic. Will that less-skilled player want to come back?</p>

 <p>3v3 also just feels like too few people for <em>Highguard’s</em> massive maps. The moment one person splits off, they are likely to run into two or three enemy players if they push too far, and that’s a fight they’ll likely lose. With 4v4 or 5v5, people could split up but still have at least a partner to help. It could make base defense more exciting as you could more evenly split yourselves between the bombs and make rotating less necessary, which would help when playing with no-mic randos.</p> <p>I’m not suggesting that developer Wildlight can just go in, flip a switch and instantly turn <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-already-has-over-7000-negative-reviews-on-steam-2000663220"><em>Highguard</em></a> into a 4v4 or 5v5 game. But, if the team is looking for a way to bring in more players and make it easier for casual shooter fans to enjoy what it offers, I think upping the playercount in a “casual” mode that also contains a few other tweaks could go a long way toward helping <em>Highguard</em> stick around and even grow.</p>

              <p>Valve’s attempt to have courts dismiss a legal action brought against it for allegations of overcharging and anti-competitive practices has failed, as reported by <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2g1md0l23o">the <em>BBC</em></a>. A <a href="https://www.catribunal.org.uk/judgments/16407724-vicki-shotbolt-class-representative-limited-v-valve-corporation-judgment-cpo">judge’s ruling</a> is allowing the case brought by lawyer Vicki Shotbolt to go ahead on behalf of 14 million Steam users in the UK.</p> <p>First filed in 2024, Shotbolt’s claim (with <a href="https://steamyouoweus.co.uk/about-us/">its own fancy website</a>) is an attempt to prove that Valve’s policies on Steam violate UK laws on “anti-competitive prices” and “unfair trading conditions that prevent or hinder others from competing with them.” The argument concerns Valve’s demand that games sold on Steam not be made available at a permanently lower price on rival stores, <em>and</em> that once you buy a game on Steam, the only way you can buy further content for that game—be it DLC, expansion packs or cosmetics—is also via Steam. This, Shotbolt claims, allows Valve to “hold a dominant position in the PC gaming market” and “that it may have used this position in ways that violate UK competition law.”</p>

 <p>Class action lawsuits are not a commonplace event in the UK, where the mass litigation is known as a “collective action claim,” and works on an “opt-out” basis. Basically, Shotbolt and her law firm are going to sue Valve on behalf of British Steam users unless they specifically say they don’t want in. That’s how it’s able to claim to be suing on behalf of 14 million people.</p> <p>Valve, obviously, objects to the claims, and filed to have the case thrown out. A ruling filed January 26 by the Competition Appeal Tribunal says that Valve opposed on the basis that the “PCR” (the shorthand for Shotbolt’s group) “had not put forward an adequate methodology” before venturing all manner of peculiarly specific fiddly details about “determining the effect of the alleged PPOs [Platform Parity Obligations]” and that the “class definition was inadequate” and so on. The latter was seemingly based on lots of kids using Steam, and how they couldn’t opt in or out of the action. It all seemed to amount to “They didn’t cross their Ts sufficiently,” and the tribunal was having none of that.</p>

 <p>Shotbolt’s team promised to double-check their punctuation, and that seemed to be enough to have Valve’s concerns overturned. “The PCR proposed revisions to the <a href="https://steamyouoweus.co.uk/faqs/#classDefinition">proposed class definition</a> which substantially diminished the concerns raised by Valve,” says the ruling, which appears to mean they rejigged things to ensure it was just representing over 13s…I think? “In light of that development,” says the ruling, “the Tribunal rejected Valve’s challenge in this respect.”</p>

 <p>All of that basically amounts to “Yup, this action can go ahead,” which will mightily annoy Valve. Those who don’t want to be included in the entire PC gaming population of Britain will have the option to opt out pretty soon, given <a href="https://steamyouoweus.co.uk/faqs/">the site’s FAQ</a> stated it was waiting for this very certification before offering the option. Given 99.9 percent of Steam users will never even know this action is taking place, that sounds impressively farcical.</p> <p>Should the PCR win, it’ll mean everyone in the UK is entitled to some money back, which will likely be fairly meaningless amounts to all involved except for Valve. The claim is looking for £656 million, which at the time of writing is $904 million. Given that <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-pc-sued-price-fixing-1851537419">when we first covered this story in 2024</a> that figure converted to $838 million, Valve will likely hope for a quick resolution before Trump manages to tank the dollar even further.</p>
