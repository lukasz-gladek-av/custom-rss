But we did get a sense of <em>Saros</em>’ world and stakes, with the main character mentioning endless time loops and an eclipse from which madness, and creepy enemies, both spawn. </p><p>It seems very much like a spiritual successor to 2021's GOTY roguelike contender <em>Returnal</em> but with an important difference. While that game was pretty punishing run-to-run, Saros will have “permanent resources and progression.” Every time hero Arjun Devraj (played by Rahul Kohli) respawns, he’ll have new weapons and upgrades rather than his arsenal resetting each time.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s the description:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Set on the planet Carcosa under the threat of an ominous eclipse, take on the role of Arjun Devraj, a powerful Soltari Enforcer searching for answers on a lost off-world colony.  SAROS features permanent progression systems, where every death reshapes the world while offering new upgrades to overcome challenges. With a haunting story, deep third-person action, and a grounded performance by Rahul Kohli, SAROS presents the next evolution in Housemarque’s gameplay-first experience.﻿<br></p></blockquote><p>Creative director Gregory Louden called it “the ultimate evolution of the Housemarque gameplay-first experience” and said the game will continue in the third-person action shooter tradition of its predecessor. There’s even a slight wink and a nod to Housemarque’s signature bullet hell orb patterns it loves killing players with. </p><p>When the game does arrive sometime in 2026, it will include enhancements for PS5 Pro. Considering the importance of framerate to the genre, that will probably end up being no small thing. Hopefully we get to see some actual gameplay later this year. In the meantime, you can join me in celebrating Housemarque’s 30th anniversary by giving <em>Returnal </em>a shot if you haven’t already.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
