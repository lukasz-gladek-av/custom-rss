              <p>Everyone knew <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> was a frontrunner to clinch some of the biggest categories at The Game Awards 2025, but I don’t know that anyone expected it to sweep the night and <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">set a new record for winning nine awards</a> (<em>The Last Of Us 2</em> earned seven back in 2020). Instead of resting on its laurels, Sandfall Interactive used the night to shadow-drop <em>Clair Obscur</em>‘s free mini-DLC to give fans a reason to dive back into the Belle Époque RPG.</p> <p>This content drop <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-free-update-expansion-bosses-2000633193">was teased earlier this year</a> and includes a new playable environment called “Verso’s Drafts” inspired by the character’s childhood. There’s also new late-game boss battles, more Luminas and Weapons, extra costumes, and the addition of a photo mode for players to document their dress-up sessions with. Here’s a trailer for the new area:</p>  <p>The photo mode comes with dozens of filters and the devs say they’re excited to see how players use them to capture moments from the game’s memorable cinematic scenes in completely new ways. And for anyone who hasn’t played Clair Obscure yet, it’s worth noting that the game is currently just $40. Normally $50, it’s 20 percent off on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox until December 16. It’s also still available on Game Pass.</p> <p>Here are the full patch notes for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1903340/view/491585297311596633">the free 1.5 update</a>:</p>  <ul> <li> <p>Verso’s Drafts, a new playable environment, taking the characters of Expedition 33 to a brand-new location with new enemy encounters and surprises to discover&nbsp;🙂<wbr></p> <ul> <li> <p>Located on the World Map, next to Lumière – Accessible from Act III<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Esquie’s Underwater ability is required!<wbr></p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>New text and UI game localizations into Czech, Ukrainian, Latin American Spanish, Turkish, Vietnamese, Thai, and Indonesian, bringing the total number of supported languages to 19, with more to come!</p> </li> <li> <p>New costumes for each member of the Expedition, giving even more customization options for players throughout their adventure&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>New boss battles for late-game players to overcome in the Endless Tower – They are variations of iconic bosses from the main game, designed to be even more challenging<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Added new Luminas and Weapons<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Added the “Old Key” quest item to the final area of the game – Previously obtainable only during the Prologue, this addition gives players a second chance to collect all journals within a single playthrough<wbr></p> </li> </ul>  <ul> <li> <p>Added Photo Mode with plenty of settings and options for players to get creative with while capturing your favourite moments from the game, accessible at any time from the pause menu!&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Added Lumina Sets feature, allowing players to save up to 50 different lumina loadouts for adapting to plenty of different fighting tactics at any moment&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Added Abandon Battle option in the pause menu which can now be opened in battle&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Added HUD Scale setting, allowing players to adjust the size of in-game HUD elements from 80% to 120%&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Added FSR 4 support, including AMD temporal upscaling for sharper visuals and Frame Generation for smoother gameplay on compatible GPUs&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Added new filters for Pictos and Luminas and improved the UI&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Added input remapping for controller</p> </li> </ul>  <ul> <li> <p>The game is now certified on Steam Deck and ROG Xbox Ally!&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Global improvement of text legibility<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Fixed multiple fog and lighting issues:&nbsp;&nbsp;<wbr></p> <ul> <li> <p>Overly intense effects during the Flying Manor boss fight (which also impacted some cinematics)&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Overexposed areas in the Visages&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Overly dark areas in the Endless Tower<wbr></p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Fixed FPS being capped at 30 on Steam Deck&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>VSync can now be properly disabled in the settings when playing on Steam Deck<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Graphic settings are now adjusted for Steam Deck users&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Improved first-time setup flow:&nbsp;&nbsp;<wbr></p> <ul> <li> <p>Controller input is now supported in installation wizards (no longer touchscreen-only)<wbr></p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>External controllers now switch seamlessly with the Steam Deck controls&nbsp;<wbr><wbr></p> </li> </ul>  <ul> <li> <p>Fixed an issue where using Battle Retry after a cinematic or automatic trigger could spawn the player out of the world if the last save was created in a different location&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>The playtime displayed on save files now accurately reflects total playtime, including time spent on Game Overs<br> (Note: this fix does not retroactively update existing save files.)&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Fixed inventory behaviour so that sort order now persists after closing the game menu&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Fixed issue preventing Intel XeSS Frame Generation setting from being accessible on PC Game Pass&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Fixed an issue where the usage of particular diacritic marks (e.g. ^, ~, ´, `) in Windows is blocked after launching the title<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Fixed Breaking Death always breaking all enemies when the character dies, it should only break the enemy that killed the character – As a result, it shouldn’t work when the character kills themself anymore<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Characters’ turn order during a First Strike, triggered by attacking an enemy on the map, now correctly respects characters’ Speed<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Fixed Boucharo giving +150% Critical chance instead of +50% Critical chance&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Fixed some Luminas giving unintended hidden +10% damage:&nbsp;&nbsp;<wbr></p> <ul> <li> <p>Sweet Kill&nbsp;&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Teamwork&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>Dead Energy II&nbsp;<wbr></p> </li> <li> <p>First Strike and others</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/logitechs-wireless-gaming-headset-deal-comes-early-hitting-its-cheapest-price-yet-despite-being-newly-released-2000652578</link>

              <p>Enhance your gaming experience by treating yourself to audio that actually does your games justice. If you’ve been relying on the default speakers built into your TV, you probably don’t realize how much you’re missing. Switching to a quality over-ear headset feels a lot like discovering you’ve needed glasses your entire life—once you try it, everything suddenly becomes sharper and far more detailed. With proper surround sound, you can pick up tiny environmental cues, like the faint scuffle of an opponent approaching from behind, and identify their position using audio alone. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6369/">Even better, the Logitech G522 Lightspeed PC gaming headset is currently 25% off, dropping from $160 to just $120 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6369/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Advanced Synchronized Audio</h2>
<p>Logitech knows to take comms seriously. It doesn’t matter if you are a pro-level&nbsp;<em>League</em> player telling your jungler when to make their move or if you’re just laughing with friends because you barreled back down the mountain in <em>PEAK</em> again. The best in class voice clarity with full bandwidth 48 khz/16 bit microphone ensures your words are coming across crystal-clear. Its can handle broadcast-quality audio if you intend to use this headset while livestreaming on Twitch.</p>
<p>The audio you hear is equally impressive. The state-of-the-art PRO-G audio drivers can deliver synchronized 48 khz/24 bit audio of the highest quality, producing rich bass with minimal distortion. You get real sound—not the hollow tin-can crap you hear with bargain-bin headsets.</p>
<p>The Logitech G522 Lightspeed headset offers several choices for how to connect to your PC or mobile devices. Use a wired USB-A and USB-C connection for uninterrupted play. Bluetooth is also supported so you can connect to your phone or even a Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>Any gaming headset worth its weight in gold needs to be comfortable. The Logitech G522 Lightspeed headset utilizes rounded cushion ear cups for maximum comfort. The suspension band allows it to fit around the contour of your head perfectly. Plus, its washable so you can keep the whole thing hygienic. No one has ever gotten a Victory Royale without sweating a little bit. The headset is lightweight too so you’ll barely even notice it while wearing it on your dome.</p>
<p>And of course, this wouldn’t be a capital-G “Gamer” accessory without the state-of-play-mandated RGB support. The side-facing lighting can produce up to 16.8 million colors, fully customizable by you. There are eight different lighting zones across the headset so you can create different combinations of colors.</p>
<p data-start="2463" data-end="2767">Battery life is another standout. With lighting off, you’ll be hitting close to the 60 hours of game time before you need to plug it back in. Not stats unfortunately on how long the headset lasts with lighting on. And with a 30-meter wireless range, you can wander off between matches to make much-needed trips to the kitchen to replenish your snacks without losing audio.</p>

              <p>Last night’s Game Awards revealed the first trailer for <a href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-movie-trailer-cast-release-date-2000652775">next year’s&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter</em> movie</a>, and people’s reaction has been excellent to watch. Given the source material, and the multiple straight-faced attempts to make it work as a movie over the last few decades, there was a base assumption that this would be another self-serious attempt to make a dramatic action movie. When it was clearly not that, something that looked both fun and even funny, the world reacted with a collective “huh?” But to solve the puzzle, there’s one important piece that people missed: the director.</p> <p><em>Street Fighter</em> is being directed by Kitao Sakurai. Who’s that, you ask. Kitao Sakurai is the director of 62 episodes of <em>The Eric Andre Show</em>.</p> <p>If that doesn’t mean anything to you, this should help:</p>  <p>And now we’re all on the same page.</p> <p>I think it’s really worth watching the&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter</em> movie trailer again, following the above.</p>

  <p>I was pretty sure that was Eric Andre dancing behind the news desk as Don Sauvage for a split-second there the first time I watched. And yup, it is! And it all starts to make so much more sense.</p>

 <p>As social media <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/spacecoyote.com/post/3m7r5oye4xc27">filled with memes</a> about the extraordinary new look for Guile, and game sites tried to comprehend what they’d just seen, it was all reasonably skewed by prior expectations. Me too! And <em>Kotaku</em> in general! Ethan’s take was to call the trailer “<a href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-movie-trailer-cast-release-date-2000652775">surprisingly good</a>.” It’s only 16 years since we were served Andrzej Bartkowiak <i>Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li</i> (<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/street-fighter-the-legend-of-chun-li/">a 17 on <em>Metacritic</em></a>), and no one can shake 1994’s Steven E. de Souza version, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme and Kylie Minogue. There was no reason to think that that we should hope for something better this time, either. So watching the trailer, preconceptions were so heavy that it was almost impossible to see what was really happening.</p>

 <p>What we actually see in this trailer is <em>deranged</em>. With the blinkers of pessimism removed, every cliched pose, every choreographed punch and kick, starts to reveal what it truly is: a goof. Seriously, look closer. That hoary old shot of Zangief pulling the tractor—there are two bored men sat on top of it, one reading a paper. The crash zoom on Andrew Koji’s Ryu, a shameless Bruce Lee rip-off moment—that’s on purpose. And Noah Centineo looking like the Ken doll version of Ken Masters—that also makes much more sense. In this light, Guile’s spectacular (and faithful!) flattop is no longer an anomaly, but a natural part of events.</p>

 <p>Now factor in the details like how Kyle Mooney has a character in this film, and how Sakurai’s more recent work has included&nbsp;<em>Twisted Metal</em>, and his only previous feature film was the surprisingly good genre-bending comedy <em>Bad Trip</em> starring Eric Andre and Lil Rey Howery, and there’s no way to believe this new&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter</em> movie is going to be a weird-ass comedy from start to finish.</p> <p>Heck, given the pacing on the Eric Andre Show, the frenetic trailer might even match the final experience.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-govee-philips-hue-65-smart-tv-light-strip-is-56-off-and-now-even-cheaper-than-the-55-version-2000652694</link>

              <p>Good lighting can really bring your entire gaming and entertainment setup together. If you’re looking to enjoy a more immersive visual experience with your screen, where the entire room lights up during action-packed scenes and settles into a calm vibe when something peaceful is playing, a smart lighting strip is what you need.</p>
<p>Depending on the features you’re after, these can cost a pretty penny, but that changes today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6368/">The 65-inch Philips Hue Play Gradient Smart TV light strip is currently going for just $130 at Amazon, after a whopping 56% or $167 discount.</a> It’s the lowest we have seen these lights drop to in a long, long while, and you’ll also enjoy free shipping with your purchase. These are sure to make holiday movie nights a lot more fun – just be sure to get your orders in before the price goes back up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6368/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Millions of LED Multi-Color Lights</h2>
<p>The box comes with a one White and Color Ambiance 65-inch TV smart LED light strip with mounting brackets. It attaches to the back of your screen (just below the corners) safely using the brackets. This deal applies to the 65-inch version, but you can also get the 55-inch and 75-inch sizes, depending on the size of your TV. Both versions are discounted, going for $142 and $255, respectively. Note that the lighting strips need to be paired with a Hue bridge and sync box (both sold separately) to unlock their full potential. If you don’t have those already, now is a good time to snap them up, too, as several Philips Hue products are going for less at Amazon.</p>



<p>Once everything is up, the strip offers both warm-to-cool white and millions of LED multi-color lights to choose from. The colors blend perfectly into each other, while the 45-degree angle light projector casts the stunning gradient of light onto the wall behind your TV. Of course, syncing abilities are the highlight here, as they make the lights react to whatever’s happening on screen in real time, whether you’re watching a show, playing a game, or just listening to your favorite music. Watching a Stranger Things episode? Expect your living room to light up with some Eleven magic. Thrilling, action-packed games with a shooting sequence are going to put up a light show, while LoFi songs are going to fill the space with calm vibes. It’s great for both solo streaming sessions, movie nights with friends, plus fun New Year’s parties.</p>
<p>Voice control is supported, meaning you won’t always have to adjust settings or manage the lights manually via the dedicated app. It plays nicely with Alexa and Google Assistant, so you can say something like “Hey Alexa, turn the lights on”, or “Hey Alexa, increase the brightness”, and your command will be answered in seconds. The Hue Bridge brings even more convenience by letting you add motion sensors, set routines, create timers, and more. There’s a lot more to like about this smart lighting strip. It does more than adding lights to your setup; it creates a vibe. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6368/">The current deal lets you pick the 65-inch version for $130, after an impressive 56% discount.</a> Other sizes are discounted too, so there are options to choose from. Deals this good tend to wrap up soon, so it’s best to grab yours without wasting a lot of time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-clears-out-elite-series-2-core-gaming-controllers-at-their-lowest-price-to-compete-with-playstation-and-switch-2000653005</link>
            <guid>1381807</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve already bought an Xbox for the holidays, there are a couple of small issues you thankfully still have time to address. One, it comes with one controller, so if you’re in a multi-player home, that’s going to be an issue. Two, that default controller is good — but it’s not&nbsp;<em>great</em>.</p> <p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B07SFKTLZM/?tag=kotaku01-20">The Xbox Elite Series 2 wireless controller that’s on sale for 33% off right now at Amazon?</a> Indisputably great, so you can get that second controller&nbsp;<em>and</em> a pro gaming experience at the same time by taking this $135 deal. The Elite 2 works with Xbox One, Series S, and Series X, and also works for PC gaming.</p>

 <h2>Premium Feel</h2> <p>The upgrade from the default Xbox controller to the Elite 2 is obvious from the second you take it out of the box. It’s slightly thicker and has a heavier feel, but just enough heft that it feels sturdy and well-built. The rubberized grips give you a feeling of secure control, and overall it’s ergonomically outstanding, designed for long sessions.</p>

 <p>The construction already sets the Elite 2 apart from the default Xbox controller and third-party versions, but where it really takes off into the stratosphere is when you get to customize it. The tension on the thumbsticks can be finely adjusted, and the triggers are shorter and faster for an edge in shooters and battle royals. The thumbsticks, d-pads and paddles are all swappable, so it’s as close to custom-designing a controller for yourself as you can find.</p>

 <p>Take the customization further by using the Xbox Accessories app on the console or on a PC to remap buttons, set up multiple profiles and custom stick curves, and even assign macros. The profiles can be stored on the Elite 2 itself so you can change them on the fly, which means you can set up different ones for different games.</p>

 <h2>Endurance Level Battery</h2> <p>Where the default Xbox controller is powered by AA batteries and also somewhat notorious for chewing through them at a rapid rate, the Elite 2 is rechargeable. You get up to 40 hours of gameplay on a single charge, and the USB-C charging dock is included. You can game all day and rest the Elite 2 on its dock by night to ensure you’ll have a full charge every time you fire up the console or PC.</p> <p>The upgrades from the default controller to the Elite 2 are staggering, so much so that it’ll entirely reshape how you play. Even if you’re not in need of a second controller, upgrading to the Elite 2 and keeping the default controller on hand as a backup is a smart move. Now’s the time to make the switch — <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Elite-2-Controller-Black-Xbox-One/dp/B07SFKTLZM/?tag=kotaku01-20">Amazon’s 33% off deal brings the Xbox Elite Series 2 wireless controller with its charger and swappable components down to a very reasonable $135.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Another Game Awards showcase <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-the-2025-game-awards-2000652719">has come and gone</a>. What did you think? Did you stay up and watch or just skim the highlights on social media? Did the right games win in the right categories? Did any of the “world premier” trailer reveals make you feel like Geoff Keighley’s event earned its nearly four-hour runtime? Consider this an open thread to chat, joke, and share your thoughts.</p> <p>I’ll start. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">won more awards than any game in TGA history</a>. Personally, while I love the game and think it warrants the hype, that seems a bit overblown. Will it stand the test of time like formative winners including <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, <em>Elden Ring</em>, and <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>? I suspect not, but maybe not reinventing the wheel shouldn’t be held against it. It’s the game of the moment and this is the awards show for 2025.</p>

 <p>At the very least, it <a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070">shouldn’t have won best indie game</a>. I blame the TGA jury for that one. If one of the goals of the show is to highlight as many of the year’s best games as possible, maybe one game shouldn’t be able to win “best game” across multiple categories. If you picked <em>Clair Obscur</em> for GOTY, it can’t also win “best RPG” or “best debut indie game.” It would prevent sweeps like this, which, even if deserved, end up being kind of boring and leave so many other amazing games underrepresented on the big stage.</p>

Keighley tried to pull another <em>Okami 2</em>-style rabbit out of his hat with <a href="https://kotaku.com/mega-man-dual-override-trailer-capcom-2000652829"><em>Mega Man Dual Overdrive</em></a> (aka<em> Mega Man 12</em>). As someone who grew up on games in the NES-era, <em>Mega Man 3</em> gave me a daily ass-kicking for years, it sort of worked. That game isn’t coming until 2027 though, and didn’t look nearly as solid or revelatory in the gameplay and art than I’d expect for the Blue Bomber’s prodigal return. Insiders promise Capcom is cooking but they have their work cut out for them.</p>

 <p>The show also seemed light on some of those known quantities that bring a special X factor to a showcase like this. No Nintendo wasn’t surprising. Sony showed showed more<em> Saros</em> but that doesn’t quite pop has much as more <em>Wolverine</em> or a new <em>God of War</em> would have. Microsoft, Square Enix, Ubisoft, and the rest of the big publishers were absent too. The big show stoppers, a new&nbsp;<em>Divinity</em> RPG from Larian Studios and a new <em>Star Wars: The Old Republic</em> spin-off from ex-BioWare director Casey Hudson, are games I can’t wait to play but whose reveals were muted a bit by brief cinematic teasers that shared a vibe but not a story.</p> <p>In many ways, this might have been the smoothest and most slickly produced Game Awards yet. It also, for some reason, felt like one of the least memorable. Will see if that gut assessment holds up a couple years from now. What did you think?</p>
