And even if the second big expansion isn’t on it, I’m sure we’ll at least start to get teases for what comes next later in the year. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s the story of four high school friends reuniting after 27 years without contact. Why they’re getting back together now is, apparently, part of the plot you create with your decisions, but there’s word of a terrible secret they all shared coming back to haunt them.</p><p>Each part is being released as a “tape,” because ‘90s references I guess, the first next week on February 18, and the second (currently) set for April 15. And, both will be included for PS+ subscribers at the Extra and Premium tiers.</p><p>But that’s not all that was revealed. Intriguing puzzle game&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.blueprincegame.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.blueprincegame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Blue Prince</em></a></span>, that calls itself an “atmospheric architectural adventure,” and looks absolutely fascinating. It’s seemingly first-person exploration, but in buildings where the rooms rearrange themselves, and all sorts of secrets are hidden within. It’s an indie piece, published by Raw Fury, and it will be coming straight onto PlayStation Plus this spring.</p><p>Then, in the summer, early access Steam hit <em>Abiotic Factor</em> will arrive on PS+ too. This is an FPS combined with survival sim, for one to six players, set across a bonkers mix of biomes and realms. It’s absolutely <em>adored</em> on PC, so makes for an excellent addition to Sony’s catalogue, especially given it works best when played in groups. If you’ve tried to convince friends to pay for an obscure indie title on console so you can play together, you’ll already know why everyone just have automatic access makes it far more likely to happen.</p><p>Sony is clearly testing the waters here, given its previous defiant refusal to sacrifice those day-one $70 sales for the ongoing income of a subscriber. While these are obviously not games that’d fetch such sums, and the latter two would be harder sells outside of Steam’s more esoteric ecosystem, it’s still a pretty big deal—<em>Lost Records</em> especially, given Don’t Nod’s string of previous mid-price successes.</p><p>Let’s hope it proves popular, enough that PlayStation broadens the day-one options, such that those who can’t afford to pay for multiple $70 games a year might have a cheaper path to entertainment.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
