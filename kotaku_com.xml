              <p>Choosing the right drone can feel like a real challenge with so many options out there. But if you’re just starting out or flying for fun, there’s one key thing to keep in mind: <strong>your drone should weigh under 250 grams to avoid the hassle of FAA registration</strong> and Remote ID requirements.</p>
<p>That narrows your choices quite a bit, and luckily, DJI offers two solid options in that category. The ultimate bang for your buck <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4270/">is the Mini 4K — and right now, it’s available on sale at an all-time low of $249, down from $299, at Amazon</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4270/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Ultimate Drone with Impressive Power and Precision</h2>
<p>The DJI Mini 4K is not just light but it’s also designed to impress. Its small body is lightweight but it’s what it does in the air that truly counts: Loaded <strong>with a 4K Ultra HD camera and combined with a 3-axis gimbal stabilization system</strong>, it records video with silky, movie-quality smoothness. Whether capturing a sunrise, sunset, or nighttime scene, the sharpness and clarity are excellent. This means <strong>you don’t necessarily need to be an expert to create professional-grade videos</strong>.</p>
<p>Due to its brushless motors, the Mini 4K supports <strong>wind resistance as high as 38 kilometers per hour</strong> — that’s Level 5 wind resistance. It also comes with the ability to <strong>take off and fly at altitudes as high as 4,000 meters</strong>. This guarantees that your flying experience is still stable and sensitive even if the weather gets a bit challenging.</p>



<p>The increased battery life adds an important plus to your flight duration: You can purchase sets that include one battery for 31 minutes (like that one on sale at Amazon), two batteries total of 62 minutes, or even three batteries where you can fly for up to 93 minutes.</p>
<p>Casual flyers and beginners will appreciate its simplicity and safety features: With one-tap takeoff and landing, GPS-enabled “Return to Home” and automatic hovering, even those new to drones can quickly get comfortable behind the controls. Plus, the DJI Fly app offers in-app tutorials to speed up the learning process so you’ll be flying and capturing your best shots in no time. The Mini 4K also comes with intelligent QuickShots like Helix, Dronie, Rocket, Circle, and Boomerang that make tricky flying maneuvers a breeze and capture stunning shots with only a few taps.</p>
<p>If you want to try aerial photography, this drone is the ideal friend.</p>

              <p>Boom! Bang! Kablam! Etc. and so on. There will be a lot of that happening today as a big new event on Steam has a whole host of fantastic retro-inspired first-person shooters on sale for the rest of the week.</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/boomstock2025">On September 23, Boomstock 2025 started on Steam</a>. The event celebrates “all boomer shooters and retro-inspired” FPS games and features a ton of new trailers, demos, and of course, a load of games on sale. This includes some genuine bangers, like<em> Dusk</em>, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/mullet-madjack-anime-fps-roguelike-hades-review-steam-1851475865">Mullet Madjack</a></em>,<em> Project Warlock</em>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/"><em>Selaco</em></a>, and<em> Sulfur</em>.&nbsp; But don’t wait too long, as the event wraps up on September 27, which is just a few days away. If you need help picking out a new shooter to buy, here are some of the best and biggest deals we spotted from the event:</p> <ul> <li><em>Nightmare Reaper</em> – $15 ($25)</li> <li><em>Brutal John 2</em> – $9 ($13)</li> <li><em>Selaco</em> – $19 ($25)</li> <li><em>Forgive Me Father</em> – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Forgive Me Father 2</em> – $15 ($25)</li> <li><em>Wizordum</em> – $15 ($20)</li> <li><em>Dusk</em> – $7 ($20)</li> <li><em>Sulfur</em> – $16 ($22)</li> <li><em>Zero Protocol</em> – $7 ($12)</li> <li><em>Project Warlock 1+2</em> – $12 ($27)</li> <li><em>Mullet Madjack</em> – $15 ($20)</li> <li><em>Warhammer 40K Boltgun</em> – $11 ($22)</li> <li><em>Blood We</em>st – $9 ($25)</li> <li><em>Heavy Bullets</em> – $2 ($10)</li> <li><em>Viscerafest</em> – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Supplice</em> – $15 ($22)</li> <li><em>Wild Bastards</em> – $9 ($35)</li> <li><em>Shadow Warrior</em> (2013) – $3 ($30)</li> <li><em>Shadow Warrior 2</em> – $3 ($30)</li> <li><em>HROT</em> – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Gravelord</em> – $15 ($20)</li> <li><em>Quatermain and the Cult of Cthulu</em> – $2.50 ($3)</li> <li><em>Hard Reset</em> – $1.50 ($15)</li> <li><em>Hard Reset Redux</em> – $2 ($20)</li> <li><em>Serious Sam 2</em> – $2.50</li> <li><em>Mycopunk</em> – $11 ($14)</li> <li><em>Graven</em> – $5 ($23)</li> </ul> <p>I’d also like to shout out some demos for upcoming games that you can play for free right now.

Anyway, here are some Boomstock demos worth playing:</p> <ul> <li><em>Sportal</em> – A boomer shooter all about using sports equipment like bats and tennis rackets.</li> <li><em>Blocks for Babies –</em> <em>Tetris</em> meets <em>Doom</em>. It mixes 2D and 3D gameplay. It’s an odd one, but worth checking out.</li> <li><em>Slyders</em> – This one is part<em> Serious Sam</em> and part roguelike, which is already a great pitch, but then you add in a cool cartoon fox protagonist, and you’ve got something special.</li> <li><em>The Last Exterminator</em> – This is the <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em> sequel we deserved. This isn’t a new demo; <a href="https://kotaku.com/duke-nukem-3d-last-exterminator-demo-boomer-shooter-pc-1850918547">I covered it last year</a>, but it’s a part of the event and still worth checking out.</li> </ul>

              <p>LEGO has just rolled out its new Advent calendars, and they’re giving early shoppers a real treat. Every year it’s the same story: prices are friendliest at launch then as December gets closer, demand sends them climbing back up.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4264/">the LEGO Minecraft advent calendar (2025 edition) is going for only $38 instead of the usual $44</a>. No wonder it’s already the fan favorite among all the LEGO calendars this season, from Harry Potter to Star Wars – but <strong>Minecraft is the #1 best-seller on Amazon</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4264/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>LEGO just released its new Advent calendars, and they’re treating early buyers to a welcome bargain. Year after year: prices are kindest at introduction, then closer to December, demand pushes them on the rise. Currently, the LEGO Minecraft Advent Calendar 2025 is available for as low as $38 rather than its normal price of $44.99, which is its lowest ever on Amazon. No wonder it’s already the holiday favorite of all the LEGO calendars available this year, whether it’s Harry Potter or Star Wars—but Minecraft is in the spotlight.</p>



<h2>A Christmas Deal That Brings Minecraft to Life</h2>
<p>Why this set is exciting is pretty simple: children and adults like counting down to Christmas, and LEGO and Minecraft is as good a sure bet as you’re ever likely to get. Instead of a second box of chocolates, <strong>you’re getting 24 buildable surprises</strong> that extend the suspense through the morning.<strong> Constructed from 300 pieces</strong>, the set creates a full-sized Minecraft world to discover one day at a time.</p>



<p><strong>8 classic Minecraft mini-figures are shipped inside</strong>: Alex and Steve are present, of course, but you also get a Creeper, stray, drowned, zombie, snow golem, and even a villager in Santa clothes. They all come with holiday-themed accents that still fit the vibe of the holiday countdown without losing the characteristic Minecraft look.</p>
<p>What’s really cool is <strong>the way the pieces interact with one another</strong>: There’s something new every day and collectively, they build a Minecraft-themed winter village scene. That playmat background in the box acts as the glue to hold everything together so instead of having 24 separate builds, kids see their own Lego world come together over the space of a month.</p>
<p>This Advent calendar isn’t a separate collection: it’s <strong>compatible with the entire range of LEGO Minecraft</strong>. For someone who already has Minecraft Lego pieces lying around, this slots right into the existing collection. Kids can expand on their worlds, bridge scenes together or start with it and build something even bigger.</p>
<p>And there’s more than just nostalgia at play: LEGO calendars like this one don’t stick around at low launch prices. Historically, these drop right around release week before climbing steadily into mid-November, as the frenzy for Advent calendars kicks in. Waiting until December almost guarantees you’ll pay list price—or risk a sell-out altogether.</p>
