              <p>Kalshi’s CEO is bullish on the future of prediction market betting to solve disagreements for people, or at least make him very, very rich. What if every outcome in your life could be turned into a way to win or lose money? Imagine your very existence has been gamified into a gambling roguelike. “The long-term vision is to financialize everything and create a tradable asset out of any difference in opinion,” Tarek Mansour said at last month’s <a href="https://www.citadelsecurities.com/news-and-insights/kalshi-founders-tarek-mansour-luana-lopes-lara-on-turning-events-into-assets/?series=future-of-global-markets-2025-conference">Citadel Securities conference</a>.</p> <p>What sounds like a loading screen <a href="https://kotaku.com/gen-ai-fps-tom-clancy-shooter-hyperwrite-2000638861">from<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em></a> was enough to make investors jump at the opportunity to turn angry Reddit threads into stock tickers you can gamble on. Kalshi recently raised $1 billion in its latest funding round this week, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/prediction-market-kalshi-hits-11-billion-valuation-in-new-funding-round-c4b1ddfe?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqdK-C0DhBc1ROkTdmdjauO7NE1xfoRnplk7FG1xKlaVPgwq1j6G1W_GWZ8c32U%3D&amp;gaa_ts=69309f9c&amp;gaa_sig=hKp-ZWblR1czvzvZi6BU2jUgxKi7W5LCwBBoCgom6lbVg_ldgoo9zy88xGYY8empWbRhMBInY0rli8I8qQBvIQ%3D%3D">leading to an $11 billion valuation</a>. What are investors so pumped about? Here’s the pitch Mansour <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/moreperfectunion.bsky.social/post/3m747g22dcc2o">gave in November</a> on stage with co-founder Luana Lopes Lara:</p>

 <blockquote><p>[Prediction markets are] pretty much already close to a $100 billion a year asset class. It’s pretty easy to imagine it 10x from here. We haven’t even started. It’s been a year. I think a very large number of people care, much larger than traditional markets, and I think retail as a pie has just been growing in the U.S. and I think it’s going to keep growing–it’s growing in the stock market, it’s growing outside the stock market.</p> <p>The long term vision is to financialize everything and create a tradable asset out of any difference of opinion. And I think if you do build a general purpose exchange that can resolve differences of opinions on anything the [total addressable market] is quite massive, quite a bit bigger than the current TAM of the stock market.</p> <p>Putting aside the retail trading and the institutional trading product there’s sort of this separate product which is we are living in a world where we have an abundance of information but there’s a lot of noise and we don’t really understand what’s real from what’s not and prediction markets are an antidote to that, they do a very good job of surfacing information and distilling truth to people.</p></blockquote>   <p>Mansour’s prediction market, i.e. opinion polls turned into casinos, was established back in 2018. <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-race-polymarket-clair-obscur-2000640468">Like rivals such as Polymarket</a>, It’s pitched as a sophisticated tool for hedging risk. Picture some big world event like a war or an election. No one knows the outcome or what it might mean for their business so they trade bets to reduce the chance of losing a ton of money.</p>

 <p>I’m not going to weigh in on whether that makes any sense because that’s not what Mansour is saying is going to make Kalshi go 10X. The real moonshot is being able to take the popularity of betting on stocks with apps like Robinhood or sports with Draft Kings, and apply it to the totality of life. Every outcome, not just one in the market or a football game, will be an opportunity for people to gamble, ahem, I mean hedge risk.</p>

 <p>It all feels very Sam Bankman-Fried-coded. Remember <a href="https://kotaku.com/riot-games-ftx-cryptocurrency-exchange-sponsorship-sue-1849909204">that big FTX crypto debacle</a> from the wunderkind that was also making grand pronouncements on stage at conferences just before it all went belly up? Headlines <a href="https://frontofficesports.com/polymarket-and-kalshi-ceos-say-theyre-changing-the-world/">like this</a> about Kalshi and Polymarket don’t drive confidence. Where’s the prediction market for betting against prediction markets?</p>

 <p>If the post-covid era has taught us anything about the current state of the distraction economy, it’s that we love finding new ways to waste time and money on our phones. I don’t actually think most people want to treat break room debates or dinner table arguments like betting on horse racing. Maybe if it was more like <em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>.</p> <p>But I think Mansour does and the people prepared to give his company billions do and that’s all it takes for bad things to happen.</p>

              <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/ready-or-not">Ready or Not</a>,</em> a popular (and controversial) first-person tactical co-op shooter and SWAT simulator, is getting a free trial on consoles. The trial will feature full access to the game and will be available for the rest of 2025.</p> <p>On December 3, Void Interactive announced a new limited-time free trial for<em> Ready or Not.</em> The trial is available now on PlayStation 5 (with a PS Plus subscription), Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. Once downloaded and installed, players will have access to the entirety of<em> Ready or Not,</em> including every mission. Players can enjoy the game for three hours before the trial ends. After that, all progress made in the trial can be carried over to the full game if players decide to purchase <em>Ready or Not.</em> This free taste will be available only on consoles and only until February 20, 2026.</p> <p>First released in 2021 on PC via Steam early access, <em>Ready or Not</em> has been mired in controversy over the years. <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-loses-publisher-days-after-devs-remind-fans-about-1848258819">The game lost its original publisher</a>, Team17, shortly before launch. The SWAT sim courted controversy over its subject matter, including a level set in a community college. <a href="https://kotaku.com/controversial-steam-best-seller-ready-or-not-is-an-unse-1848317351">When <em>Kotaku’s</em> own Ethan Gach played the game in 2022</a>, he felt it was unfinished and filled with juvenile humor and unsettling copaganda. I recently played it earlier this year, and while the action is tight and snappy, everything around it, including how it makes you treat every human you meet as a threat, is hard to ignore.</p> <p>In July, it found itself buried in a whole different mess of controversy <a href="https://kotaku.com/ready-or-not-censorship-update-console-mod-uncensored-1851786403">when a patch was rolled out across PC</a>&nbsp;that made changes to some in-game assets, including the censorship of nudity. This was done to make the game easier to release on consoles. Fans who had been playing for years called foul and review-bombed <em>Ready or Not.</em> A modder rolled back the changes within an hour of the patch going live. Things have calmed down a lot since then, and the game has continued to receive frequent updates.&nbsp; <a href="https://kotaku.com/ready-or-not-community-manager-fired-for-responding-to-charlie-kirk-assassination-with-nothing-was-lost-2000627182">Earlier this year, the game’s community manager was fired after joking about Charlie Kirk’s killing.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/no-games-for-genocide-xbox-microsoft-boycott-palestine-2000650175</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>No Games For Genocide, a collective of video game workers and union organizers, just announced a pledge to boycott Xbox. It calls on journalists, developers, streamers, and consumers to participate in the Palestinian-led BDS (boycott, divest, sanction) movement against Microsoft, which it’s accused of being complicit in Israeli war crimes. The tech giant recently cut off cloud services to an Israel Defense Forces intelligence unit that </span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/06/microsoft-israeli-military-palestinian-phone-calls-cloud"><span>used them for mass surveillance of Palestinians</span></a><span>, but continues supplying them to the rest of the military.</span></p> <p><span>After years of acquisitions, Microsoft has become a gaming industry monolith, and avoiding it entirely may prove difficult for many, especially considering how dire the industry’s job crisis has been over the last few years. But </span><a href="https://nogamesforgenocide.com/"><span>No Games For Genocide</span></a><span> believes that the more people who take part in their movement’s proposed collective actions, the better chance the tech giant will take notice.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“The games industry in particular is at the intersection of entertainment and tech, and there are a lot of material links—when we’re looking at the tech aspect of hardware and software—there are a lot of connections between the games industry and the genocide that Israel is committing against the Palestinian people,” Sara Khan, a content creator, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/gameassist"><span>cofounder of Game Assist</span></a><span>, and one of No Games For Genocide’s organizers, told me over a video call. “A few of us really wanted to organize around that, and organize people within the industry to say ‘we don’t want these ties’ and find a way to move past them.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Khan and IWGB Game Workers Union founder, Austin Kelmore, worked with other industry members to organize No Games For Genocide and determine where to focus its attention. The IWGB recently unionized Disco Elysium maker ZA/UM and has been fighting Rockstar Games over the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-union-rockstar-court-legal-developers-2000643478"><span>firing of 34 </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6</span></i><span> developers</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Sort of serendipitously, the </span><a href="https://bdsmovement.net/microsoft"><span>Palestinian-led BDS movement</span></a><span> announced earlier this year that Xbox was going to be one of their new consumer targets,” Khan explained.” It made sense for it to be a priority campaign for us.”</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:dkxt4ihy3a4lnunqu3g5xhyn/app.bsky.feed.post/3m6zcsllmoc2k" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreielby3tqjwmmgrdbdifrubaewzhyln7onkchbyj6t7wx4skskvbtm"> <p lang="en">SIGN OUR BOYCOTT XBOX PLEDGE: We are asking gamers, game workers, streamers &amp; journalists to join us in boycotting &amp; divesting from Xbox, to force Microsoft to end its complicity in the genocide of Palestinians.</p> <p>We’ve provided concrete actions everyone can take. Sign here: nogamesforgenocide.com</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:dkxt4ihy3a4lnunqu3g5xhyn?ref_src=embed">No Games For Genocide (@nogamesforgenocide.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:dkxt4ihy3a4lnunqu3g5xhyn/post/3m6zcsllmoc2k?ref_src=embed">2025-12-02T16:00:16.473Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><span>No Games For Genocide has been working with the BDS National Committee to organize its campaign, which doesn’t just include signing the pledge, but offers a variety of other ways people can participate. </span></p>

 <p><span>It argues that consumers should avoid purchasing Microsoft or Xbox products, streamers shouldn’t play Xbox-published games on stream (or accept sponsorships from any Xbox game studio), journalists should “halt all coverage of Xbox-published games,” and developers should “demand [their] publisher not publish [their] game on the Xbox and Microsoft Stores,” among other things.</span></p>

 <p><span>Khan and their fellow organizers know these are some pretty tall orders. “People understandably are facing hurdles and have to consider the potential risks to their job security, their livelihood, which is completely understandable,” they said. “This is definitely more long-term work. How do we build that collective power? How do we make sure we’re protecting people’s jobs and accounting for that risk? […] As individuals, these things are scary; the risks that they carry are very real, so it’s important for us to build that collective power.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Perhaps with that risk in mind, many of the pledge’s signatories (which include the investigative YouTube channel People Make Games and worker-owned game studio Soft, Not Weak) are at the consumer level. “That’s immediately more accessible to folks,” Khan explained. “Hopefully, over time, we’d love to be able to get more studios or media outlets in a position to commit to the pledge.”</span></p> <p><span>The term “collective power” comes up a lot; the notion that organizing behind a common goal can create cover and/or protection for individuals who want to publicly take a political position that may result in retaliation. Khan likened it to union organizing and how workers feel empowered to stand up for fair wages and labor protections together as a unit: “How can we build towards you being in a position—not just you as an individual in your workplace, but hopefully multiple individuals, perhaps the entire workplace—to get you into a position where this would be doable? […] There is only so much we can do as individuals. There’s so much more we can do as a collective.”</span></p> <p><span>But didn’t Israel and Palestine just agree on a ceasefire? And what about the <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/09/25/update-on-ongoing-microsoft-review/">September 2025 “update” from Microsoft</a> that confirmed the company “ceased and disabled a set of services to a unit within the Israel Ministry of Defense?” When asked, Khan pointed back to the</span><a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/microsoft-blocks-israel%E2%80%99s-use-its-technology-mass-surveillance-palestinians"><span> official BDS statement</span></a><span> after </span><span>Microsoft announced it was terminating Israel’s access to AI and Azure cloud tech</span><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>“</span><span>Microsoft remains a key technological pillar in Israel’s apartheid regime and its genocide in Gaza,” the BDS news post read. “It continues to equip the Israeli military, government, and prisons with the technology used to commit war crimes, crimes against humanity, and genocide.”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Khan also emphasized that Microsoft and other video game companies are complicit in the genocide and imperialism taking place in the global south, and that No Games For Genocide’s goal is to help the industry rethink its role in these systems. (In 2023, a</span><a href="https://google.com/search?q=future+class+kotkau&amp;rlz=1C1RXQR_enUS1119US1119&amp;oq=future+class+kotkau&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIJCAEQIRgKGKABMgkIAhAhGAoYoAEyCQgDECEYChigATIJCAQQIRgKGKABMgkIBRAhGAoYoAEyBggGECEYCtIBCDQ1OTVqMGo0qAIAsAIB&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8"><span> petition created by the Game Awards Future Class calling on The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley to acknowledge the humanitarian crisis in Gaza</span></a><span> was reportedly ignored.)&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“The violence that Palestinian people have been experiencing is, plain and simple, settler colonial violence,” Khan said. “It’s an occupation, not just apartheid and not just genocide…so a ceasefire is not enough. We have to question the very existence of a settler colonial state, and we have to ask: What does decolonization look like for the Palestinian people?”</span></p> <p><span>No Games For Genocide’s long-term goals are aligned with BDS: “We keep mounting up the pressure until we see Microsoft divesting.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Kotaku has reached out to Xbox for comment.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><strong>Update 12/3/2025 at 2:40 pm E.T.:&nbsp;</strong>A Microsoft spokesperson told&nbsp;<em>Kotaku,</em> “the company treats claims about our technology seriously. As we indicated in our blog, we have undertaken an ongoing review of these allegations” and linked to the aforementioned September 2025 blog post. The company also pointed to an internal email from President Brad Smith about a new “Microsoft Integrity Port” for employees to report their ethical concerns to.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Elden Ring Nightreig</em>n’s first paid DLC, <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-dlc-forsaken-hollows-artorias-dark-souls-2000643101"><em>The Forsaken Hollow</em></a>, is finally here. If it does it’s job, the new mini-expansion will bring fans back and give them new reasons to obsess over the surprisingly excellent multiplayer roguelike.</p> <p>I’ve cleared my schedule and shamed my friends into joining me for whatever fresh surprises from FromSoftware await us. Here’s everything you need to know about the new content, including what’s in it, when it goes live, and the accompanying patch notes.</p>

 <h2 id="what-time-does-elden-ring-nightreign-the-forsaken-hollows-launch-in-your-time-zone">What time does <em>Elden Ring Nightreign: The Forsaken Hollows</em> go live?</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The official release schedule of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/ELDENRING?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ELDENRING</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NIGHTREIGN?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NIGHTREIGN</a> The Forsaken Hollows is now available.</p> <p>Learn how to access the content of The Forsaken Hollows here: <a href="https://t.co/YKcgUiynX1">https://t.co/YKcgUiynX1</a> <a href="https://t.co/RJafPEq0dV">pic.twitter.com/RJafPEq0dV</a></p> <p>— ELDEN RING (@ELDENRING) <a href="https://twitter.com/ELDENRING/status/1995858043746275502?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This is the part that sucks. The global release times are staggered and consoles get the short end of the stick. <em>The Forsaken Hollow</em> launches December 3 at 6:00 p.m. ET on PC and December 4 at 12:00 a.m. ET. If you’re on Xbox Series X/S, you can pull the time zone trick to get in early, but it seems like everyone on PlayStation 5 and PS4 are out of luck.</p>

 <p>I’m still holding out some small ray of hope that the DLC will magically unlock around 9:00 p.m. ET like most of <em>Nightreign</em>‘s free updates and weekly content rotations. That doesn’t seem to be the care this time around, however.</p>

 <h2>How do you access <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em>?</h2> <p>Just because you bought the $15 DLC doesn’t mean the content will automatically be active in your version of <em>Nightreign</em>. To actually access the two additional Nightfarer characters you’ll need to have first defeated Tricephalos, the game’s three-headed wolf Nightlord. After that, head to the Roundtable Hold, talk to the Iron Menial, and get the message from the Small Jar Merchant to unlock the new Scholar and Undertaker classes.</p>

 <p>What about the new Shifting Earth event? To access that and the new Balancers boss fight, you’ll need to have completed the above steps and defeated a second Nightlord. With those conditions met you’ll head to a chapel that appears behind the Small Jar Merchant where you can activate the&nbsp;cataclysmic Shifting Earth event ‘The Great Hollows.’</p>

 <h2>What’s <em>The Forsaken Hollows</em> DLC adding to <em>Nightreign</em>?</h2> <p>There’s the Scholar, a new support class whose Character Skill is called Analyze and lets him debuff enemies by keeping them within a scoped view. His passive skill is Bagcraft which lets him hold more items. His Ultimate Art is called Communion and it links enemies so damaging one damages them all, while also doing the same for allies letting them share heals.</p>

 <p>Then there’s Undertaker, a more aggressive melee class whose Character Skill is called Trance and gives her free stamina and bonus speed. Her Ultimate Art is Loathsome Hex which unleashes a flurry of attacks at whatever’s targeted. Her passive, Confluence, briefly gives her another free Ultimate Art any time an ally uses theirs.</p> <p><em>The&nbsp;Forsaken Hollows</em> DLC also adds the aforementioned Great Hollows Shifting Earth event, which isn’t just a repurposed section of the existing map but an entirely new area players will have to fly to with its own points of interest, ruins, and underground mazes. In addition to the new Balancers Nightlord, the DLC is bringing poison swamps to Limveld, fresh field bosses, and also entirely new weapons.</p> <p>Most importantly, it should feel hard. “Whenever people who have played the main game extensively go into the DLC content, they’ll be able to have a bit of that feeling like they had when they first played <em>Nightreign</em>, where there’s still a bit that they’re trying to figure out,” <a href="https://kotaku.com/nightreign-forsaken-hollows-dlc-map-swamp-field-bosses-2000649718">director Junya Ishizaki promised</a>. “[<em>The Forsaken Hollows</em> is] definitely a little bit harder, but it’s not ridiculous or anything like that, but that’s still within what we would consider to be a fair challenge.”</p> <h2>A new patch with no Nightfarer balance changes</h2> <p>Finally, the DLC arrives alongside the latest free update which is already live. It includes some small quality-of-life tweaks and a bunch of bug fixes, including for Raider’s Retaliate skill where it wouldn’t work properly and an ongoing issue where some Sites of Grace or Churches wouldn’t activate. Notably, however, there are no actual buffs or nerfs to the existing cast of characters. Maybe FromSoftware wants to see how Scholar and Undertaker compare before decided to rescale them.</p> <p>Here are the full patch notes for <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-103"><em>Nightreign</em> version 1.03</a>:</p> <blockquote> <h2>New features</h2> <ul> <li>Added support for The Forsaken Hollows. <ul> <li>If you own the DLC The Forsaken Hollows, it will be displayed in the lower right corner of the title screen.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Added a display of the currently equipped relics in the Character Selection menu. <ul> <li>You can check the effects of equipped relics by toggling the display.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Added a feature to set names when registering Relics presets in the Relic Rites menu.</li> <li>Set names can be changed in the All Presets section.</li> <li>The order of presets for each character can now be changed in the All Presets section of the Relic Rites menu. <ul> <li>In the Relic Rites menu, you can change the order of presets (but not the order of the character themselves) in the All Relics section.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Added Deep Large Scenic Flatstone to the Collector Signboard shop.</li> <li>The map’s layer display can now be toggled in the Results menu.</li> <li>The relics equipped by each player can now be displayed in the Results menu. <ul> <li>Relics can only be displayed for sessions played in version 1.02 or later.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Players with a Personal Objective that requires defeating a specific target while Reliving a Remembrance can now embark on Expeditions with players whose Personal Objective does not require defeating a specific target. <ul> <li>Personal Objectives that do not require destroying the target will only appear for one player per Expedition.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The flask count will now be highlighted in the following situations:</li> <li>When the flask count is at the maximum capacity,</li> <li>When an enemy-induced effect that influences the flask is triggered.</li> <li>The vertical position of the compass’ rune icon will now be displayed if the runes dropped upon death are significantly above or below the player character.</li> <li>You can now highlight specific events that occur on a map layer that is on a different level from the character’s location in the map menu.</li> <li>Adjusted the Dormant Power selection screen so that the HP gauge and other UI elements remain visible while the screen is displayed.</li> <li>Adjusted the weapon lineup in Limveld’s shops.</li> <li>Added Fire Pots to the shop inventory inside the Spirit Shetler.</li> <li>The target-lock on enemies that are behind when the tombstone summoned by Raider’s Ultimate Art appears no longer gets released.</li> </ul> <h2>Balance Adjustments</h2> <p>In general, the trigger conditions of Relic effects that trigger with low HP, equipment passive effects, and special effects have been broadened.</p> <h3>Changes to Passive Effects and Special Effects</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Added new Passive Effects:</strong> <ul> <li>Improved Melee Attack Power</li> <li>Improved Dash Attacks</li> <li>Improved Rolling Attacks</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Attack Power when Two-Handing.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Attack Up when Wielding Two Armaments.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Chain Attack Finishers.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Charge Attacks.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Jump Attacks.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Guard Counters.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Improved Skill Attack Power.</li> <li>Increased the effect of the Passive Effect Physical Attack Up.</li> <li>Broadened the trigger conditions and decreased the effectiveness of the Passive Effect Improved Damage Negation at Low HP.</li> <li>Broadened the trigger conditions and decreased the effectiveness of the Talisman Blue-Feathered Branchsword.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <h3>Changes to Relic Effects</h3> <ul> <li>Increased the effect of Physical Attack Up.</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved Initial Standard Attack.</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved Critical Hits.</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved Guard Counters.</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved XXX Damage (excluding bow weapon types).</li> <li>Increased the effect of Improved Attack Power with 3+ XX Equipped (excluding bow weapon types).</li> <li>Broadened the trigger conditions and decreased the effectiveness of Improved Damage Negation at Low HP.</li> </ul> <h3>Other Changes</h3> <ul> <li>Reduced the FP consumption and increased the power of the Wrath of Gold Incantation.</li> </ul> <h2>Bug Fixes &amp;
