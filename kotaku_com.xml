Even though they confidently take a Rathalos fireball to the face in their introductory cutscene, Lagiacrus is weak to Fire. They also differ from other water monsters in that they’re not weak to Thunder, and instead use Thunder element attacks. All that to say, <strong>Fire-based weapons and Thunder-resistant armor will go a long way here</strong>.</p><p>I’ve had the most luck when keeping a +20 Thunder resistance. This hunt isn’t as bad as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762">Arch-Tempered Rey Dau</a></span>’s almost endless lightning strikes, but more than half of the attacks are electric. Being afflicted with Thunderblight and subsequently getting stunned is highly likely if your resistance isn’t high enough. </p><p>Besides a couple of projectile attacks, Lagiacrus’ physical attacks are similar to Mizutsune’s, in that they’ll cover a substantial amount of ground lunging and sweeping their entire body at you. Don’t expect a certain area to feel safer, the way you can lie low underneath <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-zoh-shia-crystals-farm-1851781913&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-zoh-shia-crystals-farm-1851781913">Zoh Shia</a></span>. Well-timed guards and evades are incredibly important for a fight like this.</p><p><strong>Prioritizing hits to the back is a smart way to restrict some of Lagiacrus’ Thunder attacks and collect the not-so-common Lagiacrus Shockspike material.</strong> Heavy Bowguns and other weapons with long reach will be fine, but Dual Blade users like me mostly have to rely on traps and mounting. A great method for any hunter to dish out damage to the back is by dodging through the monster’s massive discharge attack, since that can reveal a Focus Strike spot for a few seconds after.</p><p>The environment is a helpful friend in a fight like this. Never hesitate to lead it towards Poisoncups, Sporepuffs, or into a turf war with another monster. On the likely chance it moves to Area 15, trigger the Dam Rubble interactable with your slinger. You’ll deal a lot of damage and knock it down for a bit.</p><p>Lagiacrus will retreat to the newly added Area 19 at the tail end of the fight. It will briefly surface along the edge of Area 13, where you can trigger Unstable Rubble to fall and knock it out of the water. No matter if you interrupt its journey or not, you’ll track it to Area 19. Keep the hits coming to make the monster dive into the nearby water. This is when you can follow after it and fight the “Lord of the Seas” on its own turf.</p><figure id="" data-id="af69a4d7868f3f38a6c418c7a07ec608" data-recommend-id="image://af69a4d7868f3f38a6c418c7a07ec608" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lagiacrus stares down at its prey." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lagiacrus stares down at its prey." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="af69a4d7868f3f38a6c418c7a07ec608" data-recommend-id="image://af69a4d7868f3f38a6c418c7a07ec608" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lagiacrus stares down at its prey." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Bear in mind that underwater combat isn’t as fleshed out as regular combat. While there is free movement and access to the Evade button, you’ll mainly be fighting with your slinger. You can use it to drop Submerged Rubble, collect Piercing Pods, or directly latch onto Lagiacrus in a similar interaction to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446">Mounting</a></span>. The latter is the best way to deal big damage during this part of the hunt.</p><p>Hurt Lagiacrus enough during this phase to trigger a cool cinematic of your hunter smacking the hell out of it and taking the fight back on land. If there isn’t enough damage dealt, the watery serpent will quickly create a whirlpool that unleashes a massive discharge of electricity. Swim as far away as possible to avoid losing a majority of your health or even fainting. Either way, the fight will transition back up top for the final bout. Play it smart and you’ll be done soon enough.</p><p>Tempered Lagiacrus kicks the difficulty up many notches. Attacks are frequently chained together and they all hurt a lot. Evading seems to be a more manageable strategy than guarding against these attacks. I’ve seen great results using the Rey Dau <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-armor-alpha-beta-gamma-arch-1851785351&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-armor-alpha-beta-gamma-arch-1851785351">Gamma armor</a></span> that’s forged from fighting Arch-Tempered Rey Dau. On top of the included high Thunder Resistance, it offers many other useful skills for both offense and defense. Throw in some Evade Window and Partbreaker decorations to give yourself a real fighting chance.</p><h2 id="h814946"><a id=""></a>Lagiacrus’s drops</h2><figure id="" data-id="81cec7d827d570ce8b67805155ad33b6" data-recommend-id="image://81cec7d827d570ce8b67805155ad33b6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Obtainable Materials page for Lagiacrus, highlighting the Lagiacrus Claw+ material." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Obtainable Materials page for Lagiacrus, highlighting the Lagiacrus Claw+ material." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Obtainable Materials page for Lagiacrus, highlighting the Lagiacrus Claw+ material.</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="81cec7d827d570ce8b67805155ad33b6" data-recommend-id="image://81cec7d827d570ce8b67805155ad33b6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Obtainable Materials page for Lagiacrus, highlighting the Lagiacrus Claw+ material." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The only thing better than defeating the “Lord of the Seas” is all the parts you get after. Below is a list of every Lagiacrus material, arranged by how often they drop.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Lagiacrus Claw+ (100% chance for breaking the Foreleg)</li><li>Lagiacrus Hide+</li><li>Lagiacrus Scale+</li><li>Lagiacrus Shockspike (100% chance for breaking the Back)</li><li>Lagiacrus Horn+ (100% chance for breaking the Head)</li><li>Lagiacrus Tail (100% chance for breaking the Tail)</li><li>Lagiacrus Certificate S</li><li>Lagiacrus Sapphire</li></ul><p>I would like to stress that the new Title Update 2 monsters have really scarce drop rates for the rarer materials. If you’re struggling to get the Lagiacrus Sapphire with its ridiculous 1%-2% drop rate, it might be best to wait until a hunt features the material as a Bonus Reward and then <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-investigations-farm-monster-1851785212&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-investigations-farm-monster-1851785212">save that investigation</a></span>. </p><p>This difficulty spike is exactly what the community has been asking for. Here’s hoping Capcom keeps it up with even more difficult monster battles in the future.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-lagiacrus-tempered-underwater-1851787435]]></content:encoded>

Its tale of the cutthroat, vindictive side of the entertainment industry may be oozing true crime flair, but outside of the jump scares and darker turns, is the story it tells really <em>that </em>different from any real-life horror story you might have heard about the challenges struggling artistss sometimes face when they’re trying to make it?</p><p>If you want a game to talk about the trials and tribulations of actors, it’s worth having some incredible talent to get the message across. <em>Dead Take </em>stars <em>Final Fantasy XVI </em>and <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> lead Ben Starr and Astarion from <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> himself, Neil Newbon, as two struggling(?) actor friends(?), Vinny Monroe and Chase Lowry. Both actors auditioned for a role in the latest movie by visionary director Duke Cain, but Vinny was the one who landed the job. While Chase is clearly not thrilled by this turn of events, he and Vinny seem to still be on good terms, up until Vinny stops answering his phone after a party at Cain’s luxurious mansion. Chase, in an effort to find his friend, goes to Cain’s home and finds only the aftermath of a party long over.</p><figure id="" data-id="bc168987eef4072045f926f40732eea8" data-recommend-id="image://bc168987eef4072045f926f40732eea8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chase looks into the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Chase looks into the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Surgent Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bc168987eef4072045f926f40732eea8" data-recommend-id="image://bc168987eef4072045f926f40732eea8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chase looks into the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Most of <em>Dead Take </em>plays out as a kind of large-scale escape room. Cain’s mansion is full of locked rooms with mysteries and unpleasant answers on the other side. The game is a mostly solitary affair, as Chase seems to be the only soul in the building, but Starr, Newbon, and a few other surprising big actors in the video game space get some real face time through found footage. So even if Chase is alone, every supporting character’s presence is still felt in their absence. There are plenty of text logs and environmental cues that give you a sense of what’s going on, but the bulk of the story is told through FMV video files you search for and watch in Cain’s lavish home theater. There are some puzzles even within that, some requiring you to use video editing software to find hidden footage within the files you’ve already discovered. It’s nothing as demanding as what you find in a Sam Barlow game like <em>Her Story </em>or <em>Immortality</em>, but it’s just enough to make you feel like even the videos you find aren’t the full story, and that there are hidden meanings to be found within even the most innocuous footage.</p><p>Starr’s performance is the standout for me. Vinny is a driven but privileged nepo baby who is drinking Cain’s Kool-Aid as if the man’s films were plopped into theaters by Christ himself. But that’s not even a character flaw that’s specific to him. Everyone<em> </em>in <em>Dead Take </em>is lapping up everything this man puts down, and they’re willing to sabotage others to bask in his light.</p><figure id="" data-id="d3881f02474225a64efce3e83644add6" data-recommend-id="image://d3881f02474225a64efce3e83644add6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The video editing interface in Dead Take." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The video editing interface in Dead Take." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Surgent Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d3881f02474225a64efce3e83644add6" data-recommend-id="image://d3881f02474225a64efce3e83644add6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The video editing interface in Dead Take." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We’re seeing this all through Chase’s eyes, and his voyeuristic role in this whole ordeal means we see more of Vinny’s character than probably anyone else, with much of the footage we see of Chase being taken from his initial, unsuccessful audition. <em>Dead Take </em>has the perspective of someone who has been pushed out or denied entry into a sacred, elite space, and by god, it sure speaks to the feeling of trying to break into a competitive artistic field where certain auteurs are put on a pedestal by just about everyone. Yeah, this is the kind of shit Hollywood has to deal with, but it’s also universally applicable to most creative industries. Whether you’re an actor, an artist, a musician, or hell, even a journalist, there’s a perception that there’s an in-crowd and that some people are so legendary that they cannot be so much as be questioned. To say a word against them is to incur their wrath, and that of the people who stand to gain something by being in their proximity. <em>Dead Take</em>’s horrific vision of these ideas is extreme, but it’s rooted in something so real that I had as much of a visceral reaction to the notes I found as I did to any of the more straightforward horrors I encountered in the self-aggrandizing museum Cain calls a home. I won’t spoil some of the mysteries I uncovered, but suffice it to say, <em>Dead Take</em>’s rancid vibes don’t just come from the tense, isolating atmosphere.</p><p>All that being said, the more straightforward scares are my biggest issue with <em>Dead Take</em>. I can handle a jump scare. I can handle two, even. My problem is that <em>Dead Take</em>’s use of them feels incredibly cheap and artificial. I know it’s currently in vogue to point out that “good” or “elevated” horror doesn’t rely on loud bangs and creepy monsters jumping out of walls to scare a viewer or player. While I think those critiques are often overblown and can carry an air of pretentious elitism, almost all of <em>Dead Take</em>’s jump scares are sudden distorted visions of Starr’s screaming face that appear on the screen without warning or any real diegetic context. This happens over and over, with increasing frequency as the game goes on, and I got pretty sick of it by the time I reached the final sequence. Sure, I could charitably read these as manifestations of Chase’s gradually decaying psyche, but they become so frequent and yet impossible to anticipate or connect to anything specific happening in the game that eventually, they no longer feel like real scares rooted in the world you’re moving through. All they did for me was disrupt my nervous system to the point where I had to brace myself every time I walked into a room, and eventually, I had to pause the game before I moved on because I knew I’d probably get a random bit of Starr screaming at me while I’m just trying to find a key or a USB stick.</p><figure id="" data-id="710917357cdc309b029094d23ccb1a1c" data-recommend-id="image://710917357cdc309b029094d23ccb1a1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hallway covered in movie posters with Vinny and Chase both depicted as the leads." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hallway covered in movie posters with Vinny and Chase both depicted as the leads." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Surgent Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="710917357cdc309b029094d23ccb1a1c" data-recommend-id="image://710917357cdc309b029094d23ccb1a1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hallway covered in movie posters with Vinny and Chase both depicted as the leads." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s a shame those stuttering screams are littered throughout a game I was otherwise drawn into. If you have the tolerance for jump scares, especially ones that have no real basis in the world, have at it. For everyone else, you might need to take some breaks walking through Cain’s mansion like I did, but once you’re past them, there’s a pretty compelling escape room mystery here, elevated by great performances from its two leads. <em>Dead Take </em>is scariest when it’s rooted in something real, and even if there’s a disclaimer assuring everyone it’s not based on anyone specific, know that Duke Cains walk among us.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/dead-take-review-ben-starr-neil-newbon-horror-game-1851787439]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>These days, many video games either tell you an extravagant story that you’ll play through once and then ditch, or they urge you to open your wallet and delve deep for cosmetics and battle passes on the free-to-play front, presumably forever. But if you venture over to the indie side of gaming, you’ll find genuine gems. One such is <em>RimWorld</em>. It’s a story-generator, according to its creator, Tynan Sylvester, in which the pawns you control and your choices create the ongoing tale. With the launch of the game’s latest expansion, <em>Odyssey</em>, introducing gravships, additional biomes, new animals, and more quests and rewards to uncover, it’s an excellent time to delve into <em>RimWorld</em>. I may be biased as I’ve spent nearly 700 hours with the game. But stick with me and you too might come to see what makes this game so special.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196918" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why You'll Fall In Love With This Indie Horror Romance Mashup" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="196918,196358,195579" data-current="196918"><div><p>Why You'll Fall In Love With This Indie Horror Romance Mashup</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22475.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h802557"><a id=""></a>So what is <em>RimWorld</em> all about?</h2><figure id="" data-id="aa175e61b0af28305889b80e5a6229b3" data-recommend-id="image://aa175e61b0af28305889b80e5a6229b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A colony set in an active volcano surrounded by lava in RimWorld." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A colony set in an active volcano surrounded by lava in RimWorld." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ludeon Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aa175e61b0af28305889b80e5a6229b3" data-recommend-id="image://aa175e61b0af28305889b80e5a6229b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A colony set in an active volcano surrounded by lava in RimWorld." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The colony sim genre went through something of a resurgence with the launch of <em>RimWorld</em>. Before that, it was relatively niche, but still popular in a cult following sort of way, thanks to <em>Dwarf Fortress</em>. It’s not about an overarching story; it’s about the tales you craft in the moment. In <em>RimWorld</em>, intelligent AI storytellers, like Randy Random, alter the experience based on how you’re faring in the moment. If you’re doing too well, with abundant food and resources, you might soon endure a horde of man-eating chinchillas ravaging your base and its crops. It’s all part of the experience.</p><p>This randomness is why most people who enjoy <em>RimWorld</em> really enjoy <em>RimWorld</em>. They don’t play for ten or twenty hours; they play for <em>thousands </em>of hours. They want to see what’s going to happen in the next episode of cannibal colony meets <em>The Sims</em>!</p><p>To give you an idea of what can happen in a colony, here’s an excerpt from a review I wrote on Steam about the game, which I think perfectly encapsulates the <em>RimWorld </em>experience:</p><p>“I started an ice sheet challenge with a single colonist. Thanks to the abundance of mods, my colonist soon discovered a talking tree in the wastes. His mind was forever altered. It wasn’t long before the kindly Lafayette was muttering to himself and chanting in odd tongues. He began to worship Cthulu in the mountains - alone and with supplies dwindling. It mattered not. The old god required sustenance of his own. Raiders came to pillage; none survived. They were placed upon the sacrifice table and offered to the tentacled one.”</p><h2 id="h802558"><a id=""></a>New player tips to help you avoid a colony crisis</h2><figure id="" data-id="7a12b1468b64620e336ff6a79b46ee06" data-recommend-id="image://7a12b1468b64620e336ff6a79b46ee06" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A late-game base with storage and base defenses in RimWorld." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A late-game base with storage and base defenses in RimWorld." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ludeon Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7a12b1468b64620e336ff6a79b46ee06" data-recommend-id="image://7a12b1468b64620e336ff6a79b46ee06" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A late-game base with storage and base defenses in RimWorld." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re a new player who recently picked up <em>RimWorld </em>on sale, I’m sorry. No, not welcome or ‘nice to have you here’. Just, I’m sorry. You’re about to either lose many, many hours of your free time or rage so hard as your first colony crumbles into dust that you’ll never pick up the game again.</p><p>If you’re in the former camp, then here are a few tips to help you survive the onslaught of Randy Random and Cassandra Classic:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Don’t hesitate to pause the game</strong>. While the default game speed isn’t overwhelmingly zippy, there’s a lot of map to explore, including under-mountain areas, colonists to manage, animals to hunt, and monsters to flee from. Your attention will be pulled in ten different directions simultaneously every few seconds, so pause to give yourself some breathing room.</li><li><strong>Defend your colony to the death</strong>. Upon crash-landing planetside, there are a few necessities to consider first: food, shelter, and safety. These three pillars are paramount to your colony’s success, but so many new players overlook safety. They think building in a mountain like a dwarf secures their existence. It doesn’t. You’ll want to consider traps, sandbags, etc.</li><li><strong>Build for efficiency, not aesthetics</strong>. Once you’re more experienced, then you’ll start designing bases that incorporate vibes or whatever Reddit says these days. For now, focus on efficiency. Wood burns, granite doesn’t. Your refrigerator and kitchen may remain in the same room to eliminate wasted time. Your Research Bench isn’t like other workbenches, in that it requires a sterile room to boost your colonists’ research rate, so separate it from the rest of the rabble.</li></ul><p>I could go on endlessly, but these tips will start you off strong.</p><h2 id="h802559"><a id=""></a>A look at <em>RimWorld</em>’s wild side: modding</h2><figure id="" data-id="f6afbdc16eb09b7cabf9b1c1cc731739" data-recommend-id="image://f6afbdc16eb09b7cabf9b1c1cc731739" data-format="png" data-width="1145" data-height="718" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A look at the front page of the RimWorld Workshop on Steam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A look at the front page of the RimWorld Workshop on Steam." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Ludeon Studios / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f6afbdc16eb09b7cabf9b1c1cc731739" data-recommend-id="image://f6afbdc16eb09b7cabf9b1c1cc731739" data-format="png" data-width="1145" data-height="718" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A look at the front page of the RimWorld Workshop on Steam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>RimWorld </em>draws in tens of thousands of players daily and has an all-time peak player count of over 62,000. It’s safe to assume people love the game. And as it’s on PC, the modding community is obsessively active. Seriously, you can find total conversion mods that turn <em>RimWorld </em>into <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> or <em>The Witcher 3</em>. Anything you need or want, the modding community delivers!</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Quality of Life mods</strong>, such as better storage solutions, greater pawn control, pawn editors, an improved camera, and the must-haves, like interaction bubbles that add flavor to your characters.</li><li><strong>Content mods</strong>, such as additional weapons, vehicles, animals, workbenches, hygiene, oil production industries, sushi cooking, fishing, mining, refrigerators, a Roomba, giant crops straight out of Stardew Valley, and of course, anime women.</li><li><strong>Total conversion mods</strong>, such as for <em>Dune</em>, <em>The Witcher</em>, <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>, <em>Killzone</em>, a medieval setting, a zombie apocalypse, and much more.</li><li><strong>Adult mods</strong>, such as…you know what, I checked out the offerings at Loverslab specifically for this bullet point, and I feel gross. There’s a lot, from furry content to animated erections for colonists.</li></ul><h2 id="h802560"><a id=""></a>What do people think about <em>RimWorld</em>?</h2><figure id="" data-id="b40b8703318cfacec2931d356128940b" data-recommend-id="image://b40b8703318cfacec2931d356128940b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A closer look at the Overwhelming Positive reviews for RimWorld on Steam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A closer look at the Overwhelming Positive reviews for RimWorld on Steam." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Ludeon Studios / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b40b8703318cfacec2931d356128940b" data-recommend-id="image://b40b8703318cfacec2931d356128940b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A closer look at the Overwhelming Positive reviews for RimWorld on Steam." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Well, for starters, it’s one of the highest-rated titles on Steam. But if you need a professional’s opinion, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rimworld-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rimworld-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rock Paper Shotgun</a></span> calls it a “wonderful fiasco. But it doesn’t take long to realise that this is something special.”</p><p>Would you prefer to hear from everyday people? Over on Steam, one user by the name of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198262566904/recommended/294100/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198262566904/recommended/294100/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Detrail</a></span> said: “This is quite simply, the best game ever made. Nothing will top it.”</p><p>Another by the name of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198097094494/recommended/294100/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198097094494/recommended/294100/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Dog</a></span> says, “2,000 hours in, I can say it’s okay.”</p><p>As someone with approximately 700 hours and counting, I can attest to its enrapturing qualities. No two games wind up the same, with some colonies crumbling into dust within a matter of days after planetfall, and others surviving through catastrophes big and small until your pawns feel almost godlike.</p><hr><p><br><em>RimWorld </em>is available now on Windows PCs, and its latest expansion, Odyssey, launched on July 11.  </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/rimworld-odyssey-expansion-colony-randy-random-1851787430]]></content:encoded>
