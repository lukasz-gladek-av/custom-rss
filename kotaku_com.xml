On Arrakis, that’s true. Between the sandworms and the other deadly players, you’d be hard pressed to find anyone or anything friendly. Even worse, your only haven—the base you build—isn’t free or safe. You owe money to the local government for plopping down a few foundations and creating a habitat. If you don’t pay, oh, they’ll take it from you by force, by god. Here’s everything to know about paying your taxes in <em>Dune Awakening</em> to avoid the Imperial government’s wrath! We can’t help you with paying your actual taxes though—but be sure to do that, too!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196394" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="97" data-playlist="196394,197541,196013" data-current="196394"><div><p>The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21942.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h16338"><a id=""></a>How to pay the tax man</h2><p>Initially, you’ll likely have to pay the Ornithopter Pilot at a local trade post for a ride to either Arrakeen or Harko Village.

The port will launch on July 17, but this early footage may be running the 2.3 update already, because fans have taken note of what might be an autopilot icon when V gets behind the wheel. <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt </em>had a similar function when you rode your horse, allowing you to trot along to your destination without having to move your character yourself. If <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> got a similar feature, it would actually be a genuine improvement to the game because its cars handle like they’re hydroplaning. Motorcycles run well enough, though. However, sometimes the plot requires you to drive a car for races and high-speed chases, and that shit <em>sucked</em>.

There are many video games that capture this spirit of stillness, of just being in awe of a visual spectacle that communicates a sense of place.
