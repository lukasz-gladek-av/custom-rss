            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Remember last month when Game Freak revealed that Hawlucha would get a mega form in </span><i><span>Pok√©mon </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>with an </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-hawlucha-machamp-trailer-2000620960"><span>animated sports drama</span></a><span> starring the luchador bird and a Machamp? Well, Nintendo partnered with real luchadors to bring this fight to life. Last night, </span><i><span>Pok√©mon </span></i><span>took over a Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre event in Mexico City that had several luchadors dressed in </span><i><span>Pok√©mon</span></i><span>-themed costumes, including two who referenced the rivalry between Hawlucha and Machamp.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pok√©mon</span></i><span> and Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre collaboration was a two-hour event full of drama, mayhem, and references to different Pok√©mon in both costuming and in the set dressing. The ring in which the bouts took place included </span><i><span>Pok√©mon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>branding (or </span><i><span>Leyendas Pok√©mon Z-A</span></i><span>, as it‚Äôs called in Spanish). Attendees were given paper hats of Hawlucha and Machamp to wear in the stands, and Pikachu and Eevee mascots were hanging out the whole time. If you want to watch the whole thing, it‚Äôs on </span><i><span>Pok√©mon </span></i><span>Latam‚Äôs YouTube channel, but do keep in mind this was a Spanish event. I don‚Äôt speak a word of the language, and the vibes are still pretty great.</span></p>  <p><span>Those who attended the event were gifted a </span><i><span>Pok√©mon Home</span></i><span> medal featuring art of Hawlucha and Machamp squaring up. As of right now, there are no plans to distribute this anywhere else outside the event. For those of us who couldn‚Äôt make it out to Mexico City, the VOD is still a really fun intersection of </span><i><span>Pok√©mon</span></i><span> and a specific culture. Lucha libre wrestling and its aesthetics have been featured in </span><i><span>Pok√©mon </span></i><span>before, both with Hawlucha itself and the Pikachu Libre cosplay variant in </span><i><span>Omega Ruby </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Alpha Sapphire</span></i><span>, but this event takes that energy to a new level, and it‚Äôs fun to see people in the crowd playing into that crossover with their own costumes and chants.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="cs" dir="ltr">M√≠stico Charmander üî•<br>This is peak <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CMLL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CMLL</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/LeyendasPok%C3%A9monZA?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#LeyendasPok√©monZA</a> <a href="https://t.co/zYFYDzhBfo">pic.twitter.com/zYFYDzhBfo</a></p> <p>‚Äî Emmanuel üêù (@Emmanurl_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Emmanurl_/status/1971391237069603185?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The most aura there's even been in 1 fist bump holy shit<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/cmll?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#cmll</a> <a href="https://t.co/AtRD8nZSqL">pic.twitter.com/AtRD8nZSqL</a></p> <p>‚Äî Pete (@pinklightsticc) <a href="https://twitter.com/pinklightsticc/status/1971402106566516846?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">LOUD ASS TOGEPI CHANTS IN ARENA MEXICO üò≠<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CMLL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CMLL</a> <a href="https://t.co/q5awnYy46U">pic.twitter.com/q5awnYy46U</a></p> <p>‚Äî Pete (@pinklightsticc) <a href="https://twitter.com/pinklightsticc/status/1971388353636675678?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">THIS UMBREON MASK IN THE AUDIENCE <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CMLL?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CMLL</a> <a href="https://t.co/ljUzo9naIe">pic.twitter.com/ljUzo9naIe</a></p> <p>‚Äî Pete (@pinklightsticc) <a href="https://twitter.com/pinklightsticc/status/1971398611830538419?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Hawlucha wins the fight thanks to its Mega Evolution in the trailer, so if Machamp wants to stand a chance, it‚Äôll probably need a new form of its own.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As much as we all like to joke that ‚Äúthe PS5 has no games,‚Äù that‚Äôs simply not true. Mine has plenty of PS4 games on it! Ba-dum-tiss. Anyway, there are some awesome PlayStation 5 exclusives. The amazing and cute platformer <em>Astro Bot </em>won Game of the Year last year. <em>Ghost of Y≈çtei </em>is dropping in under a week. Plus people are still sleeping on 2021‚Äôs incredible third-person shooter roguelike <em>Returnal</em>. And then yes of course there really are a bunch of good PS4 games to check if you missed them last generation. A lot of them have great-looking updates too like everything going on with <em>The Last of Us </em>remakes and remasters. Point is there are lots of good games to play, but do you have enough storage space for all of them?</p>
<p>Expand you PS5 storage with the help of Seagate‚Äôs officially-licensed game drive for PlayStation consoles. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4328/">This external hard drive connect to your system over USB 3.2 and will&nbsp; let you boost your capacity to store games by a full 2TB</a>. Right now, Amazon has the drive discounted down from $90 to just $80. A $10 savings may not sound like much, but that‚Äôs already halfway to getting you <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4328/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The PS5 base model only comes with 800GB of internal space (1TB on the Slim), and some of that isn‚Äôt even usable to you as it‚Äôs got all the system stuff on it that makes the console work. Really you‚Äôre working with roughly. The base model really has about 667GB while the Slim has a bout 842.2GB for you to work with, saving your games. This Seagate drive will more than triple your ability to store your game data. nor more deleting and redownloading.</p>



<h2>One Small Caveat</h2>
<p>There is a catch though. You can‚Äôt actually&nbsp;<em>play</em> you games off this external drive. The PS5 requires much faster read/write speeds than this supports. You might be thinking, ‚ÄúOkay, then what the heck is the point?‚Äù Well, this drive is still helpful because you can move you games from it to your internal drive when you want to play them. This is a much, much faster process than redownloading a game over the internet. Think of it like the digital version of taking your disc off the shelf and popping it into your console. The good news is you can play your PS4 games directly off of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4328/">Unlike the internal SSDs available to expand your PS5 storage, this drive requires no tools to install as it just connects over USB.</a> That makes it totally portable so you can bring it over to a friend‚Äôs house and fire it up on their PS5 if you wish. Have your whole gaming library on the go.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Will<em> Resident Evil 9</em> struggle on Switch 2? Is the new <em>Borderlands 4</em> patch really broken or do players just need to be better at compiling their shaders? And where the hell is the next <em>Metal Gear Solid Master Collection</em>? Welcome to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‚Äòs daily roundup of gaming news and culture. While all the big gaming showcases have wrapped up, there are still a few more days of Tokyo Game Show proper until the last big gaming festival of the year wraps up. Then it‚Äôs on to the fall‚Äôs next batch of big game releases. Yes, I‚Äôm talking about you <em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em>.</p> <h2>PlayStation boss touts PS5 as Sony‚Äôs most lucrative gaming box yet</h2> <p>Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Hideaki Nishino was the keynote speaker at Tokyo Game Show 2025 and his topic was the PlayStation Store. Covering its evolution and current financial dominance, he flashed a chart showing how revenues have kept climbing with each new console. What‚Äôs interesting is that this is happening despite PS5 sales tracking only slightly ahead of the PS4. So where is the growth coming from? In part its the explosion in microtransactions in free-to-play games like <em>Fortnite</em>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nishino-san says PlayStation 5 is the most successful generation in PlayStation history. <a href="https://t.co/E5feupYHGr">pic.twitter.com/E5feupYHGr</a></p> <p>‚Äî Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1971034274536272100?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It‚Äôs also the expansion of subscription services like PS Plus. And then there‚Äôs the fact that people are still playing on PS4, so even though the install bases are similar, the overall footprint of active PlayStation players spending money is seemingly larger. Plus the consoles keep getting more expensive. With graphs like this, did Sony really need to raise the price of the PS5 another $50 nearly five years after it launched? Either way, it‚Äôs an interesting data point amid debates about console makers going platform-agnostic. Will PS6 just be a PC with a PlayStation logo on it, or is Sony, like Nintendo, married to the hardware business long-term?</p>

 <h2><em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> dev‚Äôs next 2D action game is out in November</h2>  <p><em>Possessor(s)</em> is Heart Machine‚Äôs first stab at the Metroidvania formula and arrives the same year its loot shooter, <em>Hyper Light Breaker</em>, entered Early Access. There‚Äôs a new trailer showing off more of the game about a high school student who forms a pact with a demon to uncover the mystery behind a catastrophe that‚Äôs befallen Sanzu city. It‚Äôs out on PS5 and PC on November 11.</p>

 <h2>One of the last significant updates for <em>The Witcher 3</em> has been delayed</h2> <p>CD Projekt Red‚Äôs fantasy RPG was supposed to get cross-platform mod support across PC and consoles before the end of the year. The update will <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thewitcher.com/post/3lzochplzqc2h">now arrive in 2026</a>, but with no clear window for when players can expect it. Once it finally arrives, PS5 and Xbox Series X players will finally get to experience all of the extra fan-made content modders created for the PC version.</p>

 <h2>Gearbox has some advice if <em>Borderlands 4</em> is running poorly for you <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-fov-slider-consoles-ps5-update-pc-crashing-patch-performance-2000628823">after the latest patch</a></h2> <p>The studio <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1971285941194195311">blames some initial reports</a> of even worse performance following the new update on shader compilation. Basically, the game has to recompile all of the shaders again, which can mess things up while running in the background. ‚ÄúStuttering issues should resolve over time as the shaders continue to compile in the background while playing,‚Äù the studio wrote on X. ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre still experiencing issues after 15 minutes of continuous play, you can also clear your shader cache via your video card manufacturer‚Äôs approved method.‚Äù</p>

 <p>One fan offered <a href="https://x.com/Ki11ersix/status/1971286391964434615">their own tip</a>: ‚Äúquit the game once after launching and relaunch it. Now travel into a zone and back out (Idolator Sol‚Äôs or a Vault will work) this should compile a BUNCH of shaders and start improving the smoothness.‚Äù Big-budget gaming in 2025 folks!</p>

 <h2><em>Resident Evil 9</em> looks pretty decent in first Switch 2 hands-ons</h2>  <p><em>Requiem</em> is the first game in the survival horror series to come day-and-date to a Nintendo platform. Early impressions seem to be that while the game looks and runs best on PC and high-end consoles, the Switch 2 version still performs admirably, especially in hand-held mode. So far both <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> have both been better than expected on Nintendo‚Äôs new console. Hopefully other third-party ports can continue the trend.</p> <h2>A <em>Metal Gear Solid 4</em> remaster will arrive eventually</h2> <p>Fans waiting for news on the status of the <em>Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 2</em> got an update via a panel at Tokyo Game Show. According to <a href="https://x.com/Kuwabara357/status/1971126048017322123">a translation by X user Kuwabara357</a><span>, it will still take a little longer for the next batch of games to get ported. ‚ÄúThe project is moving forward properly, and we believe it‚Äôs shaping up to be something enjoyable really,‚Äù Konami producer Noriaki Okamura reportedly said. ‚ÄúSo please wait just a bit more, more information is coming.‚Äù</span></p> <h2><em>Payday 2</em> dev apologizes for price-gouging fans</h2> <p>The<em> Payday 2</em> Infamous Collection bundle, which contains every piece of DLC the multiplayer heist shooter has ever received, recently jumped in price from $118 to $170. Starbreeze also announced a new $5-a-month subscription option for players to access all of it. Fans obviously thought the timing of this was a bit cynical.</p> <p>‚ÄúThe community has been pretty clear about how it looks next to the subscription launch‚Äîand they‚Äôre not wrong, it‚Äôs terrible timing,‚Äù Starbreeze‚Äôs Gustav Nisser <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/starbreeze-says-sorry-reverses-price-increase-on-payday-2-dlc-bundle-we-definitely-didnt-handle-this-right/">told <em>PC Gamer</em></a>. ‚ÄúWe definitely didn‚Äôt handle this right, and we‚Äôll be apologizing to the community. Hopefully there will be at least some acceptance that this was an honest mistake.‚Äù</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/bowser-leaves-nintendo-of-america-2000628868">Nintendo is shaking things up at Nintendo of America with the retirement of Bowser</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-israel-palestine-gaza-phone-calls-xbox-cloud-2000628764">Microsoft has taken the first step toward addressing the Xbox BDS boycott over Israel</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-6-biggest-map-japan-open-world-size-comparison-2026-ps5-xbox-2000628855"><em>Forza Horizon 6</em>‚Äòs open world take on Japan will be the game‚Äôs biggest map yet</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-4-8-star-kingston-ssd-in-all-capacities-at-record-low-cheaper-than-samsung-or-crucial-2000628887</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Lots of awesome games came out this year from <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> to <em>Blue Prince</em> to <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>. <em>Silent Hill f</em> and <em>Borderlands 4</em> just dropped along with the 1.0 release of <em>Hades 2</em>. If you want to play all of these plus all the other cool stuff that came out in 2025&nbsp;<em>and</em> hang onto all of your other games, you may want to expand your storage. Over the past decade or longer, game file sizes have really started to balloon larger and larger. Some titles even clock in over 100GB. So get yourself a solid internal SSD like the Kingston NV3 drive. It‚Äôs available in sizes up to 4TB and is currently on sale.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4323/">Breaking down the different models and discounts, let‚Äôs start with the smallest. Kingston has 500GB option for its Gen 4√ó4 SSD</a>. That one normally goes for $54, but it‚Äôs now down to just $39 ‚Äî saving you $15. Going up, we have the 1TB model. That‚Äôs usually $80, but the sale has it to just $58 ‚Äî a savings of $22. The 2TB is $43 off, bringing it from&nbsp; $158 to just $115. Then lastly we have the massive 4TB model going for $230. That‚Äôs a $91 discount off of the starting price of $320. All discounts work out to between 27-28%.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4323/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast Load Times</h2>
<p>The Kingston NV3 SSD has remarkable read and write speeds, coming in at up to 6,000 MB/s for read speeds and up to 5,000 MB/s for write speeds. That means quick load times in all your games. Hope you‚Äôre good at them because you‚Äôll have hardly any time to read those quick tips that appear while waiting for levels to load. Those speeds will also help with plenty of non-gaming tasks ranging from video editing to working with large datasets ‚Äî really any kind of hardware intensive workflow.</p>
<p>Check the specs of what you‚Äôre looking to install it on. So long as your laptop, tower, or mini PC has support for PCle 4.0, you‚Äôll be good to go.</p>



<p>If you‚Äôre not a PC gamer and are instead looking to expand to storage of your PlayStation 5, it is compatible but with a catch. You will have to separately pick up a heatsink. These little metal casings are used to help dissipate heat to prevent overheating. They‚Äôre pretty easy to install into your PS5. You can just follow any number of video tutorials on YouTube.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4323/">For a limited time, you can save up to $91 on this internal SSD from Kingston</a>. Choose between four different capacities, starting at just $39.</p>
