Granted, it’s not like the movie is lacking in characters, and it’s probably a good thing that Marvel isn’t squeezing every single one of them into an already-bloated movie. Will something terrible happen to some of the cast to make space for other heroes to play a role in <em>Avengers: Secret Wars</em>, the sequel premiering in 2027? <em>Infinity War </em>temporarily killed off half the cast so <em>Endgame </em>could focus on a smaller group of heroes, after all, and Cumberbatch has already been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/news/benedict-cumberbatch-doctor-strange-future-sherlock-sundance-1236281025/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/benedict-cumberbatch-doctor-strange-future-sherlock-sundance-1236281025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed to appear in <em>Secret Wars</em></a></span>, so that’s at least one missing hero accounted for. It’s hard to even speculate about what <em>Secret Wars </em>will entail; the last time the MCU did a giant crossover film, it emerged after years of setup and foreshadowing, but that’s largely absent here because the series has been pivoting away from its previous plans in the wake of Kang actor Jonathan Majors’ domestic violence case. Anyway, the big takeaway here for me is that I guess I’ll just have to emotionally prepare myself to not see Star-Lord for at least two more years. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Then the PS5 arrived in 2020 and Sony turned its attention to live-service gaming with the hopes of capturing a piece of the growing multiplayer market. Former executive Shawn Layden, who abruptly left Sony after more than 30 years of service right before the new hardware launched, recently suggested that strategy pivot was part of the reason behind his departure. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,197298" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“To be honest, you know, the company was making some strategic decisions about where they want to take the platform in the future with a heavy emphasis in games as a service, live-service gaming, subscription formulas, recurring revenue, whatnot, and that was kind of not my wheelhouse,” Layden, who was Chairman of SIE Worldwide Studios from 2014 to 2019, said in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/AutPkiVDSoQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/AutPkiVDSoQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recent podcast interview</a></span> with Save State Plus. </p><p>“I just make things like<em> God of War</em> and <em>Spider-Man </em>and <em>Last of Us</em> and <em>Uncharted </em>[and]<em> Horizon</em>,” he continued, “I didn’t have the vision or the energy to try to, you know, take it to this this new area of live-service gaming so, all that considered, it seemed like a good time to step down after 32 years at Sony.”</p><p>Layden left Sony in September 2019, a little over a year before the launch of the PS5. “His visionary leadership will be greatly missed,” the PlayStation account <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1178808151962816514?s=20&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1178808151962816514?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> at the time, “We wish him success in future endeavors and are deeply grateful for his years of service.

They’ve also seen the live-service pivot go nowhere quickly. While PS5 sales continue to outpace those of the PS4 in the U.S., even without a price cut over four years into the console generation, there’s a sense that Sony’s live-service ambitions this hardware cycle have come at the expense of delivering more of the single-player hits and experiments with new franchises the publisher’s first-party portfolio has historically been known for. </p><p>And the fruits of the live-service approach have been few and far between. On one side of the ledger is a game like <em>Helldivers 2</em>, which despite its shocking success was technically a second-party game continuing an IP from the PS4 years. On the other side are flops like<em> Concord</em>, the stagnation of <em>Destiny 2</em>, and a graveyard of cancelled projects including everything from <em>The Last of Us Online </em>to a multiplayer <em>God of War </em>spin-off. </p><p>There are still upcoming multiplayer projects from Sony like heist shooter <em>FairGame$ </em>waiting in the wings, but the company has now cancelled far more of them than it previously promised to release by 2026. A spokesperson for Sony told Bloomberg earlier this year that it will continue to make both single-player and multiplayer games, though it’s unclear what the exact ratio will be moving forward. The company recently revealed new single-player projects, including one from Naughty Dog <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-ps5-actors-1851722128&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-ps5-actors-1851722128">called <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em></a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/saros-release-date-trailer-gameplay-roguelike-1851762075&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/saros-release-date-trailer-gameplay-roguelike-1851762075">one from Housemarque called <em>Saros</em></a></span>, both of which look promising but could still be years away from release. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s unclear just how big a role the X-Men will play in the film, given Marvel still hasn’t properly integrated the mutant team into the cinematic universe yet, but even the actors that have been announced make it sound like the group itself will play a big role in whatever’s going on in the 2026 movie. Stewart and Grammer have both appeared in the MCU as multiverse variants of their characters. A version of Professor X showed up in <em>Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</em> as a founding member of the Illuminati, and Beast appeared in the post-credits scene of <em>The Marvels</em>. It’s unclear if the versions who show up in <em>Doomsday </em>will be the original characters from the <em>X-Men</em> films or if more multiverse shenanigans are afoot.</p><p>The MCU has been in a weird place after pivoting away from its planned Kang arc, so even with all these names, there’s not as much foreshadowing or connective tissue to speculate on as there was the last time the series did a big crossover event with <em>Infinity War</em>. I’m curious to see what <em>Doomsday</em> does to tie all these characters together when it hasn’t been given the same ramp-up because right now, this just seems like a recipe for cameo slop. I wonder how much money they had to pay Stewart and McKellen to come back. It’s gotta be some ungodly number, right?</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The duo are also producing the untitled series via their production company, Midnight Radio. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/scooby-doo-live-action-series-netflix-1235985955/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/scooby-doo-live-action-series-netflix-1235985955/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The show was previously reported to exist in 2024.</a></span> </p><p>Here’s the official logline for the upcoming Scooby show: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>During their final summer at camp, old friends Shaggy and Daphne get embroiled in a haunting mystery surrounding a lonely lost Great Dane puppy that may have been a witness to a supernatural murder. Together with the pragmatic and scientific townie, Velma, and the strange, but ever so handsome new kid, Freddy, they set out to solve the case that is pulling each of them into a creepy nightmare that threatens to expose all of their secrets.</p></blockquote><p>I didn’t have a “Scooby-Doo Watches A Person Die” show on my 2025 bingo card, but here we are. Of course, it’s possible that by the end of the first season it will be revealed that nobody died and it was all a scam by some angry janitor or rich landowner. Maybe a mask will even be ripped off of someone’s face in a dramatic fashion?</p><p>“We’re thrilled to collaborate with our longstanding partners at Berlanti Productions and with Midnight Radio to bring the legendary <em>Scooby-Doo</em> franchise to a live-action series for the first time,” said Clancy Collins White, president of creative affairs for Warner Bros. Television. “It’s no mystery why audiences continue to love these iconic characters after more than a half century. We’re excited for a new generation to discover Mystery Inc. And we’re grateful to our partners at Netflix for the opportunity.”</p><p> “Mystery, Inc. is back in business! We’re excited to bring <em>Scooby-Doo</em> to TV as a live-action series for the first time,” said Peter Friedlander, vice president of scripted series for Netflix. </p><p>I can’t wait for this show to randomly drop on Netflix with little marketing, get buried by the algorithm and never get a second season while a few angry fans complain about it the whole time. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
