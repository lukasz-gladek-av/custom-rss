A remake of a 1997 tactics game? In this economy? </p><p>This new version will include both the classic RPG and a new enhanced version that includes new graphics and voice acting. Here’s the trailer for this long-rumored remake. </p><p><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>, directed by the famed Yasumi Matsuno,<em>&nbsp;</em>follows the story of Ramza Beoulve. He’s the bastard son of a respected general, who becomes a mercenary after his faith in the nobility is shattered in the face of how their  petty power grabs lead to ruin for the people they were supposed to be serving. Eventually things go sideways and a tale of war, tragedy, and political intrigue gives way to a mystical showdown with evil demons. It also features a top-notch job system, gripping unit customization, lovely battlefield dioramas, and an amazing soundtrack.</p><p>The game was previously revised in a 2007 PlayStation Portable port called <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions</em> that featured some additional end-game elements and a much improved translation. It was the definitive way to play the game, outside of an awful slow-down bug during some battle animations. That version is also available on mobile and PC, but has never been playable on newer consoles. </p><p>Square Enix’s <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> remake comes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ff-tactics-xenogears-vagrant-story-remaster-rpgs-1850621353&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ff-tactics-xenogears-vagrant-story-remaster-rpgs-1850621353">as several other games have either been remastered</a></span> in HD or given HD-2D glow-ups, like <em>Star Ocean: Second Story</em> and <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em>. Only <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>has gotten the full-blown hyper-realistic 3D remake treatment. While some fans might prefer a sequel or new franchise to the publisher fiddling with its old games, I’m fine with it, especially in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>’ case. One of the best of all time deserves to make a comeback in style. </p><p>. <br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
