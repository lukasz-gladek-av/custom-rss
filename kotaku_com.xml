            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The gaming world hasn’t talked enough about how it feels to get good at the original <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> for the NES. I mean, I get it, it’s a notoriously brutal example of “Nintendo Hard” difficulty. I still have nightmares about those endlessly respawning birds that boomerang relentlessly around protagonist Ryu Hayabusa. Yet with enough time, practice, and memorization, it’s possible to lay those hordes of 8-bit foes low in a split second of precise button presses. Once overwhelming challenges give way to the intoxicating realization of “whoa, did I just <em>do </em>that?” where your hands react faster than your brain can process what’s going on. If it weren’t for the next threat lurking right around the corner, you’d just sit there in awe of how absolutely cool you felt.</p><p>I bring this up because The Game Kitchen’s <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em> is a pure distillation of “whoa, did I just <em>do </em>that!?” with virtually none of the trial-and-error frustration that its predecessors demanded. Even if the developers hadn’t gone on record and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/features/i-cant-believe-this-is-happening-the-game-kitchen-on-reviving-ninja-gaiden&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/i-cant-believe-this-is-happening-the-game-kitchen-on-reviving-ninja-gaiden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proclaimed their love for the series</a></span>, that deep level of mechanical understanding about what makes vintage <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>awesome would have been evident just from a few minutes of playing <em>Ragebound</em>. This team <em>gets it</em>.</p><p><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound </em>makes its homage to its NES predecessors obvious from the jump. Opening with the fatal duel between Ryu’s father and the mysterious gray ninja that series fans will remember from the first console <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, our story begins with Ryu taking up the Hayabusa family’s sword and heading to the United States on a quest for revenge. However, <em>Ragebound </em>immediately strikes its own path by instead following the story of Ryu’s protege Kenji, who stays at home to deal with the <em>rather small matter</em> of a demon invasion. That’s right, Ryu sticks around for a tutorial and a tricky boss fight that’ll put new players in their place, but afterwards he’s out for virtually the entire adventure. Vengeance waits for no one.</p><figure id="" data-id="7c24e25e4cf33a51a5e918c38acaec11" data-recommend-id="image://7c24e25e4cf33a51a5e918c38acaec11" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A gameplay screenshot shows a blue-clad ninja attacking a large blue monstrous figure of some sort on a wooden structure in the water.

Just as The Game Kitchen had to carve its own vision for <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>with respect to the works that came before it, so too do we follow a hero who carves his own destiny using the skills of his master. You’ll miss a few references and leitmotifs if this is your first <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, but otherwise it’s perfectly accessible to newcomers.</p><p>Kenji’s path eventually crosses with Kumori, a kunoichi of the Black Spider Clan that stands opposed to the Hayabusas. Extenuating circumstances force Kenji and Kumori into an unholy alliance, and the two embark on a journey that sees them facing off against both man and demonkind alike. The beats from here on out share similarities to those of the first <em>Ninja Gaiden</em>, even if <em>Ragebound </em>is a self-contained side story. The <em>Ninja Gaiden </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://jisho.org/search/gaiden&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://jisho.org/search/gaiden" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gaiden</a></span>, if you will.</p><h2 id="h618366"><a id=""></a>You’re that ninja</h2><p>While Kenji may be Ryu’s student, he plays just as fluidly as his master ever did. Whether he’s climbing walls, dodge rolling to pass through otherwise unavoidable attacks, or bouncing off enemies mid-air to execute sick aerial combos, every button press feels impeccably responsive. And despite the impressive range of attack and movement options Kenji has at his disposal, they’re all made possible through a simple control scheme that wouldn’t feel out of place in an actual SNES game.<em> </em>Aside from a few <em>very </em>specific quirks (does my aerial attack have a cooldown?), I always felt in complete control while playing <em>Ragebound</em>.</p><p>And trust me, I needed every tool in the toolbox to succeed. The earliest levels aren’t afraid to litter the screen with bad guys to take down, giving me little time to react before I’d take damage. Yet nine times out of ten, before my eyes could register everything that was happening, I’d perform a flurry of jumps, rolls, and slashes that’d clear the screen instantly. It’s not like I just relied on one tried-and-true strategy either, as I’d intuitively try attacks that just felt cool to do in the moment, often leading to huge payoffs.</p><p>While I’d like to chalk this up to my hardcore retro gaming skills, those consistent feelings of being <em>so cool </em>are a testament to how impeccably balanced <em>Ragebound </em>is. For instance, most enemies can be killed in a single strike, but there are also bulkier foes who won’t go down from one single, standard slash. Meanwhile, there are also glowing enemies who can grant Kenji a supercharged attack that cleaves right through these more imposing adversaries. This setup incentivizes you to think about the order in which you wish to take out your opposition, and even in chaotic situations, spotting a graceful way to navigate the fray and deploy those supercharged attacks on more formidable foes felt easy and natural. It helps that <em>Ragebound</em> features such fluidly animated pixel art that reading enemy attacks and telegraphs is a cinch. I didn’t master every encounter right off the bat, but I’d have a good idea of what I should have done differently to avoid a hit or keep my combos going.</p><p>Most importantly, <em>man</em>, does <em>Ragebound</em> feel as good as it looks. The sounds of cutting through small fry never get old, and those moments when the action stops just as Kenji uses a supercharged attack to slice a huge foe clean in half <em>really </em>convey the weight of the blow. I rode a consistent stream of “whoa, did I just <em>do </em>that!?” highs, whether or not I’d practiced a stage before. There were moments where I was completely immersed in a flow state, feeling just the right amount of adrenaline coursing through my veins as I played out ninja-based power fantasies I’d never actually realized I had.</p><p>And for all the ways in which its design elegantly encourages precision, I also always felt I had ample room to make mistakes, and <em>Ragebound </em>barely dwells on deaths before throwing Kenji back in the action. Rather than encouraging mastery through failure, the game feels <em>so </em>rewarding when played well that I never wanted to settle for a victory by the skin of my teeth. It helps that each stage looks and feels so distinctive that there’s nary a repetitive challenge to be found, even when bosses reappear later in the game. I could do without the two short vehicle-based autoscroller stages, but other than that, it’s all bangers here.</p><h2 id="h618367"><a id=""></a>I can’t believe it’s not Tecmo</h2><p><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em> brilliantly evolves the gameplay of its vintage 2D predecessors in a way that feels fresh, modern, yet familiar all at once. I do wish I could say the same about its storytelling. I get that plot typically isn’t a priority in retro revivals like this, but the first <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>on the NES was a trailblazer when it came to narrative. The original manga-style cutscenes are well-directed given their vintage and limitations, and the story aimed high with surprise deaths, big plot twists, and a climactic finale. It’s nothing mind-blowing nowadays, but you just weren’t getting this kind of storytelling in stage-based action games back in 1989 (settle down <em>Astyanax </em>fans, I see you).</p><p><em>Ragebound </em>does start strong in this regard. The Game Kitchen utilizes its signature art style from <em>Blasphemous</em> to weave together some impressive cinematics that pay loving homage to the series’ origins. However, once the game enters its third act, the story mostly devolves into small quips between frenemies Kenji and Kumori with little else to keep the narrative exciting. I’d go as far as to say that 1989’s <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> actually makes <em>Ragebound</em> feel simple by comparison. There’s the occasional twist, but I never felt especially connected to what was happening on screen.</p><figure id="" data-id="9c62723dbd47cf9c1f7ef907bc91d058" data-recommend-id="image://9c62723dbd47cf9c1f7ef907bc91d058" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image from a cutscene shows the blue-clad ninja looking distraught, his head in his hand.

An older man sits across from him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s a shame, because <em>Ragebound</em> ends on a note that <em>should </em>have been meaningful and impactful had the buildup been better executed. The moment in question didn’t linger in a way that let me sit with what had happened either, which made the entire ending feel like clumsy tonal whiplash. Even completely disregarding the story, I thought <em>Ragebound </em>ended an act too soon. The set pieces in the end convey more “rising action” than “climax of the story,” a problem that I’m sure is observable by even the most dedicated cutscene skipper. By the time I hit the final boss, I was thinking less “oh this is <em>it</em>!” and more “oh, <em>this </em>is it?” It’s a bummer of a way to end an otherwise strong journey.</p><h2 id="h618368"><a id=""></a>It’s Blasphemously good</h2><p>I could certainly nitpick at <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em> more. Hitboxes occasionally felt a little too big. I didn’t love a few of the enemy types near the end. The unlockable hard mode modifies an early game boss in a way that felt way too rigid, creating an awkward difficulty spike that the rest of that playthrough never wound up matching again.</p><p>Still, a few grievances and an underwhelming finale haven’t stopped me from returning to <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>, even after I’d seen everything I’d need to write a review. The moment-to-moment action just feels <em>so good</em>, and there’s enough variety between stages to make mastering each one a unique, worthwhile challenge. I’ve never fancied myself a high score chaser or a speedrunner, but all I can think about as I write this is picking up my controller and chasing max ranks on stages. Not because I have anything to prove or unlock, but because I want to see what other combos or tricks I can pull off. In a modern gaming landscape where we often need a slow drip-feed of rewards as encouragement to keep playing, it’s refreshing to see a game with such high replay value simply because it’s that tight and concise. Just the act of play is its own reward.</p><p><em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound </em>captures virtually everything that made 2D action games of yesteryear awesome while ironing out all the rough edges synonymous with that era of gaming. It looks spectacular, controls like a dream, and boasts levels that are worth experiencing over and over again. It does end too soon for its own good, and its short runtime may throw some people off. Aside from that, however, the developers at The Game Kitchen have proven themselves to be masters of their retro-inspired craft with this one. <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound </em>is a worthy successor to its NES predecessors, without a boomerang bird in sight.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-2d-blasphemous-1851787265]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is the newest entry in one of Nintendo’s longest-running franchises, and it’s a rip-roaring good time for fans eager to destroy everything in their paths. However, players only control Donkey Kong this time around, with his usual sidekicks like Diddy and Dixie taking on supporting roles as non-playable characters. What does that mean for the prospect of co-op, though? Let’s talk about it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,196646,196452" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h468982"><a id=""></a>Does <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> even have co-op?</h2><p>If you’re looking to play <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> with a friend or family member, I’ve got some exciting news: <strong>The game features a co-op feature</strong>! One other player can join up and help you beat levels, but it just might not be in the way that you think. But what can you do with it? </p><p><strong>Co-op in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> doesn’t split the screen and give a second player full control of their own DK-like hero in the game world.</strong> Instead, it allows them to control Donkey Kong’s adorable companion Pauline as she rides along his shoulder. Because of this, the second player is rather limited in their moveset, not getting to experience the rolling, punching, or general sense of momentum that comes from playing as the game’s titular star.</p><p>However, that doesn’t mean that Pauline is useless. She’s anything but! While controlling Pauline, <strong>the second player can copy materials around a level, then shout that material at enemies or obstacles to deal damage</strong>. This can help with clearing paths, and it’s especially helpful for dishing out damage to bosses.</p><p>You can play <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> via local co-op or online. Even cooler, <strong>by using GameShare, you can temporarily allow your friend or family member (especially young children) to join your game with their own Switch or Switch 2, even if they don’t own the game themselves</strong>. Whoever’s controlling Pauline also doesn’t have to worry about abilities cooling down. They can spam away, which can make the game even more fun and chaotic. Like many Nintendo games, this opens up the door to a lot of fun play opportunities and quirky moments of discovery. It’s rad as hell.</p><p><br>While the co-op mode in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is a little limited when compared to other fully fledged co-op games, it’s still a neat way for youngsters or casual gamers to join in the fun. Whether you’re flying solo or bringing a pal along for the ride, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is available now for Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-co-op-support-gameshare-pauline-1851787349]]></content:encoded>

After finding out that Squall and crew all grew up together in an orphanage before their bonds with the summoned Guardian Forces drained their memories, we also learn that the very existence of Squall’s mercenary group, SeeD, was created after a sorceress traveled back in time to bestow Squall with the task of eliminating sorceress Ultimecia, who sought to do some funny business with time, collapsing it in on itself or something (sounds an awful lot like Sephiroth’s goals in <em>Rebirth</em>, come to think of it). </p><p>What this boils down to is this: <em>FF8</em> is a story of meddling with the past, literally, to change the future. </p><figure id="" data-id="c97a5578199bc488b83b4cefbe2ce43d" data-recommend-id="image://c97a5578199bc488b83b4cefbe2ce43d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="607" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rinoa and Squall look out over the city of Kalm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rinoa and Squall look out over the city of Kalm." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / ReforgedStudio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c97a5578199bc488b83b4cefbe2ce43d" data-recommend-id="image://c97a5578199bc488b83b4cefbe2ce43d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="607" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rinoa and Squall look out over the city of Kalm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So not only is time travel native to the lore of <em>FF8</em>’s setting, but the theme of recurring events would make for a much more natural remake built on that premise. <em>FF7 </em>does have themes of spirits and the flow of energy across time and space, but what the remake project does with it is a <em>bit</em> of a stretch. </p><p>And hey, maybe then we can finally all admit that Rinoa <em>is</em> Ultimecia, regardless of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Forum:Rinoa-Ultimecia_Theory&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Forum:Rinoa-Ultimecia_Theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what some guy said</a></span>.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ff7-rebirth-remake-ff8-cloud-aerith-tifa-squall-rinoa-1851787335]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Earning coupons in the Zone was already pretty straightforward. But for those of us who’ve spent tens or hundreds of hours in <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Heart of Chornobyl</em>, tackling the same side quests repeatedly for cash becomes downright gruesome—more so than the mutants we fight. Thankfully, update 1.5 introduces a new money-making method: Hunting! Now you can hunt and skin mutants for rare resources, like fangs, tusks, and tentacles, that you can sell off to earn a buck. You might think it’s pretty straightforward: Just get out there and start hunting. But there’s a more lucrative, and often more dangerous, method to trophy hunting in the Zone!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195386" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty DLC Probably Won’t Change V’s Fate" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195386,196909,196917" data-current="195386"><div><p>Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty DLC Probably Won’t Change V’s Fate</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195386/195386_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195386/195386_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195386/195386_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195386/195386_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20852.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h468964"><a id=""></a>How mutant hunting works</h2><figure id="" data-id="b507f1c7add32c00db25d60165425ede" data-recommend-id="image://b507f1c7add32c00db25d60165425ede" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Skinning a mutant for trophies in Stalker 2" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Skinning a mutant for trophies in Stalker 2" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->GSC Game World / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b507f1c7add32c00db25d60165425ede" data-recommend-id="image://b507f1c7add32c00db25d60165425ede" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Skinning a mutant for trophies in Stalker 2" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When you nab your first mutant trophy, such as a Boar Fang, you’ll find the item card claims its worth is around 2,000 coupons. Unfortunately, you’re not getting 2,000 coupons. My heart sank when I brought my first trophy to a trader, and Huron (Garbage) offered me a measly 700 coupons instead—less than half of what I was supposedly owed. That’s about how every hunt will progress: You’ll track down mutants across the Zone, maybe one in three will have an item to loot, and then you’ll score a few hundred coupons.</p><p>So how do you increase your earnings?</p><figure id="" data-id="1e1478c48d45a6c32dace1d3b80bbb27" data-recommend-id="image://1e1478c48d45a6c32dace1d3b80bbb27" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Accepting a hunting quest from Viktoria in Stalker 2" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Accepting a hunting quest from Viktoria in Stalker 2" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->GSC Game World / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1e1478c48d45a6c32dace1d3b80bbb27" data-recommend-id="image://1e1478c48d45a6c32dace1d3b80bbb27" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Accepting a hunting quest from Viktoria in Stalker 2" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Depending on how deep into the game you are, unlocking STC Malachite opens up a ton of opportunities. Those scientists pay quite well, and they always have gigs available. But one woman in particular, <strong>Viktoria Dorozhnyuk, the local merchant, offers contracts for mutant parts that the local science contingent will pay quite well for to research the Zone’s fauna.</strong> She’ll pay you many thousands of coupons in exchange for a handful of eyeballs, for example. It’s far more lucrative and far more entertaining than freelance hunting out in the wilds.</p><h2 id="h468965"><a id=""></a>Which mutants to hunt</h2><figure id="" data-id="c510b991d19d2f8d9ef29b9b0e082b7f" data-recommend-id="image://c510b991d19d2f8d9ef29b9b0e082b7f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hunting trophy from a Boar in Stalker 2" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hunting trophy from a Boar in Stalker 2" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->GSC Game World / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c510b991d19d2f8d9ef29b9b0e082b7f" data-recommend-id="image://c510b991d19d2f8d9ef29b9b0e082b7f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hunting trophy from a Boar in Stalker 2" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Many of the game’s enemies, like the Blind Dogs, Fleshes, and Boars, randomly spawn throughout the Zone.
