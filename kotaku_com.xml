              <p>An Ubisoft developer I chatted with back in 2022 was feeling pretty jealous. <em>Elden Ring</em> had just come out and was blowing people away. Despite FromSoftware’s reputation for challenging gameplay and esoteric design, the open-world RPG was <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-goty-2022-dlc-fromsoftware-dark-souls-1849925353">breaking out into the mainstream</a>. It was a hardcore game but it wasn’t only being enjoyed by hardcore gamers. Ubisoft had thousands of people working on open-world RPGs for years. Why couldn’t it make one that felt just as creatively bold, vibrant, and potent?</p> <p>A version of this question has been haunting the French publisher since <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-recon-breakpoint-is-an-infuriating-mess-1838885246"><em>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</em></a> bombed back in 2019. It wasn’t a terrible game, just kind of a bland and boring one. It became the poster child for the bloated Ubisoft blockbuster that felt designed by committee for no one in particular. Co-founder and CEO Yves Guillemot <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-admits-ghost-recon-breakpoint-has-been-a-disast-1839329787">promised sweeping reforms</a> to get to the bottom of what was going wrong with the publisher’s production processes. Over five years and several organizational “resets” later, it’s not clear the company has gotten any closer to an answer.</p>

 <p>The untenable situation blew up again this week with Ubisoft announcing <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866">major delays, cancelations, cost-cutting, and restructuring</a> that will result in some big short-term operating losses and more long-term uncertainty. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-share-price-crash-prince-of-persia-ai-2000662169">Ubisoft’s market cap</a> before <em>Breakpoint</em> was close to €10 billion. It’s since fallen by 95 percent <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3mczhjprjis24">to just €500 million</a>. The news was jarring, particularly to the more than 15,000 employees across the company’s global network of studios who found out the news alongside everyone else in an end-of-day message from the CEO.</p> <h2>“A boss run wild”</h2> <p>“The strategic and organizational changes we will make in the coming weeks and months will propel Ubisoft into its future. They will allow us to reconnect with our DNA – that of one of the largest and most storied video game companies in the world – and to regain our creative leadership as well as our competitiveness,” part of it read. It went on to explain a new, less bureaucratic structure for decision making and organizing franchises like <a href="https://kotaku.com/division-3-definitive-edition-remaster-destiny-2000658970"><em>The Division</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-remains-a-priority-for-us-ubisoft-says-2000662321"><em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</em></a> while also noting that there would be more pain to come as management continues to “make difficult decisions, including stopping certain projects” and “potentially closing select studios.”</p>

 <p>Slipped in between the grand vision and subtle threats was the reversal of a popular hybrid work-from-home policy that would have a direct impact on everyone working at Ubisoft. Staff would be back in the office five days a week, but with the promise of a generous number of work from home days. “The intention is not to question individual performance, but to regenerate our collective performance, which is one of the key elements in creating the best games with the required speed,” Guillemot wrote.</p>

 <p>There was immediate confusion and frustration. One French union representing Paris Ubisoft developers called for a half-day strike. “It is out of the question to let a boss run wild and destroy our working conditions,” Solidaires Informatique <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:gwmurecu4lbyaqjzsyv2orat/post/3mcxfxwczwk2z?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.escapistmagazine.com%252Fnews-ubisoft-france-union-strike-solidaires%252F">wrote in a press release</a>. “Perhaps we need to remind him that it is his employees who make the games.” Even more colorful quotes were given to <a href="https://www.bfmtv.com/tech/gaming/il-est-en-train-de-tout-foutre-en-l-air-sur-fond-de-rumeurs-de-licenciements-d-appel-a-la-greve-et-de-fin-du-teletravail-chez-ubisoft-les-salaries-desabuses-s-enflamment-contre-un-patron-en-roue-libre_AN-202601220331.html">French news broadcaster BFM TV</a>. “[Guillemot] is senile like Donald Trump,” one anonymous employee told the network. “He is losing his mind, we need to get him out of the company management [board]. He is screwing up everything and f****** the company.”</p> <h2>Return to office talent drain</h2> <p>Employees have been venting directly on Ubisoft’s internal messaging board as well, based on screenshots shared with me. “A full return to the office will only cause a significant amount of essential talent to leave the company, and nothing is being done to prevent this,” wrote one developer. “Why is top management not taking responsibility or accountability for the many errors and mistakes in the past? Instead, only workers are suffering the consequences.” Another wrote, “Since I joined Ubisoft, I’ve seen more change in the RTO policy than the company’s improvement and success.” A third did not mince words. “This is probably the most embarrassed I have felt working somewhere,” they wrote.</p>

 <p>Particularly galling about the new return-to-office policy for some Paris staff was that they had only recently finished negotiating to ensure two days of work-from-home per week. “It’s only been six months since the situation was more or less ‘back to normal’ and now it’s shattered to the ground by Yves’ sole decision with zero justification, zero documents, zero internal studies proving RTO increases productivity or morale, nothing,” one developer told me.</p> <p>The specific details for the rollout of the return-to-office policy have yet to be communicated to everyone, could vary team by team, and might not go into effect for much of the year. One thing that is clear is that Ubisoft is beginning to consolidate its Paris operations under one roof: the Floresco headquarters that was completed back in 2021. “Over the coming years, Ubisoft is planning to progressively bring together our Paris-area-based teams&nbsp;in the same building in Saint Mandé. This initiative is designed to optimize our workspace, foster greater collaboration between teams, and make better use of existing facilities, while being implemented gradually and in close dialogue with our employees,” a spokesperson for Ubisoft confirmed in an email.</p> <h2>Definition of insanity</h2> <p>There’s concern that these shifts could make it harder for Ubisoft to recruit the talent it needs to improve, or even worse, actively drive away more of the company’s existing veterans. But some employees have also shared broader disappointment with Ubisoft’s recent creative drift. “We need to stop with the trend-chasing, the trying to muscle our way into saturated markets, the sanitizing the edge off of our projects, and most of all the deciding which games get made behind closed doors,” one employee wrote this week on the company’s internal message board. They pointed to the launch of money pits like <em>Skull &amp; Bones</em> and Ubisoft’s many failed attempts at live-service battle royales and extraction shooters.</p>

 <p>In many ways, this week felt like a repeat of two years ago. The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-skull-bones-delay-assassins-creed-far-cry-cuts-1849975925">had just canceled several games and delayed a bunch of others</a>. It promised organizational shifts and a doubling-down on the company’s biggest franchises. The stakes were similarly high and the solutions far from clear. “The ball is in your court,” Guillemot <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-assassin-s-creed-mirage-far-cry-delay-canceled-1850001343">wrote to employees at the time</a>. Developers were furious then, too. The CEO later apologized for how the remark was phrased, but two years later some people at Ubisoft feel like nothing’s changed.</p> <p>One current employee posted the following comment internally this week. “To quote one of the greatest villains in a video game: ‘Did I ever tell you what the definition of insanity is? Insanity is doing the exact same f****** thing over and over again, expecting shit to change. That is crazy.’ – Vaas Montenegro.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sims-4-sex-mod-wickedwhims-ea-maxis-2000662724</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://wickedwhimsmod.com/"><span>WickedWhims</span></a><span> is one of the most popular mods for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/the-sims-4"><i><span>The Sims 4</span></i></a><span>. Led by modder Turbodriver, the fan creation, which adds fully animated and interactive sex, expanded relationships, and even a menstrual cycle and birth control for your Sims, has over 16,000 paid supporters on </span><a href="https://www.patreon.com/wickedwoohoo"><span>Patreon</span></a><span>. According to a recent interview, the actual number of people using the mod is far higher than that.</span></p> <p><span>As noted by </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4s-most-notorious-sex-mod-gets-launched-400-000-times-a-day-which-is-more-people-than-i-realized-were-even-playing-the-sims-every-day/"><i><span>PC Gamer</span></i></a><span>, German news site </span><i><span>Taz</span></i><span> published an interview with Turbodriver (who uses his pen name for anonymity) this week. Via Google Translate, when asked how many people use WickedWhims, the modder said that his server is pinged an average of 400,000 times per day. For context, the pings occur whenever someone starts the game with the mod installed.</span></p> <p><span>It’s important to note that, according to publisher EA, </span><i><span>The Sims 4</span></i><span> has accrued more than 80 million players worldwide, a statistic it </span><a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/the-sims-5-update-multiplayer-creator-content-ea-interview-1236142010/"><span>shared with </span><i><span>Variety</span></i></a><span> during an interview in September 2024. Of course, not all 80 million boot up the game every day, and the average 400,000 pings can include repeated sessions by the same person. Still, the mod’s widespread usage provides a valuable and curious insight into how many people are interested in amplifying the sexual content available in the game.</span></p> <p><span>As it stands, the (figuratively and metaphorically) vanilla version of </span><i><span>The Sims 4</span></i> <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/articles/the-sims/the-sims-4/gender-romance-attraction-guide/"><span>includes options</span></a><span> to customize sexual orientation around “men” or “women,” romance dynamics and boundaries, and attraction turn-ons and turn-offs. When it comes to intimacy, however, the act of sex itself isn’t shown, often obscured by shower steam or bed blankets.</span></p> <p><span>Mods like WickedWhims break that barrier with painstaking clarity, while amplifying both visual and simulation options. Sims can be fully controlled during sex—including over 10,000 animations from various creators, </span><a href="https://wickedwhimsmod.com/features"><span>according to the site</span></a><span>—naked bodies can show pubic hair and sweat, and fantasies such as voyeurism are added into the mix.</span></p> <p><span>But as Turbodriver told </span><i><span>Taz</span></i><span>, anyone playing a life simulation wants it to be “as realistic as possible.” That’s why WickedWhims also includes mechanics around a sexually transmitted disease, menstruation cycles, and birth control, among other things. The modder doesn’t intend for WickedWhims to be educational, and considers it a side effect.</span></p> <p><span>“The most confusing thing is that Sims have different fertility levels depending on when they’re in their cycle,” he said, via Google Translate. “Of course, as a man, I had to do some research when I programmed that part of the mod.”</span></p> <p><span>While Turbodriver doesn’t consider himself a feminist activist, he remarked that the mod is a product of his “political convictions,” and that feminist views also influence his work, albeit not exclusively. Moreover, the modder argued that game developers are becoming more open to explicit content, citing </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span> as a title that features nudity, but that there’s still a double standard in the industry when it comes to sexual content.</span></p> <p><span>“Large game developers can include sex scenes in their games without any repercussions,” Turbodriver said. “Indie games, on the other hand, are penalized much more quickly by the platforms, which label them as adult games and show them to fewer people.”</span></p> <p><span>While the number of WickedWhims sessions is definitely noteworthy, it’s important to remember the context in which this activity is taking place. For one, as Turbodriver pointed out, the internet is becoming increasingly centralized on fewer platforms that restrict sexual content of any kind.</span></p> <p><span>The context surrounding </span><i><span>The Sims 4</span></i><span>, too, is important to consider. Developer Maxis recently </span><a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/the-values-that-shape-the-sims"><span>shared a blog post</span></a><span> saying that it remains committed to its values, one of which is inclusivity, and that “The Sims team’s creative control has not changed.” This comes in response to concerns from the community around the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund’s intentions to become the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-shareholders-approve-55bn-sale-saudi-arabia-trump-2000655342"><span>major owner of EA</span></a><span>, as it marches to secure a deal to buy 93.4 percent of shares in a $55 billion deal.</span></p> <p><span>While the deal is pending government approval, the Public Investment Fund is almost entirely owned by a state known for </span><a href="https://www.humandignitytrust.org/country-profile/saudi-arabia/"><span>persecuting and killing queer people</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://theweek.com/60339/things-women-cant-do-in-saudi-arabia"><span>denying women many basic rights</span></a><span>, among other causes for concern. It’s unclear if Maxis will be able to maintain its values if the deal comes into fruition in the future, but it’s clear that players have an interest in mods like WickedWhims which provide forms of expression and experience that go beyond the boundaries of what’s offered in the vanilla game.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/fable-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-fantasy-rpg-reboot-2000662595</link>
            <guid>1414828</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Later this year, assuming it doesn’t get delayed again, <em>Fable</em> will take us back to the whimsical fantasy world of Albion for a new adventure developed by Playground Games, the team behind the <em>Forza Horizon</em> franchise. It’s been a long time coming for this one. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-is-bringing-back-fable-1844482199">It was first announced in 2020</a>! But after that long wait, it is set to return later this year and not just on Xbox. Here’s everything you might want to know about <em>Fable</em>. The new one, I mean. Not the old one, which is also simply called <em>Fable</em>.</p> <h2><strong>What is <em>Fable</em>?</strong></h2> <p><em>Fable</em> is an upcoming open-world third-person fantasy action RPG and the latest entry in Xbox’s <em>Fable</em> series. As in previous games in the series, players will start as a young child who loses their family and becomes a solo hero with their sights set on grand adventure. The franchise has always been known for its British humor and less-than-serious vibes, and the new game is no exception, with lots of silly jokes and people calling you a twat in a thick English accent.</p>

 <h2><strong>Does this new <em>Fable</em> have connections to the old games?</strong></h2> <p>Maybe? For the most part, Playground Games has called <em>Fable</em> a reboot of the franchise and not a direct sequel or prequel to any of the past games. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/weve-been-working-on-this-game-for-a-really-really-long-time-the-big-fable-interview-with-microsoft-developer-playground">But, in an interview with <em>IGN</em></a>, Playground founder and general manager Ralph Fulton alluded to the idea that while there are no returning characters, there is <em>some</em> connection to the past games, telling the outlet: “We do share lore and some of that originating lore of the <em>Fable</em> universe is really important to our story.”</p> <h2><strong>How big is the map in <em>Fable</em>?</strong></h2> <p>Playground Games is famous for its<em> Forza Horizon</em> series, which includes massive open-world maps. But according to Playground Games, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fable-reboot-features-open-world-release-date-fall-xbox-ps5-2000662295"><em>Fable’s </em>open-world&nbsp;map</a> isn’t nearly as big as a <em>Forza Horizon</em> world. That’s because the main character isn’t driving around at 250mph, and so you don’t need that much space. Instead of sheer scale, the studio is focused on detail and immersion. For example, every building in the game is apparently enterable and explorable.</p>

  <h2><strong>Is there a morality system? Will I grow horns if I’m really evil?</strong></h2> <p>Yes, and no. There is a morality system, and the world will react to you depending on what you do and what people think. <a href="https://kotaku.com/fable-reboot-appearance-morality-good-evil-horns-halo-2000662597">But your character’s appearance won’t change based on how evil or good they are</a>, as the morality system in the new game doesn’t treat your actions in such a binary way.&nbsp; An action of yours might make some people see you as evil, while others find that same action noble and admirable. So no more horns.</p>

 <h2><strong>Does <em>Fable</em> have co-op multiplayer?</strong></h2> <p>Nope! This has been confirmed via the official <em>Fable</em> Discord’s FAQ section, which simply states: “<em>Fable</em> is a single-player open-world action-RPG.”</p> <h2>Can I choose my gender in <em>Fable</em>?</h2> <p>Yes. While most of the marketing for the upcoming RPG has featured a woman protagonist, upsetting some angry online chuds, you will be able to choose your gender in the full game.</p> <h2>Are marriages and home ownership in the new <em>Fable</em>?</h2> <p>Yup and yup. Also back are jobs and divorces. You’ll be able to live a horrible life as a repeatedly divorced “hero” who owns many homes and kicks people out for being late on their rent. Just keep in mind that the devs claim that these people might cause you problems in the future if you run into them again.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000662718" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000662718"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000662718">©Xbox</figcaption></figure> <h2>When does <em>Fable</em> launch?</h2> <p>Xbox has yet to provide a specific release date. Instead, <em>Fable</em> is currently slated to launch sometime in Fall 2026.</p> <h2>Will Fable be on PlayStation 5?</h2> <p>Yes. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-forza-horizon-6-ps5-delay-launch-fable-reboot-2000662665"><em>Fable</em> is launching on PS5</a> alongside Xbox Series X/S, Game Pass, and PC sometime later this year.</p> <h2>Wait, where’s the dog?</h2> <p>Uh… bad news. There is no dog in the new <em>Fable</em>. Sorry.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Careful, This City-Builder Starring Cute Mice And Evil Royal Cats Might Suck Away All Your Free Time]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/whiskerwood-city-builder-mice-cats-timberton-factorio-indie-steam-early-access-2000662691</link>
            <guid>1414795</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It was around 1:45 in the morning, as I was laying down wooden walkways to help little rodents get to work faster, that I realized I was fully hooked by <em>Whiskerwood</em>, a newly released city-builder and resource manager that blends together <em>Timberborn</em>, <em>Factorio</em>, and <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/sid-meiers-colonization-is-the-best-4th-of-july-video-g-1600113277">Sid Meier’s Colonization</a>.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>Out now on Steam via early access, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2489330/Whiskerwood/"><em>Whiskerwood</em> is a top-down real-time city builder</a> that has you leading Whiskers, lowly mouse peasants and workers, as they travel to new lands in the 1700s by order of the rich, powerful Claws, a group of royal cats. After picking a spot to build a dock for incoming ships and a warehouse to store goods, you start harvesting supplies to begin building up a tiny mouse settlement. Your goal isn’t simply to survive, but also to harvest enough resources, including fish, berries, logs, and rock, to pay off your taxes, which are claimed every so often in-game by a royal fleet. As you do, the amount of taxes you have to pay goes up, and wait a minute…I don’t think these Claws are good people!</p>

  <p>Early on, one of your mice rightfully points out that, hey, the Claws provided the mice supplies to build structures that would enrich the cats, but failed to provide much more than that, leaving the Whiskers basically on their own to figure out how to build a town and not all perish in a few days. Once again, not sure these cats can be trusted.</p> <p>This part of <em>Whiskerwood</em> is currently the least developed, with what sounds like plans to allow a self-sufficient colony to cut itself off from the Claws and even revolt. For now, that stuff mostly sits in the background and provides a good reason to harvest more and more supplies.</p>

 <p>While the game’s recreation of 1700s colonization hooked me at first, what kept me around until way too late the first night I played was the easy-to-understand city-building mechanics and smartly designed UI. Doing anything in <em>Whiskerwood</em> rarely takes more than two clicks. Each menu is easy to read, navigate, and close, which isn’t always the case in games like this. <em>Whiskerwood</em> also does a fantastic job, even in early access, of providing players with all the information they need to know about where mice are going, what they need, what’s missing, which resources are low, and so forth.</p>

 <figure><figcaption>©Minakata Dynamics</figcaption></figure> <p>I especially love the alert banners that appear for important problems, like an injured mouse. Or to let you know that a mouse might have a long trek to the mines from his tiny hovel. You just click on it, and it zips you to the problem, and from there, you’re usually a click away from moving a mouse or tweaking some part of a building.</p> <p>Making that trip shorter or more efficient is a breeze with <em>Whiskerwood’s</em> snappy building and management menus, which feel like they were built by people who understand how vital this stuff is to making a city builder fun. But all of this smart design doesn’t come at the cost of simplification! This is still a complex game that will demand that you create more and more elaborate networks of buildings, conveyors, stairs, transportation, housing, and storage to be able to not only pay your taxes but also survive harsher seasons and weather.</p>

 <p>I’ve only put about five hours into <em>Whiskerwood</em> so far, but based on what I’ve played and the gushing I’ve seen <a href="https://aftermath.site/whiskerwood-review-impressions-pc-city-builder-hooded-horse/">from city builder experts like Luke Plunkett over at <em>Aftermath</em>,</a> I’m excited to keep playing. Hopefully one day my tiny mice will rise up, seize the means of production from the Claws, and gain independence. For now, they’ll need to keep breaking rocks and cutting down trees for those fat cats.</p>
