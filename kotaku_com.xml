They’d love to get an update on how the long-awaited <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em> is coming along too, but a new expansion for <em>Starfield </em>feels more likely. Blizzcon isn’t returning until 2026 either, so we’ll probably get some updates on<em> Diablo IV</em> and other projects from that set of teams as well. </p><p>The<em> Outer Worlds 2</em> Direct, meanwhile, will feature “new gameplay, details, and developer insights” about the sequel to the 2019 sci-fi RPG shooter about futuristic space colonies dominated by rogue pirate gangs and corporate profiteers. It’s set to arrive before the end of the year on Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC. Maybe a Switch 2 version will get announced by then as well. </p><p>The main event will begin streaming at 1:00 p.m. ET with the <em>Outer Worlds 2</em> showcase following directly afterwards. Microsoft also notes that this year’s show will be “digital-only,” suggesting it’s fully committed to the trail first blazed by Nintendo and won’t be holding an in-person component for the showcase (in past years the company had filled auditoriums with media, content creators, and fans to watch the streamed event in person).</p><p>The <em>Outer Worlds 2</em> is taking center stage this year presumably because <em>Fable</em> was delayed until 2026. Microsoft’s supplementary showcase Directs began in 2023 with <em>Starfield</em> and continued the following year with <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>. But Xbox still has a bunch of other rumored projects it could still reveal for 2025, including a<em> Gears of War</em> collection, as well as a new raft of ports for PS5 as well as Switch 1 and 2 as it continues its multiplatform pivot. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
