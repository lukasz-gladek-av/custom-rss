              <p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> latest update has given players plenty of new things to do, from grinding for new talismans to trying not to die to the new 9-star boss fights. But players on PC are still struggling with poor performance optimization, and Capcom now says no major fixes will be ready until the winter.</p> <p><span>“To our hunters playing <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> </span><span>on PC, we’re committed to listening to your feedback and improving both performance and stability of the game,” an update posted on X on August 18 <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1957473035885121806">reads</a>. “Although we will continue to implement gradual improvements in the weeks ahead, we are targeting Free Title Update 4 this winter to implement a multifaceted plan, including CPU and GPU related optimizations, followed by a second stage of mitigation measures afterwards. We’ll share more information on the specifics in the future.”</span></p> <p>The response from fans so far has been less than stellar. “It’s not normal to wait one year to get at least a small optimization for PC players,” wrote one. “We are paying for stability and performance as the same time free updates. I have a war machine and i have to play everything on LOW hoping it’s going well.” Another posted, “Love MHWilds I really do, but waiting almost a year for the game to run at least a little better is a bit crazy.”</p>

 <p>Similar sentiments have been echoed across the game’s subreddit and recent Steam reviews where <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> still sits at just 25 percent, up from an all-time low earlier in the summer, but still far from where the overwhelmingly positive ratings other recent entries in the series sit. While not everyone’s facing issues, people on a range of machines are still reporting crashes, ugly textures, and unstable framerates even at 30fps.</p> <p>There’s currently a new Title Update 3 scheduled for September to add a new monster and more balance adjustments to combat and progression, followed by Title Update 4 in the winter. There’s also the game’s first expansion, which new <em>Monster Hunter</em> entries tend to get 12-18 months after they ship. It’ll be a make-or-break moment for the players on PC who feel like the last six months have been closer to an Early Access experience.</p>

              <p>Mitch William Gross, a 34-year-old man from Earling, Iowa, is about to spend four months in federal prison for the crime of buying $145,000 worth of <em>Pokémon</em> cards and gaming items. The mistake he made was to buy them by defrauding the logistics company he worked for.</p> <p>It’s a tale as old as time itself. Man works for transportation corporation, man uses company credit cards to buy tens of thousands of dollars on <em>Pokémon</em> cards, man falsifies receipts on expense reports to make the payments appear as regular business costs, man gets caught by the FBI and charged with wire fraud. We’ve all been there at one time or another.</p> <p>Mitch William Gross managed to rack up an extraordinary $146,590.15 in fraudulent purchases, which <a href="https://www.justice.gov/usao-sdia/pr/earling-man-sentenced-four-months-federal-prison-wire-fraud">the Southern District of Iowa’s Attorney’s Office</a> said (thanks,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ktiv.com/2025/08/18/iowa-man-spent-140k-company-funds-pokemon-cards-gaming-items/"><em>KTIV</em></a>) were spent on “prepaid gift cards, <em>Pokémon</em> cards, and gaming items.” He is then said to have “submitted falsified receipts and mischaracterized fraudulent charges on his expense reports so that the purchases appeared as legitimate business expenses.”</p>

 <p>As a result of an investigation by the FBI and Des Moines Police Department, Gross has been ordered to repay the full amount of his elicit shopping, as well as serving four months in a federal prison,&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>three further years of post-release supervision. The report notes, “There is no parole in the federal system.”</p> <p>As is all too often the case in these circumstances, we don’t have the key information: which <em>Pokémon</em> cards did he buy? Was this one big spend on a rare Charizard, or did he pick up a wealth of booster boxes? (The crimes all took place between September 2021 and October 2022, back in the glory days <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">when you could buy Pokémon cards in stores</a>.)</p> <p>Gross pleaded guilty back in April, and was sentenced in the past couple of days. If he kept the <em>Pokémon</em> cards, he could sell them now four about five times whatever he paid.</p>
