              <p>Why was a decision that saved <em>Borderlands</em> such a dumb one to make? What was it like to play <em>Prey 2</em> at E3 2011? Will <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> eventually come to Switch 2? Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Yours truly is still recovering from the weekend’s PAX West marathon and I have a bunch of interviews and previews still to publish on the site throughout the week. In the meantime, let’s take a short walk down memory lane.</p> <h2>Watch someone play Bethesda’s canceled sci-fi shooter <em>Prey 2</em></h2>  <p>Let’s talk about <em>Prey 2</em>. The short version is that <em>Prey 2</em> was a sequel to a popular 2006 shooter by Human Head Studios about solving puzzles on an alien spaceship. It got a big blowout showing at E3 2011, including a playable demo that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2011/jun/20/e3-2011-prey-2-game-preview">generated a ton of buzz</a>. As a bounty hunter in an alien city, players used guns and parkour to chase suspects and choose how to apprehend them. A robot punished you if you caused too much immersive sim chaos,&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>style.</p> <p>The game was supposed to come out in 2012 but never did. What was most surprising of all was that Bethesda never provided clear reasons for why the project was suddenly scuttled. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/05/what-went-wrong-with-human-heads-prey-2">There were reports</a> of contractual disputes and Bethesda leveraging the <em>Prey 2</em> publishing agreement to try to fully acquire Human Head Studios. Ultimately, Arkane began working on a reboot of the game that would become 2017’s very different sci-fi immersive sim <em>Prey</em>. This is where the <a href="https://kotaku.com/leaked-e-mails-suggest-bethesda-misled-gamers-about-pre-1149092622">term of endearment “press sneak fuck” was born</a>.</p>

 <p>Now fresh footage of the original <em>Prey 2</em> has leaked on YouTube under the account “David Halsted.” There are five videos totaling just over 20 minutes of gameplay showing off different features as well as the E3 demo. “I remember when they revealed this at PAX back in the day,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1n6zcc8/prey_2_development_videos_leaked/?share_id=GehdxVGPPqJefxwNWn5Ci&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">wrote one fan on Reddit</a>. “The whole con was buzzing about how cool it was and how hype we were for it. And then we got whatever it rebooted as. Dream revival game though.”</p> <h2><em>Borderlands</em> devs reflect on its “insane” art style overhaul</h2> <p>Gearbox’s loot shooter series is known for its <em>Diablo</em>-style loot, rude attitude, and bubblegum wrapper cel-shaded art style. But it was not always thus. Early in development, the first game in the shooter series looked like a broke knock-off of <em>Fallout 3</em> and <em>Rage</em>. That’s how it appeared in a <a href="https://kotaku.com/that-time-team-fortress-2-and-borderlands-changed-art-s-1749106652">demo at E3,</a> and on the cover of a 2007 <em>Game Informer</em> containing a deep dive on the game back before anyone had ever even heard of Claptrap.</p>

 <p>The magazine is back <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/01/the-behind-the-scenes-story-of-the-art-style-swap-that-saved-borderlands-1">with a new series of interviews</a> about Gearbox’s race to overhaul the grim, gritty, and dull look of the game to help it stand out and eventually become the mega-hit it is today. Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford gave members of the art team permission to look into overhauling the art style, even as milestone deadlines were breathing down their necks:</p> <blockquote><p>It was, like, five guys with two weeks to go mess around with the look and the feel, and I immediately knew I made a mistake. I was like, ‘S—. We’re trying to get to Alpha, dude. There’s a business here. I’m responsible for other people’s money. I’m going to let these guys spin for two weeks, which means they’re going to be even more invested in what they’re doing, and then I have to go in and look at what they did, and I have to shoot it in the head. That’s what’s going to happen here. Son of a b—-. I’m an idiot. Why did I do that?’ But there was something in my heart that knew that we had to at least look at and explore. I knew we weren’t right.</p></blockquote> <h2>There’s another <em>28 Years Later</em> movie coming in just a few months called<em> The Bone Temple</em></h2> <p>Ralph Fiennes got so ripped fo<em>r 28 Years Later</em> that they made him the star of the sequel just 12 months later. <em>The Bone Temple</em> will briefly have Cillian Murphy return as Jim from the original movie as well. He’ll have a much bigger role in a trilogy-capping third movie arriving after <em>The Bone Temple</em>.</p>

  <h2><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> director can neither confirm nor deny the existence of a Switch 2 port</h2> <p>The turn-based GOTY contender seems like a perfect fit for Nintendo’s new handheld hybrid. Will it get there sooner or later? Sandfall Interactive isn’t saying. “We have some possibilities that we will explore, but at the moment we cannot confirm anything,” the studio <a href="https://www.nintenderos.com/nintendo-switch-2/sandfall-interactive-esta-explorando-lanzar-clair-obscur-expedition-33-en-nintendo-switch-2/">told <em>Nintenderos</em></a>. That sounds like a studio who promised not to disclose that they have a Switch 2 dev kit.</p> <h2><em>Stellar Blade 2</em> is fully in development</h2> <p>That’s according to <a href="https://x.com/genki_jpn/status/1963102317886283809">developer ShiftUp’s latest financial report</a>. “We are actively pursuing the franchise development of the ‘Stellar Blade’ IP and are currently developing a sequel to ‘Stellar Blade.'” The game is supposed to have a bigger world and some additional action mechanics. In the meantime, the first game is another candidate ripe for porting to Switch 2.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-saudi-arabia-street-fighter-6-sony-esports-2000622367">Fighting game pros are confronting Saudi Arabia’s new co-ownership of Evo</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-corvette-steam-players-2000622428"><em>No Man’s Sky</em>‘s Voyager update is leading players and the game’s Steam records to new heights</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381">A look at&nbsp; <em>Kpop Demon Hunters</em>‘ cultural takeover</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

              <p>Laptops are miracles of productivity, but they’re limited to just one screen of workspace. Even the big boys with their ultra-sharp 17-inch displays are, well, just one 17-inch display for all of those windows you multitasking mavens want to have open at one time. Reaching the full potential of your laptop or even your tablet requires an extra screen, or maybe even two, and the <strong>Anker USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter </strong>is the perfect tool to make that happen. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3881/">Even better, it’s just $25 right now in a limited-time Amazon deal</a>.</p>
<p>The Anker USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter requires no extra software or drivers, just plug-and-play with any compatible laptop or tablet with an USB-C port. Windows laptops can be extended to two additional 4K monitors either in mirror mode, with all three screens showing the same image, or extended desktop mode with A-B-B or A-B-C configuration. MacOS laptops can extend to two additional 4K monitors in mirror mode or A-B-B extended desktop mode. Smartphones with a USB-C port can also be connected to a dual-HDMI display.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3881/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Huge Configuration Potential</h2>
<p>While the Anker USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter can definitely be thought of as an ideal laptop-to-external monitor device, its capabilities don’t end there. On the USB-C source side of the adapter, compatible tablets and smartphones are also just a plug-and-play connection away from being mirrored onto a much-larger screen. That screen isn’t just limited to HDMI-compatible external monitors, either. TVs and projectors with an HDMI input port are also accessible to your USB-C devices, and without the need for a driver or app.</p>
<p>The potential use for these connections is nearly limitless. The productivity boost of going from one small screen to one small screen and two large 4K screens is obvious. But now instead of having to pass your smartphone or tablet from person to person to show off those pictures and videos you shot on vacation, you can connect your compatible USB-C device to an external monitor, big-screen TV, or projector and put on a show.</p>



<h2>Pocket-Sized Power</h2>
<p>We’ve seen hubs and ports that, while powerful and versatile, are large and/or requiring their own source of AC power. The Anker USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter is anything but bulky. It’s 2 inches by 2.5 inches in size — smaller than a credit card — and just under a half-inch thick. The adapter’s weight is negligible at 1.7 ounces, so you can stick it on your pocket or laptop bag and bring it out anywhere there’s a HDMI-compatible display at the ready.</p>
<p>The Anker name that’s so trusted for charging devices is also a sign of quality for this multi-device adapter. Anker covers the USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter with a worry-free 18-month warranty should anything go wrong. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3881/">Amazon’s limited-time deal makes this a $25 accessory that guarantees you’ll never look at working on one small screen the same way again.&nbsp;</a></p>
