            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ahead of <em>Black Ops 7</em>‘s November 14 release date and the early access beta running from October 2 to 5<em>, Call of Duty </em>Next showed off some live footage from the latest entry in the long-running of the military shooter series. The game looks like a solid, speedy, competitive shooter that’s utilizing its futuristic setting for some war-themed sci-fi fantasy. So let’s jump into what stood out during CODNext.</p>  <h2><em>Black Ops 7</em> multiplayer looks tactile and fast</h2> <p>I don’t blame those who think all of these games look the same, but if you like a fast shooter with some interesting opportunities for gravity-defying tactics, you might want to check out footage from today’s event–especially if you’re a fan of&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 2</em>, to which <em>7</em> is intended as a spiritual successor.</p>

 <p>Set in the near future,&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em> has some fancy tech that builds off the advanced movement techniques in&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>. Wall-jumping, sliding, tactical stance, it all combines very seamlessly in both the scripted sizzle reels and the actual gameplay shown off today.</p>

 <p>The wall-bouncing, which looks like it’ll owe&nbsp;<em>Titanfall&nbsp;</em>a royalty check, is particularly exciting as various streamers showed off how these techniques can be used for some vertically lethal plays and opportunities to get new, unexpected sight lines.</p>

 <h2><em>Black Ops 7</em> will ship with 18 maps, mostly focusing on 6v6</h2> <p>In what’s shaping up to be a healthy roster of maps,&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7 </em>will feature 16 6v6 maps, with 13 of those being brand new designs joined by three remakes of&nbsp;<em>BLOPS6 </em>maps. The remaining two maps are for 20v20 battles.</p> <p>During the beta, folks can jam on six of these maps, all of which are of the smaller, 6v6 variety. Map design in&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7 </em>is particularly focused on standard, three-lane construction. That tried-and-true design, however, might be just what allows the game’s advanced movement techniques to really let players mix things up.</p>

 <h2>Overclocking equipment</h2> <p><em>BLOPS7</em> will contain many of the usual loadout options we’ve long come to expect from&nbsp;<em>CoD</em>, but you’ll be able to further customize your class by “overclocking” lethal, tactical, field upgrades, and score streaks. Once unlocked, these let you equip two modifications in addition to the ordinary functions of the equipment. One such example shown off today was the Stim Shot, which lets you either cancel out enemy-induced debuffs&nbsp;or gain a speed boost when using it.</p>

 <h2>Weapon build sharing</h2> <p>In what stood out to me as one of the coolest features in&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7</em>, folks will be able to quickly share weapon builds with each other by way of a simple code the game generates when you finish a specific setup. This should make it pretty easy to just grab an effective meta build and jump into a match.</p>

 <h2>Season one aims to be the ‘biggest’ in <em>BLOPS</em> history</h2> <p>Though&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7</em> has a pretty sizeable stock of maps to choose from at launch, Treyarch announced today that seven additional multiplayer maps will join the game over the course of its first season, with six of them for the 6v6 mode. Ranked play will arrive in season two.</p> <h2>Nuketown returns</h2> <p>Looking like it came straight out of Bethesda’s&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em> games, the end of the multiplayer reveal showed off a couple of shots of fan-favorite&nbsp;<em>CoD</em> map Nuketown. Check it out:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000630311" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630311"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630311">© Screenshot: Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Nuketown is expected to arrive “soon” after&nbsp;<em>BLOPS7</em>‘s launch.</p> <hr> <p>All in all, the big takeaway from CODNext is that if fast-paced, competitive shooters are your thing, <em>BLOPS7</em> is looking pretty solid.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Reveals Everything Coming Before The End Of The Year]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-two-new-maps-modes-roadmap-free-updates-dlc-2025-ea-2000630301</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-reveals-everything-coming-before-the-end-of-the-year.1312792/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>EA has released a content roadmap for <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-battlefield-6-trailer-direct-attack-against-call-of-duty-celeb-trailer-skins-ea-2000629910"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> that outlines all the new goodies and free DLC players can expect during the online shooter’s first season.</p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em>, EA’s next installment in the popular military sim series, is nearly here. The FPS arrives on October 10 on console and PC. But in 2025, games like <em>Battlefield</em> can’t just launch and be done. No, they need roadmaps! Promises of more content coming down the pipeline. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-season-1-roadmap-preview">And that’s just what’s been revealed,</a> with <em>BF6</em>‘s season one roadmap confirming two new maps are arriving in <em>BF6</em> before the end of the year, as well as new modes, guns, and more.</p> <p>As seen in the new roadmap shared on September 29, season one of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-framerate-fps-xbox-series-s-ps5-2000626043"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> doesn’t start at launch. Instead, it begins on October 28, a few weeks later. The first season is being split into “phases” that will bring in new content every month for the rest of 2025.</p> <figure><figcaption>© EA</figcaption></figure> <h2>Phase One of <em>BF6</em>‘s first season</h2> <p>The first Phase is Rogue Ops, and it adds a brand new map: Blackwell Fields. This is a big map set in the California badlands, and it will support all modes as well as land and air vehicles. The first phase also adds Strikepoint, a new 4v4 mode all about “intense, small team tactical” combat. Squads fight over an objective across multiple rounds, but only have one life each round. Sounds tense. Not sure it’s something I’ll play, but different strokes, etc.</p>

 <p>Also being added in the first phase are an APC vehicle, a compact carbine rifle, a new sidearm, and some extra attachments for weapons.</p> <h2>Phase Two of <em>BF6</em>‘s first season</h2> <p>Phase two of <em>BF6</em>‘s first season kicks off on November 18 and adds a new map, Eastwood, which seems to be a bit smaller than Blackwell Fields. This new battlefield is also set in the United States and is located in a “sleepy, affluent suburb” next to a golf course. All modes supported, but it seems no jets will be available on this one, just helis. A new mode called Sabotage is being added in this phase, too. The new mode is another smaller one focused on 8v8 combat as teams try to destroy as many objectives as possible before time runs out. One team defends, the other attacks. Once again, not sure if this is what I want from <em>Battlefield</em>, but cool for folks who like it.</p>

 <p>Also being added in phase two: Battle Pickups. This is a returning feature from some past<em> Battlefield</em> games. Players will be able to find powerful and advanced weapons that can be picked up and used until they run out of ammo or you die and drop them. I’m excited to see how this might change up some maps.&nbsp; A new double-barreled pump shotgun, revolver, and attachment is also being added during this phase.</p>

 <h2>Phase three of <em>BF6</em>‘s first season</h2> <p>Finally, on December 9, phase three of the season arrives. EA says this is the last phase of the season. This phase doesn’t add a new map, but instead changes up an existing map. <em>BF6</em>‘s Empire State map, set in NYC, will temporarily be covered in snow during this phase of the season. According to the roadmap, this won’t simply be a fun cosmetic change, but will actually affect gameplay. There will be a new “Freeze” mechanic introduced on the snow-covered map that EA describes as a “gameplay modifier.” No other details yet.</p> <p>Meanwhile, the third and final phase will add an ice-climbing axe as a new melee weapon option, and a new limited-time “Ice Lock” even that will happen exclusively on the snowy Empire State map.</p> <hr> <p>Phew! That’s a lot of content and all of it is, assuming nothing gets delayed, arriving in the game’s first few months. I’ll be curious to see how much content future seasons include. Can we expect two maps and multiple guns in every season? That seems like a lot. But if the devs can pull it off, <em>Battlefield 6</em> might end up being one of the best entries in the series. And that might help distract people from the news that <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829">EA is being bought up by Saudi Arabia’s prince and Jared Kushner’s investment firm</a>.&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em> is out on October 10 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In a few days, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a> beta launches on console and PC. This will be the first time players get a chance to go hands-on with the upcoming FPS. It will also be the first chance hackers and cheaters get to possibly screw up the game. And Activision not only expects that to happen, but <em>wants</em> it to happen.</p> <p>On September 29<a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-ricochet-anti-cheat-update">,</a> <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-ricochet-anti-cheat-update">Activision and the team behind <em>Call of Duty’</em>s anti-cheat tech posted a lengthy blog</a> about what they are doing to stop cheaters from ruining the game. As previously announced, this time around, <em>Call of Duty</em> players on PC will have to have Secure Boot activated on their rig to <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blackops7/beta">play <em>Black Ops 7</em> and the upcoming beta</a>. For most players, this shouldn’t be much of an issue as newer PCs running Windows 11 are likely to already have Secure Boot activated. But for other players planning to run the game on older PCs or rigs that don’t support Secure Boot, this could be a problem.</p>

 <p>We saw similar issues with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/battlefield-6-requires-secure-boot-to-run-and-its-coming-to-more-games-soon-including-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-heres-what-it-is-why-linux-gamers-are-mad-about-it-and-how-to-enable-it/"><em>Battlefield 6</em> and its open beta</a>, which also required Secure Boot. The idea is that this extra level of security can help stop some PC cheat tools, but some players have complained that it can be a pain to turn on Secure Boot if you aren’t experienced with messing around with your PC’s BIOS settings. Others claim it doesn’t do much to stop hackers and cheaters, and point to the fact that <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-cheating-cheaters-hacks-ea-dice-secureboot-pc-2000616686"><em>BF6</em>‘s beta reportedly had cheaters in it almost immediately.</a>&nbsp; Regardless, Secure Boot is needed to play <em>Black Ops 7</em> and the beta.&nbsp; And if cheaters do try to play the <em>BLOPS7</em> beta despite Secure Boot, Activision and its anti-cheat team, Team Ricochet, are waiting for them and ready to ban them forever.</p>

 <p>“Cheaters will try to test the limits during the Beta. That’s exactly what we want because #TeamRICOCHET is here, watching, learning, and removing them as they appear,” explained the team in the previously mentioned blog post. “Any account permanently banned for cheating during the Beta will be banned across all<em> Call of Duty </em>titles, from<em> Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> to future releases.”</p>

 <p>The studio further explained that all of its anti-cheat tech, which includes machine learning tools and more, will also help make Activision’s free-to-play battle royale <em>Call of Duty Warzone</em> safer from cheaters, adding: “Everything we’re building for <em>Black Ops 7</em> will also protect <em>Call of Duty: Warzone.”</em></p>

 <p>I still expect cheaters will break through Activision’s defenses and cause problems in <em>BLOPS7</em>‘s beta and the full game, which launches in November on consoles and PC. But it sounds like the folks building the game’s anti-cheat tools are not just ready for a fight, but actively encouraging it.</p> <p>The <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> beta launches on all platforms on October 2 via early access. It then opens up to everyone on October 5 and ends on October 8.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-tips-guide-ivalice-remaster-jobs-2000630228</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/12-tips-to-know-before-playing-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles.1312633/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’ve played <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> twice in the past couple of months. The first runthrough was of the original on PlayStation. The second <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040">was the excellent <em>Ivalice Chronicles</em> remaster,</a> out today. Despite having grinded through the classic strategy RPG back in the day, I still learned a thing or two from revisiting it again all these years later. Here’s a bunch of friendly reminders, PSAs, and helpful tips, whether you’re playing <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> for the first time or coming back to it after decades away.</p> <h2>Keep every character a Squire until they learn JP Up</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630276" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630276"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630276">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Rule number one of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is “ABJPU”: always be JP-ing up. JP stands for Job Points and these are what you use to unlock skills across the game’s sprawling job system. As you rank up each job, you’ll collect more points per action you take, but the JP Up skill will double that, letting you progress your characters twice as fast. The skill is on the third page of the Squire skill list under the passive section. Hold off on swapping your fresh recruits to chemists, knights, or other starting classes until you have this one unlocked.</p>

 <h2>Unlock Focus if you really want to streamline grinding</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630277" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630277"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630277">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Characters earn XP and Job Points for successful actions. This means doing damage, healing, or buffing/debuffing something. The fastest way to level up characters is to stock up on potions, leave one enemy in a battle alive, and have everyone keep taking turns while staying healed. Accumulate is a Squire skill that raises your attack. It never misses. And you use it on yourself so you don’t have to move or worry about being in range.</p>

 <p>The quickest way to grind in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is to have everyone learn the skill (it costs 300 points) and stand around using it at the end of a random encounter. Because you can use it as a character’s second skill, it’s helpful no matter what job they are trying to level up, making it a sound strategy over the course of the entire game.</p>

 <h2>Always have a least one character with the Item skill equipped</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630275" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630275"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630275">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>The ability to use Phoenix Down items is one of the most useful skills in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>. That’s because when characters die, they only have three turns before they turn into crystals. Once that happens, they’re dead for the whole game unless you reset. If Ramza dies this way, the game is over. Even the best-laid plans can go sideways, and there’s nothing worse than having a character die early on in a fight and realizing you have no way to bring them back. Make sure at least one character has the Item skill equipped and Phoenix Down unlocked (it’s only 90 JP points) no matter what job they are. I usually have at least two or three.</p>

 <h2>Job Point spillover is your friend</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630278" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630278"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630278">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is full of math that never gets overtly explained. One of the most important calculations is called JP spillover. Every time a character earns Job Points, the rest of your characters in battle get 20 percent of those points to that same job. Even if they don’t have the job unlocked yet, the points will still accrue in the background, showing up once it’s available.</p>

 <p>This has two important uses. The first is you can have people double-up on jobs and unlock specific skills much faster. The other is that you can earn a small amount of points that let characters unlock one or two lower-level skills without them ever having actually spent time ranking up in that job. If you have a Chemist in your party earn 2,000 points, that will be enough for everyone else to learn Auto-Potion, one of the most useful counterattack skills in the game.</p>

 <h2>Drag battles out when you can so human enemies turn into crystals</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630283" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630283"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630283">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>When humans fall in battle, they can turn into treasure chests or crystals. The treasure chests aren’t that useful, but the crystals contain all of the Job skills those soldiers had when they died. This is a really efficient way to unlock skills without spending any points, especially for lower-level stuff on jobs that character isn’t currently using. For example, your Chemist, Knight, or Archer might grab a crystal from a White Mage and learn a bunch of useful secondary skills like Cure, Raise, and Protect without ever grinding as a White Mage. There’s just one caveat: they need to have the job unlocked to be able to earn the skills from it this way.</p> <h2>Stats grow differently depending on the job you have when you level up</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630287" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630287"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630287">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Here’s some more arcane math the game doesn’t tell you about. Jobs have different base stats, so if you go from being a Knight to a Thief, even if you don’t change anything else, that character will have less health but be faster. Well, these stats also change in the background as you level up (with XP) in particular jobs. Players have spent decades trying to get the rough math right <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/197339-final-fantasy-tactics/57636648">in charts like these</a>, but there are some key things even casual players should be aware of.</p> <ul> <li>Monks, Knights, and Lancers have the highest health growth multiplier.</li> <li>Monks and Ninjas have the highest attack growth multiplier.</li> <li>Ninjas, Thieves, and Monks have the highest Speed Multiplier.</li> <li>Wizards and Time Mages have the highest magic attack growth multiplier.</li> <li>Priests, Wizards, Time Mages, and Summoners have the highest magic point growth multiplier.</li> </ul> <p>Mimes, the hardest job to unlock in the game, have the highest all around stat growth potential, while Bards have the worst for male characters and Chemists have the worst for Female characters.</p>

 <h2>Ramza kicks ass as a Monk</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630288" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630288"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630288">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Thematically, it feels like the main character should be wearing armor and tanking hits out in front. It’s also bad if he dies, so survivability also seems like a priority. But Monks, even though they wear light armor and less of it, can be exceptionally strong, and Ramza, because of his underlying stats, is one of the strongest. In addition to hitting for lots of damage and maintaining good speed, he’ll also unlock all of the Martial Arts skills which include ranged attacks, health and MP healing, status ailment removal, and a revive. Best of all, these skills cost no MP and happen instantly.</p> <h2>Pay attention to Bravery and Faith</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630289" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630289"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630289">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>More numbers! Each character in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> has a Zodiac sign and two numbers near their name. The first is Bravery and it measures their ability to deal and take physical damage. The second is Faith and it’s involved in calculating the effectiveness of magic spells, both used and received. A high Faith character, for example, will have a higher likelihood of spells working and dealing more damage, but will also be more susceptible to them in return. Take note of these stats in the Recruiter’s office when you’re looking for new party members and when you’re deciding on their job trajectories.</p>

 <p>If someone’s pursuing magic, they’ll do best with a Faith stat over 60 (I like to aim for 70). Same for Bravery when it comes to physical fighters. Bravery also effects the likelihood of counterattacks activating. This is extra important for things like Auto-Potion. A low Bravery character won’t react to being hit with their counterattack skills as much.</p> <h2>You can out-level for story battles but not random encounters</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630280" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630280"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630280">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>If you’re stuck on a story battle like, say, the Dorter Slums or Lionel Castle Gate, you can keep grinding until your characters get powerful enough to overwhelm the enemy with sheer force. Random encounters, however, will always raise enemy levels to around where Ramza’s is, which is worth knowing before you try to go into a fight and grind with characters who are all learning new jobs they haven’t unlocked skills for yet.</p> <h2>Don’t rush into fights!</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630281" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630281"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630281">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>This is a lesson <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> tries to teach you itself in Ramza’s very first battle out of the academy when Delita warns him about taking things slow. Any time I have ever lost a battle, it is because I got way too aggressive way too early. This will leave your fastest, farthest-moving characters isolated and easy targets to be picked off while also spreading you out across the field too much.</p>

 <p>If you’re facing mostly Archers and Knights, turtle up and take advantage of healing and support spells that hit multiple allies at once. If you’re facing enemy spell casters, separate your party just enough to not have multiple people targeted at once while still being close enough together to burst down one enemy at a time.</p> <h2>Always buy the best armor you can afford</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630282" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630282"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630282">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Every couple of battles, new gear will become available at the Outfitter’s office. Armor doesn’t increase defense in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>. Instead, it raises health and magic point totals. Lighter armor will be a more balanced mix, while heavy armor prioritizes HP. It’s okay to switch things up to suit your character’s skills. A Knight that also casts White Magic will want to wear mage robes instead of a full suit of armor to get more magic points.</p> <p>In the old days, traveling back to town could mean getting stuck in a random encounter, but the remaster gives you the option to flee any battle on the map, so there’s no downside to constantly tracking back for supplies and better armor. Unless you’re playing on easy,<em> Final Fantasy Tactics</em> will require you to grind for cash and levels every so many story battles. Staying on top of the latest gear available will help even the odds.</p> <h2>Don’t under estimate the power of Move +1</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630292" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630292"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630292">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>One is the loneliest number. In a game full of big numbers, it can look especially unimpressive. But the maps in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> aren’t very big, and being able to move one extra square in any direction can pay off in big ways. Combine an early pair of Battle Boots with the Squire’s +1 movement ability and all of a sudden you have a 50-percent move bonus. Especially for characters who aren’t ranged, this can be the difference between contributing something meaningful to the fight during their turn and just constantly getting outmaneuvered until they die.</p>

              <p><span>I’m surprised it took </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>nearly a decade to have a proper skin creation contest, but Chinese artists are currently </span><a href="https://ow.blizzard.cn/trsj2025/#/"><span>competing for the chance to have a costume concept appear</span></a><span> in the hero shooter. Pushing aside with all our might the fact that it sucks that this is a China-exclusive deal when </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-comic-zenyatta-ramattra-2000628236"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i></a><span> is played all around the world, it’s an exciting prospect, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-juno-venture-sprays-ai-generated-2000626941"><span>thankfully, the competition has a hard ban on AI art</span></a><span>. The team at Blizzard will get the final say in what ends up in the game, but fan voting has a chance to tip the scales. The theme of the contest is “What if the Omnic Crisis never happened?” which, for those who aren’t versed in the lore, means that all of these soldiers and agents would have likely gone on to live normal lives without payload pushing and point capturing. Some of these skins are pretty great, others are going viral on social media for…other reasons. Let’s look at some of the standouts.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000630267" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630267"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630267">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The designs currently leading in fan voting are a set of three skins, one each for Cassidy, Kiriko, and Ramattra. Kiriko is dressed as a donut store employee, and even her fox spirit, which she casts out when she uses her ultimate, is carrying a pastry in its mouth. Cassidy hasn’t fallen too far from his roots, as he’s still depicted as a criminal, but as a fugitive on the run and dressed in prison orange. Ramattra is probably my favorite of the three, however; as the radical Omnic no longer has a war to wage, he has become a housekeeper. Making his staff a broom is a fun touch.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000630266" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630266"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630266">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The current second-place skin is one for the water-wielding hero Wuyang that sees him dressed as a firefighter. In retrospect, this concept is such an obvious fit for him I’m surprised Blizzard hadn’t made one itself. Though I’m not sure if the tank top would pass a regulations check.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000630265" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630265"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630265">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>While some of these skins don’t really seem on-theme and just look like artists wanted to put their favorite character in a pretty dress (valid), my favorites are the ones that truly imagine where these characters might have ended up if they’d been born in a peaceful world. Zenyatta as a traffic police officer throwing tickets instead of his signature orbs is inspired.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000630264" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630264"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630264">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>However, one submission circulating in the community has been gaining traction particularly rapidly on social media and, by extension, in the competition. The Chew Time-Huskyrat skin for Junkrat has crossed my desk a few times over the past couple of days, and it’s pretty imaginative, to say the least. At a glance, it’s actually a pretty fun skin that has the explosive hero putting away his bombs for bones and chew toys and looking like a fairly standard mascot character. If you look more closely, though, you see it’s also meant to be a reference to pup play and furry culture, and he’s wearing a diaper, which has plenty of implications you can google if you’re curious. I don’t think there’s a chance in hell that Blizzard puts this one in the game, even if it somehow skyrocketed to the top of the leaderboard, but it has entered the top 10, and fans are losing it as it climbs the ranks.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cancel that Chinese skin vote right fucking now why does the Junkrat furry diaper fetish skin have so many votes</p> <p>— jamie🎐 (@VentureFootJob) <a href="https://twitter.com/VentureFootJob/status/1971794747078726003?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">the concept of junkrat being a diaper furry if the omnic crisis never happened <a href="https://t.co/WpHSF7AiNr">pic.twitter.com/WpHSF7AiNr</a></p> <p>— matt 🗯 (@6luelights) <a href="https://twitter.com/6luelights/status/1971902800667050158?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">being a junkrat fan after the diaperfur skin surfaced <a href="https://t.co/58Qlt1PqPy">https://t.co/58Qlt1PqPy</a></p> <p>— fRankie 🐀💬 #TRANSMASCJUNKRAT💙💗🤍💗💙 (@vishkar_junkrat) <a href="https://twitter.com/vishkar_junkrat/status/1971984646000071042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">STOP SAYING ID LIKE THE JUNKRAT FAN ART I DO NOT. 😭😭😭😭 <a href="https://t.co/AA1pzPlvhG">https://t.co/AA1pzPlvhG</a></p> <p>— Aspen (@aspenisoffline) <a href="https://twitter.com/aspenisoffline/status/1972332121793700011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">IS JUNKRAT WEARING A DIAPER 😦 <a href="https://t.co/R2t1Fsj4Jw">pic.twitter.com/R2t1Fsj4Jw</a></p> <p>— Rowan🌱Lifeweaver CEO 🌷 (@adoringniran) <a href="https://twitter.com/adoringniran/status/1971836185359405251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">"…and then, in 2025, overwatch finally hosted a fan design contest."<br>⁰"how fabulous! did anyone submit anything good?"<br>⁰"someone drew furry junkrat… in a diaper…"<br>⁰"oh darling, that is simply dreadful!"<br>⁰"i know, rarity. i know…" <a href="https://t.co/QRRGbrzHJQ">pic.twitter.com/QRRGbrzHJQ</a></p> <p>— 𝘱𝘺𝘳𝘢 ໒꒱ (@pyraVT) <a href="https://twitter.com/pyraVT/status/1972252773866725666?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>E</span><span>ight winners will be chosen, including one first-place entry, two second-place winners, and two third-place contestants, and a popularity award will be granted to the top three highest-voted designs.

              <p>We’re still about a week out from Prime Day — Amazon’s big sales week ahead of Black Friday in which you can save tons on tech, home goods, and more. Even though the deals event isn’t here yet, some stuff has already begun to see some major discounts. If you’re hoping to save some cash on some new stuff for your PC or laptop, you can. Take this docking station for example. Anker has a USB hub that’s normally priced at $270. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">Right now, Amazon has it marked down by 37%. That saves you a cool $100, bringing the price to just $170 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stay Organized and Versatile</h2>
<p>This docking station from Anker can bring all of your devices together in one place. No mess on your desktop. This hub will allow you to connect to multiple displays, transfer data quickly, or even charge all your devices easily from one place.</p>
<p>The anker hub employs a number of different ports to manage your different needs. along the front, you’ll find four USB-C ports, two of which are capable of up to 100W max output and the other two capable of transfer speeds of up to 10Gb/s. You’ll also find two USB-A ports, one designed for charging at 12W max and the other for data transfer. When all charging ports are being used, you’ll have a total output of 160W.</p>
<p>The front smart screen display will show you information about the charging output to your plugged-in devices. An audio jack is also on the front beneath that to connect to headphones.</p>



<p>When we turn the Anker docking station around, we find three more USB-A data ports, capable of up to 480Mb/s. Two HDMI 2.0 ports are there so you can connect to multiple displays at once, allowing for up to 4K resolution. You have an Ethernet port capable of up to 1Gb/s. And then we have a USB-C upstream port.</p>
<p>With a ton of electronic devices plugged into the hub, you may be worried about overheating. Well the hub employs ActiveShield temperature monitoring to check temperature levels three million times a day. The airflow system efficiently works to keep the unit cool while it’s on. In the event it does overheat despite that, the smart display can warn you with overheat alerts.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">For a limited time, Amazon has the Anker USB-C docking station on sale for a huge $100 discount</a>. The price is down from $270 to just $170 right now.</p>
