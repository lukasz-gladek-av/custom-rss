              <p>The internal SSD market doesn’t have a ton of options if you want a powerful drive, but Samsung is definitely leading the race right now. If you’re looking for a 2TB SSD that offers serious speed at a reasonable price point, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3807/">Samsung’s 990 EVO Plus just dropped to an all-time low price on Amazon at only $119, down from $176</a>. That’s a crazy good deal compared to similar drives from Crucial or WD_Black that go for $129 to $189 right now. Plus, it’s getting <strong>rave reviews with a solid 4.8 out of 5 stars</strong>, so it’s definitely worth a look.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3807/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Insane Speed</h2>
<p>This Samsung 990 EVO Plus has a <strong>PCIe Gen 4×4 interface</strong> and features <strong>read speeds of up to 7,250 MB/s</strong>. What does that do for you? Quick game loading, quick file transfer, and apps in a flash, cutting down on waiting time big time. It’s an M.2 2280 size, basically saying it will be compatible with nearly any new laptop or desktop available. Samsung also uses something called HMB Technology which allows the drive to manage its memory smoothly.</p>
<p>The drive also has Intelligent Turbowrite 2.0 which boosts write speeds when you most need them. That’s a nice little kick when you’re copying data or moving files around, so the whole system feels nippier as time goes on while the drive smartly learns about how you use it. This’s not necessarily about raw speed: it’s about keeping your system responsive and efficient. And let’s be honest, Samsung’s all about quality, so this SSD is well-ventilated and won’t drain your battery even if you’re using it hard.</p>



<p>Worried about how long it will last? This SSD is built to endure. It includes a high Total Bytes Written (TBW) rating, which is just geek speak for “it can write a whole lot of data throughout its lifetime,” so you can game, work or store a gazillion files without fear. Samsung also offers great software utilities that let you keep tabs on your drive’s health and optimize its performance easily.</p>
<p>At this cost and with Samsung’s impeccable track record, the 990 EVO Plus 2TB SSD is a deal that won’t leave you disappointed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For many months now, some fans online have suggested that <a href="https://kotaku.com/onimusha-way-sword-pragmata-resident-evil-9-preview-2000618849">Capcom’s upcoming sci-fi adventure <em>Pragmata</em></a> is actually a secret<em> Mega Man r</em>eboot. However, <em>Pragmata’s</em> producer says it is not, even laughing about the conspiracy theory when recently asked about it.</p> <p>Fans and content creators online have spread this theory around for a while. Many point out that <em>Pragmata’s</em> cybergirl sidekick, Diana, shares a lot of design elements with Mega Man<em>,</em> with her coat lending her the robot’s signature color and her arm expanding during some moments in a way reminiscent of the Blue Bomber’s oversized blaster arm. There’s also the game’s narrative setup, which involves evil robots. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcom-settles-it-no-pragmata-isnt-a-secret-mega-man-game/">But, in a recent interview with&nbsp;<em>VGC</em></a><em>,</em> <em>Pragmata’s</em> producer Naoto Oyama completely denied this theory.</p> <p>“<em>Pragmata</em> is not a <em>Mega Man</em> game,” said Oyama. <em>VGC</em> also reports he was laughing as he answered the question. He then added, “It is a completely new game from Capcom.</p>

 <p>“I was actually one of the producers on the <em>Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collectio</em>n as well, so I’m happy to see that people who love <em>Mega Man</em> are passionate about <em>Pragmata</em> too,” Oyama told the outlet. “From my standpoint, it’s nice to see people are being so positive about it.”</p> <p>So that seems like a definitive no. However, I expect some fans will claim that Capcom is lying. That, <em>of course</em>, they won’t confirm <em>Pragmata’s</em> connection to <em>Mega Man</em>. It’s supposed to be a big secret, so Capcom will deny it until <em>Pragmata</em> launches sometime in 2026. (<a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-pragmata-delay-delayed-2023-2024-ps5-xbox-pc-1850531732">Remember when this game was revealed in 2020 and was supposed to be out in 2022?</a>)</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="PRAGMATA – Announcement Trailer, Extended Cut | Next Gen (2022)" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZJxXPZGmTzY?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>However, I’d argue that Capcom knows how much people want new<em> Mega Man</em> games, and if they were making one, they’d be shouting about it from the rooftops. Also, keep in mind that Capcom isn’t above referencing and hinting at other games in their new IPs. <a href="https://kotaku.com/exoprimal-dino-crisis-reboot-sequel-dinosaur-shooter-ca-1849066060">We saw this happen with <em>Exoprimal</em></a>, which many fans were convinced was a <em>Dino Crisis</em> game. And to fans’ credit, Capcom did include a woman with red hair in a debut trailer for the game about dinosaurs. So I’m not surprised there’s some <em>Mega Man</em> inspiration in <em>Pragmata</em>. Capcom really needs people to remember this game exists and care about it in 2026. And what better way to do that than by sprinkling a few references to something much more popular and hoping the fans take the bait.</p> <p>Anyway, even if <em>Pragmata</em> isn’t a <em>Mega Man</em> game (and I really don’t think it is), the game sounds like it might be an interesting throwback to the kind of linear action games we got back in the 2010s on Xbox 360 and PS3. <a href="https://kotaku.com/pragmata-capcom-preview-summer-game-fest-impressions-1851784342">Here’s what our own Kenneth Shepard thought about it when he played it earlier this year</a>:</p> <blockquote><p><em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>feels a bit like a game out of time, as its gruff old man protagonist, slow-moving enemies, and brutalist sci-fi aesthetic are all evocative of the over-the-shoulder shooters from the PS360 era. Given those seemingly bygone qualities, it’d be easy for&nbsp;<em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>to feel rote and dated, but what I played was just inventive enough to feel novel. I was super impressed with it.</p></blockquote>
