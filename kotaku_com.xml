It’s an interesting idea that currently seems like more trouble than it’s worth. <br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,197298" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Microsoft announced Copilot in-game assistance over <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/13/new-copilot-for-gaming-save-time-help-get-good/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/13/new-copilot-for-gaming-save-time-help-get-good/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on the Xbox Wire blog</a></span> on Thursday and briefly showed how it will work <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoUDVNjDUSw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZoUDVNjDUSw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the latest episode of the Official Xbox Podcast</a></span>. The examples included an AI voice telling a player who to pick in <em>Overwatch 2 </em>and a chatbot explaining how to craft wood planks in <em>Minecraft</em>. The program also offered feedback on past in-game failures in <em>Age of Empires</em> and could be used to pull up strategy guides if the player remained stuck.</p><p>Perhaps the silliest use case presented in the podcast was telling the Copilot AI to install a game which, if communicating with Copilot via text at least, would seemingly require several more taps and clicks than just doing that manually (a process that already takes only seconds on mobile). The YouTube page is full of people asking why AI needs to be part of the experience at all.</p><figure id="" data-id="a60ea39d3f3684ef58fd764d74785999" data-recommend-id="image://a60ea39d3f3684ef58fd764d74785999" data-format="png" data-width="614" data-height="344" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microsoft / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a60ea39d3f3684ef58fd764d74785999" data-recommend-id="image://a60ea39d3f3684ef58fd764d74785999" data-format="png" data-width="614" data-height="344" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="9baed66410ae15c7de1abaf61412ec39" data-recommend-id="image://9baed66410ae15c7de1abaf61412ec39" data-format="png" data-width="642" data-height="331" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot displays a conversation with AI.

Instead of telling me how to do a thing in a game, maybe it could just do it for me, like a more experienced friend would if they were playing with me. Maybe the Copilot can show my kid how to grow food to keep his workers from starving during the winter in <em>Overthrown</em> instead of him asking me every five minutes. </p><p>The use cases quickly snowball from there, however, and probably not in a direction Microsoft wants. Why stop at helping me control my console more easily or bypass a frustrating part of a game? Why not have the Xbox Copilot do my dailies for me and grind random encounters in my favorite JRPG while I scroll TikTok? Let the AI grind the battle pass and pop achievements. One reason not to do that might be that I don’t want Copilot spying on me and my family. Or, if it eventually becomes a paid service like it will presumably have to be in order to be financially sustainable, even the cheevos it could earn for me wouldn’t be worth it.<br></p><p>We’ll see how useful, frightening, or silly the tool ends up being once it’s out. In the meantime, Microsoft also revealed that over 1,000 games like <em>Balatro </em>are now Play Anywhere between Xbox and PC, and the number is expected to keep rising.

I made it through countless ship battles with a half-finished crew before I dove into the assignment menus. But if you’d like to make the most out of the pirates you recruit, assign them based on skills to the appropriate squad. There are three: <strong>Cannon Squad</strong>, <strong>Boarding Squad</strong>, and <strong>Support Squad</strong>.</p><h2 id="h5579"><a id=""></a><strong>Cannon Squad</strong></h2><p>Your Cannon Squad is relatively self-explanatory. These brave men and women act as your first line of offense, manning the various port and starboard cannons during a naval battle. Should you take damage during said battle, a few will divert their attention to repairs, keeping the Goromaru floating.</p><p>To maximize your Cannon Squad, opt for <strong>Cannon Power </strong>and <strong>Ship Upkeep</strong> skills to help bolster damage and increase healing capabilities.</p><h2 id="h5580"><a id=""></a><strong>Boarding Squad</strong></h2><p>While your Cannon Squad launches its first assault, your Boarding Squad launches the follow-up, close-quarters battle to take command of an enemy vessel in forward-facing combat. When you slam into an enemy ship, the crewmates assigned to your boarding squad, alongside Majima, jump across the gap to swing swords.</p><p>To make the most of your Boarding Squad, choose skills that will significantly enhance the <strong>Attack </strong>and <strong>Defense </strong>of each combatant.</p><h2 id="h5581"><a id=""></a><strong>Support Squad</strong></h2><p>The Gorumara’s Support Squad is the only unit in your misfit pirate crew that won’t fight in open combat. They’re background actors, helping to buff your other squads through passive abilities.</p><p>Some of the pirates you recruit simply won’t hold their own in a sword fight, so assign them to the Support Squad to help boost, say, combat potential or healing capabilities for the whole crew.</p><hr><p>With the right crew meta, you’ll find that no battle is too harsh, not even the dreaded giant squid lurking in the waters around Madlantis. <em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em> is available now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
