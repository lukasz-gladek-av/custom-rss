              <p>Meta launched a second generation of Ray-Ban smart glasses with incremental improvements but the original model remains compelling through proven functionality and dramatically lower pricing. The <strong>Gen 1 Ray-Ban Meta featuring 12MP camera, open-ear speakers, and AI assistant integration</strong> delivers the core smart glasses experience without the premium that newest hardware commands.</p>
<p>The price gap tells the story clearly: Gen 2 models cost $410 while these <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6031/">Gen 1 Wayfarers hit $262 during Black Friday on Amazon (down from $329) which is roughly 40% savings for hardware</a> that differs minimally in daily use. <strong>All coloris and frame styles</strong> receive identical discounting and the<strong> #1 bestseller status in tech glasses</strong> validates that buyers love it.</p>

<h2>12MP Camera That Shows Different Angles</h2>
<p>With the built-in 12MP camera, <strong>you can take pictures and videos hands-free from your exact point of view</strong>: This makes content that smartphones can’t make without awkward arm extensions or obvious filming. Parents keep track of their kids’ soccer games, recitals, and everyday moments by looking them in the eye and being present instead of watching through phone screens. Perspective shots that show what you really saw instead of what cameras picked up from hand-held positions that were slightly off from your line of sight make travel photography more real.</p>



<p><strong>Video recording can last up to 60 seconds per clip in 1080p resolution</strong>, and this is long enough to capture important moments without using too much storage space or battery life that would come with unlimited recording. Birthday cake presentations, scenic overlooks, and quick tutorials all fit easily into the 60-second window. This limit encourages people to film on purpose instead of filming for hours and hours and hours of footage that needs to be edited. The Meta View app automatically syncs the captured content to your phone, keeping everything organized without the need for manual file management or card readers.</p>
<p><strong>Open-ear speakers send sound</strong> in a way that only you can hear at normal volumes: This lets you listen privately without the isolation or discomfort that comes with wearing earbuds for a long time. You can still hear podcast episodes, directions, phone calls, and music while being aware of conversations, traffic, and other sounds that are important for safety. <strong>This technology is great for walking, biking, or any situation where complete audio isolation could be dangerous</strong> or lead to bad behavior.</p>



<p>Meta’s software lets <strong>you use voice commands to control photos, calls, messages, and information queries</strong> without having to touch your phone. You can ask the glasses to take a picture, make a call, send a message, or answer factual questions by speaking naturally, which is easier than trying to use your phone. The hands-free feature is useful when cooking, working out, or doing anything else where it’s hard or impossible to reach your phone.</p>
<p><strong>Ray-Ban’s classic look is kept with the iconic Wayfarer style</strong> which is better than the obvious tech-forward designs that scream “smart glasses” and cause problems in social situations. The matte black frames and polarized gradient graphite lenses make these look like high-end sunglasses first and wearable technology second. This means they can be worn in both professional and social settings where tech that stands out is not appropriate.</p>
<p><strong>The battery lasts through full days of moderate use</strong> which includes taking a few photos, making a few videos, streaming music, and making calls without having to charge it in the middle of the day. The charging case that comes with it lets you charge it more than once on trips that last more than one day when there aren’t many wall outlets available.</p>
<p>There is a $148 difference between the Gen 1 models, which cost $262, and the Gen 2 models, which cost $410, and most users won’t even notice the improvements in their normal use. This record-low price makes smart glasses available without the usual trade-offs or extra costs for early adopters.</p>

              <p>The biggest shopping event of the year is almost here, and you know what that means; saving big on items that rarely go on sale. It’s especially a great time to treat yourself to some Apple products, since we’re spotting iPads, audio gear, and even MacBooks dropping to their lowest ever prices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">One of the best discounts live right now is the Apple AirPods 4 with ANC marked down to just $99.99.</a> These typically retail for $179, so you’re saving a whopping nearly $80 on the pair. These have dipped to around $130 during past sales, but $99.99 is the lowest we’ve seen them go in a long time. Even crazier? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/">The non-ANC AirPods 4 are nearly 50% off at just 69, which is an insane deal for the latest model.&nbsp;</a>The deal is open to all shoppers, whether you have a Prime subscription or not.</p>
<p>It’s best to get your orders in fast, as we’re not expecting the deal to stick around for long.</p>

<h2>Adaptive Noise Cancelation for an Immersive Experience</h2>
<p>Apple unveiled its AirPods 4 last year, after redesigning the pair for exceptional all-day comfort and greater stability. The redefined contour makes for a better fit, while the shorter stem keeps the frame minimal. The build is responsive, meaning you can just press the earbuds to control music and manage calls.</p>
<p>The pair is packed with Apple’s powerful H2 chip to unlock an immersive, rich audio experience with two modes; Active Noise Cancelation and Transparency. ANC blocks background noise and chatter, letting you vibe to your favorite songs or listen to podcasts without distractions. It’s great for noisy, chaotic public places where you just can’t seem to focus on what’s playing. Putting the buds on will disconnect you from the outside world, making it feel like you’re in a quiet room even when you’re packed into a subway.</p>
<p>Transparency mode does the opposite. It lets some ambient sound in, so that you can stay aware of what’s happening around while still enjoying high-quality audio. It’s better for public settings where you don’t want to miss when someone tries to interact. Even better, there’s Conversation Awareness that automatically lowers the volume of what’s playing when someone talks to you. You won’t have to awkwardly take the earbuds out just to hear the other person properly.</p>
<p>Spatial Audio with dynamic head tracking is supported, too. It places audio all around you for a 3D experience, letting you enjoy your favorite movies and TV shows better.</p>



<p>Voice/video calls get a boost with Voice Isolation, a feature that reduces background noise while clarifying yours. Catch up with friends on the go, or hop on meetings in a cafe without having to repeat yourself or constantly apologizing for the background noise. It plays nicely with Siri, so you can use the voice assistant for hands-free convenience throughout the day. Just say “Hey Siri”, and ask it to play music, make calls, or check your schedule. It’s helpful when you’re behind the wheel and don’t want to take your attention off the road, or even when both your hands are busy typing and picking up the phone would break your flow.</p>
<p>On a single charge, AirPods 4 give you around 5 hours of listening in the standard mode, while up to 4 hours with ANC on. Drop them back into the charging case, and your total extends to 30 hours. The pair is also IP54-rated dust, sweat, and water resistant. Intense workouts in the gym or a few splashes here and there won’t affect the functionality.</p>
<p>All things considered, AirPods 4 are some of the best wireless earbuds out there. You’re getting impressive sound, two listening modes, and a reliable battery life, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6034/">all for just $99.99 (ANC)</a> and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6035/">$69 (without ANC) right now.</a></p>
