              <p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> just swept at The Game Awards. French studio Sandfall Interactive—the devs behind this stylistic turn-based RPG—set a record for the show winning in nine separate categories including Game of the Year. Want to see what all the fuss is about? Secure yourself an Xbox Series X to play it in beautiful 4K. The full MSRP as of late has been $650 for Xbox’s most elite gaming console. However for a limited time, Amazon is selling it for an 8% discount. This shaves the price down by $50, bringing it to just $600.</p>
<p>Okay, let’s take a quick detour into the Xbox Series X’s price history. Back when the Xbox Series X and Series S first launched in 2020, the former of which was priced at just $500. Back in May, Microsoft announced the company would be increasing the console prices, which raised the Series X by a whole $100 to $600. Then just a couple months back, they did it again—by $50 to $650. This might just be the only console generation to see it’s systems go up in price rather than down. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6384/">So with all that said, this discount does save you $50, by bringing the Xbox consoles back down to it’s Spring and Summer MSRP.</a></p>

<h2>Xbox Series X vs. Xbox Series S</h2>
<p>When looking at the Xbox Series X next to it’s more affordable counterpart—the Xbox Series S—you’ll find some substantial perks that justifies the price gap.

<p>The Series X is also equipped with a disc drive. If you value keeping a physical collection of your games, the the Xbox Series X is the way to go. It’s also good to have at least one Blu-ray player in the house and this console can be that for your home.</p>



<p>Both the Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S makes use of the Xbox Velocity Architecture. This Microsoft tech is what makes the consoles super-fast load times possible. It also allows support for Quick Resume. This feature allows you to hop back and forth between games without having to close out or restart them. They will suspend your progress and return you right to where you were when you last had on the game. No need to hunt down a save point before shutting down for the day.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Forget Samsung Odyssey, Alienware Restocks Its 34″ Curved Gaming Monitor at an All-Time Low After Sellout]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-samsung-odyssey-alienware-restocks-its-34-curved-gaming-monitor-at-an-all-time-low-after-sellout-2000651038</link>
            <guid>1382893</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="129" data-end="949">If you’ve never spent time using a curved monitor, it’s easy to assume the design is just a marketing trick. I used to think the same until I started gaming on one myself. Once you’re positioned at the ideal distance and angle, the curve subtly pulls you into whatever you’re playing or watching in a way that a flat screen doesn’t quite match. The viewing experience feels more natural as the display envelopes your view. Curved monitors have come down in price over the last several years, so they’re far more accessible additions to gaming setups today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6383/">A great example is the Alienware 34-inch curved gaming monitor, which is currently 28% off.</a> Although it normally lists for $699 on Amazon, the discount drops it to just $500—leaving you with an extra $199 in your pocket.</p>
<p data-start="993" data-end="1509">Alienware’s 34-inch OLED monitor makes a strong first impression through its sheer size and shape. The ultrawide screen features a 1800R curvature, a design meant to better align with the natural way our eyes perceive the world. We don’t see our surroundings in a flat rectangle; our view is curved and panoramic. That’s why displays like this can make games feel more cinematic and immersive. The curved layout draws your attention toward the center while still keeping peripheral details within comfortable view.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6383/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="993" data-end="1509">Lag-Free Gameplay</h2>
<p data-start="1511" data-end="1948">In terms of performance, the monitor delivers a crisp QHD 1440p resolution, backed by a fast 165 Hz maximum refresh rate. This combination ensures smooth, responsive motion, which is especially valuable in fast-paced games. AMD FreeSync Premium and VESA Adaptive Sync both work to reduce stuttering and eliminate screen tearing for a consistently fluid gaming experience.</p>
<p data-start="1511" data-end="1948">Remarkably, this monitor’s input time i just 0.1ms. You read that right. Not 1ms, but 0.1ms. You kind of don’t realize just what a game changer a good response time is until you’ve experienced it, and this is the industry’s fastest.</p>


<p data-start="1950" data-end="2355">We also know extended screen time can strain your eyes, particularly with bright displays. For long sessions—whether you’re gaming, editing, or working—the Alienware curved monitor includes hardware-driven blue light reduction settings accessible through its onboard console. This helps maintain visual comfort while still delivering rich colors and contrast, so you don’t have to sacrifice image quality.</p>
<p data-start="2357" data-end="2881">Connectivity is another strong point. On the back, you’ll find an HDMI ports and two DisplayPorts, allowing you to connect multiple devices simultaneously. You might use it primarily with your gaming PC, while also keeping something like a Nintendo Switch 2 plugged in and ready. Switching between inputs is seamless, saving you from unplugging cables or rearranging your entire setup. The monitor also includes multiple USB ports for added convenience.</p>
<p data-start="3089" data-end="3252" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6383/">For a limited time, you can pick up the Alienware 34-inch curved gaming monitor for just $500—a strong value for anyone looking to make the best of their gaming experience.</a></p>

              <p>Forza Horizon 5 hit the PlayStation 5 storefront earlier this year. You best dip in to experience one of the best racing games of the generation. And if you want to make the experience extra special, get yourself the right tool to make it feel like you’re really behind the wheel—because you’re really be behind the wheel. A wheel. The Logitech G923 racing wheel and pedals for PlayStation consoles, PC, and Mac is heavily discounted at the moment. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6381/">The pair is normally sold for $400 at Amazon, but right now, it’s been brought down by 30%.</a> That cuts out a whole $130, bringing the price to just $280 for a limited time.</p>
<p>Not on PlayStation yourself? You’re an Xbox kid? Say no more. Amazon also has the same Logitech G923 racing wheel and pedals kit but for Xbox consoles.&nbsp; If you’re on PC, you get your pick of the litter. Either model will work for you. Just decide which you like better. Xbox’s AXYB setup, or PlayStation’s X, square, circle, triangle setup.</p>
<p>This racing kit is designed for ultra-realism. It’s all built out of premium materials. Brushed metal wheel with a hand-stitched black leather cover and polished metal petals.&nbsp; That’s nicer than what the wheel of my actual car looks like.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6381/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fully Immersive Racing</h2>
<p>You need the weight of a real wheel in your hand to translate to full immersion with your racing game. Your movements are processed by the wheel at 4,000 times per second, ensuring you have the best control over your in-game car, and the provide feedback through the hardware to make it feel like you’re really putting rubber to the pavement. You’ll feel every little bump along the racetrack like you would in the seat of a real race car.</p>
<p>The wheel has a programmable dual clutch, allowing you to kick out of the starting line clean and fast. It simulates a real race car launch assist when playing with games that support it.</p>



<p>The pedals are pressure sensitive, allowing you to brake slowly or immediately like you would driving a real vehicle.</p>
<p>The levels of force feedback and wheel sensitivity is fully customizable. You can make any tweak you need from major to minor right in the Logitech G Hub app, which can be launched with one button press on the controller.</p>
<p>Now, pockets of the gaming community love to get their hands on weird controllers to speed run notoriously difficult games with them. Folks have become Elden Lord on a DDR pad or slain Crota with a Rock Band drum set. Are you one of these gamers? Maybe you can be the first to dethrone Grandmother Silk with a racing wheel and pedal kit. Just got to set your mind to it.</p>
