Otherwise, we still don’t have a trailer or even a real synopsis of what season 4 proper will entail. I assume it will be the usual mix of dueling egos and knowing video game dunks, but hopefully there’s some more trenchant, contemporary criticism mixed in. <em>Mythic Quest </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-we-loved-and-hated-about-mythic-quest-a-tv-show-a-1841365855&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-we-loved-and-hated-about-mythic-quest-a-tv-show-a-1841365855">still has one of the best jokes</a></span> about gaming ever made. </p><p>For those who haven’t yet taken the plunge on Apple’s video-game-flavored riff on shows like <em>Community</em>, it’s about the charming but dysfunctional studio behind a hit MMORPG in the mold of <em>World of Warcraft</em> and the ways they self-sabotage one another while working through their personal foibles and attempting to grow past their character flaws. It’s a perfect example of Apple TV’s narrow, lowkey success with original programming that is very good and almost nobody is watching. People can start remedying that in the meantime by catching up on seasons 1-3. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Instead, the team’s goal is to remaster the entire game and every asset in it. And so far, it’s looking really good. </p><p>In a new behind-the-scenes trailer released on November 14, Nvidia sat down with some of the modders working on<em> Half-Life 2 RTX </em>and let them talk about why they are remastering this game and what it means to them 20 years later. (Yeah, <em>Half-Life 2</em> turns 20 on November 16.) And in the new trailer, we see a lot of <em>HL2 RTX</em> in action and it looks phenomenal. </p><p>The team’s goal isn’t to change how <em>Half-Life 2</em> plays, but instead to add a new coat of paint to the old shooter to make it look better than ever. This means remaking many props and assets to be higher quality, replacing textures with new ones that react properly to lights, and much, much more. It’s honestly one of the best looking remasters I’ve ever seen. </p><p>Nvidia says <em>Half-Life 2 RTX </em>is still in early development, so no idea when we’ll get a chance to play this mod. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477290/HalfLife_2_RTX/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2477290/HalfLife_2_RTX/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can now find a new Steam page</a></span> for the mod on Valve’s storefront, which shows that while Valve isn’t officially involved, they are cool with the project.

And even though all of its many currencies and systems can make for a confusing impression, it didn’t take long for players to figure out metas. And now we can share that information with you! From the three available booster packs from the launch period of the new expansion, we’ve put together a ranking of the top eleven cards.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-guide-how-to-get-cards-1851689908&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-guide-how-to-get-cards-1851689908"><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> Can Be Deeply Confusing At First, So Here Are The Basics</a></span></p><p>This list will be based specifically on cards from the initial expansion. We won’t be including any limited-time promo cards, although we will give a special shout-out to the Lapras ex card. If you’re interested in what to look out for from <em>Genetic Apex</em>, these are the best cards you can pull.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ca227c54539c92844afe0e9015d583a0" data-recommend-id="image://ca227c54539c92844afe0e9015d583a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Alakazam card, showing the Pokémon focusing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Alakazam card, showing the Pokémon focusing." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ca227c54539c92844afe0e9015d583a0" data-recommend-id="image://ca227c54539c92844afe0e9015d583a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Alakazam card, showing the Pokémon focusing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Under the right circumstances, Alakazam will hit like a truck. His Psychic attack does 60 base damage plus an additional 30 damage for each energy attached to your opponent’s active Pokémon. Considering that most ex Pokémon require three or four energy to use a strong attack, Alakazam can easily dish out 150 or 180 damage.</p><p>The biggest detriment is that he will require quite a bit of work. You’ll need to evolve an Abra and then evolve a Kadabra before you can get this guy on the field. It’s a great idea to set up Alakazam on your bench while using other Pokémon in the active spot. On the other hand, it’s a bad start if you have to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-battles-first-turn-rules-energy-1851693195&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-battles-first-turn-rules-energy-1851693195">go first</a></span> and put an Abra in the active spot.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="34998c0e96def2b970de9d3f27a4d9d2" data-recommend-id="image://34998c0e96def2b970de9d3f27a4d9d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gengar smiles deviously in the Gengar ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gengar smiles deviously in the Gengar ex card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="34998c0e96def2b970de9d3f27a4d9d2" data-recommend-id="image://34998c0e96def2b970de9d3f27a4d9d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gengar smiles deviously in the Gengar ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One of the more unique utility Pokémon to use is Gengar ex. The 170 HP and 100 damage attack certainly help it stand out, but its best contribution will be the Shadowy Spellbind ability. It’s only active when Gengar ex is in the active spot, but it stops your opponent from using Supporter cards. This is a great way to stop an enemy from powering up their Pokémon or from messing with yours.</p><p>Just like Alakazam, an issue here is that Gengar ex is a stage two Pokémon. You will need to evolve two times to bring it out. There is also an inherent risk as an ex card, since it could cost you two points if it’s knocked out. Charizard ex or even Gyarados can spell trouble against this troublemaker ghost.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="866665fe55e9cae83326e6f7bb65ea2e" data-recommend-id="image://866665fe55e9cae83326e6f7bb65ea2e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Pidgeot card shows the bird grabbing hold of a Magikarp." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Pidgeot card shows the bird grabbing hold of a Magikarp." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="866665fe55e9cae83326e6f7bb65ea2e" data-recommend-id="image://866665fe55e9cae83326e6f7bb65ea2e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Pidgeot card shows the bird grabbing hold of a Magikarp." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Next is another fantastic utility Pokémon. Pidgeot can use its Drive Off ability once per turn to switch out your opponent’s active Pokémon to the bench. It’s like a Sabrina card you can use every turn! Best of all, it can do all this from the bench.</p><p>You might notice the pattern, but Pidgeot can take a while to come out since you’ll need to evolve a Pidgey and Pidgeotto. The only other concern is that its Wing Attack dealing 70 damage is kind of just okay. Thankfully, that is balanced out by a lax two-energy requirement.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3dee6dc1c29c483347240755e2267296" data-recommend-id="image://3dee6dc1c29c483347240755e2267296" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Misty Supporter card shows the eponymous Water trainer confidently posing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Misty Supporter card shows the eponymous Water trainer confidently posing." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3dee6dc1c29c483347240755e2267296" data-recommend-id="image://3dee6dc1c29c483347240755e2267296" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Misty Supporter card shows the eponymous Water trainer confidently posing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>That brings us to the first Supporter card on the list, and naturally, it’s Misty. This must-have for Water-type decks relies entirely on luck. You select one Water Pokémon and then keep flipping coins until you flip tails. The Pokémon will gain one energy for each time the coin flips heads.</p><p>A match’s momentum can easily switch when this card is used. Being able to fully load up a strong Water Pokémon that didn’t have any energy before is a huge game-changer. Conversely, immediately flipping tails will make this the biggest waste of a Supporter card. The sheer impact it can have cements it a spot on this list.</p><p>It also has an unproven, but certainly real bug where every time I use it I’ll only flip one head, but my opponents will get at least three when they use it. They really need to fix that.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0b44846aba4dd77cc0ec25f3d9b87e68" data-recommend-id="image://0b44846aba4dd77cc0ec25f3d9b87e68" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A large blue bird flies out of the borders of the Articuno ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A large blue bird flies out of the borders of the Articuno ex card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0b44846aba4dd77cc0ec25f3d9b87e68" data-recommend-id="image://0b44846aba4dd77cc0ec25f3d9b87e68" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A large blue bird flies out of the borders of the Articuno ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Speaking of strong Water-types, you can’t mention the best without including Articuno ex. A basic ex Pokémon has plenty of potential and this Legendary easily proves that. Its Blizzard attack deals 80 damage but also has the benefit of inflicting 10 damage to your opponent’s benched Pokémon. </p><p>Aside from the risk of your opponent gaining two points if it’s knocked out, the only other problem is that it takes three energy to use Blizzard. Articuno ex can make up for that with a 40-damage Ice Wing attack that only requires two energy.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="19661a6ed0e69238211d497857c1f460" data-recommend-id="image://19661a6ed0e69238211d497857c1f460" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The yellow electric mouse jumps out of the Pikachu ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The yellow electric mouse jumps out of the Pikachu ex card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="19661a6ed0e69238211d497857c1f460" data-recommend-id="image://19661a6ed0e69238211d497857c1f460" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The yellow electric mouse jumps out of the Pikachu ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The face of the brand earns a spot here as well. Pikachu ex has access to the powerful Circle Circuit attack, which does 30 damage for every Lightning-type Pokémon on your bench. A full bench can output 90 damage as long as they’re all the correct type.</p><p>There isn’t much too much to complain about here. Circle Circuit can deal a lot of damage for just two energy. What prevents this from landing higher is that it’s entirely dependent on your bench, and 120 HP isn’t great for an ex card that can’t promise consistent damage.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="86808c5c23a97d5bcbf6ba64d037202a" data-recommend-id="image://86808c5c23a97d5bcbf6ba64d037202a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Professor Oak waves in the Professor’s Research card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Professor Oak waves in the Professor’s Research card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="86808c5c23a97d5bcbf6ba64d037202a" data-recommend-id="image://86808c5c23a97d5bcbf6ba64d037202a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Professor Oak waves in the Professor’s Research card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Professor’s Research might be on the most basic cards, but it’s invaluable no matter the deck.

This has a great chance of giving you the right card(s) or at least milling out the deck to get them sooner.</p><p>I can’t imagine putting together any deck without including this in there. Whether you play it at the beginning of a match to give yourself an advantage or use it in the climactic final turns, the card is great. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6503029f5ba1db3b15a0f4a1f8a648c3" data-recommend-id="image://6503029f5ba1db3b15a0f4a1f8a648c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Charizard ex card shows the Pokémon posing with their wings outstretched." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Charizard ex card shows the Pokémon posing with their wings outstretched." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6503029f5ba1db3b15a0f4a1f8a648c3" data-recommend-id="image://6503029f5ba1db3b15a0f4a1f8a648c3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Charizard ex card shows the Pokémon posing with their wings outstretched." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Everyone’s favorite dragon-but-not-a-dragon-type creates a big presence when played on the field.

The former deals a modest 60 damage while the latter inflicts a painful 200 that can beat anything.</p><p>This Fire-type isn’t without its setbacks. Crimson Storm’s four energy requirement is a lot to build up to and it additionally discards two Fire energy to use it. The giant pool of HP and massive damage make this a card still worth playing.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bb19415700b667f15d085f4c41645680" data-recommend-id="image://bb19415700b667f15d085f4c41645680" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sabrina poses with her arm outstretched in her Supporter card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sabrina poses with her arm outstretched in her Supporter card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bb19415700b667f15d085f4c41645680" data-recommend-id="image://bb19415700b667f15d085f4c41645680" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sabrina poses with her arm outstretched in her Supporter card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Sabrina is undoubtedly the best Supporter card.

It looks cool and has an awesome movie that can make anyone cry and leave them with deep pondering thoughts. Mewtwo ex is just as beloved here thanks to it being a basic card that can inflict 150 damage with its Psydrive attack. For just two energy, it can also inflict 50 damage using a Psychic Sphere attack.</p><p>Similar to Charizard ex, Mewtwo ex’s strongest attack has the detrimental effect of discarding two Psychic energy to use. That can make Psydrive a less consistent attack to pull off. Still, the 150 damage is great for a Basic Pokémon. As you’ve probably seen, pairing him with a Gardevoir can do wonders thanks to its ability to attach one Psychic energy to the Active Spot card each turn.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6e3f5a3fa7f6043f7d0d8441e1c16298" data-recommend-id="image://6e3f5a3fa7f6043f7d0d8441e1c16298" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A large ten-pointed star Pokémon spins in the Starmie ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A large ten-pointed star Pokémon spins in the Starmie ex card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6e3f5a3fa7f6043f7d0d8441e1c16298" data-recommend-id="image://6e3f5a3fa7f6043f7d0d8441e1c16298" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="608" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A large ten-pointed star Pokémon spins in the Starmie ex card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Sitting at the top of this list isn’t a Legendary or something that requires a ton of energy. Starmie ex is a low-risk card that can deal big damage fast, making it a great inclusion for a Water-based deck. Its Hydro Splash attack only needs two energy to deal 90 damage. Another fantastic benefit it has is a zero retreat cost, meaning you can easily swap it out if you’re worried it might get knocked out soon.</p><p>The only barrier with Starmie ex is that you need to evolve a Staryu for it. That isn’t that big of an issue in the grand scheme of things. Hydro Splash is sure to knock out if not take a big chunk from most Pokémon you pit it against. At the same time, 130 HP will help it survive against most attacks thrown at it. Every Water-based deck will be elevated by including or basing itself around a Starmie ex card.</p><hr><p>There is no telling how the metas might change, but for now, these are the best cards by far.

This time around, work-for-hire spriggan Van Arkride is tasked with investigating murders  at the hands of a mysterious red monster in the City of Edith. Despite its familiarity, the setup nevertheless sets the stage for some notable change-ups in combat, returning character cameos, and a narrative time-loop mechanic.</p><p>Let’s take them in order, starting with combat. Players will still largely be working with the same structure and toolset they’re accustomed to, but <em>Daybreak II</em>’s real-time, action-oriented field combat has more options this time around, with party members able to wield Quick Arts outside of  conventional turn-based combat. Once things do switch into turn-based encounters, a new Recast timer prohibits players from spamming S-Crafts back-to-back, a strategy that dominated in the first game.</p><p>  <em>Daybreak II </em>also features a larger cast. There are more playable characters and lots of cameos. The former assassin duo from <em>Trails Into Reverie</em>, Swin and Nadia, will play big roles in the game. Others, like the martial artist Zin Vathek who appeared as far back in the series as <em>Trails in the Sky, </em>will also make appearances, fighting alongside your party for a time when the story deems it appropriate. The callbacks will be a boon for longtime <em>Trails</em> fans but will also potentially make <em>Daybreak II</em> harder to parse than the first game, which in many ways served as the most ideal jumping-on point for newcomers the series has had in years. </p><p>Perhaps most unique to <em>Daybreak II</em> is a time-loop system in which a magic artifact revives the team when they die and lets them pursue an alternate course of action to progress their journey instead. It sounds like this mechanic, which includes a menu screen showing branching story paths, will be purely a narrative device rather than one that impacts gameplay. You’ll still be pursuing every avenue in a somewhat linear fashion, and while time technically resets, your earned XP and treasure chest rewards remain intact between loops. </p><p>But much of the bread and butter of a <em>Trails </em>game is everything you’re doing in-between new dungeons and major story beats. <em>Daybreak II</em>’s European-inspired urban backdrop includes food carts you can buy stuff from and consume to get temporary party buffs, as well as to increase your gourmet rank to unlock new and better foodie benefits. Fishing, cards, cyberhacking, and other minigames <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/trails-through-daybreak-ii-brings-improved-combat-more-perspectives-and-fishing&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/trails-through-daybreak-ii-brings-improved-combat-more-perspectives-and-fishing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have also been confirmed</a></span>. And outside of main quests and character side stories, there’s  an optional endless dungeon to grind to your heart’s content. </p><p>Even if <em>Daybreak II </em>seems like mid-arc filler, NIS America rep Alan Costa said its events will be important for later games, including a direct sequel that’s already out in Japan called <em>The Legend of Heroes: Kai no Kiseki</em>. NIS also localizes Nihon Falcom’s other big RPG franchise, <em>Ys</em>, the tenth entry of which just arrived in the West back in September.

While Nihon Falcom President Kondo Toshihiro <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20241009051/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20241009051/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">appeared bullish</a></span> on the prospects of using improving AI translation capabilities to speed up development and close the gap in global release times for <em>Trails</em> and <em>Ys</em> games, NIS America, which localizes the games for English, isn’t using any AI translation in its pipeline at the moment. </p><p>“We don’t use AI for any forward-facing translations inside of our games,” Costa told <em>Kotaku</em> during the recent preview event. “Anything that Falcom decides to do on their end, obviously we have no insight or oversight or say into that. I don’t believe they used any AI  in the creation of their script for this game, but we didn’t in our use in localizing the title. So all of this is warts and all—hopefully we don’t have too many—this is all done by people.”</p><p>Though <em>Trails Through Daybreak III</em> doesn’t yet have a release date in the U.S., the second game isn’t the only <em>Trials</em> release next year. A remake of the first game in the series, <em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky the 1st</em>, is also due out in 2025 on Switch. In addition to updating the 2006 game, it will also finally provide a clear starting point for new players on modern platforms. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I rounded up characters I think have an actual shot—even a very small one— at showing up at some point in <em>Sonic 3</em>, and am ranking them based on how likely I think they are to be the featured reveal in the big post-credits stinger.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="42be7cd9db584c899e8371e3f2392313" data-recommend-id="image://42be7cd9db584c899e8371e3f2392313" data-format="jpg" data-width="757" data-height="657" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Big waving." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Big waving." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="42be7cd9db584c899e8371e3f2392313" data-recommend-id="image://42be7cd9db584c899e8371e3f2392313" data-format="jpg" data-width="757" data-height="657" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Big waving." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Look, it would be a good bit. Big the Cat, the lovable oaf who debuted in <em>Sonic Adventure</em>, is beloved by fans despite mostly being a joke character in recent years. While he’s not often a playable fixture in the series, Big has been surprisingly present in several big games, to the point where I feel like he will probably show up somewhere down the line if the <em>Sonic </em>live-action universe continues to draw in ticket sales. I can already envision a scene in which Big is running around, chasing his slippery sidekick Froggy through the wreckage of whatever destruction Shadow creates in <em>Sonic 3</em>. Will it actually happen? No chance. That’s why Big is kicking off this list as the least likely hero to show up in <em>Sonic 3</em>.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="988dc5e5b9de95ffcef3f7f5c75c21ab" data-recommend-id="image://988dc5e5b9de95ffcef3f7f5c75c21ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="528" data-height="516" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Renders of Espio, Charmy, and Vector." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Renders of Espio, Charmy, and Vector." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="988dc5e5b9de95ffcef3f7f5c75c21ab" data-recommend-id="image://988dc5e5b9de95ffcef3f7f5c75c21ab" data-format="jpg" data-width="528" data-height="516" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Renders of Espio, Charmy, and Vector." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Did you know the detective agency trio of Vector the Crocodile, Espio the Chameleon, and Charmy Bee already exists in the live-action <em>Sonic </em>universe?

Even so, since we know these three sleuths are in this continuity, it seems likely they’ll make an appearance somewhere down the line. However, with so many big names in the <em>Sonic </em>franchise still unaccounted for, I have a hard time seeing them setting up the next film.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="50d4d34966ad6b2408eb7e5f6a9ded86" data-recommend-id="image://50d4d34966ad6b2408eb7e5f6a9ded86" data-format="jpg" data-width="2615" data-height="1470" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Chaos" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Chaos" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="50d4d34966ad6b2408eb7e5f6a9ded86" data-recommend-id="image://50d4d34966ad6b2408eb7e5f6a9ded86" data-format="jpg" data-width="2615" data-height="1470" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Chaos" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I think there’s a strong possibility that Chaos, the water-like mutant antagonist of the original <em>Sonic Adventure</em>, is the villain in a future <em>Sonic </em>movie. Whether that’s <em>Sonic 4</em> or another movie down the line, Chaos is the kind of world-ending threat that these movies seem to be leading toward as they escalate and raise the stakes each time. However, I do think these movies need a marketable face to tease what’s next, and that’s why Tails and Shadow’s appearances at the end of the first two movies made sense. They were both well-known characters that you could see facilitating merchandise like figures and plushies. Chaos is exciting to long-time <em>Sonic </em>fans and I would love to see him flood a city and Sonic make some joke about how the team is “gonna need a bigger boat,” but as a post-credits stinger? There are probably more likely candidates.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d4f91fab398c13cb3735182f722011fe" data-recommend-id="image://d4f91fab398c13cb3735182f722011fe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1195" data-height="669" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Omega" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Omega" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d4f91fab398c13cb3735182f722011fe" data-recommend-id="image://d4f91fab398c13cb3735182f722011fe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1195" data-height="669" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Omega" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Okay, hear me out. E-123 Omega is a popular character as the third member of Shadow’s Team Dark, but he certainly wouldn’t make for a big, crowd-pleasing post-credits scene on his own.

If you’ve played <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, you know how that story ends for Shadow: he falls to Earth from space, is presumed dead, and then is found by Eggman for his own experiments. If Shadow meets a similar fate at the end of <em>Sonic 3</em>, a robot is going to probably have to find him, right? Who better than his future teammate?</p><p>Come on, Paramount.

Silver the Hedgehog, the time-traveling telekinetic hero from the future, seems like a shoo-in for a future <em>Sonic</em> live-action movie. If he does show up, I can’t imagine him not being accompanied by Blaze the Cat, his companion from the future in his debut in <em>Sonic ‘06 </em>(though we’ll ignore the way Sega retconned her origins and decided she’s from another dimension, because we don’t need to make <em>Sonic</em> a multiverse story this early into the cinematic universe). </p><figure id="" data-id="f2a45d21bcd2c3ce46df620d37a14a05" data-recommend-id="image://f2a45d21bcd2c3ce46df620d37a14a05" data-format="jpg" data-width="548" data-height="306" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Blaze" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Blaze" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f2a45d21bcd2c3ce46df620d37a14a05" data-recommend-id="image://f2a45d21bcd2c3ce46df620d37a14a05" data-format="jpg" data-width="548" data-height="306" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Blaze" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I expect this pair to show up in the near future because some of the groundwork has already been laid.

The show made some embellishments to Iblis’ nature, so the next movie probably won’t be a 1:1 recreation of <em>Sonic ‘06</em>, but with both Iblis and Shadow joining the live-action universe this year, Paramount has a lot of the pieces in place to make the next movie a retelling of one of the more controversial games in <em>Sonic</em>’s portfolio. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5cfe400e4114b361c9f5ca05dcdd2380" data-recommend-id="image://5cfe400e4114b361c9f5ca05dcdd2380" data-format="jpg" data-width="842" data-height="473" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Rouge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Rouge." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5cfe400e4114b361c9f5ca05dcdd2380" data-recommend-id="image://5cfe400e4114b361c9f5ca05dcdd2380" data-format="jpg" data-width="842" data-height="473" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Rouge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I can’t believe we haven’t seen Rouge the Bat in the live-action <em>Sonic </em>universe yet. Unless Paramount is deliberately hiding her in all the trailers and promotional materials, it doesn’t seem like she’ll be making an appearance in <em>Sonic 3 </em>proper despite it being a loose adaptation of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, which featured the debut of the treasure-hunting spy. I was hopeful she would show up in the <em>Knuckles </em>show since she’s considered the titular Echidna’s rival, but again, that show barely had time for one CG character, much less two. So here we are, with no sign of the leader of Team Dark even after a show and a movie that would have been easy entry points. </p><p>If Rouge isn’t secretly in <em>Sonic 3</em>, I could see her debut in the live-action universe being much like the beginning of Team Dark’s story in <em>Sonic Heroes</em>. She could happen upon Shadow in stasis while looking for treasure in Eggman’s base, then one thing leads to another and the team is formed. Typing that out, I realize it seems like a stronger basis for the opening of the reported Shadow spin-off, but I do think Rouge joining the cinematic universe is a matter of when, not if. In recent games and shows like <em>Sonic Dream Team </em>and <em>Sonic Prime</em>, Rouge has been treated as a friend of Sonic, rather than being more closely tied to Shadow as she has been in most other appearances, so there’s a chance the <em>Sonic </em>movies go that route. That would be incredibly disappointing to me as a Team Dark stan, though, especially after Sega brought the band back together this year in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review-levels-powers-1851676560"><em>Shadow Generations</em></a></span>.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="48ab438853dcf84060303a1c895b08db" data-recommend-id="image://48ab438853dcf84060303a1c895b08db" data-format="jpg" data-width="713" data-height="398" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Amy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Amy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="48ab438853dcf84060303a1c895b08db" data-recommend-id="image://48ab438853dcf84060303a1c895b08db" data-format="jpg" data-width="713" data-height="398" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Amy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Unlike Tails and Shadow, I don’t see Amy Rose as the kind of character who can kickstart the narrative of a sequel on her own. She’d probably need to be paired with some other character or force in a post-credit scene, but the <em>Sonic </em>movies desperately need her after being a boy’s club for three movies. Amy is often treated as secondary to the main trio of Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles, but she’s ultimately a core part of the heroes’ dynamic and it’s about time she showed up. Paramount has omitted her for so long that I’m not sure how she’ll fit into this storyline, but someone over there needs to figure it out, and sooner rather than later. </p><figure id="" data-id="51cefc75231483be9e6daa86d36d4088" data-recommend-id="image://51cefc75231483be9e6daa86d36d4088" data-format="jpg" data-width="964" data-height="544" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Cream" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A render of Cream" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51cefc75231483be9e6daa86d36d4088" data-recommend-id="image://51cefc75231483be9e6daa86d36d4088" data-format="jpg" data-width="964" data-height="544" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A render of Cream" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If they wanted to get real bold, I could see Cream the Rabbit showing up alongside Amy, making the whole cast of anthropomorphic characters more well-rounded. Either way, I don’t see a version of events in which she shows up without Amy also being there, given the two are considered a pair not unlike Sonic and Tails. It wouldn’t be my ideal choice, but I can also see Paramount trying to package Amy, Cream, and Rouge as a girl-centric group in a call-back to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/mizuhano/status/989669646730067968&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/mizuhano/status/989669646730067968" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scrapped <em>Sonic Heroes</em> team</a></span> that would have featured the three of them working together.

I hope Paramount swings for the fences and introduces something different in the next movie, but given that there’s already reason to believe Doctor Robotnik might be piecing Metal Sonic together, I fully expect the robot to make his debut in <em>Sonic 3</em>, whether that’s as an eleventh-hour villain or in a post-credits scene. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
