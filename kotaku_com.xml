              <p>The AirPods Pro 2 are still Apple’s flagship earbuds and they sit just one generation behind the recently released Pro 3. Here’s the thing though: the improvements between these two generations are incremental at best and definitely don’t justify paying 30 percent more for the newer model. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/">you can grab the AirPods Pro 2 for just $169, down from their usual $249 price tag</a>. That’s<strong> an all-time low on Amazon</strong> and makes these earbuds three times cheaper than Apple’s over-ear AirPods Max headphones.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The first reason listeners are drawn to AirPods Pro 2 is that they fix the problem with listening to audio in noisy settings in the first place. <strong>Noise cancellation in these AirPods is made possible with Apple’s own H2 chip</strong>&nbsp;where it picks up background noise using external microphones and generates anti-noise that effectively cancels it out before it hits your eardrums. The end result is incredibly quiet background noise so that listeners can enjoy their audio with the volume turned down to safe levels rather than competing with background noise.</p>



<h2>Advanced Audio Technology for a Fraction of the Price</h2>
<p>The custom-built driver in each earbud produces<strong> high-fidelity sound with rich bass response</strong>, clear treble, and balanced midrange frequencies that bring out the details in your music. Apple’s Adaptive EQ continuously adjusts the sound profile based on how the earbuds fit in your specific ear shape, which means you get consistent audio quality even if the buds shift slightly during movement. This real-time tuning happens automatically in the background, so you never have to fiddle with manual EQ settings or worry about suboptimal sound. The <strong>personalized spatial audio feature creates an immersive three-dimensional soundstage</strong> that makes audio feel like it’s coming from all around you rather than just two points inside your ears.</p>



<p>The <strong>transparency mode</strong> is one such feature that totally unites the manner in which you use your wireless earbuds in your daily life. You no longer need to physically take out your earbuds every time someone is talking to you or if it is an announcement that you need to pay attention to; rather, with the transparency mode, all you need to do is press the stem, in which case you can immediately understand what is happening around you without having to stop the musical playback in the background, thanks to the external microphones that allow background sounds to seep in while keeping the volume low so that it doesn’t completely pause the playback.</p>
<p>The<strong> hearing aid function is a true innovation</strong> that is more than just an ordinary consumer audio device feature. Following a basic hearing test done by using the app in partnership with the AirPods Pro 2, it is possible to amplify certain frequencies according to your own hearing needs, thus serving as an authentic hearing aid for mild to moderate hearing loss using a clinical-grade level device for the true benefit derived from its usage.</p>
<p>Listening time with the battery is almost six hours with active noise cancellation on, and then<strong> the charging case gives multiple charges for a total playback time of almost 30 hours combined</strong>. The use of USB-C is also a big improvement since it is compatible with charging any other Apple device such as the new iPhone 15 series, iPad, MacBook, and also AirPods with just one cord, thus eliminating cords on your desk or in your backpack. Also, the <strong>charging case is compatible with any Qi-certified charging pad</strong>, plus it is also compatible with the new MagSafe charging devices.</p>
<p>At $169, AirPods Pro 2 provides the essential high-end benefits one would want in a daily listening experience at an affordable price.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This 2TB Laptop Is 75% Off on Amazon, Dell Quietly Drops $2,700 From the Original Price]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-2tb-laptop-is-75-off-on-amazon-dell-quietly-drops-2700-from-the-original-price-2000638980</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-2tb-laptop-is-75-off-on-amazon-dell-quietly-drops-2-700-from-the-original-price.1334641/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dell laptops typically sit in the premium tier where you’re paying extra for build quality and brand reputation. But every once in a while, the pricing gods smile upon us and something wild happens. Right now, you can grab a fully loaded <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5000/">Dell Inspiron with Windows 11 Pro, a massive 2TB SSD, and 64GB of RAM for just $959, down from its usual $3,699 price tag</a>. That’s a $2,740 discount which makes this the<strong> steepest markdown on any Windows 11 Pro laptop currently available on Amazon</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5000/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The configuration here is impressive for anyone who needs serious computing power without compromise: That 64GB of RAM is overkill for casual browsing, sure, but if you’re running virtual machines, editing 4K video footage, juggling dozens of browser tabs while running Adobe Creative Suite, or compiling code, this amount of memory transforms your workflow. You can <strong>keep everything open simultaneously without that dreaded slowdown</strong> when your system starts swapping to disk. The 2TB solid-state drive gives you enough room to store your entire photo library and still have breathing room left over.</p>
<h2>Professional Power That Doesn’t Break the Budget</h2>
<p>The Ryzen 7 7730U processor found in this laptop is an <strong>AMD Zen 3 processor with a boost speed of 4.5 GHz</strong> if the need arises for more power. With eight cores and sixteen threads, it is a multitasking beast with enough power for content generation and even some gaming in between tasks if the need arises. The Ryzen 7 7730U is optimized for performance with power savings in mind, so if your need for it is something that doesn’t require it to be plugged in for extended periods, then it is possible to use it for an extended period without checking the percentage meter like it is a ticking time bomb.</p>



<p>The <strong>15.6-inch touchscreen display has Full HD capabilities with 1920×1080 pixels</strong>, and provides sharp text rendering and picture quality minus the power consumption associated with high-resolution screens. The <em>Wide Viewing Angle</em> feature ensures that the displayed color remains accurate even if the screen is being viewed from an angle, particularly useful during presentation setups where multiple viewers congregate around the screen, making it easier for others to view what is being showcased on the screen. Having an <strong>anti-glare screen</strong> is indeed a welcome feature if your work environment is near a window or under bright office lighting, where it becomes possible to view the screen without the botheration posed by overwhelming reflections.</p>



<p>Windows 11 Pro is an improvement over the last edition in terms of the benefits it offers for professional usage. You enjoy <em>BitLocker</em>-protected storage for secure storage of your files, the ability to connect to other computers using Remote Desktop, allowing access from any location, and joining a domain if you’re connecting from your company’s network. With the “Pro” version Off Windows 11, you have more flexibility with Windows Update so you can delay feature updates so that it doesn’t restart in the middle of a critical operation.</p>
<p>Dell also bundles a comprehensive accessory package with its laptop which actually provides value addition rather than mere inflation in the box. You can expect to get a <strong>stylus pen for operating the touchscreen display, a camera privacy cover for those concerned with security, a 128GB USB storage drive for transferring files quickly, dust plugs for protecting the ports, a laptop sleeve, and even a microfiber cloth</strong> for cleaning the system.</p>
<p>At $959, it’s an historic low for a laptop with such specs coupled with the Windows 11 Pro license.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Is Offloading This 60,000mAh Power Bank for Pennies, Anker’s Stock Is Flying off the Shelves]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-is-offloading-this-60000mah-power-bank-for-pennies-ankers-stock-is-flying-off-the-shelves-2000638972</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-is-offloading-this-60-000mah-power-bank-for-pennies-anker%E2%80%99s-stock-is-flying-off-the-shelves.1334593/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The little 10,000mAh power banks you see everywhere are fine for topping up your phone once, maybe twice if you’re lucky. But when you’re camping for the weekend, dealing with a power outage or spending a full day at an outdoor event, that tiny capacity just doesn’t cut it. You need serious juice, and that’s exactly what the Anker <em>PowerCore</em> delivers. Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/">has slashed this beast of a power bank from $149 down to just $79</a>, which is an all-time low for a device packing a <strong>massive 60,000mAh capacity</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The 60,000mAh capacity translates to <strong>192 watt-hours of stored energy</strong> which means you can charge an iPhone 17 more than 10 times over or keep a 3-watt LED lamp running for over 42 hours straight. That’s the difference between fumbling in the dark during a blackout and having reliable lighting for nearly two full days. The <strong>dual USB-C ports deliver 60 watts and 27 watts respectively</strong> so you can fast-charge a laptop and a smartphone at the same time without sacrificing speed.</p>
<h2>A Backup Generator That Fits in Your Backpack</h2>
<p>Anker built this power station with emergencies in mind and it’s apparent in its design. There’s a built-in light on top of the power station that’s retractable; it’s incredibly bright which makes it perfect for nighttime campsite setups or traveling during power outages. Still, the feature that stands out in terms of safety is its dedicated SOS button for an emergency strobe light function. The intelligent display screen on the front lets users know exactly what their power levels, wattage output, and time left are, so they’re never surprised by a power level status they can’t gauge on their own in the absence of wall power access.</p>



<p>The solar panel compatibility is what elevates it from a mere power bank to a off-grid system on its own: You can hook up a compatible solar panel via the input socket to charge it using only sunlight which is fantastic for long camping ventures or readiness systems for power outages. Charging the system is quite easy; simply hook up the USB-C to USB-C charging cord to a wall socket so it only takes 5-6 hours using your wall socket’s wattage, which is quite acceptable for such massive capacity.</p>



<p>As for the build quality, it’s definitely robust without being completely bulky either. Of course, it’s a bit heavier, thanks to the presence of battery cells but it is something that can be easily thrown into a backpack or even into an auto-emergency kit in your car, if need be. The build quality appears to be more resilient to rough handling, which is quite an aspect if one is supposed to be using it outdoors, say in an RV during an adventure vacation. Anker warrants it with a three-year warranty, which is an assurance on their own part regarding its durability.</p>
<p>At $79, <strong>this deal represents a 47 percent discount</strong> and brings the price per watt-hour down to an incredibly competitive level. Most portable power stations in this capacity range still hover around $120 to $200 so catching this at under $80 is fantastic.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911">The newly revealed </a><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved,</em> an Unreal Engine 5 remake of 2001’s <em>Halo</em>, isn’t just a graphical update of the original game. The devs are making some big changes to the classic <em>Halo</em> experience, and this includes changing levels. And yes, if you were wondering, The Library is one of the levels getting tweaked.</p> <p>Ask 100 random <em>Halo</em> fans what the worst level in the first game is, and 90 or more will likely say “The Library.” This late-in-story level is very long, filled with never-ending waves of Flood, aka space zombies, and has limited supplies, checkpoints, and waypoints. It also lacks visual variety and can be a dull experience on lower difficulties and a pain in the ass for those playing on higher difficulties who enter unprepared. To help players in 2025, Halo Studios is making some changes to <em>Halo’s</em> infamously annoying level.</p>

 <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-answering-the-big-questions/">In an October 24 blog post</a>, Halo Studios and Xbox explained that with Library, “it felt right to make tweaks to several areas” to create a “new experience that balances nostalgia with the expectations of today’s gamers.”</p>

 <p>“We learned from&nbsp;<em>Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary</em> that there was still an appetite for things like better wayfinding, navigation, and diversity in enemy encounters,” said <em>Halo </em>creative director Matt Szlagor. “In The Library specifically, which features several Flood encounters, we wanted to reevaluate the pacing and enhance the environmental storytelling. We’ve added new lines to Guilty Spark, which guide players through the level, and there’s new dialogue that gives more insight into the narrative as it plays out.”</p>

 <p>He further added: &nbsp;“We’re not changing the stories, it’s about refining and adding context to this moment, and other levels like it, so players can stay on track.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-impressions-1235451111/">Speaking to <em>Rolling Stone</em>,</a> executive producer Damon Conn claimed that every mission, encounter, and cinematic in <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> has been “rebuilt and retouched with the spirit intact of the original’s awe, sense of discovery, and heroism.” Hopefully, that means the Library won’t look like the same boring grey corridors over and over again for 20 minutes.</p> <p><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2026.</p>
