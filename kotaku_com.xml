            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-4000-apple-vr-headset-meta-quest-3s-drops-to-all-time-low-with-50k-units-sold-on-amazon-2000648422</link>

              <p>The Meta Quest 3 established new VR standards when it launched but its premium pricing kept virtual reality aspirational rather than accessible for mainstream buyers. Meta addressed this barrier by releasing the Quest 3<strong>S</strong> as a lighter and more affordable variant that maintains core functionality while cutting costs through strategic compromises that most users won’t notice during actual gameplay.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5604/">the Quest 3S costs $249 for the 128GB model during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $299</a>, which makes this the <strong>best entry point into modern VR</strong> without the $499 Quest 3 investment. The aggressive pricing combined with complete wireless freedom and instant access to 40-plus games creates exceptional value that explains why the 3S outsells its premium sibling.</p>

<h2>Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 That Works Well</h2>
<p>Qualcomm’s newest XR-specific silicon is optimized for the unique computational needs of virtual reality and it gives the processor twice the graphical processing power of the previous Quest 2 generation. Games load quickly so you don’t have to wait around like you did with older headsets and complex scenes render smoothly at high frame rates, which is important for avoiding motion sickness.</p>
<p>The next-generation graphics make the<strong> visuals almost as good as those on the PlayStation 5</strong> and they do it in standalone wireless headset form factors, which means you don’t need a gaming PC like you did with older VR systems, which were expensive and hard to use. The performance is good enough for demanding games like realistic simulators, fast-paced shooters and detailed adventure games that would stutter or crash on hardware that isn’t powerful enough.</p>



<p>The <strong>8GB of RAM is 33% more than what most budget VR headsets offer</strong>: This makes it easier to switch between VR environments, load textures with more detail without pop-in, and generally make the game more responsive. With more memory, developers can make more ambitious experiences with bigger worlds, more things on screen at once, and better graphics without having to make the trade-offs that come with limited RAM.</p>
<p>The <strong>freedom of wireless technology gets rid of the cords</strong> that made early VR systems so annoying: Players had to always be aware of where the cords were so they wouldn’t trip or pull on the headsets while playing. During room-scale VR experiences for instance, you can move naturally through physical spaces. In shooters, you can spin 360 degrees to track enemies from all directions. This makes setup much easier and lets you use VR anywhere, not just in dedicated gaming rooms.</p>
<p>The <strong>two RGB color cameras let you see everything in full color and mix virtual objects with your real-world surroundings</strong> through mixed reality experiences. You can see your real furniture, walls, and surroundings in color, and virtual objects look like they belong there. This lets you play games that interact with real spaces. With passthrough, you can clearly see the real world instead of the grainy black-and-white feeds that made earlier systems confusing.</p>



<p>The <strong>Gorilla Tag bundle gives Quest 3S buyers special in-game items and 1,000 shiny rocks currency</strong>: This makes the social VR game even more valuable, and it’s become a huge hit. Instead of using traditional joystick controls, Gorilla Tag uses arm-swinging locomotion to simulate how gorillas move. This gives the game a unique physicality that makes it very popular even though the graphics are simple.</p>
<p>The <strong>included three-month trial gives you instant access to more than 40 games</strong> which means you won’t have to pay for software right after you buy new hardware. You can try out different types of VR experiences, like action games, creative tools, fitness apps, and social platforms, without spending hundreds of dollars on software before you know what types of games you like.</p>
<p>The<strong> battery lasts for more than two hours</strong> which is enough for most gaming sessions without needing to stop and charge in the middle of a game, which breaks immersion. However, for longer marathon sessions, you’ll need to use a power bank or take breaks to charge. The runtime is long enough for most people who play for 30 to 90 minutes, which is about the same as the average attention span for active VR gameplay, which is more physically engaging than passive screen entertainment.</p>
<p>Meta’s current-generation VR technology costs less than many game consoles at the record-low price of $249 on Black Friday. If you’ve been curious about virtual reality but didn’t want to pay a lot for it, this deal makes modern VR possible at prices that make it worth it to try.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nothing Headphone (1) Clearly Can’t Make Profit at This Record Low, Now Over 2× Cheaper Than AirPods Max]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nothing-headphone-1-come-down-to-their-lowest-price-yet-for-black-friday-2000647680</link>
            <guid>1367455</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="62" data-end="797">There are countless reasons to invest in a quality pair of headphones—especially ones equipped with active noise cancellation. Being able to shut out the world and immerse yourself in what you <em data-start="255" data-end="265">actually</em> want to hear makes a huge difference, whether you’re stuck on a long, noisy flight or trying to concentrate in a busy workspace. If you’re in the market for a stylish and capable option, the Nothing headphones are worth a look. With their distinctive transparent design and sleek, technical aesthetic, they stand out visually. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6042/">Currently, they’re available at a 20% discount. Normally priced at $299, you can pick them up now for $239, saving $60 for Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</a></p>
<p data-start="799" data-end="1484">These headphones feature advanced, intelligent noise cancellation technology. Using next-generation processing and adaptive microphones, they continuously analyze your surroundings and automatically adjust the level of noise reduction. The over-ear design further enhances isolation by forming a secure acoustic seal around your ears. The result is a listening experience free from interruptions—perfect for music, audiobooks, or podcasts. When you need to re-engage with your environment, you can switch it over to Transparency Mode which lets outside sounds pass through naturally. This is especially helpful when walking through busy areas or responding to a coworker without removing your headphones.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6042/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="1486" data-end="1508">Hands-Free Control</h2>
<p data-start="1510" data-end="2171">The Nothing headphones conveniently offers an onboard control system that minimizes the need to reach for your phone. A dedicated side button allows quick access to apps like Spotify, letting you launch your audio without digging into your pocket. On the opposite earcup, a paddle lets you skip tracks or jump ahead in podcasts. Holding it down allows you to scrub through your audio with precision. Above this, a roller gives you intuitive control over volume, playback, and toggling between Active Noise Cancellation and Transparency Mode. Altogether, the controls are designed to keep your listening experience smooth and uninterrupted.</p>
<p data-start="2173" data-end="2652">Battery life is reliably long. With ANC turned off, you can enjoy up to an impressive 80 hours of listening time—enough for several days of use without recharging. Even with ANC enabled, the headphones still deliver around 35 hours of playback, which is more than sufficient for long workdays, commutes, or travel. And if the battery does run low, a quick 5-minute charge provides about 5 hours of additional listening time, ensuring you’re rarely stuck without sound.</p>


<p data-start="2654" data-end="3000">Comfort is equally important for long sessions, and Nothing has put real thought into the design. The ear cushions are made from memory foam wrapped in PU material, which resists oils and makeup to stay clean over time. The reinforced aluminum core adds durability while keeping the headphones lightweight, making them suitable for extended wear.</p>
<p data-start="3002" data-end="3186" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6042/">For a limited time, you can grab the Nothing headphones at a $60 discount on Amazon.</a> With them, you get style, comfort, and premium noise cancellation in one package. Makes for a great gift for any music lover this holiday season.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Portable Gaming Monitor (FHD, 15″, IPS) Hits Rock Bottom, Amazon Offloads Stock at New Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/portable-gaming-monitor-fhd-15-ips-hits-rock-bottom-amazon-offloads-stock-at-new-record-low-2000648418</link>
            <guid>1367395</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Portable monitors solve specific problems that laptops and tablets cannot address alone, particularly for gaming scenarios where you want larger screen real estate without lugging full-size displays. Nintendo Switch players confined to the 7/8-inch handheld screen gain dramatic improvement through 15.6-inch external displays that transform mobile gaming into living room experiences during travel or temporary setups.</p>
<p>The <em>KYY</em> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/">15-6-inch portable monitor costs $66 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $99</a>, and hits a record-low price that undercuts competing 1080p portable displays typically selling between $80 and $120 for identical specifications. The 34% discount makes <strong>secondary displays accessible</strong> at pricing approaching basic phone accessories.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4362/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD IPS Display That Works</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch IPS panel with a resolution of 1920 x 1080</strong> makes images clear and readable, and games show sharp detail instead of the blurry compromises that lower-resolution portable monitors make. When you look at the screen from the side or share it with others,<strong> the 178-degree viewing angles keep the colors and contrast true</strong>. What’s more, HDR support improves the dynamic range of compatible content by showing more detail in shadows in dark scenes and keeping highlight information that SDR displays clip.</p>



<p>The <strong>two USB-C ports with full functionality</strong> let you connect a single cable to a laptop or phone that supports DisplayPort Alt Mode and Power Delivery. You don’t need separate power adapters or HDMI converters that make cable clutter to connect modern MacBooks, Windows laptops and flagship smartphones: They all work with simple USB-C cables. The <strong>Mini-HDMI port</strong> works with devices that don’t have USB-C video output, like gaming consoles, older laptops, and desktop computers.</p>
<p>The monitor is truly portable because <strong>it is only 0.3 inches thick and weighs only 1.7 pounds</strong>. The dimensions fit into laptop bags with other gear without needing special carrying cases or taking up too much room in luggage while traveling. Business travelers get presentation screens for working in hotel rooms, digital nomads set up dual-monitor workstations in cafes or coworking spaces, and students use laptop screens to do research-heavy assignments that need multiple document windows.</p>
<p>The <strong>included smart cover is made of PU leather and protects against scratches</strong> while being transported.The magnetic attachment makes it easier to attach and remove the cover than cases that need straps or closures, and the frameless design keeps it as small as possible. The grooves in the stand make it easy to find a comfortable viewing angle, whether you’re typing on a laptop or watching something hands-free.</p>



<p>The built-in dual stereo speakers let you listen to music without headphones or external speakers, but the sound quality is only okay because of physical limitations. The <strong>3.5mm audio jack lets you connect headphones</strong> or external speakers when you need better sound, but it also keeps things flexible for different uses. When sound quality isn’t as important as convenience, the speakers are good enough for video calls, watching videos, or playing games.</p>
<p>The <strong>landscape and portrait orientation support lets you work in different ways</strong> such as coding with vertical text display, reviewing documents in their native orientation, or editing portrait photos. You can change the brightness, contrast, color temperature, and input selection on the screen without having to use software or complicated button combinations.</p>
<p>The Black Friday price of $66 is the lowest ever, which means that KYY’s portable monitor costs a lot less than other 1080p displays that cost between $80 and $120 and have similar specs and build quality.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Stops Caring About Profit on This Ryzen 5 Mini PC as It Clears Out the 4.5-Star Desktop Inventory]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-amazon-black-friday-deal-delivers-huge-pc-performance-from-a-tiny-desktop-unit-for-just-190-2000639063</link>
            <guid>1367353</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The novelty of having a palm-sized desktop PC can wear off once you realize that, in terms of performance, it sort of just gets by. “Meh” is not the reaction you want to have for a brand-new desktop PC, even if it’s saving you money upfront. GMKtec’s G10 Mini PC is not a “meh” machine at all — it can outperform many of its bigger full-tower rivals and even some of the big-brand laptops. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5036/">It’s well worth the new Amazon Black Friday price of $219, which is 27% less than its full retail $300 tag for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>GMKtec has managed to stuff all sorts of goodies and useful features into this 2-pound package, starting with an AMD Ryzen 5 3500U processor that can hit 3.7GHz when you put the pedal to the metal for multitasking, 16GB of RAM, a 512GB NVMe solid-state storage drive, and integrated Radeon Vega 8 graphics that’s powerful enough (1200 MHz) to run up to three external monitors. There’s also room under the hook to expand that RAM to 64GB and enough expansion slots and ports to drive the storage as high as 16TB.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5036/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Underdog Wins</h2>
<p>That AMD Ryzen 5 processor and Radeon Vega 8 integrated graphics might not grab your eye if you’re just skimming Amazon listings for Intel products. Which would be understandable since Intel is the gold standard for PC processors. But the Ryzen 5 3500U that’s at the heart of the GMKtec G10 has more than held its own in benchmark tests against Intel’s N-Series chips and often beats them, and for less money overall.</p>
<p>You can feel free to push the processor and the rest of the GMKtec G10 as hard as you want or need to, because all that hard work isn’t going to cause any internal meltdowns thanks to the tiny turbo cooling fan built into the mini PC’s body. That little fan can crank all day long, and do it quietly — 35 decibels, which is slightly louder than the sound of breathing.</p>



<h2>All the Connections</h2>
<p>The most important connections, of course, are the ones that get you on the internet, and the GMKtec G10 has Wi-Fi 5 and Bluetooth 5.0 along with a super-fast 2.5GB Ethernet jack. From there the connections are all about expansion and the ability to turn the GMKtec G10 into the hub of your workstation, and in that regard it’s fully loaded — dual USB-A 3.2 ports in the front, and a full array in the back, including HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4, along with two USB-C ports (one for data) and another USB-A 2.0.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5036/">Jumping at this limited-time Amazon deal taking 27% off the price of the GMKtec MIni PC</a> isn’t settling. It’s grabbing a more-than-proficient desktop PC that can run up to 3 external monitors and handle all of your workload and then some for a great price — it’s just $190 while this deal lasts.</p>
