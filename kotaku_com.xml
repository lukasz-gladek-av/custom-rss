It’s the notion that there’s only one core route through a game, a pre-determined path down which all players must tread, where we do not have the freedom to pick our own directions. As such, looking back from our current era in which open-world games dominate the AAA landscape, this can give the appearance of a design that removes or restricts player agency to a deletory result.</p><p>And to be incredibly clear, some corridors did just that. While first-person games were born in level-based mazes (<em>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</em>, <em>Doom</em>, etc), there did come a wake of games that were almost literal corridors, so ridiculously restrictive that it felt like being dragged down their inevitable tunnel by your nostrils, shoulders scraping the claustrophobic walls all the way. To name names, the very worst of these were the <em>Call of Duty</em> campaigns from <em>Black Ops</em> onward—games that killed you if you dared to walk left or right, rather than straight on, and pushed you to the back to watch the NPCs play the game for you.</p><p>But I would argue that almost no one who played <em>BioShock</em> in 2007 reacted by saying, “Damn, that was just a corridor.” Because it was a game that, despite having only one core pathway, allowed players to feel an enormous sense of freedom. You chose <em>huge</em> amounts in <em>BioShock</em>, from how you actually played (run-and-gun shooter, device-based trapping and stealth, immersive sim), to how you responded to the nature of the world around you, not least in how you treated the Little Sisters. People celebrated the game for the amazing amount of freedom it offered within such a tightly scripted narrative, and all of that is to ignore that the game being a prescribed corridor was <em>the <strong>entire point</strong></em>.</p><p>Sorry to spoil an 18-year-old game, but the fact that you had no choice but to follow the instructions you were given was the massive third-act reveal. That the game was set in an inescapable corridor is so much of why <em>BioShock</em> was brilliant, because if it had let players visit any point in the underwater city of Rapture whenever they wanted, everything else about it would have fallen apart.</p><p><em>BioShock</em>’s drama so often depends on you being exactly where the game designer wants you to be, at exactly the moment they want you there, and that kind of precise narrative choreography is the result of a corridor. By rejecting such game design as a failure, we’re losing this kind of experience, and I really believe it’s something we should instead be fighting to save.</p><figure id="" data-id="dd3540bbcbb2c283baf7eff9528aa2de" data-recommend-id="image://dd3540bbcbb2c283baf7eff9528aa2de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alyx holds her hand up against the container sealing in her father." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Alyx holds her hand up against the container sealing in her father." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dd3540bbcbb2c283baf7eff9528aa2de" data-recommend-id="image://dd3540bbcbb2c283baf7eff9528aa2de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alyx holds her hand up against the container sealing in her father." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of course corridors are, and should be, only a part of games. I’m not silly, I love a fantastic open-world game, and of course have been playing RPGs since the 1980s that offer vast amounts of player freedom when approaching their worlds. I’m not for a moment arguing for anything more than a desire to preserve the corridor as an option among so much else, and therefore not to disparage it as if a failure of the past. Because damn, it brought so much success.</p><p>I don’t think I’m necessarily being that huge of a maverick here. In fact, if you look at any number of “all time best games” lists, and adjust for recency bias, there are certain names that come up again and again: <em>Half-Life 2</em>, <em>Deus Ex</em>, <em>Quake 2</em>, <em>Halo</em>, <em>Dishonored</em>. They share space on those lists with games that do quite the opposite, the litany of wonderful RPGs that often eschew corridors entirely, but those games with straight paths undeniably dominate. Indeed, they are the shining examples of how to hide the corridor in the best possible ways.</p><p>But rather than getting into the nitty-gritty of how and why disguising the corridor was key to their success, let’s focus more on what’s being lost without them.</p><p>Open worlds are <em>great</em>, and I’m very happy to be clearing up icons in an Ubisoft map or picking my own unique route through the acts of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. But what they cannot do as well is puppeteer the player, creating deliberate, narrative moments on a deliberate, narrative path. They cannot offer something more akin to the scenes of a movie, where the impact of event B is so much more meaningful because it came directly as a response to the action of event A, and the consequence of this drives the emotional resonance of event C.</p><figure id="" data-id="cc6e3bd8c98d86e2a45be5f57af45d09" data-recommend-id="image://cc6e3bd8c98d86e2a45be5f57af45d09" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Commander Shepard faces the blue swirly boy at the end of Mass Effect 3." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Commander Shepard faces the blue swirly boy at the end of Mass Effect 3." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc6e3bd8c98d86e2a45be5f57af45d09" data-recommend-id="image://cc6e3bd8c98d86e2a45be5f57af45d09" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Commander Shepard faces the blue swirly boy at the end of Mass Effect 3." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I remember, in the early 00s, at the beginning of the rejection of corridor gaming as a design choice, responding with the same argument that springs to mind now: “Do you reject having to read the pages of a book in order? Is the book a failure if page 37 comes after page 36 every time?” To which the immediate counter is, “Games aren’t books, that’s why we call them something else,” and sure, but my point is: games <em>can</em> aim to be like books in some of the best ways. Because, when your game is set in a corridor, when the scenes are as inevitable as the pages of the book, it’s how we interact with them that defines them. It places the emphasis on our own personal interpretation of what we’re offered, and rather than being a sandbox in which we can play god, we’re instead inside a story which we have the means to uniquely experience.</p><p>(In fact, this is the basis for why I’ve argued that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-right-with-mass-effect-3s-ending&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-right-with-mass-effect-3s-ending" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the end of <em>Mass Effect 3</em> is not a failure to recognize player agency</a></span>, but instead a scripted moment understood uniquely based on your personal experiences accrued across all three games.)</p><p>Agency can be wonderful, but it is often at a cost—the cost of a curated, directed, deliberate narrative experience. And yes, it wouldn’t be a good thing if all games were that, but it’s no better to look down upon it as an anachronistic shortcoming of game design. <em>BioShock</em> only worked <em>because</em> it was a corridor, and indeed was a thesis <em>on the corridor</em>, making it all the more odd of a game to throw under the bus of history. There’s value in experiencing a curated, pre-determined tale, boosted by our unique approaches born of how we turn those pages. I don’t want it to be lost, in the name of boasting “greater player agency.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It includes the first two games and the prequel which lays much of the groundwork for what we’ve seen teased in the new trailers so far. I give you permission to skip<em> Borderlands 3</em> and just catch up with a YouTube video.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/apple-tv-free-weekend-severance-silo-for-all-mankind-1851731841<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apple TV+ is a strange ol’ streaming service, spending wads of Apple’s infinite money on incredibly expensive prestige television and movies, and then hiding it all as best it could. In recent months, it’s occurred to the company that perhaps it’d be good if people saw the stuff it’s making, adding the service as an option on Amazon Prime, and now it’s offering a completely free weekend to lure you in. It’s just, there’s also an awful lot of confusion about when it actually starts.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It’s purportedly not set up such that you have to cancel once the free weekend is over on January 5, which is good. I say purportedly, because right now we’re unable to get it to offer anything other than the standard seven-day free trial, which <em>does</em> require you to cancel. It’s also worth noting that on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2024/12/get-a-free-all-access-pass-to-apple-tv-the-first-weekend-of-2025/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.apple.com/tv-pr/news/2024/12/get-a-free-all-access-pass-to-apple-tv-the-first-weekend-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple’s own press release for the offer</a></span>, it describes it as running January 3 to 5, but the embedded video says it’s January 4 to 5. We contacted Apple to get some clarification, and it didn’t clear things up a great deal. It’s expected to start at some point in the evening in ET zones, but perhaps earlier in PT, and then beyond that, “the timing just depends on the territory.”</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/severance-ben-stiller-adam-scott-apple-tv-news-1851713808&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/severance-ben-stiller-adam-scott-apple-tv-news-1851713808"><em>Severance</em>’s Most Complicated Relationship Gets Messier In Season 2</a></span></p><p>If you <em>can</em> get it working, there’s a wealth of excellent stuff to watch on the streamer, genuinely some of the best TV in the last few years. My personal favorite is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/silo-apple-tv-renewed-season-2-fallout-amazon-1851721881&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/silo-apple-tv-renewed-season-2-fallout-amazon-1851721881"><em>Silo</em></a></span>, an adaptation of the Wool novels set in a post-apocalyptic underground bunker. Then there’s <em>For All Mankind</em>, a wonderful alternative-timeline historical drama set in a version of the world where Russia beat America to landing on the moon, and the consequential space race. Both are gripping dramas.</p><p>Then there’s <em>Severance</em>, Ben Stiller and Adam Scott’s incredible twist on a workplace comedy in which everything is distinctly not OK, Bill “<em>Scrubs</em>” Lawrence’s comedy <em>Ted Lasso</em> following an American coach of a British football team, and indeed Bill Lawrence’s comedy-drama-cum-murder mystery <em>Bad Monkey</em>, with Vince Vaughn finally finding a platform in which he can shine.</p><p>There’s a ton of other sci-fi on there too, among it <em>Invasion</em>, <em>Dark Matter</em>, <em>Foundation</em>, <em>Constellation</em>, and the <em>Godzilla</em> spin-off show <em>Monarch: Legacy of Monsters.</em> Other hugely rated shows include <em>Slow Horses </em>starring Gary Oldman, <em>Bad Sisters </em>with the amazing Sharon Horgan, and <em>Disclaimer </em>starring Cate Blanchett.</p><p>A <em>lot</em> of the above shows have been cancelled, so cruel is the world of spending hundreds of millions on TV shows that don’t ever get a chance to find an audience, but none so brutally as Taika Waititi’s reimagining of Terry Gilliam’s <em>Time Bandits</em>. But, you know, if you’re only planning to blitz the archive for a single weekend, you may as well watch what looks enjoyable.</p><p>Um, Apple has also made some movies.</p><p>Is there a catch? Well, sure. You’ll need to sign up for an Apple ID to do this, which is to say, this is a massive database play by the megacorp, looking to gather vast numbers of email addresses to bombard with further nags. But of course it’s that, and we’re all capable of unsubscribing, or using a temporary email address.</p><p>Whether it actually starts Friday or Saturday (we shall update accordingly), it seems like a pretty decent deal. If you want <em>one</em> show to focus on, pick <em>Silo. </em>And <em>Severance</em>. And <em>For All Mankind.</em></p><p><strong>Updated: 01/03/2025, 10:32 a.m. ET:</strong> Added some vague details about when the offer begins in the U.S. based on Apple’s response to our questions.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
