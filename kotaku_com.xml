              <p>The upcoming retro-inspired brawler <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/marvel-cosmic-invasion"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></a> is one of the coolest-looking Marvel games in years. And now we know the identities of two more Marvel characters who will be joining the pixelated action when <em>Cosmic Invasion</em> launches later this year. One of them is a very popular character you are likely familiar with, and the other is Cosmic Ghost Rider.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-brawler-dotemu-tmnt-co-op-switch-1851772740">Announced in March</a> during a Nintendo Direct, <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> is a side-scrolling 2D pixel-art beat ’em up being developed by Tribute Games. That’s the team behind <em>Mercenary Kings</em> and the totally rad <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em>, which was also a 2D co-op brawler. <em>Cosmic Invasion,</em> like Tribute’s past work, looks to be another snappy and action-packed retro throwback that I’ll be playing over and over with friends. We’ll all have a huge roster of characters to pick from, as Tribute and Marvel have confirmed that <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/17/black-panther-cosmic-ghost-rider-join-marvel-cosmic-invasion/#:~:text=In%20Marvel%20Cosmic%20Invasion%2C%20one%20of%20our%20biggest%20features%20is%20our%20playable%20character%20roster%20boasting%2015%20Super%20Heroes!">15 heroes</a> will be available at launch. And now we know two more names that have made the cut: Black Panther and Cosmic Ghost Rider.</p> <p>On September 17, Tribute put out a trailer showing off the newly announced<em> Cosmic Invasion</em> characters, which you can watch below:</p>

  <p>I likely don’t need to explain who Black Panther is to most people reading a video game website in 2025. The character has appeared in multiple games, movies, and award-winning comics and has become extremely popular, thanks in large part to the fantastic performance delivered by the late Chadwick Boseman in the MCU. However, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_Ghost_Rider">Cosmic Ghost Rider</a> is a bit more obscure and quite an odd duck. The short version is that he’s an alt-universe version of The Punisher that died and became the Ghost Rider and then met up with Galactus, who made him his Herald aka his new Silver Surfer basically. Yeah, it’s weird. But hey, he’s literally got Cosmic in his name, so he seems like a fine choice for <em>Cosmic Invasion.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>Every character confirmed for <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></h2> <p>Here are all the <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> characters that have been officially revealed so far. As mentioned, the full roster will include 15 people, so after today’s reveal, that leaves just three more heroes left to unveil.</p>

 <ul> <li>Captain America</li> <li>Spider-Man</li> <li>Venom</li> <li>Wolverine</li> <li>Storm</li> <li>Phyla-Vell</li> <li>Nova</li> <li>Rocket Raccoon</li> <li>She-Hulk</li> <li>Beta Ray Bill</li> <li>Silver Surfer</li> <li>Black Panther</li> <li>Cosmic Ghost Rider</li> </ul> <p>It makes sense that the game will feature a huge roster, as the big gimmick in<em> Cosmic Invasion</em> is that <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-hands-on-preview-mvc-impressions-2000614681">everyone picks two characters</a> that you can then swap between while playing. This means that if four players join the game, you’ll be rolling into fights with eight Marvel characters. Good luck to all the random, nameless goons trying to fight Venom, Storm, Wolverine, Spider-Man, and Black Panther.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-preview-beat-em-up-tribute-games-1851784757"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> looks great and sounds like a blast based on previews</a> of the upcoming brawler. We still don’t have a specific release date for the game yet beyond 2025. Hopefully it lands soon, though maybe not in October. That month is already a mess.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Seagate’s 2TB Xbox Expansion Card Is Cheaper per TB Than the 1TB One, All-Time Low Ahead of Prime Day in October]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Video game files sizes have gotten ridiculous. As time goes on, they continue to balloon to astronomical levels that are frankly unreasonable. This is especially common among western AAA developers. Just this year, we saw&nbsp;<em>Oblivion: Remastered</em> reach a size of over 120GB. I don’t even want to think about just how much space&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI </em>is going to take up. While these game files extending into the triple digits of gigabytes, our Xbox consoles still sit at their base internal storage of 1TB. If you intend to play more than just the same four games back and fourth, you’re going to have to do some regular maintenance of deleting and reinstalling games — but not one want to that. The better solution is to get yourself a dedicated expansion drive. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4009/">Seagate has one made specifically for the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. For a limited time, you can grab it for a hefty discount.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4009/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>Right now, Amazon has three models of the Seagate expansion card for Xbox on sale. The 1TB model is down from $160 to just $130, saving you $30. The 2TB version comes down from $360 to just $218, a savings of $142. Then we have the massive 4TB model, normally priced at $500 but down to $430. That’s a savings of $70 with the deal. The best deal among the three at this time is for the 2TB version. That $142 savings accounts for a whopping 39% discount.</p>

<p>Since the Xbox Series X only starts with a single terabyte of storage, adding on one of these Seagate drives means you’ll be either doubling, tripling, or quintupling your storage capacity.</p>
<p>The Seagate expansion card is super easy to install. While the PS5 expansion SSDs require opening up the casing of your console, these ones for Xbox simply just plug into a dedicated slot in the back. No tools necessary. Once installed, you can choose to have the games you download save to either your internal storage or the new Seagate drive.</p>



<h2>Play Games Seamlessly</h2>
<p>Games saved to the Seagate drive receive the same benefits as those on your internal drive. One of the features of this generation Xbox that Microsoft likes to show off is Quick Resume. That allows you to suspend your game state of one game while you play another. You can hop from a race in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> into a quick&nbsp;<em>Rocket League</em> match with your buds, then pop back over to Forza to cross the finish line.</p>
<p>Well, Seagate officially-licensed the Xbox Velocity Architecture which is what makes Quick Resume possible.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4009/"> That means its supported on any game you have downloaded, whether its to your internals or to your new Seagate drive.</a></p>
