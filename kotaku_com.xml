We saw how a rebellion erupted in a separate Silo—Silo 17—resulting in people defiantly venturing to the outside world only to be killed by the noxious air. Since then, we’ve seen Juliette Nichols (Rebecca Ferguson) walk through what could be the future for Silo 18, the Silo she left: dead bodies strewn outside, “Lies” scrawled across the monitor the Silo people use to see the outside world, and darkness. </p><p>Ever since the people of Silo 18 watched Juliette become the first person to successfully walk outside and survive at the end of the first season, the Silo’s mayor, Bernard Holland (Tim Robbins), has been using every manipulative tactic at his disposal to prevent an uprising among people who have been told their entire lives that life outside the Silo isn’t safe. He’s arrested individuals for painting Juliette’s initials on the walls as a sign of reverence, lied about her using new tape his team developed to block the poisonous air from entering her suit, hired actors to publicly challenge him so he can dismiss their opinions as ramblings compared to his deceitful proclamations of hope, and coerced Judge Mary Meadows (Tanya Moodie) into supporting his lies to pacify the people with false promises of this new tape ushering in a new day. </p><p>What he did in episode four might be both his most dastardly deception and his most effective one. </p><h3 id="h99732"><a id=""></a>What happened to Judge Mary Meadows?</h3><figure id="" data-id="d1fa2a75cc32f69ba886fe790532d79b" data-recommend-id="image://d1fa2a75cc32f69ba886fe790532d79b" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="1606" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tanya Moodie waiting for her suit" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tanya Moodie waiting for her suit" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Apple</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d1fa2a75cc32f69ba886fe790532d79b" data-recommend-id="image://d1fa2a75cc32f69ba886fe790532d79b" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="1606" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tanya Moodie waiting for her suit" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After Bernard’s brooding enforcer Robert Sims (Common) questions Judge Meadows’ fidelity to the lie, he attempts to remove her from her place of influence with Bernard by having people call for her impeachment. While he simply wanted her sidelined, Bernard saw a more vile opportunity to both silence her and distract people from looking for the truth about the Silo.</p><p>Meadows only went along with Bernard’s plan in exchange for a suit designed to keep her safe when she exits the Silo, a promise he dangled in front of her until the end. Under the guise of a friendly dinner before handing her over her suit, Bernard poisoned the food she ate in an effort to “unite the Silo.” How her death would help accomplish that wasn’t clear until he offered Knox (Shane McRae) and Shirley (Remmie Milner), the two people leading the silent rebellion against Bernard, the chance to come see Judge Meadows. When they arrive in her office to see her dead with a knife in her chest, they quickly realize they’ve been set up to be pinned as the murderers of the Silo’s judge. </p><p>Soon after, Sims incited a manhunt for the accused killers, telling an angry mob that the two had killed Meadows for refusing to open the Silo’s air lock, and proclaiming it the duty of every Silo member to find them. That’s one way to bring people together.</p><p>With Juliette trying to assemble a suit so she can get back to Silo 18 and stop a rebellion that would lead to the deaths of its residents, the embers of fiery hatred have already been stoked, and there might not be much time left to prevent the inevitable.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But there were some bad ones, too.</p><p>Light and dark. Left and right. Pepsi and Coke. One needs the other to exist. The best games are only great if we can compare them to mediocre or awful games. And 2024 had plenty of so-so or downright horrible games, too. </p><p>So let’s take a look at some of the worst-reviewed games of 2024.</p><p> But before we do that it’s worth repeating: Liking a “bad” game isn’t a <em>bad</em> thing. Numbered scores come with all sorts of asterisks and caveats, which is part of the reason we don’t use them here. And Metacritic’s aggregate isn’t perfect by any stretch. If you see a game on this list that you happen to love, it just means you have a different taste than a bunch of other critics or players. That’s fine! Enjoy what you like and don’t be an asshole about it and everything will be fine. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-worst-games-of-2020-according-to-metacritic-1845913017?_gl=1*1906hd1*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzUwMTEyNS44NS4xLjE3MzM1MDg3NDQuNTcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-worst-games-of-2020-according-to-metacritic-1845913017?_gl=1*1906hd1*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzUwMTEyNS44NS4xLjE3MzM1MDg3NDQuNTcuMC4w">Now, as we’ve</a></span>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-worst-games-of-2021-according-to-metacritic-1848234861?_gl=1*1ij1sdw*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzQxNDU4NS44My4xLjE3MzM0Mjg3OTguNDIuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-worst-games-of-2021-according-to-metacritic-1848234861?_gl=1*1ij1sdw*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzQxNDU4NS44My4xLjE3MzM0Mjg3OTguNDIuMC4w">done</a></span>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-worst-games-of-2019-according-to-metacritic-1840668824?_gl=1*66bxk9*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzUwMTEyNS44NS4xLjE3MzM1MTI4MDEuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-worst-games-of-2019-according-to-metacritic-1840668824?_gl=1*66bxk9*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzUwMTEyNS44NS4xLjE3MzM1MTI4MDEuNjAuMC4w">before</a></span>, here are the 10 worst-rated games on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/game&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Metacritic</a></span> with at least seven reviews.</p></div></div><div><p>This appears to be another attempt at a small studio making a <em>CoD </em>zombies-like wave-based shooter.

A wacky adventure mixing together different franchises and worlds. Instead, its a boring, annoying, barely functional third-person action game starring ugly <em>Funko Pops </em>solving bad puzzles and fighting the same 10 enemies over and over again with guns and laser pistols. Don’t play <em>Funko Fusion.</em> Save your money, buy some pizza, and watch one of the movies included in this collection instead. It will be much more enjoyable and you won’t have to restart the movie five times to reach the end.</p></blockquote></div><div><p>It’s wild that in 2024 one of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482">best games we played was the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake</a></span>. Meanwhile, in the same 12 months, Konami also released <em>Silent Hill: The Short Message</em>, a first-person horror game that wasn’t very good and which most people likely forgot about within weeks of playing it. At least it was free and short. </p></div><div><p>The original <em>Test Drive Unlimited</em> was awesome and was in many ways the predecessor to <em>Forza Horizon</em>’s big open worlds.<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/test-drive-patch-notes-free-car-unlimited-solar-crown-1851689819&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/test-drive-patch-notes-free-car-unlimited-solar-crown-1851689819"><em>Solar Crown</em></a></span>, on the other hand, is a buggy disaster that players don’t enjoy and which wasn’t even playable for a few days at launch due to server problems.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675#:~:text=I%20also%20want,2024.%20It%20sucks.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675#:~:text=I%20also%20want,2024.%20It%20sucks."> It also had three different release dates based on how much you paid</a></span>. Bleh. </p></div><div><p><em>TMNT Mutant Mayhem</em> is a fantastic movie with one of my favorite fight scenes from recent memory. <em>Wrath of the Mutants</em>, on the other hand, is just a quick and barebones port of the 2017 arcade game that has a title that sort-of-sounds like the popular movie. So yeah, this is just a bland cash grab. There are much better <em>TMNT </em>games to play instead of this. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/walking-dead-destinies-new-game-bad-kong-game-mill-1851032588?_gl=1*1v0d7zk*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzUwMTEyNS44NS4xLjE3MzM1MTI2NzMuNS4wLjA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/walking-dead-destinies-new-game-bad-kong-game-mill-1851032588?_gl=1*1v0d7zk*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzUwMTEyNS44NS4xLjE3MzM1MTI2NzMuNS4wLjA.">Another high-quality title from publisher Game Mill</a></span>. </p></div><div><p>This horror game was made by one person, so credit to them: They shipped a mostly working game. That’s not easy. But <em>Pneumata </em>isn’t very good, with poor level design, bad enemy AI, and not many scares. </p></div><div><p>This is a very pretty-looking game that lets you drive around Barcelona as a taxi driver. Sadly, it’s not much fun to drive, offers little depth, and there are much better transportation sims out there. Also, as a <em>Crazy Taxi</em> fan, this game lacks Offspring music and big jumps. Boo. </p></div><div><p>The good: <em>Looney Tunes</em> characters are still funny and charming in <em>Wacky World of Sports</em>. The bad: Everything else. This co-op sports game plays poorly, has only four sports to choose from, and looks like it fell out of 2015. Avoid and watch some clips of Bugs and Daffy on YouTube instead. Oh hey, look, this game was also published by Game Mill. Hmmm.</p></div><div><p>If you Google<em> Jujutsu Kaisen: Cursed Clash, </em>you’ll find a lot of people calling it the worst anime game released in years and bragging about how they refunded it quickly. Others are warning people to not buy it. I’ll quote one negative Steam review: “<em>Roblox JJK</em> games are more worthy of your time.” </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Despite attempts by Instagram and YouTube to copy its mechanics and algorithmic recommendation machine, neither has so far been able to replicate the formula at a similar level of success. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
