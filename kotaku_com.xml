<p>The<i> Puyo Puyo Tetris</i> series combines two classic puzzle franchises into a single fun and vibrant experience, and it tends to be a pretty damn good time. With the Nintendo Switch 2 now out in the wild, fans of the series can get their hands on <i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</i>, an enhanced version of 2020’s <i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2</i>. You can tell it’s enhanced because of the “S”, which is the universal way to know something is extra cool, I think.</p> <p>Anyway, this new version of the game brings a variety of upgrades and new features, such as the new 2v2 Doubles Mode, a bunch of additional characters, and even mouse controls. But if you’re a diehard fan, you’ll probably be checking out the Adventure Mode, which sends you off on a journey across an overworld map to compete against foes for some puzzle mayhem. How long will you spend seeing things through? How does its mouse mode work? And what should you consider before grabbing a physical version? Let’s take a look.</p> <h2><span id="how-long-does-it-take-to-beat-puyo-puyo-tetris-2s%e2%80%98s-adventure-mode"></span>How long does it take to beat <i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</i>‘s Adventure Mode?<span></span></h2> <p>So, let’s get something out of the way: <i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</i> is a puzzle game with endless replayability, so how many hours of fun you get out of it will be based on how much you enjoy <i>Puyo Puyo</i> and <i>Tetris</i>. However, the Adventure Mode tells a story with missions to tackle, speaking more to folks who like a campaign to tackle. And that campaign is finite, naturally.</p>

 <p><b>Simply reaching the end of </b><b><i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</i></b><b>‘s Adventure Mode can take 10-15 hours</b>, depending on your skill level. But you can stretch things out much further by trying to tackle every optional mission and side story the game has to offer. Additionally, completionists will want to aim to get a full four-star rating on every mission to show they know their shit. Not me, though, because I’m equally dreadful at <i>Puyo Puyo</i> and <i>Tetris</i>.</p> <p>Speaking of being bad at puzzle games, you can mess with the difficulty to help set you up for success if you’re not making any headway in the campaign. I don’t feel much shame admitting that I’m just not very fast or good at stacking all this colorful stuff, and neither should you.</p> <h2><span id="how-well-does-mouse-mode-work-on-puyo-puyo-tertris-2s"></span>How well does mouse mode work on <i>Puyo Puyo Tertris 2S</i>?<span></span></h2> <p>Not only does the <i>2S</i> version of this game toss in the 2v2 Doubles Mode, it also allows you to use the Switch’s “mouse mode” to move your blocks around. In this mode you’ll use your shoulder button to rotate the block, while pulling down with the mouse will accelerate how fast the block falls. While this adds a level of physicality you might otherwise not expect in <i>Tetris</i>, it can be a challenge to pull the mouse down in a perfectly straight line, so don’t be surprised if the blocks land a little to the left or right when using this mode.</p>

 <h2><span id="puyo-puyo-tetris-2s%e2%80%99-physical-version-comes-on-a-gamekey-card"></span><i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</i>’ physical version comes on a Game-Key Card<span></span></h2> <p>If you were hoping to grab a physical copy of this game, you should know that you’ll still need to download the full game with an internet connection. The card that ships in the case is only a key for a license to download the game and doesn’t have the full data available for you to play.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-survey-game-key-carts-2000614465">Switch 2 Owners Are Leaping On A Survey To Express Fury Over Game Key Cards</a></p> <p>On the flip side, you can still share or resell this Game-Key card, which you can’t do with a “digital” version. <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-nintendo-survey-game-key-carts-2000614465">Game-Key cards are an ongoing frustration</a> for Switch 2 fans, and <i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S </i>is no exception.</p> <hr> <p><i>Puyo Puyo Tetris 2S</i> is available now on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

<p>He’s the leader of the bunch, you know him well, but where is Donkey Kong in the roster of <i>Mario Kart World</i>? When you load up the game and try to find the newly-redesigned DK, you may be disappointed to not be able to find him. Luckily, you can find him without too much trouble! Here’s what you need to know to unlock Donkey Kong in <i>Mario Kart World</i>, which tracks he’s best on, and what karts you should use when playing as him.</p> <h2><span id="how-to-unlock-donkey-kong-in-mario-kart-world"></span>How to Unlock Donkey Kong in Mario Kart World<span></span></h2> <p>To unlock Donkey Kong, you only need to complete the Mushroom Cup in the Grand Prix mode. It might seem like a massive oversight to not have Donkey Kong unlock for completing the Banana Cup, but considering the Mushroom Cup culminates in the track DK Spaceport, it’s a good place to find him.</p> <p>Placement is irrelevant here; you only need to complete the grand prix to qualify. Whether you end up in first place or 24th, you’ll be able to add DK to your playable roster. You might want to try playing the cup again if you ended up in 24th, though.</p>

 <h2><span id="which-karts-are-best-for-donkey-kong"></span>Which karts are best for Donkey Kong?<span></span></h2> <p>There are at least four karts that will serve Donkey Kong well against other racers. Chagrin’ Truck is easily one of the fastest, but the Baby Blooper sacrifices top speed for some increased handling you may find useful. Following these two karts, the Reel Racer and Stellar Sled offer a nice combination of speed and handling.</p> <h2><span id="donkey-kong-unlockable-costumes"></span>Donkey Kong Unlockable Costumes<span></span></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616899" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616899"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616899">© Screenshot: Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Unfortunately, as if making him unlockable wasn’t enough, the DK disrespect continues with his unlockable costumes. He has one costume for players to find out in the open world. This puts him barely above minor drivers like Cow and Snowman, and below the main cast of characters. I don’t know how it happened that costumes for King Boo somehow rank above the ape that started it all, but here we are.</p> <p>Donkey Kong’s only unlockable costume is All-Terrain. You can find it by eating quite a few different foods from around the map; try out a variety and you’re bound to find it before long. It’s a great looking costume. Just try to block out any memories it surfaces of 2022’s disappointing Mario Strikers: Battle League.</p> <h2><span id="what-tracks-favor-donkey-kong"></span>What tracks favor Donkey Kong?<span></span></h2> <p>For the most part, other heavy-class characters like Bowser might be the pick to hit the best times. But tracks like Crown City, Desert Hills, Wario Shipyard, Koopa Troopa Beach, Dandelion Depths, Choco Mountain all typically favor the heavy class, so Donkey Kong should perform well here.</p> <hr> <p><i>Mario Kart World </i>is available now on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

              <p><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-assassins-creed-tv-show-ubisoft-plot-date-1851786489">isn’t the only hit Ubisoft blockbuster</a> getting a TV series spin-off. <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-6-the-kotaku-review-1847830444"><em>Far Cry</em></a> will be adapted as well, according to a recent leak on the publisher’s website. But the psychological horror series for FX will be helmed by an unlikely individual: Rob Mac of <a href="https://kotaku.com/always-sunny-frank-danny-devito-last-of-us-mash-up-fx-1851021540"><em>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em></a> fame.</p> <p>A news post that seemingly went up early <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/2YgRby0tgbIWL7K03LKN4t/far-cry-series-adaptation-in-the-works-at-fx">on Ubisoft’s news site over the weekend</a> before being quickly deleted indicated (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/farcry/comments/1mlalqt/far_cry_series_adaptation_in_the_works_at_fx/">according to Reddit</a>) that a <em>Far Cry</em> show will be coming from <em>It’s Always Sunny</em>‘s home network, FX, with Mac joined by <em>Fargo</em> TV creator Noah Hawley, who also recently launched <em>Alien: Earth</em>. Hawley will be showrunner, while Mac reportedly stars in the “anthology” style<em> Far Cry</em> show.</p> <p>The FX house style is probably a good fit for the franchise, though it remains to be seen what a TV version of sneaking through outposts and blowing them up with gas tanks and RPG launchers ends up looking like. Mac isn’t a completely left-field pick either. Ubisoft has been working with him up through the cancellation of <a href="https://kotaku.com/apple-tv-mythic-quest-rob-mcelhenney-season-4-date-1851698983">Apple’s <em>Mythic Quest</em></a>, the workplace comedy about game development created with Megan Ganz and Charlie Day.</p> <p>Ubisoft has a new <em>Far Cr</em>y sequel currently in the works, and with previous entries being best-sellers, the open-world FPS franchise is an obvious candidate for the current video game-to-TV pipeline gold rush. And unlike <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, each <em>Far Cry</em> game features completely different characters and scenarios, giving the show’s writers and producers lots of creative flexibility with how to present the loose franchise’s pillars of carving up animals for inventory upgrades and cult-leader villains.</p>

              <p>Are video game discs popping free of their spindles more often than ever before? That seems to be what some users believe. And what does Samoa Joe think about the recent<em> Battlefied 6</em> open beta? Did he like it? Oh, and everyone loves that new horror movie <em>Weapons</em>, so it’s interesting to hear that the director’s next project might be a really weird and totally fresh take on<em> Resident Evil</em>. All this news and more is featured in today’s hot and ready Morning Checkpoint!</p> <h2>What’s Up With Loose Discs In Video Game Cases?</h2> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:qpbuxrel3f3njvjw5rakf532/app.bsky.feed.post/3lvvy4i6q5226" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigpnazgvm6tzssz5gsjj4yfkqgu7i2qk77wmr56nvaj5oms5lr5yi"> <p lang="en">I would love for someone to do an Investigative Journalism into why most disc-based games are just rattling around loose in their case when purchased brand new vs affixed to the spindle. This never happened until toward the end of the PS4 era, and now it's basically every game I feel?</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qpbuxrel3f3njvjw5rakf532?ref_src=embed">Brandon Sheffield (@brandon.insertcredit.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qpbuxrel3f3njvjw5rakf532/post/3lvvy4i6q5226?ref_src=embed">2025-08-08T19:24:13.437Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>Have you bought a new physical video game in the last few years and noticed that the disc was rattlin’ around inside the plastic case? If so, you aren’t alone. Other people have been commenting on this phenomenon, which was brought to my attention via a BlueSky post by Necrosoft Games Director Brandon Sheffield. According to Sheffield, this has been a growing problem since around the final years of the PS4. Others chimed in, sharing that they too had bought a game and found it loose in the case. Many theories have been provided, including changes in plastic, cheaper plastics being used, and less human involvement in packing physical media. Personally, I’d say all of those play a part in games being loose in the case.</p> <p>Oddly, I’ve mostly avoided this problem when buying new movies and games, but I will admit that when pulling out a new game in 2025, those suckers just pop right out with no force. Meanwhile, I needed to use the jaws of life to pry out PS2 games back when I was younger. So something has seemingly changed, that’s for sure.</p>

 <h2>Look At These New <em>Sonic</em>-Themed Shoes</h2>  <p>These upcoming <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em>-themed Puma sneakers were announced <a href="https://sneakerbardetroit.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-puma-collection-release-date/">earlier this month</a>, but somehow I didn’t see them until now via social media posts about the cool shoes. These are honestly some rad-looking sneakers, with one big exception: The face bits on each shoe representing the character the shoe is based on. I get it, Sega wants some more branding on the sneakers, but it turns these shoes into cheap-looking things you’d buy on Amazon for $10 a day before your nephew’s 12th birthday party. Anyway, these new sneakers are arriving on October 30.</p> <h2>Samoa Joe Shares His Thoughts On The<em> Battlefield 6</em> Beta</h2> <p>All of my friends played the <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta over the weekend. And a lot of people I know online played, too. It seemed like everyone was playing it, including Samoa Joe. Yes, the famous wrestler and actor apparently played a lot of EA’s upcoming FPS over its open beta weekend and <a href="https://x.com/SamoaJoe/status/1954544594483318926">shared his thoughts on social media</a>, saying: “Is the new <em>Battlefield</em> kinda hitting for anyone else, or was the bar so low I’m just grateful? I’m really rooting for the former over the latter.” You are correct, Mr. Joe, the new <em>BF6</em> indeed hits.</p> <h2>Indie <em>Persona</em>-Like RPG Finally Has A Release Date</h2> <p><a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/demonschool-launches-september-3">Necrosoft Games recently announced</a> that its upcoming game, <em>Demonschool</em>, finally has a release date. The “school life strategy RPG” arrives September 3. <em>Demonschool</em>, which looks a lot like a never-before-released Game Boy Advance port of a <em>Persona</em> game (in a good way), will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC.</p>

 <h2><em>Weapons</em> Director Says His <em>Resident Evil</em> Movie Will Be Weird</h2> <p>The biggest movie in America right now is <em>Weapons</em>, a strange horror film from writer and director Zach Cregger. And it just so happens that Cregger’s next project is likely a <em>Resident Evil</em> movie. Cregger, who also created the hit horror flick <em>Barbarian</em>, recently spoke to the <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/weapons-director-zach-cregger-movie-1236340007/"><em>Hollywood Reporter</em> about his video game adaptation</a> and had this to say: “[<em>Resident Evil</em> is] an original screenplay. It’s a weird story. I wrote it and I love the story. It has nothing to do with any of the other <em>Resident Evil</em> movies. If I do my job, it will feel fresh and edgy and weird.” As someone who finds all the past <em>Resident Evil</em> movies to be dumb, mostly bad action flicks, I’m totally fine with someone coming in to make an actual horror movie based on the franchise. Let’s hope Cregger nails it.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-cheating-cheaters-hacks-ea-dice-secureboot-pc-2000616686">People used cheats and wallhacks in the <em>BF6</em> beta (Don’t tell Samoa Joe)&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-boss-rod-ferguson-leaving-blizzard-after-five-years-2000616680"><em>Diablo IV</em> boss Rod Fergusson is leaving Blizzard and Microsoft</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633">Don’t worry, we ranked every song from Netflix’s massive hit movie <em>KPOP Demon Hunters</em></a></li> </ul>  <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p>The new <em>Spider-Man</em> movie has been filming for only a few days, but Sony and Marvel already have a trailer.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="SPIDER-MAN: BRAND NEW DAY - Day One on Set" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ymmwq55sHY?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

              <p>Let’s be honest, how many play a real-time strategy game for its campaign? Me. I do. It’s like a practice mode before you head into a pub stomp or, in my case, face off against the AI because I’m getting old and I can’t click nearly as fast as my <i>StarCraft 2</i> days. Thankfully, <i>Broken Arrow</i> is a bit more tactical, and it’s less about the clicks-per-second and more about overarching strategy. You’ll have plenty of time to practice said strategy, with an extensive campaign and multiple game modes on the side!</p> <h2>How long does it take to finish <i>Broken Arrow</i>’s singleplayer campaign?</h2> <p>If you’re committed to tackling the main campaign in <i>Broken Arrow</i>, which for most players will serve as an introduction to the game’s units and mechanics, like a tutorial for multiplayer and AI opponents, then expect to spend approximately 20 to 25 hours across its 19 main missions:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Showtime</li> <li aria-level="1">Peacekeeper</li> <li aria-level="1">Airbase Heist</li> <li aria-level="1">The Big Wave</li> <li aria-level="1">Tracked and Furious</li> <li aria-level="1">Blackout</li> <li aria-level="1">Papers Please</li> <li aria-level="1">We Own the Night</li> <li aria-level="1">Self Service</li> <li aria-level="1">Operation Cold Harbour</li> <li aria-level="1">Vampires!</li> <li aria-level="1">Heavy Rain</li> <li aria-level="1">Search &amp; Rescue</li> <li aria-level="1">Forbidden Waters</li> <li aria-level="1">Hunting Season</li> <li aria-level="1">With a Little Help From My Friends</li> <li aria-level="1">The Ride of the VDV</li> <li aria-level="1">Road to The Fiddler’s Green</li> <li aria-level="1">Broken Arrow</li> </ul> <h2>What to do after finishing <i>Broken Arrow</i>’s campaign</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000616869" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616869"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616869">© Screenshot: Steel Balalaika / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>On top of the lengthy campaign, which we’ll consider the game’s warm up, you’ll have access to a skirmish mode against AI, a full multiplayer mode against human opponents, a scenario editor that you may craft and share…scenarios, and a lot of us will likely spend hours upon hours perfecting our units in the army customization suite.</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><b>Skirmish Mode</b>: The game’s skirmish mode pits you against AI opponents on 19 maps, with varying difficulty levels for high replayability.</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Multiplayer</b>: If you’re feeling antsy and want to test your abilities online against real-life players, multiplayer matches featuring 5×5 gameplay allow your competitive side to shine through as you vie for dominance of the leaderboards.</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Scenario Editor</b>: The scenario editor in <i>Broken Arrow</i> is a comprehensive toolset, identical to the mission editor used by the development team, allowing you to craft custom scenarios complete with visual scripting, cutscenes, and dialogue.</li> <li aria-level="1"><b>Army Customization</b>: There are currently more than 300 units in <i>Broken Arrow</i>, and over 1,500 combinations, allowing you to tailor your entire army to suit your playstyle and needs.
