And charging $90 for the complete version of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> is a perfect example. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,194644,195922" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Nintendo announced that the game, a launch title on the original Switch back in 2017, will get an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmDD7JSfhcE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dmDD7JSfhcE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">upgraded version for the Switch 2</a></span> with smoother framerates, better resolution, faster load times, HDR support, and additional perks from the Zelda Notes mobile app like daily stat bonuses and a GPS for finding Korok seeds. While the upgrade is free for Switch Online Expansion Pack subscribers, it’ll be $10 for everyone else, making <em>Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> a $70 game on Switch 2. </p><p>But Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-nintendo-switch-2-edition-wont-include-the-dlc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-nintendo-switch-2-edition-wont-include-the-dlc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently confirmed to<em> IGN</em></a></span> that that version still won’t include the game’s year-one DLC. The <em>Breath of the Wild</em> Expansion Pass, which contains a harder difficulty mode, more gear, additional side quests, new story missions, and an honest-to-god motorcycle, will still be locked behind an additional $20 upgrade. In other words, anyone coming to<em> Breath of the Wild</em> for the first time on Switch 2 will need to spend $90 for the full experience. The price of saving Hyrule has never been so high. </p><p>Contrast Nintendo’s approach to its eight-year old mega hit with CD Projekt Red’s to <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. Both games have sold over 30 million copies. Both games are dense open-world adventures. Both are coming to Switch 2. Both will be $70 there. Except<em> Cyberpunk 2077 </em>will include its <em>Phantom Liberty</em> expansion which came out less than two years ago as a “Complete Edition” pack-in at no extra charge. And that’s despite the fact CDPR has to pay a platform fee to Nintendo on every sale. </p><p>In isolation, selling<em> Breath of the Wild </em>DLC  separately on Switch 2 would warrant a “there goes Nintendo again” eye roll and nothing more, but it’s the latest in a series of headscratchers that keeps killing the pre-launch vibe. <em>Mario Kart World</em> and <em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom </em>are both $80, suggesting most upcoming top-tier first-party games will be as well. <em>Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour </em>is a $10 download instead of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Reggie/status/1910052940242620563&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Reggie/status/1910052940242620563" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wii Sports-like pack-in</a></span>. Some physical games will only be cartridges with DRM keys on them. GameChat, complete with its own dedicated controller button, will require a paid subscription after the first year. </p><p>Than there’s the wonky way Nintendo has handled all of the questions still surrounding the Switch 2.

On paper, it’s everything fans have been asking for for years. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-destroy-everything-photo-surf-2d-1851774873&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-destroy-everything-photo-surf-2d-1851774873"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a></span> look incredible. If an ongoing trade war doesn’t completely sabotage the launch in the U.S., early adopters may go hands-on with the Switch 2 on June 5 and instantly fall in love, forgetting all of the current noise and bellyaching. But in the meantime it’s all we have, and the nickel-and-diming has gotten completely out of control. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
