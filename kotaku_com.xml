Take-Two might not need the extra money, but raising the price of<em> GTA VI</em> could give cover to other companies to raise their prices as well. The increasingly hollowed-out middle ground could go from charging $40 and $50 to $60 and $70, so the reasoning goes. Then again, in the current zero-sum environment, raising the cap could also just drive even more money away from smaller companies and lesser-known franchises. </p><figure id="" data-id="bd6b415eb1ea39c5ee1ec569ba6c6f8c" data-recommend-id="image://bd6b415eb1ea39c5ee1ec569ba6c6f8c" data-format="png" data-width="1192" data-height="848" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows how much of the gaming market is dominated by the top franchises.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This isn’t the first time someone’s brought up the idea of <em>GTA VI </em>potentially breaking the current $70 price barrier. Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/take-two-ceo-no-pushback-70-price-sega-zelda-gta-vi-2k-1850456925&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/take-two-ceo-no-pushback-70-price-sega-zelda-gta-vi-2k-1850456925">asked about it on investor calls in the past</a></span> and responds by saying the company always wants to overdeliver in terms of quality and value. That noncommittal response certainly doesn’t close the door to <em>GTA VI </em>being $80 or even $100, and Take-Two was one of the first companies to push existing games into $70 territory with the launch of the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p>Before that, premium boxed games had been $60 since the launch of the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/game-prices-go-up-to-70-the-first-increase-in-15-years?sref=P6Q0mxvj&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-11-09/game-prices-go-up-to-70-the-first-increase-in-15-years?sref=P6Q0mxvj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remaining stagnant for roughly 15 years</a></span> even while most other things around them got more expensive, including development budgets. When <em>GTA 3</em> came to PS2 back in 2001, it was $50. If it were <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">adjusted for inflation</a></span>, it would cost $90 today. And in fact many big blockbusters, like <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, already have $100 versions for those players who want limited-edition skins, premium battle passes, extra in-game items, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paid-early-access-pre-order-madden-star-wars-outlaws-1851596675">and early access to play ahead of the official launch</a></span> (the ultimate edition of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is even more at $110). </p><p>In his analysis, Ball points to a number of reasons why companies are so hesitant to raise game prices, or at least now use a one-size-fits-all approach to selecting them. The mere fact that game prices have historically not changed much has reinforced how “sticky” they are and leads to outsized player scrutiny any time price hikes are discussed. Other factors are competition from the rise of free-to-play games like <em>Fortnite </em>and <em>Genshin Impact</em> and the desire to reach as big a player-base as possible for battle passes, DLC, and other paid add-ons down the road. Plus it’s no secret how many people are already trained to wait just a few months for major discounts on everything but the best-selling games. </p><p>Nintendo recently showed that price hikes aren’t the end of the world when done smartly. It charged an extra $10 for <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> despite still being on the same hardware as the $60 <em>Breath of the Wild</em>. The game still went on to sell over 20 million copies and it also didn’t mean that <em>Pikmin 4</em> was all of a sudden going to cost $70 too (though it certainly would have still been worth it). <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> was only $60 on PC, but could have been another obvious contender for an $80 or even $100 game.</p><p>“I don’t love the artificiality of pricing structures post retail,” Larian Studios head of publishing, Michael Douse, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1828078408397623473&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1828078408397623473" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote online last year</a></span>. “Use the inflated base price to upsell a subscription, and use vague content promises to inflate ultimate editions to make the base price look better. It all seems a bit dangerous &amp; disconnected from the community. I think a game should be priced accordingly with its quality, breadth &amp; depth. I’m not against higher prices, but this arbitrary uniformity just doesn’t make sense to me. It feels so unserious.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And now, dozens of movies later, a new report claims that one of the villains from that very first<em> Iron Man</em> film, Raza, is returning in a new MCU TV show. Are you excited? Do you even remember Raza? Well, it doesn’t matter; he’s back, baby! </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2025/01/faran-tahir-marvel-vision-series-disney-plus-1236257063/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2025/01/faran-tahir-marvel-vision-series-disney-plus-1236257063/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On January 14, <em>Deadline </em>reported</a></span> that its sources had confirmed that actor Faran Tahir was set to appear in the upcoming Paul Bettany-led <em>Vision Quest</em> series.
