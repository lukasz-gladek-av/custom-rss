              <p>It doesn’t matter if you get your workouts in running the road, climbing at a rock gym, or just lifting weights. Fitness buffs of all kinds have a good reason to use a fitness tracker. It can provide you with useful metrics, help establish healthy habits and keep you motivated to stay active.</p>
<p>Fitness trackers can vary a lot in price, but you can often find some of the good ones at steep discounts. Right now, Amazon happens to have the Fitbit Charge 6 on sale for 38% off: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5344/">band normally goes for $59, but the ongoing sale brings it down to an even $99</a>.</p>

<h2>Built-in GPS</h2>
<p>One of the most important features in a good fitness tracker, particularly for runners, is <strong>GPS</strong>. You can track mileage and pace right on your wrist instead of carrying your smartphone around, recording it there. The Fitbit Charge 6 is equipped <strong>with over 40 different exercise modes</strong> to take advantage of. Activities range from running to kayaking to cycling and more.</p>
<p>You can monitor your heart rate all throughout your day to get an idea of where you resting heart rate is at, then measure the intensity of your workouts based on how much it’s going up. Use this data to get a handle on your effort levels so you can adjust accordingly to meet your goals. Heart rate monitoring using the ECG app and sensor can also be used to detect irregular heart rhythm, which may be caused by atrial fibrillation (AFib). It can also provide<strong> insight regarding blood oxygen levels, skin temperature, and more</strong>.</p>



<p>You can even use your Fitbit Charge 6 for stress management purposes: The fitness tracker can breakdown for you a stress management score, calculated by analyzing your heart rate along with some other factors. The tracker can walk your through guided breathing sessions which can help build healthier habits in handling stress.</p>
<p>The fitness tracker isn’t just for when your active, but inactive too. The watch can measure how productive your sleep is each night in recharging you and allowing you to take on the day. The Fitbit Charge 6 assigns you a sleep score by tracking your light, deep, and REM sleep in unison with your sleeping heart rate, nailing down how consistent your night’s rest is. You can even set an alarm window for waking up, in which the tracker can vibrate to wake you up when you are in the optimal sleep stage for feeling refreshed when it’s time to get up in the morning.</p>

              <p>The kids’ electric scooter market is blowing up with super cheap options from unknown brands that skimp on safety certifications and build quality. You see them everywhere online, they tempt you with super low prices but without the testing or engineering that prevents accidents.</p>
<p><strong>Segway Ninebot built a reputation on safe, reliable personal transportation</strong>&nbsp;and the <em>eKickScooter C2 Pro</em> brings that same commitment to kids aged 6 to 14. Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5343/">has dropped the price from $279 down to $229, hitting an all-time low</a> for a scooter that parents can trust and kids will actually enjoy riding.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5343/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Safety Features to Give Parents Peace of Mind</h2>
<p>The kick-to-start system avoids the most common cause of kids’ scooter accidents: sudden, unexpected acceleration. The<strong> throttle doesn’t kick in until your child gets the scooter up to 3 mph</strong>, and removes the possibility of the motor engaging while they are still getting on or adjusting their position. This alone turns the scooter from a potentially very hazardous toy into something kids can safely control from the first ride.</p>
<p>The UL-2272 certification covers the battery system, charging components and electrical circuits, all ensuring that <strong>the scooter will not overheat, catch fire, or have electrical failures</strong> common in uncertified models. TUV Rheinland’s testing process includes drop tests, water resistance evaluation and sustained load testing that goes far beyond what discount brands bother with.</p>
<p>The scooter features<strong> three riding modes that let you match its performance to your child’s skill level</strong> and the riding environment. Safe Mode limits speed and acceleration for beginners still learning balance and control. Standard Mode opens up more speed while maintaining manageable acceleration curves. Sport Mode unleashes the full 12.4 mph top speed for experienced riders tackling longer distances or slight inclines. The <strong>150W motor delivers enough torque to handle hills</strong> that would stop weaker scooters, supporting up to 132-pound riders.</p>



<p>The adjustable handlebar extends to<strong> three different heights to fit kids</strong> from elementary school through middle school. After all, a 6-year-old and a 14-year-old have much different heights and arm lengths, and this scooter adjusts to fit both in and out of the box. Proper handlebar height is important for both control and safety-too low, and kids have to hunch over uncomfortably; too high, and steering precision suffers.</p>



<p>On one charge,<strong> it provides 9.3 miles of range</strong>&nbsp;which easily equates to several days of neighborhood rides or trips down to your friend’s house. Charging time is 4 hours, so if your kid plugs it in after getting home from school, then it’s ready to go for the next day’s adventures. Range will vary based on rider weight, terrain, and riding mode, but even conservative real-world use yields 7 to 8 miles, enough for most kids’ typical journeys.</p>
<p>The integrated Bluetooth speaker adds the dimension of entertainment that kids will be seriously appreciative of. Pair the scooter with a smartphone and ride while streaming music, with LED lights pulsating and changing colors in time with the beat. Voice assistant compatibility lets kids control music playback hands-free, keeping both hands on the handlebars where they belong.</p>
<p>At $229, you’re getting a scooter backed by Segway’s engineering expertise and actual safety certifications, not just marketing claims.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-priced-like-an-old-model-amazon-quietly-dumps-its-anc-headphones-2000641239</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-priced-like-an-old-model-amazon-quietly-dumps-its-anc-headphones.1343956/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The premium headphone market overflows with active noise cancellation options from Sony, Apple, Sennheiser, and countless others, but <strong>Bose is still the brand that essentially invented consumer ANC</strong> and continues to push the technology forward. The <em>QuietComfort Ultra</em> is the top of the line from Bose and marries its most advanced noise cancellation with class-leading spatial audio capabilities that few competitors can match. Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5342/">has dropped the price from $429 down to $329, the all-time low for Bose’s best headphones</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5342/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Three Modes That Adapt to Your Environment</h2>
<p>Bose QuietComfort Ultra has three different listening modes that redefine the way you interact with the world around you: <strong>Quiet Mode</strong> with full noise cancellation, puts you in a personal bubble of quiet that rejects airplane engines, traffic noise and chatty coworkers. All of this occurs via a series of outward-facing microphones that detect ambient noise and inward-facing processing that generates inverse sound waves to nullify noise. <strong>Aware Mode</strong> turns the tables, piping environmental sound back in through the headphones so you can hear announcements, conversations, or oncoming traffic without ever having to take your headphones off. <strong>Immersion Mode</strong> melds maximum noise cancelation with Bose Immersive Audio-their spatial audio technology that envelops your head with three-dimensional space.</p>
<p><em>CustomTune</em> technology tailors the sound profile to your ears: When you first don the headphones, they play a brief tone and measure how sound reflects off of your unique ear shape. It then <strong>adjusts frequency response to compensate for how your ears naturally emphasize</strong> or diminish certain frequencies. Two people listening to the same headphones will hear slightly different tuning optimized for their individual anatomy, ensuring that you get the most accurate sound reproduction possible.</p>



<p>The microphone system stands out for good reason: in practice, it really does deliver clear phone calls. It’s<strong> powered by six microphones that collaborate to lock in your voice and filter out background noise</strong>, wind and more. You can take calls from a busy street or a windy park and the person on the other end hears you clearly without competing noise.</p>



<p>Comfort is essential when you are wearing headphones for hours on end: The <strong>ear cushions employ soft, conforming foam</strong> that doesn’t develop pressure points, and the headband evenly distributes weight around your head. Materials feel high-quality with a refined finish; professional enough to use in work settings. The<strong> 254-gram weight puts these headphones right in the middle of premium over-ear headphones</strong>, light enough to comfortably wear but substantial enough to feel well-built.</p>
<p>With noise cancellation on, you can get up to <strong>24 hours of battery life</strong> which means multiple days of use between charges. Toggling on Immersion Mode with spatial audio reduces that to 18 hours, still likely more than enough for a week’s listenings for most people. A 15-minute charge gets you 2.5 hours of playback, which is enough to top off at lunchtime and make it through the afternoon.</p>
<p>For $329, you’ll get tech worth upwards of $400, backed by decades of expertise from Bose itself.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-backs-this-anker-macbook-pro-charger-and-its-5-times-cheaper-on-amazon-than-its-official-site-2000641232</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-backs-this-anker-macbook-pro-charger-and-it%E2%80%99s-5-times-cheaper-on-amazon-than-its-official-site.1343950/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Buying a charger directly from Apple is like paying a luxury price for basic functionality. A 70W USB-C power adapter from Apple’s official store costs $59 and if you want a USB-C cable to go along with it, you’re adding another $19 to $29 depending on the length. That’s close to $90 before tax for slower charging speeds than what this Anker charger delivers.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5341/">Anker option packs 100W of power and includes a 5-foot cable, all for just $21 during this limited-time deal</a>, down from the usual $27. This isn’t some sketchy third-party accessory either: it’s from Anker, a brand that’s become synonymous with reliable charging gear and officially available in Apple Stores too.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5341/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power That Matches Your MacBook’s Appetite</h2>
<p>The 100W output on this charger means you’re getting enough juice to fast-charge even the most power-hungry MacBooks. Apple’s 16-inch MacBook Pro with the M1 Max chip reaches 100% battery in just 1 hour and 20 minutes with this charger and matches the performance of Apple’s 140W charger in most charging scenarios. The difference comes down to the power delivery protocols: both chargers support USB Power Delivery 3.0, which intelligently negotiates the right amount of power for your device.</p>
<p>When you plug in a device, Anker’s PowerIQ 3.0 technology automatically detects what that is and adjusts the power output accordingly. Plug in your iPhone, and it will pass on the appropriate 20W for fast charging. Swap for a Samsung Galaxy S25 and it will push full power the phone can handle. Connect a Dell XPS or HP Spectre laptop, and it will negotiate the optimal charging speed. That makes this single charger compatible with a wide array of devices, replacing multiple other chargers and helping to cut down on the cable mess in your bag. It<strong> comes with a 5-foot USB-C-to-USB-C cable which supports a full 100W power transfer</strong>, meaning you do not need to buy a separate high-wattage-compatible cable.</p>



<p>Standard chargers jut out awkwardly in bags and catch on clothes and scratching other items. This Anker charger folds flat, creating a smooth profile that slides easily into laptop sleeves or even jacket pockets. The compact size measures roughly 2.5 inches on each side and about an inch thick, <strong>taking up less space than Apple’s 96W brick and significantly smaller than their 140W charger</strong>.</p>



<p>ActiveShield technology runs 24/7 and <strong>performs more than 3 million temperature checks daily</strong> on the charger. The moment it starts running hot from extended use or environmental elements, it automatically adjusts power output to cool things down. That prevents overheating damage to both the charger and your devices, with a considerable extension of their life span. The system is completed by protection against overcharging, short circuits, and power surges for increased peace of mind when leaving devices plugged in overnight or during long work sessions.</p>
<p>Apple wants $59 for a slower 70W charger that doesn’t include any cable. Their 96W charger will set you back $79 without cable as well. This Anker setup gives you more power than either one, throws in a quality cable, and costs $21. You could get backups for home and office at this price and still come out spending less than one Apple charger.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovo-thinkpad-with-ryzen-7-chip-priced-like-a-mid-range-laptop-and-its-not-a-refurb-2000641221</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo-thinkpad-with-ryzen-7-chip-priced-like-a-mid-range-laptop-and-it%E2%80%99s-not-a-refurb.1343941/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The ThinkPad has been the go-to business laptop for decades and for good reason: from CEOs to engineers, pros swear by them. You need a machine that can handle back-to-back video calls, crunch spreadsheets without lag, run multiple applications at once and still have juice for the commute home. The <strong>Lenovo ThinkPad E16 G2</strong> delivers all of that and more and packs premium specs into a proven design.</p>
<p>Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5340/">has dropped the price from $1,299 down to just $899, which marks an all-time low for this powerhouse laptop</a>. This isn’t some refurbished unit or stripped-down configuration: you’re getting a brand-new machine <strong>with 32GB of RAM, a 1TB SSD, and a Ryzen 7 processor</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5340/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Business-Grade Performance</h2>
<p>At the heart of this laptop is an <strong>AMD Ryzen 7 7735HS processor which boasts 8 cores and 16 threads</strong> to tackle your everyday tasks with much ease. With a base clock of 3.2GHz that boosts up to 4.75GHz when needed, this chip doesn’t break a sweat with demanding workloads. Run AutoCAD while streaming a training video and responding to Slack messages? No problem. The processor includes 4MB of L2 cache and 16MB of L3 cache which means frequently accessed data stays close to the CPU for faster retrieval.</p>
<p>The 32GB of DDR5 RAM gives you enough headroom to keep dozens of browser tabs open, work across multiple documents and run virtual machines if your job requires it. <strong>DDR5 is the latest memory standard</strong>&nbsp;and offers faster data transfer rates than DDR4 and better power efficiency. Match this with a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD, and you have storage that’s fast enough to <strong>boot Windows 11 Pro in seconds</strong> and load large files almost instantly. The terabyte lets you store years of documents, presentations, and project files at your fingertips without being forced to resort to external drives or constant cloud uploads.</p>



<p>The <strong>16-inch display uses a WUXGA resolution of 1920×1200</strong>, which, in turn, provides more vertical space than the standard Full HD screens. The extra height you get when reviewing a long document or working with spreadsheets amounts to fewer scrolls, which in turn means better productivity. The IPS panel displays consistent colors from a variety of viewing angles, while the 300 nits of brightness make it possible to work well even in bright office environments or near windows. Integrated AMD Radeon 680M graphics handle everyday visual tasks and can even manage light gaming or basic video editing if you need a break.</p>



<p>Security features run deep on this ThinkPad: The fingerprint reader built into the power button uses biometric authentication for quick login while keeping unauthorized users out. The TPM 2.0 chip encrypts sensitive data and prevents the system from booting if anyone tampers with the hardware. A physical privacy shutter covers the 1080p webcam when you’re not using it, eliminating concerns about unauthorized viewing.</p>
<p>Connectivity covers all the bases with a <strong>mix of USB-A and USB-C ports supporting up to 10Gbps</strong>. Two USB-C ports support Power Delivery 3.0 and DisplayPort 1.4, so you can charge the laptop and connect an external monitor via the same port. The HDMI 2.1 port supports 4K display at 60Hz, perfect for presentations or doing a dual-monitor setup at your desk.</p>
<p>At $899 for early Black Friday, you’re getting a laptop that would normally cost over $1,200.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You don’t have to stick to basic, boring white bulbs anymore and you definitely don’t need to change the entire wiring in your home to add smarter lighting. <em>Govee</em> makes the upgrade easy with its wide range of smart bulbs, and we just spotted a solid pair going for less on Amazon.</p>
<p>Currently, you can grab a <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5338/">2 pack of Govee LED Smart Light Bulbs for just $19, which is a little over $9 per bulb</a>. The only thing to note is that this deal is currently <strong>exclusive to Prime members</strong>. If you already have Prime, you’re good to go. If not, you might want to consider signing up, especially with the holiday season coming up.</p>
<p>Amazon usually rolls out some of its biggest discounts for Prime users during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The retailer also offers a 7-day free trial, which gives you access to the deal (and free shipping) without any immediate commitment. After the trial, it’s going to run you around $15 a month, but you’re likely going to make that money back quickly through exclusive discounts and free shipping if you order often!</p>

<h2>Millions of Colors to Choose From</h2>
<p>For less than $20, you’re getting a pair of smart light bulbs that are easy to install and can be controlled remotely via Govee Home App or smart assistants like Alexa or Google Assistant. Each bulb offers a <strong>brightness of up to 1000 lumens</strong>&nbsp;which is equivalent to a traditional 75W bulb. You can adjust the brightness from 1 to 100%, plus choose from over 16 million colors. These are also tunable between warm white and cool daylight (2700K to 6500K), so you can shift the vibe of your space from focused to relaxed within seconds.</p>



<p>The Govee Home app gives you access to up to 54 scene modes for your Wi-Fi light bulbs, and you can even create a fun lighting schedule for your day. Maybe go for a brighter setting during the day, and slowly wind down with a cozy, warm light; the options are endless.</p>
<p>There’s also a music sync feature that lets the bulbs change colors based on sound detected by your phone’s microphone. Just keep in mind that you’ll need a stable 2.4GHz Wi-Fi connection to get started, and these are not compatible with smart switches.</p>
<p>Want more bulbs? The 4-pack and 8-pack bundles are also on sale for $39 and $79.</p>

              <p>Sure, you can use your trackpad or a basic office mouse to get through most of your day, but if you’re looking for solid speeds and better accuracy, a responsive mouse can make a lot of difference. And thankfully, you don’t need to spend a fortune to upgrade.</p>
<p>Right now, Amazon has the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4265/">Logitech G305 Lightspeed wireless gaming mouse on sale for $29, which is 40% off its regular $49 price</a>. The deal applies to all color options, including black, blue, lilac, mint, and white. The retailer hasn’t specified when the deal will end, but it likely won’t stick around for long. If you’ve had your eye on it, now’s a good time to grab one before the price shoots back up or the stock expires!</p>

<h2>Impressive Responsiveness for Fast-Paced Games</h2>
<p>There’s nothing too flashy about the design, which is a good thing. Having multiple options to choose from means you can pick the one that suits your aesthetics the best. Prefer a clean, basic look? Go for the black one. Want to add a pop of color to your gaming setup? Lilac should look stunning!

              <p>There’s just something magical about how the right lighting can completely turn a room around – turn a cold corner into a cozy reading nook or make your living space seem like it’s pulled from a design magazine. Good lighting doesn’t just brighten things up: it sets the mood, creates atmosphere and, honestly, just makes you want to spend more time in your own home. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4546/">Usually $99, Amazon has slashed the price of the Govee RGBIC floor lamp to just $69</a>, which happens to be an all-time low for this <strong>#1 bestselling floor lamp</strong>.</p>

<h2>Make Your Home Smarter</h2>
<p>The Govee floor lamp packs some seriously impressive tech into its sleek black design: W<strong>ith 1000 lumens of brightness</strong>, this lamp delivers enough light to properly illuminate a bedroom or living room without needing multiple fixtures. That’s <strong>roughly equivalent to a 75-watt incandescent bulb</strong> but with infinitely more flexibility. The RGBIC technology is where things get interesting: unlike basic RGB lamps that display one color at a time, <strong>RGBIC allows multiple colors to appear simultaneously across different sections of the lamp</strong>.</p>
<p>The lamp is integrated perfectly with Alexa for complete voice control. Forgot to turn off the lamp while getting into bed? Just ask Alexa to do that. Want to dim the lights for movie night without getting up from the couch? Voice commands, of course! The Govee Home app <strong>gives you access to more than 16 million color combinations</strong> which sounds kind of excessive until you realize just how regularly you’ll actually adjust the settings to suit different occasions. Dinner party? Warm amber tones.</p>



<p>Another feature that makes this more than just a simple lamp is the music sync: It <strong>pulses in real time to whatever you’re listening to</strong>, changing colors to go with the beat. Throw on some upbeat music, and it’s an instant dance party. This works via the app’s microphone detection, so nothing too complicated in terms of setup-just turn on music sync mode and let it do its thing. It’s great for entertaining small groups or just adding an element of fun to your solo dance sessions.</p>
<p>Attention should also be turned to the design itself: This is a<strong> corner lamp which means it’s specifically shaped to tuck into those awkward spaces</strong> that most furniture can’t fill properly. The tall and slender profile takes up very little floor space while maximizing vertical lighting coverage. <strong>About 62 inches tall</strong>, it reaches high enough to cast light across an entire room rather than just illuminating a small radius around its base.</p>



<p>Setup takes minutes, not hours: Plug it in, download the Govee Home app, connect it to your WiFi and you’re ready to start customizing. The app contains dozens of <strong>preset scenes</strong> designed by Govee’s team—things like “Ocean,” “Sunset,” and “Aurora”—so you don’t have to spend time creating custom scenes if you’d rather just pick something that works. But if you do want to get creative,<strong> DIY mode lets you tap into specific colors</strong> for different segments of the lamp and save your creations for later use.</p>
<p>At $69, you’re getting smart home integration, music reactivity, millions of color options, and enough brightness to actually function as primary lighting – all for $30 less than usual.</p>

              <p>Star Wars fans, it’s a great time to bring some important pieces of the galaxy far, far away into your own space. LEGO introduced its 25th Anniversary Star Wars collection to celebrate some of the most iconic ships in the saga, and if you’ve ever wanted your very own Millennium Falcon model, now is a great time to grab one at a discounted rate.</p>
<p>Amazon has dropped the price <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">of LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon to $67, which is 20% off its regular $84 price</a>. It’s part of the brand’s special anniversary lineup, and the level of detail here is impressive. Such exclusive sets don’t really stay on sale for long, so it’s best to get your orders in sooner rather than later. The deal is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, but Prime members will also enjoy free shipping on their orders.</p>

<h2>Build Your Own Starship Collection</h2>
<p>This collectible build-and-display model lets you build a mid-scale brick recreation of one of the most iconic ships, and comes with 921 pieces in total. It hits that sweet spot; not too massive, but not so simple that you’re done before you’ve even settled in. LEGO packs it with details like the cockpit, satellite dish, and dual cannons. Even better, there’s a buildable stand to place the ship on. It includes a nameplate and a special 25th Anniversary LEGO Star Wars brick. You can even position the Falcon at a dynamic angle for a more realistic, mid-flight look.</p>



<p>The set also fits nicely into the Starship collection by LEGO, so you can always add more ships down the line if you’re planning to build out a full display. Putting it together won’t be too complicated, as it comes with a handy instruction book that takes you step by step through the entire build. The instruction book is quite detailed on its own, but if you need extra help, you can also use the LEGO Builder app.</p>
<p>Once completed, the Millennium Falcon measures just over 5 inches high, 9.5 inches long, and 7.5 inches wide. Place it on your bookshelf or your desk – it’s sure to impress anyone who sees it.</p>
<p>Just note that there’s no telling how long the discount will last, so it’s best to get your orders in soon.</p>
