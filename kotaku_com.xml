              <p>It doesn’t often happen that Amazon’s best-sellers list puts a budget Windows laptop next to high-end MacBook Airs, but that’s what’s happening right now. There’s an HP 14-inch model (Intel Celeron N4020, 4 GB RAM, 64 GB Storage) that has quietly become a serious player on the platform as one of the best-selling laptops on the site, and the reason why is simple: it’s awfully cheap.</p>
<p>With the ongoing Labor Day sale, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3762/">you can get it for $172 down from its usual $230</a>. At that price, it’s one of the cheapest brand-new laptops you’ll find anywhere, and it’s less than some headphones or tablets.&nbsp;The deal becomes even harder to pass up when you factor in it also <strong>includes a one-year subscription to Microsoft 365</strong> which alone usually costs $129 (per year). And since that comes bundled for free, you’re essentially paying close to the value of the software and getting a full-sized laptop in exchange.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3762/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why You Should Buy It</h2>
<p>The screen itself is a 14-inch HD micro-edge bezel panel that boasts a slim design that doesn’t scream “budget.” It’s not too small for Netflix sessions or working on documents, and its size sits comfortably in the sweet spot between being travel-friendly and being productive. The laptop is also easy to carry around thanks to a thin build and light weight which is convenient if you’re going to class or a local coffee shop.</p>
<p>The machine runs on <strong>Intel’s Celeron N4020 processor with 4GB of RAM and 64GB of storage</strong>. It’s not built for heavy creative projects or gaming, but that isn’t what this computer is meant for. Instead, it’s built to give you coverage for normal things such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, email or Zoom meetings. The storage might feel tight compared to higher-end models, but remember—Microsoft 365 allows you to access OneDrive cloud storage which means you can keep your most important files online and free up space on the device.</p>



<p>Battery life is always something to watch out for with cheaper laptops, but HP has managed to keep it respectable here: You’ll have hours of use out of one charge, which should be <strong>sufficient to get you through a school day</strong> or long study session. Add in <strong>preinstalled Windows 11 Home</strong>, and you’re receiving the latest version of Microsoft’s operating system with periodic updates, all for the cheap price.</p>
<p>At $172, this HP laptop is precariously close to “why not?” territory.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-slashes-all-its-margin-on-the-new-macbook-air-now-cheaper-than-an-average-laptop.1282782/</guid>

              <p>Over the past few years, Apple hasn’t really been hiking prices – in fact, in some cases it’s been doing the opposite. The MacBook Air is a perfect example, and it got more affordable since Apple introduced its own chips. What was once a laptop that never, ever went on sale is now showing up more and more in big Amazon sales.</p>
<p>This Labor Day, it takes it to the next level with the brand-new 2025 MacBook Air falling to an all-time low. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3761/">13-inch version with 16GB RAM and 256GB storage falls to $799, from a full $200 off its normal $999</a>. The higher-end ones with bigger storage and RAM are also heavily discounted but this model is the one that’s technically fallen to an all-time low.</p>

<h2>Best in Class Laptop</h2>
<p>The MacBook Air’s draw has always been combining power, portability and battery life, but <strong>the 2025 version does it even better thanks to the new M4 chip within</strong>. The processor is designed with Apple Intelligence in mind so it’s <strong>optimized to handle future AI features</strong> that will be introduced across macOS and the remainder of Apple’s platform. More importantly for day-to-day use, the M4 makes every task faster and smoother: If you’re looking for a laptop that can manage both the basics and more demanding tasks without slowing down, this deal puts that capability within reach at an affordable price.</p>
<p>The 13.6-inch Liquid Retina display is still one of the best features of the MacBook Air: With its precise bright colors, sharp resolution, and broad color gamut coverage, it’s a monitor for anyone from a student to a professional. Watching movies, photo editing, or simply typing reports feels more real and comfortable on a display like this. The thin bezels give a streamlined look, and True Tone adapts the color temperature to your environment.</p>



<p>Priced at around 2.7 pounds and measuring less than half an inch, MacBook Air lives up to its name: It fits into any bag and it’s easy to tote around all day. Even with that thin design, it doesn’t cut corners on connections or sound. You still get a pair of Thunderbolt ports, a MagSafe charging port, a headphone jack and a surprisingly deep speaker system for a laptop of this thickness.</p>
<p>Apple has also raised the bar on video calling with a 12MP front camera that includes Center Stage which is a feature that ensures you’re always front and center during a call. And with studio-quality mics and improved speakers, the Macbook Air is prepared for work calls as well as family video calls. For security and ease of use, Touch ID is built into the keyboard so you can unlock the machine or confirm purchases instantly.</p>
<p>Naturally, battery life remains one of the primary points of appeal. <strong>Apple claims the new MacBook Air will last up to 18 hours on a single battery,</strong> so you can get through a full day of classes, meetings, or travel without having to plug in. That combination of power and thrift is exactly why this line has been so adored.</p>
<p>If you’d been waiting for a good reason to finally splurge on the MacBook Air, this Labor Day sale makes it an easy call.</p>

              <p><em>Labor Day</em> is here and Amazon is in the mood to clean out its shelves with some deals that feel almost unreal. These record-low prices even beat what we saw during Prime Day in July, which says a lot. And if you’re into LEGO, you probably know Star Wars sets are the ones everyone pays attention to.</p>
<p>Right now, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3759/">LEGO Star Wars Ahsoka Tano’s T-6 Jedi Shuttle has plummeted to an all-time low price of just $47, from a previous price of $80</a> (41% off), with a whopping <strong>4.8 out of 5 stars across more than 1,500 reviews</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3759/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Must-Have LEGO Set</h2>
<p>The T-6 Jedi Shuttle (75362) tips the scales at <strong>over 600 pieces</strong> and springs to life as <strong>Ahsoka Tano’s spaceship in the Disney+ series</strong>. LEGO made sure that the shuttle is not a special one that you build and never touch again. Wings are folded up to flight position, there is an opening cockpit, and the set makes space for play scenarios that Star Wars fans will recognize straight away.</p>
<p>One of the highlights for collectors is the lineup of mini-figures included in the kit: <strong>Ahsoka Tano herself is featured with her dual white lightsabers</strong>, but with her as well is Sabine Wren with blasters, Professor Huyang with his unique droid model, and Marrok, one of the show’s antagonists, with a double-bladed lightsaber. Minifig fans alone are already made this set worth a purchase because exclusive figures inflate aftermarket values.</p>



<p>Design-wise, the T-6 has the details you’d hope for in a modern LEGO Star Wars release: The <strong>ship measures over 10 inches long, about 9 inches wide, and stands 3 inches tall in its landed form</strong>. That makes it a satisfying build that looks good on display without taking over your entire shelf. The play features (like stud shooters and the adjustable wings) are intuitive enough for younger builders to use frequently without frustration.</p>
<p>It’s also a great gift option. With Disney+ placing Ahsoka at the center of Star Wars storytelling momentum, there’s a safe bet kids (and a decent number of adults) will have this ship on their holiday list. At under fifty dollars, it’s one of those deals you don’t hesitate at.</p>
