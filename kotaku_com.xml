His family loses it and an inane argument about the iconic film ensues, eventually leading Peter to utter the enigmatic and now memed-to-death line, “It insists upon itself.” Nearly two decades later, the show’s creator, Seth McFarlane, finally explains what it means. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Since this has been trending, here’s a fun fact: ‘It insists upon itself’ was a criticism my college film history professor used to explain why he didn’t think ‘The Sound of Music’ was a great film,” McFarlane <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/SethMacFarlane/status/1881825910040702979&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/SethMacFarlane/status/1881825910040702979" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on X this week</a></span>. “First-rate teacher, but I never quite followed that one.” The joke isn’t that Peter is all of a sudden being an erudite critic as the family prepares to drown from his latest idiotic stunt. It’s just a funny-sounding bunch of words that sounds like it should mean something but actually doesn’t. </p><p><em>Family Guy </em>superfans have been trying to decipher a deeper meaning for years, with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/170hlyc/the_family_guy_meme_of_the_godfather_insists_upon/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/170hlyc/the_family_guy_meme_of_the_godfather_insists_upon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">discussions perennially sprouting up</a></span> on forums, subreddits, and social media. Sometimes the phrase just starts trending as users riff while passing idle moments gazing at their phones. Even now, people still maintain that Peter was on to something and they know exactly what he meant. </p><p>“This is why I did not like Jackson’s <em>Lord of the Rings</em>,” one person responded. “It slaps you in the face and shouts ‘This is an epic masterpiece! Appreciate it!’ I did not. He learned and toned it down a bit for the sequels.” What? </p><p>“My interpretation of ‘it insists upon itself’ is, when you’re watching it, you get the feeling that one of the intents behind the film was, ‘This is SUPPOSED to be good,’” wrote another. “There are many ways that you can try to be good without trying to be good, namely bucking trends. Insisting upon itself means it hit all the notes a ‘good’ movie “should.’”</p><p>The episode 77 gag ends with Peter revealing he hasn’t even finished <em>The Godfather</em> and prefers 1986's <em>The Money Pit </em>starring Tom Hanks and Shelley Long instead. The punchline is that movie sucks, too. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But I feel like this last movie, they did such a great job of balancing the two, so if they continue on their pattern, my guess is they’ll continue to do that. I think it does lend something to it. It definitely takes it out of a video game, and really helps ground it into a more real world situation, if that makes sense. So, like I said, I feel like they really did a great job of balancing, and could they keep adding more and more characters? For sure, there’s definitely enough characters to go around. But I think they’ll keep it with both. But what do I know? They don’t tell me anything.</p></blockquote><p>Personally, I would be really bummed if the movies left behind the human characters entirely.
