              <p>Black Friday is just around the corner, and early deals are already coming in hot. This is a great time to grab both the essentials and big-ticket items you have been keeping an eye on, without paying the full price. Those looking for a powerful tablet that can turn into a full-fledged Windows laptop when needed should consider the Microsoft Surface Pro, especially now that it’s going for a lot less on Amazon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5579/">The 2024 model of this machine typically retails for $2,100, but you can now snag it for $1,550 after a nice 26% discount.</a> This discount applies to the Platinum model and is available to both Prime and non-Prime members. It’s also one of the steepest price drops we have seen on this model, but we’re not expecting it to last long. It’s best to grab yours before the price shoots back up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5579/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Screen, Plus All-Day Battery Life</h2>
<p>It’s slightly bigger than most tablets out there. You’re getting a 13-inch OLED touchscreen display that delivers brilliant visuals with exceptional color accuracy in both bright and dim settings. Your favorite shows will come to life, and even gaming will feel immersive. Touchscreen makes it easy to navigate; you can swipe, scroll, pinch, sketch, and even type with ease.</p>
<p>The tablet also comes with a built-in stand at the back, which makes it easy to prop the screen up however you like. Working on the go? Stand it upright. Going through a long, boring document? Use it as a notebook. Feeling a bit creative? Lay it flat on the table to paint or sketch. You can also add the Surface Pro Flex keyboard (which is sold separately) to your setup and turn it into a laptop when needed.</p>



<p>Performance-wise, you’ve got a Snapdragon X Elite processor with 12 cores. It’s powerful enough to handle all your heavy-duty tasks like content creation, video production, multitasking, and more. The 32GB RAM makes sure you don’t experience any frustrating slowdowns as you work, while the massive 1TB SSD offers plenty of space to store all your photos, videos, and files with ease.</p>
<p>Copilot+ integration makes your everyday tasks a breeze. You can use it to ask questions, get help with studies, generate art using a simple prompt, and even enjoy better video calls with improved lighting and real-time subtitles. This 2-in-1 tablet also won’t give up on you in the middle of a busy day, as the battery life is designed to last up to 14 hours on a single charge.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>is so focused on its single-player story that you might have forgotten the RPG has a competitive mode like most other </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games. This four-player versus mode pits you and the other trainers against one another in a race to see who can defeat the most monsters in a short amount of time. Even if you’re not a competitive person, you might still be playing this mode to try and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-dimension-dlc-raichu-ranked-2000625708"><span>unlock some of the Mega Stones gated behind it</span></a><span>. So you want it to be fair, right? Well, it sounds like the mode is being overrun by hackers who are cheating their way to victory.</span></p>   <p><span>I don’t play much of </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s multiplayer myself, so the first time I was clued into the hacking epidemic was through a video on TikTok that showed a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolutions-best-worst-designs-legends-z-a-2000625459"><span>Mega Garchomp</span></a><span> repeatedly using its powerful ground-type attack Earthquake without any cooldowns. Because there was no gap in between these devastating area-of-effect moves, its trainer racked up points on the scoreboard so quickly that there was no way anyone else could catch up.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>What I didn’t realize at the time was that this has become so widespread that </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>creators are weighing in and providing their own footage of rigged online matches. Some of the possible hacks might not be that recognizable to the untrained eye. AustinJohnPlays has an </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bAqhVep_5dc"><span>extensive video</span></a><span> on several hacked Pokémon he and others have encountered online, though not all of the exploits are as damning as a Garchomp with no cooldowns.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>For example, he shows a Lucario who seems to have been captured with a Poké Ball that isn’t available in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>. This doesn’t give anyone a competitive advantage but it’s an example of how some people are clearly modding the game in various ways. Some are advantageous in competitive play, like someone having an </span><a href="https://x.com/amiosi/status/1986910946556535092?s=20"><span>Alpha Xerneas</span></a><span>, a larger, more powerful form of a Legendary Pokémon that is only obtainable once in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>and not as an Alpha. Clearly, some players are up to hacked shenanigans and taking these unobtainable Pokémon online.</span></p>

  <p><span>Some of the hacks AustinJohnPlays highlights might seem harmless, such as some players changing their in-game trainer ID card images to real photos, but when you see there’s an astronomical gap between their online scores and those of regular players, it’s probably safe to assume they’re also messing with the stats, movesets, and properties of their Pokémon.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>At the moment, </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>doesn’t have any kind of reporting or blocking feature, so these hackers are running around in competitive battles, spamming moves and using Pokémon they shouldn’t be able to access. We’ve reached out to The Pokémon Company for comment on the situation and will update this story if we hear back.</span></p>

              <p>Grabbing a powerful, sturdy laptop from a known brand doesn’t have to put a dent in your wallet. We’re spotting plenty of early Black Friday deals dropping in left, right, and center across different retailers. Amazon, specifically, is offering a wide range of high-end laptops for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5578/">For instance, the 15-inch Dell Inspiron 3535 touchscreen laptop is currently sitting at just $800 at the retailer, which is a massive 64% off its retail price of $2,200.</a> It’s packed with tons of useful features that are sure to support you during busy workdays and even make those late-night entertainment sessions a lot more fun. Alongside the direct discount, you’re also getting several handy accessories thrown in for free, including pre-installed Windows 11 Pro. The offer, however, is only around for a limited time, so it’s best to get your orders in sooner rather than later.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5578/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful Processor to Work, Stream, and Game Easily</h2>
<p>The laptop runs on an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U processor, delivering impressive performance that even outpaces Intel’s i7-1355U in most competing models. Paired with AMD Radeon Graphics, the machine is more than capable of handling everyday work, browsing, streaming, and even light gaming without slowing down.</p>
<p>There’s 32 GB of RAM to keep things running smoothly. It makes using demanding applications, as well as multitasking, a breeze. You will be able to work with different programs at the same time, take video calls, create presentations, push some creative boundaries, hop through tabs, and more; without a hint of lag. Best of all, storing everything locally won’t be an issue either. Dell Inspiron 3535 packs a massive 1TB SSD that offers enough space to house a ton of high-resolution photos, videos, programs, and even games without feeling limited. Plus, SSDs ensure fast boot/load times, so you won’t have to wait long to get started.</p>



<p>Display-wise, you’re covered with a modest 15.6-inch Full HD (1920×1080) touchscreen. Its narrow border maximizes the overall space, while the built-in Dell ComfortView technology keeps the screen easy on your eyes. Touch support means you don’t have to limit yourself to the trackpad or the mouse to navigate. When you’re not in the mood to press buttons, simply use your fingers directly on the screen to scroll long documents, swipe through photos, sketch, and even take notes!</p>
<p>Some other features that deserve a mention include the 720p HD webcam, ergonomic lift-hinge keyboard, Wi-Fi 5, and Bluetooth 5.0. All things considered, this laptop is great for work, studies, and even casual use.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="426">Spring cleaning is too far away. You need to stay on top of it all year long. Tidying up once a week keeps things manageable, and with the right tool, it doesn’t have to feel like a chore. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5577/">Right now, Amazon has the Dyson V9 Motorbar cordless vacuum on sale for a whopping 55% off, dropping the price from $600 down to just $270.</a> That’s a $340 savings — not bad for one of the best vacuums in the game.</p>
<p data-start="428" data-end="887">The Dyson V9 Motorbar is designed to make cleaning easier and actually kind of satisfying. Weighing in at just 4.6 pounds, it’s lightweight, ergonomic, and easy to maneuver around the house. Whether you’re tackling the floors, reaching up to dust the top of your curtains, or squeezing into tricky corners, this thing moves effortlessly with you. It works on just about any surface from hardwood and tile to carpet and transitions smoothly between them.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5577/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="889" data-end="1212">Need to clean a tight area? The Dyson V9 can quickly transform into a handheld vacuum, making it super versatile. You can take it outside to clean your car, tidy up the couch, or get crumbs out of those hard-to-reach crevices in the kitchen. It’s powerful enough for the big jobs yet compact enough for the quick ones.</p>
<p data-start="1214" data-end="1546">Since it’s cordless, you won’t have to deal with the constant unplug-replug routine as you move from room to room. The rechargeable battery gives you up to 40 minutes of run time, which is more than enough to handle most homes. Once you’re done, just dock it on the wall-mounted charger and let it power back up for next time.</p>
<p data-start="1548" data-end="1756">Emptying the bin is simple too. No need to get your hands dirty; just pull the release handle over a trash can, and the bottom pops open to drop out all the debris. It’s quick, clean, and easy.</p>


<h2>Hassle-free Hair Control</h2>
<p data-start="1758" data-end="2078">And if you’re dealing with pets (or just a lot of hair), the Dyson V9 Motorbar really shines. It includes a hair screw tool with a clever conical design that prevents long hairs from getting caught, wrapped up around the brush. That means less maintenance and more effective cleaning on pet beds, car seats, stairs, and couches.</p>
<p data-start="2080" data-end="2274" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">If you’ve been putting off cleaning because it feels like too much work, maybe it’s time to get a vacuum that actually makes it easy.. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5577/">Right now, the Dyson V9 Motorbar is more than half off, sitting at just $270 for a limited time.</a></p>
