            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is the newest entry in one of Nintendo’s longest-running franchises, and it’s a rip-roaring good time for fans eager to destroy everything in their paths. However, players only control Donkey Kong this time around, with his usual sidekicks like Diddy and Dixie taking on supporting roles as non-playable characters. What does that mean for the prospect of co-op, though? Let’s talk about it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,196646,196452" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h876189"><a id=""></a>Does <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> even have co-op?</h2><p>If you’re looking to play <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> with a friend or family member, I’ve got some exciting news: <strong>The game features a co-op feature</strong>! One other player can join up and help you beat levels, but it just might not be in the way that you think. But what can you do with it? </p><p><strong>Co-op in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> doesn’t split the screen and give a second player full control of their own DK-like hero in the game world.</strong> Instead, it allows them to control Donkey Kong’s adorable companion Pauline as she rides along his shoulder. Because of this, the second player is rather limited in their moveset, not getting to experience the rolling, punching, or general sense of momentum that comes from playing as the game’s titular star.</p><p>However, that doesn’t mean that Pauline is useless. She’s anything but! While controlling Pauline, <strong>the second player can copy materials around a level, then shout that material at enemies or obstacles to deal damage</strong>. This can help with clearing paths, and it’s especially helpful for dishing out damage to bosses.</p><p>You can play <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> via local co-op or online. Even cooler, <strong>by using GameShare, you can temporarily allow your friend or family member (especially young children) to join your game with their own Switch or Switch 2, even if they don’t own the game themselves</strong>. Whoever’s controlling Pauline also doesn’t have to worry about abilities cooling down. They can spam away, which can make the game even more fun and chaotic. Like many Nintendo games, this opens up the door to a lot of fun play opportunities and quirky moments of discovery. It’s rad as hell.</p><p><br>While the co-op mode in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is a little limited when compared to other fully fledged co-op games, it’s still a neat way for youngsters or casual gamers to join in the fun. Whether you’re flying solo or bringing a pal along for the ride, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is available now for Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-co-op-support-gameshare-pauline-1851787349]]></content:encoded>

It brought with it its many, often aggravating, mini-games, and by virtue of now being on a more open platform, the potential for modders to expand what we can do with a modern take on such a classic setting and cast of characters. One modder has taken to Reddit to show off a fun little project that replaces Cloud and Aerith with Squall and Rinoa from <em>Final Fantasy VIII</em>. It’s clearly a work in progress, but it sure is cool-looking! </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196572" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: A Rebirth, A Remake, And A Remaster" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="94" data-playlist="196572,196766,196411" data-current="196572"><div><p>The Week In Games: A Rebirth, A Remake, And A Remaster</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196572/196572_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22127.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Reddit user ReforgedStudio recently shared <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyVIII/comments/1mam69g/squall_rinoa_mods_for_ff7r/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyVIII/comments/1mam69g/squall_rinoa_mods_for_ff7r/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyVIII/comments/1mbexoo/squall_rinoa_mods_for_ff7_rebirth_mods_are_still/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyVIII/comments/1mbexoo/squall_rinoa_mods_for_ff7_rebirth_mods_are_still/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posts</a></span> showing off Rinoa and her BF Squall in various scenes from the 2024 remake of <em>FF7</em>.

And you know what, I think <em>FF8</em> might’ve been an even better candidate for a remake project that fools around with possible multiple timelines and recurring events. </p><p>I’ll defend the <em>FF7</em> remake project’s silly little narrative that sorta implies there are multiple versions of the same events of the original game’s timeline happening all at once, but really, <em>FF8</em>’s narrative was made for such a retelling. Why? Well, I’ll have to spoil a 26-year old game to explain that. </p><figure id="" data-id="97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-recommend-id="image://97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="176" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-recommend-id="image://97ff336391ae4b9df780dab87a54f9f0" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="176" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Like any classic <em>FF</em> game, <em>FF8</em> had multiple layers of plot twists. After finding out that Squall and crew all grew up together in an orphanage before their bonds with the summoned Guardian Forces drained their memories, we also learn that the very existence of Squall’s mercenary group, SeeD, was created after a sorceress traveled back in time to bestow Squall with the task of eliminating sorceress Ultimecia, who sought to do some funny business with time, collapsing it in on itself or something (sounds an awful lot like Sephiroth’s goals in <em>Rebirth</em>, come to think of it). </p><p>What this boils down to is this: <em>FF8</em> is a story of meddling with the past, literally, to change the future. </p><figure id="" data-id="c97a5578199bc488b83b4cefbe2ce43d" data-recommend-id="image://c97a5578199bc488b83b4cefbe2ce43d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="607" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rinoa and Squall look out over the city of Kalm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rinoa and Squall look out over the city of Kalm." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / ReforgedStudio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c97a5578199bc488b83b4cefbe2ce43d" data-recommend-id="image://c97a5578199bc488b83b4cefbe2ce43d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="607" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rinoa and Squall look out over the city of Kalm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So not only is time travel native to the lore of <em>FF8</em>’s setting, but the theme of recurring events would make for a much more natural remake built on that premise. <em>FF7 </em>does have themes of spirits and the flow of energy across time and space, but what the remake project does with it is a <em>bit</em> of a stretch. </p><p>And hey, maybe then we can finally all admit that Rinoa <em>is</em> Ultimecia, regardless of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Forum:Rinoa-Ultimecia_Theory&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Forum:Rinoa-Ultimecia_Theory" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what some guy said</a></span>.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ff7-rebirth-remake-ff8-cloud-aerith-tifa-squall-rinoa-1851787335]]></content:encoded>

Thankfully, update 1.5 introduces a new money-making method: Hunting! Now you can hunt and skin mutants for rare resources, like fangs, tusks, and tentacles, that you can sell off to earn a buck.

And now other people. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196918" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why You'll Fall In Love With This Indie Horror Romance Mashup" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="196918,196358,195410" data-current="196918"><div><p>Why You'll Fall In Love With This Indie Horror Romance Mashup</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196918/196918_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22475.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Hey guys! Totally normal update to the game. Nothing to see here,” reads the intro to <em>Peak</em>’s latest v1.10.a patch. Scroll down to the new feature section and you’ll see what developer Aggro Crab is talking about. “Added cannibalism,” reads the update’s only major note. How does cannibalism work in<em> Peak</em>, you ask?</p><p>Well, once your stamina meter fills up with enough hunger, your character will now start to see other players as rotisserie chickens like a 1940s cartoon. The effect comes and goes, like your character is hallucinating. If players hold down the eat button for long enough, the other character will turn into a skeleton, die, and lose all their stuff. Your stamina meter, on the other hand, will be completely restored.</p><p>Aggro Crab previously <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1940498163875696969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1940498163875696969%7Ctwgr%5E0eb9d1fcce8ea4f12863e8a8d2998ef7cec75dbc%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkinja.com%2Fembed%2Finset%2Fiframe%3Fautosize%3D1id%3Dtwitter-1940498163875696969&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1940498163875696969?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1940498163875696969%7Ctwgr%5E0eb9d1fcce8ea4f12863e8a8d2998ef7cec75dbc%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkinja.com%2Fembed%2Finset%2Fiframe%3Fautosize%3D1id%3Dtwitter-1940498163875696969" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">threatened</a></span> to add cannibalism to <em>Peak </em>at the beginning of the month. At the time, some fans asked the team to work on bug fixes instead. The game is still in Early Access, and players encounter frequent technical issues. </p><p>The latest patch does address some of those problems. One of those is a fall damage bug where players were dying after only falling short distances, usually have repeatedly spamming the lung button. Performance is also apparently more consistent. “It was the dang wildflowers,” writes Aggro Crab. It’s still working on recreating other common problems on its end before issuing additional fixes, however. <br></p><p>In the meantime, cannibalism is a perfect encapsulation of why players have flocked to <em>Peak</em> since it launched in June. It’s not because they <em>wanted</em> to eat their friends per se, but cannibalism now being a thing in the game adds to the unexpected chaos and viral screams that have made it a hit social experiment so far. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/peak-cannibalism-patch-notes-bug-fixes-steam-1851787299]]></content:encoded>
