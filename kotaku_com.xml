              <p>Another AA publisher is hanging on for dear life. Amazon continues to flee AAA gaming like it didn’t just make $77 billion in net income last year. And a $20 million fine on Reddit shows why the scourge of online age-verification requirements has become such a messy fight. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. Were you waiting for the right time to check out <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>? It was a lot of fun and <a href="https://x.com/TeamNINJAStudio/status/2026688643667214432">is about to get new DLC</a>.</p> <p>I’m still trying to read the finely crumbled tea leaves in the new CEO of Xbox’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/asha-sharma-xbox-future-plans-roadmap-2000673378">first big interview since taking over</a>. She promises AI won’t displace creativity and that nothing is off the table in terms of a rethink. But she’s also waiting to complete a listening tour before deciding what to change. Matt Booty, meanwhile, promises first-party development remains a key pillar of Microsoft Gaming, including small indie games like Double Fine’s <em>Keeper</em>. Only one thing is for certain: Xbox’s Major Nelson is <a href="https://x.com/majornelson/status/2026423036908618209">ready to report back for duty</a>.</p>

 <h2>Nacon has some overdue bills</h2> <p>The French publisher announced it doesn’t currently have enough cash to pay its debts, leading it to file for insolvency, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nacon-files-for-insolvency-says-its-assessing-all-possible-solutions-to-continue-running/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a>. It says the “procedure will enable the company to continue its business, renegotiate its debts, and develop a credible and effective continuation plan.” It recently released the underwhelming <i>Styx: Blades of Greed</i> and is preparing for the launch of the troubled RPG sequel <em>Greedfall 2</em> in March.</p> <p>Last year it published <em>Hell Is Us</em>, a grim but novel Soulslike that received a fair amount of praise but not much wider attention. It follows an AWOL military operative searching for his family in a war-torn country infested with supernatural beings. Unlike most modern games, it eschewed clear objectives and quest markers, which some found refreshing and others found tedious.</p>

 <p>Nacon was also set to publish <i>Terminator: Survivors</i> last year but the game was unexpectedly delayed indefinitely. The survival shooter also dropped its plans for Early Access and multiplayer co-op.</p> <h2>Amazon abandon’s <em>Forza Horizon</em> director’s new open-world game</h2> <p>UK developer Maverick Games is no longer working with Amazon, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/amazon-abandons-its-open-world-driving"><em>The Game Business</em> reports</a>. The studio was cofounded in 2022 by former <em>Forza Horizon</em> creative director Mike Brown to make a AAA narrative-led game, with the tech giant signed on to publish. It’s unclear what will happen if the team doesn’t find a new partner. “Development of our debut title continues to progress as strongly as planned,” Maverick Games said. “We’re in active dialogue with partners who share our long-term ambition for the IP and look forward to sharing more later this year.”</p>

 <h2>Xbox cloud gaming gets an upgrade on console</h2> <p>“We’re now rolling out up to 1440p, higher bitrate streaming for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members, delivering sharper visuals and more responsive gameplay across supported titles and regions,” reads a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/02/25/february-xbox-update-1440p-streaming-rog-xbox-ally-updates-and-more/">new post on Xbox Wire</a>. A bunch of updates have also been rolled out to the Xbox PC gaming app to make navigation feel more responsive.</p> <h2><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> lawsuit gets dismissed</h2> <p>Filed earlier this year, it accused Hasbro executives of misleading investors about the sustainability of the card game’s profits and alleged that overprinting was happening despite the known harm it would do to the brand. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/mtg-hasbro-2026-lawsuit-magic-card-overproduction/"><em>Polygon</em> reports</a> it was voluntarily withdrawn while another shareholder lawsuit continues. Hasbro previously said the claims had no merit.</p>

 <h2>Reddit gets fined nearly $20 million over child privacy issues</h2> <p>UK regulators said the company shirked its responsibility to know which of its users were 13 or younger and handle any personal information collected accordingly (via <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyx0xggepjo">the <em>BBC</em></a>). It’s one of the regulatory pressures leading companies like Reddit, Discord, and others to implement AI age checks which are in turn making users mad. “The ICO’s insistence that we collect more private information on every UK user is counterintuitive and at odds with our strong belief in our users’ online privacy and safety,” a spokesperson for Reddit said. The company will appeal the ruling.</p> <h2>20 years later, modders are still trying to “fix” <em>Morrowind</em></h2> <p>A great new feature at <em>Ars Technica</em> details the long-running efforts of <em>Elder Scrolls</em> fans to make <em>Morrowind</em>‘s world feel as vast as that of its predecessor, <em>Daggerfall</em>. The result is multiple groups of modders spanning decades working together to try and piece together all of Tamriel in the 2002 PC game.</p> <p>“We have some really wonderful people who are the old guard that feel like they are the comfortable welders, and they’re all very wise,” college-age modder Meadhainnigh said. “But even in the newest editions, we’re not here because we think that it’s all going to be done within our lifetimes. We like to joke about 2090 and about raising our children to work on the project. We just like to look at the next release, and that tends to be exciting enough to get us going.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/charity-steam-pc-games-bundle-best-deal-2026-fps-cultic-selaco-boltgun-2000673339">This boomer shooter bundle for charity is the best gaming deal of the week</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/tokyo-scramble-switch-2-worst-game-2026-2000673341">A new worst game of 2026 has arrive and it’s a Switch 2 exclusive&nbsp;</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/discord-delays-controversial-age-verification-requirements-2000673309">Discord delays its age-verification rollout but blames the backlash on people misunderstanding the details</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout 4 Is Shockingly Solid On Switch 2 Unlike Skyrim]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-switch-2-port-60-fps-40-30-performance-review-skyrim-bethesda-2000673651</link>
            <guid>1446271</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition</em> is out now on the Nintendo Switch 2. And after the rough release of <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-skyrim-port-switch-2-upgrade-free-release-date-trailer-dlc-2000651683"><em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2 late last year</a>, I was nervous about how Bethesda’s post-apocalyptic RPG would fare on Nintendo’s hybrid machine. Turns out, I had nothing to fear as <em>Fallout 4</em> on Switch 2 is totally solid. Not perfect, but pretty damn good.</p> <p>Launched on February 24, <em>Fallout 4</em> on Switch 2 is the first mainline <em>Fallout</em> game to grace a Nintendo platform. (No, <em>Fallout Shelter</em> and <em>Fallout</em> pinball don’t count.) This version of the 2015 open-world blockbuster RPG contains all the DLC as well as a ton of extra Creation Club content, too. It also launched with not one, but three different framerate options, including a 60FPS option, <a href="https://kotaku.com/skyrim-elder-scrolls-switch-2-port-60fps-30fps-compare-price-input-lag-fix-patch-2000652156">which was lacking when <em>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em> launched on Switch 2 last year.</a> And thankfully, according to many online who have played the new port,<em> Fallout 4</em> on Switch 2 performs very well.</p>

  <h2><em>Fallout 4</em>‘s visual options on Switch 2</h2> <p><em>Fallout 4</em> on Switch 2 includes three modes: a 60FPS performance option, a 30FPS visual mode, and a 40FPS visual mode. Online testing shows that in both handheld and portable, <em>Fallout 4</em> mostly sticks to these target framerates.</p> <p>There is one caveat: the 60FPs option can look really blurry in some areas. This is due to the lower resolution that <em>Fallout 4</em> can reach in its performance mode, especially in busy, outdoor areas. On the console’s portable screen, however, the 60FPS mode looks fine enough. Meanwhile, the 30FPS option offers a similarly stable experience, but with much sharper textures and better visual effects.</p>

 <p>But the best mode is probably the 40FPS option that takes advantage of the Switch 2’s 120hz screen. It will also work on a TV that supports 120hz in docked mode. <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-7-and-village-are-damn-near-perfect-switch-2-ports-2000673230">40FPS has become a favorite of mine</a> this console generation as it offers up crisp visuals, yet provides a noticeably smoother gameplay experience, which is exactly what you’ll get in <em>Fallout 4.</em></p>

 <p>Regardless of what mode you pick, the fact that <em>Fallout 4</em> on Switch 2 even launched with all these options and they all mostly work is a huge improvement over <em>Skyrim’s</em> launch on the same console. That thing was a mess and was locked to 30FPS, though it has since been patched and dramatically improved.</p> <p>Many Switch 2 owners are hoping Bethesda does the same with <em>Fallout 4</em> and adds gyro controls and mouse support, something that this port is currently lacking. I don’t really care about those features, but it would be nice to see them added in the future. Still, this is a great port of <em>Fallout 4</em> that gives me hope for future Bethesda games on Switch 2. There is one area in which <em>Fallout 4</em> is worse than <em>Skyrim</em> on Switch 2, though. <em><a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/58034-nintendo-eshop-file-size-round-up-for-feb-22nd-2026-fallout-4-resident-evil-titles">Fallout 4</a></em><a href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/58034-nintendo-eshop-file-size-round-up-for-feb-22nd-2026-fallout-4-resident-evil-titles"> takes up 61GB</a> of space compared to <em>Skyrim’s</em> 53GB install size. So be prepared to delete some stuff if you’re already struggling to find space on your Switch 2. <a href="https://kotaku.com/target-employee-shows-pc-game-memory-part-price-increases-shortage-ram-ssd-2000663863">Or buy a new memory card…if you can afford it right now.</a></p>

              <p>If you randomly received a bunch of test messages from the Xbox mobile app today, you didn’t do anything wrong. Many others, including myself, received the random spam messages this afternoon.</p> <p>On February 25 at around 12:30 PM Eastern time, people with the Xbox app installed on their phone began receiving multiple test notifications in quick succession. I received eight such test messages, and all of mine featured the icon for <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em> for some odd reason. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nicolefacee.bsky.social/post/3mfp7awat4s2h">Others online shared screenshots</a> that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/numbereighty3.bsky.social/post/3mfpakbuot223">showed even more messages</a> than I received. Each message contained the following text:</p> <blockquote><p>“This is a dummy message sent via Braze, please capture a screenshot once you receive it. This should take you to the recently added gallery.”</p></blockquote> <p>A quick Google search seems to indicate that <a href="https://www.braze.com/product/overview">Braze is some sort of cross-platform social media and digital messaging platform</a> used by a lot of different big companies. So it seems likely that the Xbox app is using Braze or is switching over to it, and something went wrong and now a bunch of people have random test messages spamming their home screen.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Xbox for comment. We only sent one email. Not seven.</p> <p>The timing of this odd tech snafu couldn’t be worse for Xbox as the company is going through a big and <a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059">reportedly messy shake-up, with longtime CEO Phil Spencer stepping down last week</a> and a new <a href="https://kotaku.com/asha-sharma-xbox-future-plans-roadmap-2000673378">AI-focused CEO taking over in his place</a>. Some, including myself, have suggested this is the end of Xbox as we know it. That it might be dead. But I guess a dozen random messages in the afternoon proves it’s still alive. At least part of it.</p> <p><b>Update: 2/25/26, 2:15 p.m. ET: </b>An Xbox spokesperson pointed <em>Kotaku</em> to<a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/2026732606612480313"> a post from the official Xbox account on Twitter</a>. The company says the issue is “resolved now” and apologized for the spam. No explanation of what actually happened was given.</p>

 <p>“The Xbox App got a little too enthusiastic with test notifications today. That’s on us, but it’s resolved now. Thanks for understanding, and we apologize for flooding your notifications,” said Xbox on social media.</p>

              <p>If you’re a <em>Pokémon</em> fan, you have no doubt experienced the <a href="https://kotaku.com/all-the-big-pokemon-games-ranked-from-worst-to-best-1849984595">mainline games</a> with all their catching, battling, and being the very best like no one ever was. But the series has a wide selection of spin-off games that span different genres and subject matter. Even if you’ve only ever played the RPGs, there’s probably something for you in the spin-offs simply because there’s such a wide range of experiences to be found. So what better to do with an eclectic collection of <em>Pokémon </em>games than to come up with a qualitative ranking to decide which is the best? We’re just days away from the series’ <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-where-when-to-watch-generation-10-switch-2000671968">30th anniversary stream</a> where we’ll learn what The Pokémon Company is up to in 2026, so to get ourselves in the mood, we’ve rounded up 25 of the most notable <em>Pokémon </em>spin-off games, putting them in order from real stinkers to some of the most important games and sub-series in the franchise.</p> <p><em>This ranking was originally published in 2023.</em></p>
