            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony has officially revealed the long-rumored <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-open-world-7th-anniversary-1851293448"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> MMO spin-off</a> it’s making with <em>Guild Wars</em> publisher NCSoft. It’s called <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em>, it looks a lot like <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and it’s not coming to PlayStation 5.</p>

 <p>Announced during South Korea’s G-Star gaming convention, <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> was developed in partnership with PlayStation studio Guerrilla Games and centers around big, raid-like boss fights against the franchise’s detailed assortment of futuristic prehistoric robots. Instead of following the story of franchise protagonist Aloy, players will create their own custom characters and team-up to take down their mechanical quarries across PC and mobile.</p>

 <p>There’s no release date yet but we did get a 10-minute deep-dive into the RPG’s gameplay and development backstory:</p>  <p>You play as a machine hunter in the Deadlands (inspired by Arizona and New Mexico) who hails from one of four tribes: the Nora, Tenakth, Utaru, or Oseram. It’s unclear exactly how many other players you’ll be able to team up with or how seamless the world will be as you explore, but early footage teased several different biomes, from fire-ravaged deserts to icy tundra. Players have ground and aerial mounts they can utilize for exploration and combat and there’s one moment in the trailer where players are galloping across a field alongside a mechanical herd as well as one of the series’ iconic Tallnecks.</p>

 <p>I have no idea how it’s supposed to run on phones but it looks great.</p> <p>“<em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em> is a full-fledged MMORPG that NCSoft has built specifically for mobile,” Guerilla Games studio director Jan-Bart van Beek said during the video. “You’re sharing the frontier with thousands of other players, sometimes working together to take down machines and other times competing with rival tribes or fighting over resources, and that mix of cooperation and competition creates moments that you could never script.”</p>

  <p>A gameplay trailer gives a better sense of how exactly combat will work and it certainly looks a lot like <em>Monster Hunter</em>. Players will hack away at enemies, targeting weaknesses and damaging specific parts of them over the course of battle. But it’s not just mashing buttons. Players will also be able to make use of carefully placed traps and grappling hook-like pullcasters to sling-shot themselves around the battlefield and onto enemies’ backs. Based on the UI, it looks like there might even be some sort of stagger mechanic.</p>

 <p>NCSoft executive producer Sunggu Lee said during the developer interview that <em>Horizon Steel Frontiers</em><em>‘ </em>emphasis will be on teamwork and strategy. As an MMORPG coming out of South Korea built primarily for smartphones, I also expect it to be a heavily monetized XP grind. If the company can make it feel more like a coop Horizon adventure than a second job min-maxing spreadsheets, <em>Horizon</em> meets <em>Monster Hunter</em> has the potential to be really cool. But a lot of that will come down to how smooth and rewarding the moment-to-moment combat looks and feels.</p> <p>Sony is currently all-in on the <em>Horizon</em> franchise. In addition to Guerrilla teasing a third mainline entry in the existing open-world RPG series, there were rumors of a live service multiplayer spin-off based on project footage from 2020 that <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-forbidden-west-aloy-sequel-burning-shores-ps5-1850369063">leaked several years ago</a>. It’s unclear whether that was abandoned, became <em>Steel Frontiers</em>, or remains another multiplayer project in the mix at Sony. There’s also the <em>Horizon</em> movie that’s currently <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-movie-date-sony-tencent-lawsuit-last-us-2000636587">slated to begin filming next year</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/galaxy-buds-3-pro-with-ai-features-are-going-for-pennies-amazon-sets-a-new-all-time-low-2000643596</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/galaxy-buds-3-pro-with-ai-features-are-going-for-pennies-amazon-sets-a-new-all-time-low.1351990/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Premium wireless earbuds have become one of those purchases where the options feel endless and the prices keep climbing higher. You’ve got Apple’s AirPods Pro at $249, Google’s Pixel Buds Pro at similar pricing, and Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro normally sitting at the same $249 mark. The specs all start to blur together after a while, and trying to figure out which pair actually delivers the best value can feel overwhelming. Price becomes a major factor when everything seems comparable on paper, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">right now Amazon has dropped the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro to just $174, down from their usual $249</a>. This is a new all-time low that you won’t even find on Samsung’s official website.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro <strong>pack AI-powered features</strong> that are constantly adapting to your environment throughout the day. Samsung’s sound optimization technology analyses the shape of your ear canal to adjust audio output for balanced sound that matches your unique anatomy. This happens automatically in the background, so you’re not always tweaking equalizer settings and wondering if you’re missing out on certain frequencies. The <strong>AI continuously monitors ambient noise levels and adjusts the intensity of active noise cancellation</strong> to match and ramps up when you step onto a busy street and dialing back when you’re in quieter spaces.</p>



<h2>Adaptive Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>Active noise cancellation on the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro works through a <strong>combination of external and internal microphones</strong> that capture ambient sound and generate inverse sound waves to cancel unwanted noise. The technology proves especially effective at eliminating low-frequency rumble from airplane engines, subway cars, or air conditioning units. You’ll notice the difference immediately on your commute as traffic noise fades into the background and you can finally hear podcast dialogue clearly without cranking the volume to dangerous levels.<strong> Transparency mode</strong> flips this system around and pips in external sounds when you need to hear announcements, have quick conversations, or stay aware of your surroundings while walking.</p>



<p>Samsung redesigned the fit for the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro to address one of the most common complaints in its predecessors: This <strong>new ergonomic contour sits more securely in your ear</strong> without creating pressure points that cause discomfort after an hour or two of wear. You get three different ear tip sizes in the box, and the companion app includes a fit test that plays audio to verify you’ve created a proper seal. Getting this seal right is enormously important for both sound quality and noise cancellation effectiveness, since even small gaps let sound leak in and bass frequencies escape.</p>
<p>The <strong>Bluetooth connectivity</strong> maintains stable connections for the typical range you’d expect from modern wireless earbuds, staying paired reliably when your phone is in your pocket or bag. Pairing happens quickly through Samsung’s ecosystem if you own a Galaxy phone, as the earbuds pop up automatically on screen when you open the case near your device. Android users outside the Samsung ecosystem and <strong>even iPhone owners can still pair these earbuds</strong> through standard Bluetooth settings, though they’ll miss out on some of the deeper integration features that Galaxy phone users enjoy.</p>
<p>Battery life gives you about six hours of continuous playback with active noise cancellation enabled, which will cover most daily use scenarios, like commutes, work sessions, or gym visits. With the charging case included, y<strong>ou get about 26 hours of total listening time</strong> before you’ll need to find an outlet; it also supports USB-C wired charging and wireless charging via Qi-compatible pads. With just a five-minute charge, you can attain about an hour of playback in case you are in a hurry and forget that your earbuds are dead.</p>
<p>This is one of the best deals on Samsung’s earbuds so far in 2025.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-performance-beast-from-dell-is-70-off-on-amazon-now-priced-like-a-basic-mid-range-machine-2000643568</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-performance-beast-from-dell-is-70-off-on-amazon-now-priced-like-a-basic-mid-range-machine.1351966/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Finding a laptop that can handle everything from pro-level video editing to more casual gaming means spending upwards of $3,000, and that’s something most people simply can’t justify. Everyone wants a powerful machine that doesn’t chug when the work starts to get serious but the budgetary reality most are faced with compromises. Until now. This early Black Friday deal on Amazon completely upends that equation by dropping <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5366/">the Dell Inspiron 16″ laptop (1TB SSD, 32GB DDR5 RAM, etc) from its usual $3,299 price all the way down to just $995</a>. That’s a <strong>huge 70% discount on a true performance powerhouse</strong>, and the deal isn’t even available on Dell’s own website.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5366/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>The Intel Core 7 150U processor powers this machine with the kind of processing muscle you would expect from significantly more expensive laptops. This chip has speeds up to 5.4 GHz and boasts a hybrid architecture, with <strong>10 cores split between 2 performance cores and 8 efficiency cores, all working across 12 threads</strong>. You get three separate engines inside: CPU tasks, GPU graphics, and NPU AI acceleration. In other words, it handles everything from complex spreadsheets to AI-powered applications with ease.</p>



<h2>Ideal for Daily Tasks</h2>
<p>The 32GB of DDR5 RAM changes the way you work as slowdowns that plague machines with less memory are gone. You can keep dozens of browser tabs open, run multiple Adobe Creative Suite apps at once, have multiple Excel workbooks processing data, and still switch between everything instantly. Compared to DDR4 found in older laptops, DDR5 provides faster data transfer rates which means your processor spends less time waiting for information and more actually processing your work.</p>



<p>The touchscreen features a 16-inch WQXGA display with 1920 x 1200 resolution and offers more vertical real estate compared to the usual 1080p panel. That extra height makes a difference when you code, read long documents or deal with a spreadsheet that requires a few more rows visible at once. The 300-nit brightness is sufficient for you to comfortably work in well-lit offices or near windows while the anti-glare coating prevents reflections from turning your screen into a mirror.</p>
<p>The Thunderbolt 4 port delivers transfer speeds up to 40 Gbps and means you can transfer whole project folders to external drives in seconds, rather than minutes. This same port supports dual 4K displays or a single 8K monitor, turning your laptop into a multiscreen workstation when you’re at your desk. Combined with traditional USB 3.2 ports for peripherals, HDMI for presentations, and WiFi 6E for lightning-fast wireless connections, this laptop connects to everything you need without requiring a drawer full of adapters.</p>
<p>This is one of the best laptop deals you can get right now, and it’s exclusively available at Amazon.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-episode-1-2-review-aaron-paul-critical-role-2000639678">Superhero workplace comedy game <em>Dispatch</em></a> has proven to be a big hit this year, already selling over a million copies since launching in October. And the fandom around the game is ravenous, with many players deeply invested in the narrative-driven adventure game’s romances. This caught the devs off guard, and might lead to some cut sex scenes returning in some form.</p> <p><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/dispatch-romance-deleted-sex-scenes-telltale-developers-exclusive-interview">In a new interview with <em>Inverse</em>,</a>&nbsp;<em>Dispatch</em> writer Pierre Shorette talked about how the game came together over the last few years and was asked about fans going wild over the few relationship and romance options in the superhero game developed by some former Telltale folks.</p>  <p>“I don’t know that I anticipated it to be as ravenous as it’s been,” said Shorette of the fan reaction. “It’s probably why we didn’t plan for more romance options, because we didn’t know it was going to be such a meaningful part of the experience for folks.” Shorette explained that he often defaults to romantic comedy when writing and has tried to resist this tendency, but romance was never an intentional focus of <em>Dispatch.</em> Rather, it was just one of the many parts of the game. Still, seeing the fans react to the romance and sex that exist in the game has Shorette wondering if they made a mistake.</p> <p>“We definitely cut some sex scenes. Which, in retrospect, we shouldn’t have,” Shorette told the outlet. “Maybe folks will get to see those one day.”</p> <p>“There isn’t anyone on the development team that wouldn’t have a laundry list of stuff they wish they could polish more or gotten into the game. On the writing side, our team has a bunch of darlings that had to be killed along the way. We’re still an indie studio, I think people forget that because it’s doing so well and looks so good. But because it looks good, it costs a lot per second to make this video game, and sometimes it costs things that often, with these games, is branching too.”</p> <p>Regardless, <a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-dialogue-options-chair-episode-3-golem-choice-2000640791"><em>Dispatch</em></a> has proven to be a big hit, with fans begging the devs for another season. And that might just happen. But for now, Shorette and the team at Ad Hoc Studios are just happy people like <em>Dispatch</em> so much.&nbsp; All eight episodes of <em>Dispatch</em> are out now on PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve a penchant for collecting things and not stopping, then <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><i>Arc Raiders</i></a> is either your best friend or your worst nightmare. Though it’s a shooter through and through, <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ crafting and loot system is rich with <i>stuff</i> to gather and is an essential part of the game. From deflated soccer balls to high-powered weaponry and everything in between, there’s so much junk in this game that it’s easy to trip yourself up in the labyrinthine layout of its various menus.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><i>Arc Raiders</i>: The <i>Kotaku</i> Review</a></p> <p>So I thought it only natural, from one hoar–<i>collector</i> to another, to help you out by sharing some of my approaches to managing the endless gathering in this otherwise action-packed adrenaline rush of a game.</p>

 <p>I’m taking a three-pronged approach here, addressing what I feel are the three most common pain points in inventory management.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-stella-montis-community-shredder-matriarch-2000643465#comments"><i>Arc Raiders </i>Is Getting A New Map But Players Have To Work To Unlock It</a></p>

 <p>Because here’s the secret: The inventory management and crafting meta game of <i>Arc Raiders</i> is what propels the action out there on the maps. It’s what you’re here to do: find stuff to make stuff. And so an overflowing inventory is actually an opportunity to create a little task list for yourself and thus find yourself out there in the field, possibly getting into some good fights.</p>

 <h2>Shit, my inventory’s full</h2> <p>Maybe you just got back from a raid, and you can’t accept any new materials from Scrappy because your inventory’s full. Maybe you got something cool from completing a quest and can’t use it because your inventory’s full. Maybe you can’t even use a Free Loadout because, you guessed it, your inventory’s full.</p>

 <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-field-depot-crate-off-radar-down-to-earth-2000642525">This Is The ‘Easiest’ Field Depot In <i>Arc Raiders</i></a></p> <p>If this is the case, I’m going to guess that you’re not paying that much attention to the details of your inventory’s contents. But with so many items, the idea of scrolling through that massive grid of icons might seem laborious. Fear not, for with some simple steps, we can sort this mess.</p>

 <h3>Step one: Manage your inventory stacks</h3> <figure id="attachment_2000643640" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643640"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643640">© Gif: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>You may not’ve noticed this, but <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ inventory system isn’t the most efficient at clearing space for you. For a game that’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gen-ai-nexon-eurogamer-voices-2000643436#comments">catching flack for its use of AI</a>, your inventory isn’t very artificially intelligent or well automated.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gen-ai-nexon-eurogamer-voices-2000643436"><i>Arc Raiders</i> Publisher Defends Generative AI And Says You Should Assume Everyone’s Using It</a></p> <p>Take Shotgun ammo. Everything’s arranged in a grid, with some icons representing stacks. You can stack 20 shells in a single icon. If you have more than that, you’ll end up with multiple stacks maxing out at 20 shells each. But it’s not uncommon to have multiple grid spaces taken up by stacks lower than the 20-count max. You might have a single stack of 20, then a stack of 12, then a stack of 2, taking up three spots in your inventory grid. Inefficient!</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-tips-solo-group-recycle-free-loadout-2000641174">14 Essential Tips For Getting Started In <i>Arc Raiders</i></a></p> <p>All you have to do here is drag the lower-count stacks on top of each other to free up extra grid space. Go through your items and see if there are any excess stacks taking up space and you’ll be surprised how many spaces on your grid you’ll clear.</p>

 <h3>Step two: Sell valuables and break down recyclables</h3> <p>If your inventory’s overflowing because you have a habit of collecting every damn thing you see, you might have some valuables in your inventory you need to get rid of. Honestly, I’m surprised at how many times a random valuable like a music cassette tape, rubber duck, or set of rosary beads are just chilling in the Misc. category.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-skins-cosmetics-decks-battle-pass-duos-2000643456"><i>Arc Raiders</i> Lowering Skin Prices And Issuing Refunds After Backlash</a></p> <p>These have got to go–<i>unless</i> you need them to craft something. Once again, the inventory system of <i>Arc Raiders</i> fails us. Not everything that is labeled as either recyclable or sellable is inherently made to be discarded. Pillows, for example, are valuables you can sell. But you also need them to upgrade Scrappy at the Workshop. Be sure to track any crafting projects you’re working on so you don’t accidentally sell the necessary items for it.</p>

 <p>Likewise, you should sift through your inventory in the Crafting submenu indicated by the wrench icon to recycle any junk that isn’t immediately useful to you. Like with valuables, some of these are secretly needed for Workshop upgrades, so be mindful of what you’re breaking down. Sometimes clearing out a handful of camera lenses, candle holders, radios, and rusted tools is all you need to free up space.</p> <h3>Step three: Repair and upgrade existing gear</h3> <figure id="attachment_2000643636" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643636"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643636">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>You really shouldn’t have too many duplicates of the same piece of gear in your inventory. Your guns and shields, for example, have durability meters that need to be maintained. And guns can also be upgraded to improve their functionality.</p> <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-solo-night-raid-quest-pvp-pve-2000641437">So Much Happens In A Single Hour Of <i>Arc Raiders</i></a></p> <p>One way to start clearing up space in your inventory is to tend to these needs. Repair all existing shields, make sure your guns are either at max durability or are on their way to their top upgrade tier. I also recommend crafting weapon mods and slapping them on your weapons as soon as you can.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000643637" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643637"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643637">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>All of these actions cost crafting supplies, so by tending to your existing arsenal, you very well may shrink your total inventory as craftables get consumed.</p> <h3>Bonus tip plus a cheat sheet: Craft Quick Use items and take them with you</h3> <p>This is similar to the previous tip, but I heartily recommend taking the time to craft things like smoke grenades, noisemakers, door blockers and more. Not only are these items a lot of fun and very useful on the battlefield, but crafting them consumes materials and taking them out with you frees up your inventory.</p> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> has a ton of loot and junk to collect. But thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1orrcag/oc_arc_raiders_loot_cheat_sheet_v2_keep_sell/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">the work of pRoDeeD on Reddit</a>, you can demystify a lot of this material by following along with their handy cheat sheet.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000643633" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000643633"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000643633">© Image: Embark Studios / pRoDeeD</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s available in both <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/16OcFyh5bIlYycvdBc3pBd6gteUs7Nz5D/view?usp=drive_link">PDF</a> and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1V0kuRHDu1T-iAxtoV2RYSi1SI5xBscIC/view?usp=drive_link">PNG</a> format.</p> <p>Happy collecting!</p>
