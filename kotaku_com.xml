But evidence from 2007 appeared to show a rate of 32,040 Hz on existing hardware, and by 2025 the average across several old consoles is closer to 32,076 Hz, with the fastest ones running at  32,182 Hz. What does this actually mean for the SNES itself? Well, the CPU clock which relies on a quartz crystal appears unchanged, but the faster APU means <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/03/snes-consoles-appear-to-be-getting-faster-as-they-age&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/03/snes-consoles-appear-to-be-getting-faster-as-they-age" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">music could be slightly sped up</a></span> and the general audio might be at a higher pitch.</p><figure id="" data-id="5919d1f7d3e241793af003fc61b64776" data-recommend-id="image://5919d1f7d3e241793af003fc61b64776" data-format="png" data-width="1000" data-height="752" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows SNES Hz testing data.

Would this actually let players meaningfully finish games faster, especially when it comes to speedrunning records? Cecil told <em>404 Media</em> he doesn’t think so. The time savings over an entire playthrough still probably wouldn’t amount to even an entire frame.</p><p>If the APU rates keep going up, however, it could eventually amount to a more tangible difference, especially for tool-assisted speedrun bots that fans use to decipher optimal routes for beating old games and to see what’s possible within games when the limitations of a human player are removed. And who knows, in 50 years maybe the ceramic resonator will start doing other weird things, assuming old SNES consoles still work at that point.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

No, you’re lying, of course you haven’t, which is the secret sauce that makes <em>Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii</em> such a unique, wild ride. The argument between whether ninjas or pirates were cooler is over when you can get you a game that basically does both. God, remember back in the day when the internet was full of fun arguments over who’d win between ninjas and pirates and not, “Is this AI video of the president sucking Elon Musk’s toes like he’s trying to drink from the right grail proper resistance praxis?” We used to be a society, I swear.</p><p>Anyway, point is, thanks to the good folks at Ryu Ga Gotoku, we don’t have to choose which of our wild, lawless fantasies to live out. Although, because it’s a <em>Like A Dragon</em> game, it does mean there’s all sorts of little quirks to account for that you probably wouldn’t think you’d have to deal with turning to a life of piracy. Thankfully, we’ve got you very much covered with a few starter tips to help you hoist the colors high.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3b1abfaf9d5593386c195fcc80a89e9f" data-recommend-id="image://3b1abfaf9d5593386c195fcc80a89e9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Combat in the game, with our character glowing purple." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Combat in the game, with our character glowing purple." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3b1abfaf9d5593386c195fcc80a89e9f" data-recommend-id="image://3b1abfaf9d5593386c195fcc80a89e9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Combat in the game, with our character glowing purple." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As per usual with <em>Yakuza/Like A Dragon </em>games, the opening minutes are quite generous when it comes to showing you the ropes of the combat, but even though <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>shows you how to do Majima’s air juggle combos, they don’t quite emphasize just how much of a boon it is to your entire moveset. For the first two chapters or so, use it because it’s cool. Later chapters, though—especially on those Devil King islands where there’s 100 dudes attempting to shove a cutlass up where dead men tell no tales—<strong>getting an enemy up in the air is the linchpin of your fights when it comes to creating some distance.</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="811be4fb0ffe7450bb73bf836cf8ed0f" data-recommend-id="image://811be4fb0ffe7450bb73bf836cf8ed0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Upgrade Ability screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Upgrade Ability screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="811be4fb0ffe7450bb73bf836cf8ed0f" data-recommend-id="image://811be4fb0ffe7450bb73bf836cf8ed0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Upgrade Ability screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Compared to a bunch of the other titles in the series,<em> Pirate Yakuza</em> is pretty generous early on when it comes to giving you enough money and Reputation to enhance yourself. Obviously, boosting Majima’s attacks and health are no-brainer purchases you’ll never regret, but the lure of the awesome-looking Heat attacks isn’t easy to ignore. We’re not saying don’t buy any of those, but firstly, many of the other enhancements are far more crucial (and cheaper) early on, and secondly, Heat actions are bound by highly specific situations here. A fair few are only really applicable when you’re raiding an enemy ship, in fact. If there’s a very specific combat situation/button press you find yourself in, go for it. But shop smart.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cf0b220b2a51c9447250f356bfedf124" data-recommend-id="image://cf0b220b2a51c9447250f356bfedf124" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Crew Formation screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Crew Formation screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cf0b220b2a51c9447250f356bfedf124" data-recommend-id="image://cf0b220b2a51c9447250f356bfedf124" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Crew Formation screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Once you get some shore leave in Honolulu, you’re basically going to be awash in recruits for your ship within about an hour. There’s no downside to letting everybody aboard, but when it comes to who you should squad up with, you’re gonna need to plan for the future.</p><p>Early on, Jason Rich and Masaru are gonna be permanent fixtures in your crew. You’ll get them the earliest, but their stats stay relatively strong through the entire game. More importantly, though, is that they’re the first characters who can be boosted up to level 40. The problem with a lot of the randos you find out in the world is that even the ones with high stats might cap off at level 20. Those are crewmates who you want in there for a good time, not a long time. Have a backup character you can evolve. If you can be patient, and grind a bit before continuing the main story (the Coliseum in Madlantis is perfect for this) <strong>I recommend having a crew of all lvl 40-capables before getting into the weeds of Chapter 3</strong>, where the difficulty spikes.

Most of it’s a direct copy-paste from<em> Infinite Wealth</em>, but in terms of sheer money-making potential, <strong>the bounties are the best and most reliable money maker in the game</strong>. You’ll see the pink handcuffs dotted around the map, but right off the bat, after you take down your first one and leave the bar, there’ll be a guy worth $16,000 right down the block. You’d think with that high a price tag, you’re about to face Malenia, Blade of Miquella, but in reality, the price tags tend to correspond with the amount of health they have rather than difficulty. Hell, there are bounties worth $4k that are more of a pain in the ass due to the sheer numbers of enemies. Point being, don’t be afraid to go on safari for these guys when you’re low on cash, and don’t be afraid to take on big fish.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c93bc972d3a6258148408f14ae9cdbda" data-recommend-id="image://c93bc972d3a6258148408f14ae9cdbda" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A mighty ship battle with a lot of fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A mighty ship battle with a lot of fire." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c93bc972d3a6258148408f14ae9cdbda" data-recommend-id="image://c93bc972d3a6258148408f14ae9cdbda" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A mighty ship battle with a lot of fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Of course, it wouldn’t be a proper pirate game without some great ship-to-ship combat on the high seas, and sure, you could just position your flank and fire away like a loser, but this is <em>Like A Dragon</em>, things can get so much wilder than that. For starters, yes, anyone who played <em>Assassin’s Creed Black Flag</em> will have no problem picking up on the fact that you can ram straight into other ships for massive damage, only here they’re actually boosted by fuel tanks that can t-bone other boats to pieces in a heartbeat.</p><p>The real fun begins when you start messing with weapon loadouts, where the typical pirate ship cannons can get upgraded, and in terms of bang for buck, <strong>the flamethrowers are ridiculously overpowered in the early chapters</strong>, able to melt down most enemy ships in seconds.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fa483da7085491d97a72ceebebb51ee2" data-recommend-id="image://fa483da7085491d97a72ceebebb51ee2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A map screen from the game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A map screen from the game." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa483da7085491d97a72ceebebb51ee2" data-recommend-id="image://fa483da7085491d97a72ceebebb51ee2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A map screen from the game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>About halfway through the game, you’re introduced to one of the other major threats roaming the waters around Hawaii: The Devil Kings. Once you beat their initial quest, all of their hideouts open up to be raided. It’s gonna be tempting, especially after the first too-easy ones to just take whatever’s available, and sweet baby Jesus you need to slow your roll, because the difference in difficulty from the early hideouts vs the four-skull ones is vast, without leveling up way above normal. If you’re gonna pump some time into that quest line, do yourself a favor and tackle them in order of difficulty, and don’t get too ambitious.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fb6bc49bf51e53526a004dc3f8d68da0" data-recommend-id="image://fb6bc49bf51e53526a004dc3f8d68da0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1637" data-height="921" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aiming a rocket launcher at another boat on the sea." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aiming a rocket launcher at another boat on the sea." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fb6bc49bf51e53526a004dc3f8d68da0" data-recommend-id="image://fb6bc49bf51e53526a004dc3f8d68da0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1637" data-height="921" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aiming a rocket launcher at another boat on the sea." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s never really emphasized after the brief bit of tutorial in which it’s introduced, but <strong>the rocket launcher is one of the most underrated pieces of gear in your arsenal</strong>. Yes, it requires Majima leaving the captain’s wheel to fire, but given just how much range it has, using the rockets as a bespoke sniper rifle has more utility than you think, especially later on when you start seeing ships with depth charges, and distance is much more at a premium. By that point, as well, you should have Majima’s grappling hook, which gives you a grapple point on your ship up to the crow’s nest, where you can get an even better view.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="90f4470712c33e22defb091729fbbcf7" data-recommend-id="image://90f4470712c33e22defb091729fbbcf7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The whole gang gathered together on board the pirate ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The whole gang gathered together on board the pirate ship." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="90f4470712c33e22defb091729fbbcf7" data-recommend-id="image://90f4470712c33e22defb091729fbbcf7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The whole gang gathered together on board the pirate ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The critical path of <em>Pirate Yakuza</em> will endear you plenty to your main ride-or-die characters like Jason, Noah, and Masaru, but as mentioned before, these are also the characters you’re gonna carry with you the entire game. As such, giving them priority attention above everyone else pays dividends like crazy. That’s not just because they have the best-written storylines, but they start out with such high stats that prioritizing them early generally means you can stick them in one position right from jump, and they’ll evolve faster the rest. For most of them, it means keeping them happy and fed while on the ship, and bringing them on raids. For Noah, that means taking in the optional conversations dotted around Honolulu early and often. For Noah’s tiger cat, Goro, though, that means visiting Nele Island just as early and often with the fancy pet food.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Pink and red flowers blossom like a mutated, fungal coral throughout the environment as traumatic memories are seemingly unearthed. “You took everything from me,” Hinako shouts at an unknown entity as she picks up a broken pipe to wield as a melee weapon. </p><p>“To this day, I remember the feeling of my first encounter with the strangling and oppressive atmosphere of <em>Silent Hill</em>,” project lead Okamoto wrote in a press release. “It still deeply haunts me, and it still utterly fascinates me.” He continued, “To me, the <em>Silent Hill</em> series is more than just a collection of stories, it’s a medium; an amazing, phenomenal way of exploring and experiencing a person’s heart and mind.”</p><p>There’s still no release date for <em>Silent Hill f </em>but the game won’t be a PlayStation 5 exclusive when it arrives, unlike the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake. The sequel will be multiplatform on Xbox and PC when it eventually emerges from the fog. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
