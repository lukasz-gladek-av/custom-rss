While studio head Neil Druckmann didn’t hint at what that project might be, he reportedly confirmed during a recent roundtable discussion that he’s been working on his next game since 2020. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195928" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="190" data-playlist="195928,195922,196345" data-current="195928"><div><p>How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21446.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The comment came during a Jewish Visionaries in Gaming talk held online this week in which Druckmann appeared alongside Ken Levine of <em>BioShock</em> fame whose own upcoming game, the sci-fi shooter <em>Judas</em>, was revealed with a full trailer earlier this year. While Druckmann, who’s also been busy running Naughty Dog and co-creating the hit HBO adaptation of <em>The Last of Us</em>, didn’t say when his next game would be out, the 2020 marker suggests it might not be too far away at this point. </p><p>The roundtable discussion <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gr42v6/neil_druckmann_says_his_current_project_has_been/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1gr42v6/neil_druckmann_says_his_current_project_has_been/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">started making the rounds on Reddit</a></span> earlier today, but the VOD has since been set to private on YouTube. While <em>Kotaku</em> was unable to view the full discussion, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/alonabadi/status/1857084744929841263&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/alonabadi/status/1857084744929841263" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another viewer</a></span> corroborated Druckmann’s mention of the 2020 date. Sony did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p><p>Naughty Dog has set the standard for blockbuster storytelling at PlayStation for years, but it’s been a while since the studio teased anything new. A <em>Last of Us Online</em> project that was expected to take the post-apocalyptic zombie survival formula into the live-service genre was suddenly canceled last fall. There’s also been a series of veteran departures at the studio in recent years, with Druckmann taking over as the top manager at Naughty Dog after former co-president Evan Wells <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/naughty-dog-neil-druckmann-evan-wells-tlou-president-1850633642&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/naughty-dog-neil-druckmann-evan-wells-tlou-president-1850633642">left in 2023</a></span>. </p><p>Given current development cycles for the biggest-budget games, it could still be a few more years until Druckmann’s next game, whatever it turns out to be, is actually in players’ hands. Things that used to take three to four years to make are now increasingly taking five to six, especially coming out of the 2020 pandemic. In addition to a new IP, fans have also been waiting to hear about the fate of <em>Uncharted, </em>which has been on ice since 2017's<em> Lost Legacy</em>. </p><p>Druckmann did speak once before about his next game in a now infamous Sony interview that was transcribed so inaccurately, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-us-2-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-sony-sequel-tlou3-1851500885&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-us-2-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-sony-sequel-tlou3-1851500885">entire thing had to be taken offline</a></span>. While the veteran writer and director was ridiculed online for appearing to suggest his next project would “redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming,” he later clarified that he never actually said those words. What he actually said was, “people even outside of gaming are looking at us to see what it is that we put out next.” </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Marking Epic’s entry into the graphics arms race with id Software, the two games were both utterly brilliant shooters in their own rights, but also became the names behind the engines on which a generation of games would be built. <em>Half-Life</em> was based on the <em>Quake </em>engine, while <em>Unreal</em>’s was under the hood of <em>Deus Ex</em>. </p><p>What also made them special is that both Epic and id were developers who grew up with an understanding of the importance of shareware, free software, and putting source code into the public domain. It’s why anyone can use those engines, and many later iterations of them, to create their games, free, without license or restriction. There are many publishers who are so ludicrously obsessed with maintaining a death-grip around their most ancient software that they will sue anyone who dares touch it (cough-Nintendo-cough), and all attempts to preserve games they refuse to support are met with outrageous hostility. Epic, for whatever other faults you may wish to level, is not like this, and while it should be commonplace, instead it’s a rare joy to see something like the 26-year-old <em>Unreal</em> so freely and willingly shared.</p><figure id="" data-id="c451d36bfccf45d942b46ffa424444d3" data-recommend-id="image://c451d36bfccf45d942b46ffa424444d3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1480" data-height="836" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Internet Archive's front page." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Internet Archive's front page." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Internet Archive / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c451d36bfccf45d942b46ffa424444d3" data-recommend-id="image://c451d36bfccf45d942b46ffa424444d3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1480" data-height="836" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Internet Archive's front page." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Meanwhile, the backbone of the internet, the wonderful Internet Archive, has been through an awful time of late.
