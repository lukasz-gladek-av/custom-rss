            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Wizards of the Coast is going to turn as much <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-mtg-magic-gathering-vivi-stock-1851786817">paper into gold</a> as it can with <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, and leading the way is its best-selling <em>Final Fantasy</em> Universes Beyond set. The company recently <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">announced at MagicCon Atlanta 2025</a> that it will be releasing additional <em>Final Fantasy</em> box sets with new cards featuring more beautiful art spanning the Square Enix RPG franchise’s history. If you’re worried about your wallet, relax! The initial wave of pre-orders sold out instantly.</p> <p>This mini-expansion includes a new <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1nr9lnn/new_magic_the_gathering_cards_revealed_today/">Chocobo Bundle</a>, a new Commander Deck, and four new Scene Boxes. They all arrive on December 5 and all of them are basically impossible to find online right now. Hopefully, fans have better luck with the inventory that comes directly to their local hobby shops. The Chocobo Bundle is $110 and comes with a bunch of booster packs, Chocobo-themed lands, alt-art reprints, a new promo card, and an incredibly neat life total click-wheel:</p>

   <p>Then there’s the new $100<em> FFVII</em> Limit Break Commander Deck that comes with a PC download code for the HD remaster of the original game and an exclusive Traditional Foil promo card that shows Cloud looking up at Shinra HQ. It seems way over-priced but is also completely sold out right now on Amazon.</p>

 <p>The new Scene Boxes are what really have my attention. There’s one each for <em>Final Fantasy</em>,<em> Final Fantasy VIII</em>,<em> Final Fantasy IX</em>, and<em> Final Fantasy XV</em>. Each comes with six Foil Borderless Scene Cards, six Art Cards, three Play Boosters, and one Display Easel for $42. The six cards go together to recreate scenes from each game. These new cards aren’t legal in standard play but look cool as heck. The art on the boxes alone makes me want one.</p>

   <p>There was no shortage of <em>Lord of the Rings</em> Scene Boxes when they arrived in 2023, offering hope that after the initial frenzy subsides, fans will be able to get access to the new<em> Final Fantasy</em> ones without too much trouble, and without paying over MSRP for them. Are the boxes worth even that? In the grand scheme of things, probably not. But that’s the whole point of Universes Beyond: subverting logic with passion.</p> <p>The result has been very lucrative for Wizards but a pain for many fans. “This whole collab has been so confusing,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1nr9lnn/new_magic_the_gathering_cards_revealed_today/">wrote</a> one after the latest <em>Final Fantasy</em> products were announced. “Every attempt I’ve made at actually purchasing cards has shown that the set is sold out everywhere, and they don’t seem to be printing any new ones. But there’s new cards still coming out too?” Yes. And I suspect these won’t be the last ones either.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon’s Prime Day sales event starts next week on October 7. But the online retailer has already marked down a ton of products ahead of its made-up holiday, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/goldbox?tag=kotaku01-20">including a long list of 4K UHD Blu-ray movies</a>. As streaming becomes more expensive and content is split up across more platforms and hidden behind more paywalls, owning a movie on Blu-ray is the best way to ensure you can watch it anytime you want at no extra cost. And, assuming you have the proper cables and setup, with 4K UHD Blu-rays, you get a picture quality that is better than compressed streaming content, too!</p> <p>Remember, you’ll need a UHD player to watch any of these movies. Your PS5 and Xbox Series X are solid UHD players, assuming they have disc slots and you are using the correct HDMI cable.</p> <p>With that all out of the way, here are the UHD movies currently on sale on Amazon. Heads up that in the past, popular movies have sometimes sold out during these big UHD sales, so if something catches your eye, don’t wait too long to snag it. And if you’re looking for spooky movies ahead of Halloween, I’ve included plenty on the list below.</p> <hr> <ul> <li><em>A Quiet Place</em> -$15 ($35)</li> <li>A Quiet Place Part II – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Air Force One</em> – $15 ($27)</li> <li><em>Batman Begins</em> – $15 ($35)</li> <li><em>The Dark Knight</em> – $14 ($35)</li> <li><em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> – $13 ($35)</li> <li><em>Batman Returns</em> – $15 ($35)</li> <li><em>Batman Forever</em> – $13 ($25)</li> <li><em>Batman &amp; Robin</em> – $12 ($25)</li> <li><em>Clueless</em> – $14 ($26)</li> <li><em>Cloverfield</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Dredd</em> – $13 ($23)</li> <li><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em> – $15 ($34)</li> <li><em>E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial</em> – $14 ($30)</li> <li><em>Evil Dead Rise</em> – $14 ($17)</li> <li><em>Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Friday the 13th</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Get Out</em> – $14 ($23)</li> <li><em>Gladiator II</em> – $15 ($30)</li> <li><em>Indiana Jones: Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Inglorious Basterds</em> – $12 ($25)</li> <li><em>Mother!</em> – $11 ($24)</li> <li><em>Poltergeist</em> – $13.72 ($34)</li> <li><em>Reservoir Dogs</em> – $11 ($13)</li> <li><em>Saturday Night Fever</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Split</em> – $14 ($23)</li> <li><em>Star Trek: The Motion Picture: Director’s Cut</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home –</em> $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek V: The Final Frontier</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek First Contact</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek Insurrection</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek Nemesis</em>— $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Star Trek Into Darkness</em> – $15 ($23)</li> <li><em>The Thing</em> – $12 ($30)</li> <li><em>Titanic</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>TMNT: Mutant Mayhem</em> – $15 ($38)</li> <li><em>Top Gun</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Top Gun: Maverick</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Transformers One</em> – $15 ($36)</li> <li><em>Transformers Bumblebee</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>The Untouchables</em> – $15 ($26)</li> <li><em>Us</em> – $13 ($23)</li> <li><em>Van Helsing</em> – $10 ($23)</li> <li><em>Wayne’s World</em> – $11 ($26)</li> </ul>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-capcom-cup-12-ppv-ticket-price-2000630340</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/street-fighter-6-fans-can%E2%80%99t-believe-capcom-wants-them-to-pay-to-watch-the-finals.1312993/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Capcom Cup started in 2013 with <i>Super Street Fighter IV: Arcade Edition</i> as the Japanese publisher sought to professionalize and take more direct ownership of its hit fighting franchise’s competitive scene. It expanded into multi-month tours leading up to the big finals, with all of the biggest matches streamed for free online. And it’s continued that way, until now. Capcom announced this week that the 2026 finals for <em>Street Fighter 6</em> will be a pay-per-view event, and fans are not happy. “No one should be deprived of the opportunity to enjoy the pinnacle of <em>Street Fighter</em>,” Evo 2025 winner Saul Leonardo “MenaRD” Mena II <a href="https://x.com/_MenaRD__/status/1972351981147525376">wrote on X</a> in response to the news.</p> <p>The two-time Capcom Cup champion hails from the Dominican Republic and noted, as many pros have, that locking esports behind a paywall particularly impacts fans from regions where the financial barriers are already higher. “I find it hard to accept,” he wrote. “I understand that in Japan, this is considered normal, and fortunately, the community is still able to support each other in this way. However, in many regions, including my own, there is hardly even the leeway to play this game.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">納得しがたいです</p> <p>日本ではこれが普通だと理解していますし、ありがたいことにコミュニティはまだこの方法で支え合えています。</p> <p>しかし、私の地域を含む多くの地域では、このゲームをプレイする余裕すらほとんどない。ストリートファイターの頂点を楽しむ機会を阻まれるべきではない。… <a href="https://t.co/DAVzvxvUWu">https://t.co/DAVzvxvUWu</a></p> <p>— WBG MenaRD🇩🇴 (@_MenaRD__) <a href="https://twitter.com/_MenaRD__/status/1972351981147525376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The <a href="https://sf.esports.capcom.com/capcomcup/cc12/en/">Capcom Cup 12 Finals</a> will take place on March 14, followed by the <em>Street Fighter</em> League World Championship on March 15. Both will take place live at the Ryōgoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena in Tokyo, Japan, where front row seats will cost roughly $135. In a major break with the past, however, even virtual viewership will be ticketed this time around. The pay-per-view ticket price will be roughly $40 for both days. Anyone who doesn’t want to pay will have to wait until a week later to stream the matches online for free.</p>

 <p>The move caught many competitive<em> Street Fighter</em> pros by surprise. Next year’s Capcom Cup sports a $1,282,000 prize pool, unchanged from the prior year, despite the new income stream. “If this decision is final, then I hope at the very least a % of the PPV earnings be used to support the prize pool to improve the payout distribution for the players,” Arman “Phenom” Hanjani <a href="https://x.com/PhenomSF/status/1972393910438883538">wrote on X</a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The issue is that while Capcom funds the CC Finals, they absolutely do not pay to run all of the tournaments where people qualify for Capcom Cup. Individual TOs and communities in countries around the world operate those events. Capcom benefits from the hardwork of those TOs and…</p> <p>— 女 Molly_Bee (@MollyAmberBee) <a href="https://twitter.com/MollyAmberBee/status/1972796918666260953?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s also unclear how the PPV requirement will impact the rest of the competitive scene’s content creators who traditionally co-stream events. Others have wondered why Capcom doesn’t just try to extract more money through Capcom Cup-specific in-game outfits and other cosmetics. “I don’t know why they’re not doing this anymore. I used to buy the CPT costume pack every year, everyone wins and everyone is happy,” <a href="https://x.com/Bigbird_fgc/status/1972303220908417059">wrote</a> Adel&nbsp;“Big Bird” Anouche.</p>

 <p>Fans are equally bewildered, pointing to all of the local events that feed into the Capcom Pro Tour but aren’t directly financed by the publisher. “I thought Capcom organized this circuit as a marketing tool for the game,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1nss7ou/capcom_announces_that_capcom_cup_12_finals_stream/">wrote</a> on Reddit. “Makes no sense to charge viewers to watch it. And esports is, unfortunately, still way too niche for that to be profitable.”</p> <p>While <em>Street Fighter</em> is massive in Japan, many are worried the move to PPV for such a big event will just end up excluding people in other parts of the world. Does Capcom care? Apparently not.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Celebrities are just like you and me. They enjoy some video games, just like the rest of us. And back in 2002, Sony was thrilled that so many famous people really enjoyed playing the PlayStation 2. Sony was so excited, in fact, that the PlayStation maker compiled a large list of “celebrity testimonies” and shared it with the press via the company’s 2002 E3 Press Kit. And thankfully, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ultrabrilliant.xyz/post/3m22r6klg722i">as spotted by Devolver Digital PR manager Andy Kelly</a>, someone all the way back in 2016 uploaded this <a href="https://archive.org/details/PlayStation2CelebQuotes">press kit to the Internet Archive</a>. Now we can all enjoy it.</p> <p>I’ve formatted all of the testimonials below, with minimal editing or tweaks. Now you can easily enjoy all of these testimonials, some of which don’t seem like something Sony would actually want people to read or share. And yes, some of the people below are not great and are super canceled in 2025. Take a shot for each time that happens. (Don’t do that.)</p>

 <hr> <h2>Matthew Perry, actor, <em>Friends</em></h2> <p>“I used to have a social life, go on dates, go to dinner parties, have a job. Now all I do is sit in a big chair and play PlayStation 2. 1 never leave my house. My friends have wondered what happened to me. Howard Hughes must have had one of these.”</p>

 <h2>David Arquette, actor,<em> Scream 3</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is to the gaming world what the computer was to the typewriter. It’s not just an entertainment luxury, but a necessity.”</p> <h2>Hayden Christensen, actor, <em>Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of the Clones</em></h2> <p>“I just got [PlayStation 2] a few days ago, but I’ve been playing it non-stop; it’s a great system. The graphics are fantastic, I’ve never seen anything like it before.”</p>

 <h2>Luke Wilson, actor, <em>Charlie’s Angels</em></h2> <p>“Freedom from everyday life can only mean one thing – the arrival of PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Sandra Bullock, actress, <em>Miss Congeniality</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is the only place where I can legally explode things and not harm anyone.”</p>

 <h2>Chris Klein, actor, <em>American Pie II</em></h2> <p>“I’ve been playing game systems for a really long time, but once you go PlayStation 2 you can never go back. . .It’s the best system for sure.”</p> <h2>Jason Biggs, actor, <em>American Pie II</em></h2> <p>“I do play PlayStation. I have a PS2 console and it is awesome…It is amazing. PS one is still great, but the graphics and the concepts on PS2 are incredibly realistic…I had PS2 in my trailer for <em>American Pie II</em>. Me and the rest of the guys would get into some heated games.”</p>

 <h2>Jason Lee, actor, <em>Almost Famous</em></h2> <p>“[PlayStation 2] is the most amazing game I’ve ever played. Amazing graphics, too. The console looks like it’s straight out of <em>Blade Runner</em>!”</p> <h2>Justin Timberlake, singer, NSYNC</h2> <p>“I play PlayStation 2 all the time, not just on the road. The play action is really easy and has the best graphics.”</p>

 <h2>P. Diddy, rapper</h2> <p>“No doubt I am a [PlayStation 2] fan. My kids and I play together.”</p> <h2>Snoop Dogg, rapper/actor, <em>The Wash</em></h2> <p>“The rush to get the new PlayStation 2 is more out of control than the Cabbage Patch Kids. I want my music on there – I want it to be Snoop Dogg and PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Nick Carter, singer, Backstreet Boys</h2> <p>“I’ve been playing PlayStation 2 since it came out. I take it out on tour and play on the bus, in my hotel room and backstage before the shows. The graphics are totally awesome, and I like that I can use it to play DVDs, too.”</p> <h2>Vin Diesel, actor,<em> The Fast &amp; The Furious</em></h2> <p>“If I’m not playing Sony PlayStation or rereading a classic or watching a foreign film. . .my friends and I get on the Internet and find out who I’m dating, and it’s always hysterical.”</p>

 <h2>Tara Reid, actress, <em>American Pie II</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation is fun. It’s innocent and fun. It is nice to be kids and have a good time… I bring PlayStation 2 into my trailer on every movie I do.”</p> <h2>John Leguizamo, actor, <em>Moulin Rouge</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is the coolest thing ever. Forget my kids, this is MINE!”</p> <h2>Wayne Brady, comedian/actor, <em>Whose Line Is it Anyway?</em></h2> <p>“I love my PlayStation 2. I’m all over my PS2. . . I tour so much now doing my improv act, that it’s great because my wife doesn’t let me play games at home, so I play them in the hotel room.”</p>

 <h2>Seann William Scott, actor, <em>American Pie II</em></h2> <p>“I’ve never seen anything like it. . . I’ve played other games before but PlayStation 2 is just amazing.”</p> <h2>Shannon Elizabeth, actress, <em>American Pie II</em></h2> <p>“The PlayStation 2 is the best thing ever.”</p> <h2>Tom Green, actor, <em>The Tom Green Show</em></h2> <p>“They’ve all got Sony PlayStations and I don’t.” (On what he most values in his friends) “FINALLY, I’ve got my very own PS2″</p> <h2>Jimmy Fallon, actor, <em>Saturday Night Live</em></h2> <p>“The PlayStation 2 is sweet! The new Madden game sounds insane…I want to play it now. I’m also excited about playing over the Internet. If they make an Olympic game it will be awesome to actually play someone in China. Too much fun.”</p> <h2>Forest Whitaker, actor/director, <em>Waiting To Exhale</em></h2> <p>“I can’t wait to get the PlayStation 2 for my kids. They’re going to love it.”</p>

 <h2>Ashley Angel, singer, O-Town</h2> <p>“It’s midnight in Milwaukee and it’s 20 degrees outside and instead of being in a warm hotel room, Jacob, Erik and I are out playing PS2 in the tour bus.”</p> <h2>Howie Dorough, singer, Backstreet Boys</h2> <p>“We are all fans, but Nikki [Nick Carter] is the biggest. That is why I can’t beat him at <em>Who </em><em>Wants to Be a Millionaire</em> – I am trying to get that thing down.”</p> <h2>Dave Matthews, singer, Dave Mathews Band</h2> <p>“The band is so into PlayStation 2. I can’t imagine being on the road without it. Our lounge on the bus is dedicated to PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Danny Masterson, actor, <em>That 70’s Show</em></h2> <p>“The games are really cool – they’ve got good soundtracks on them and look very, very real…I’m at work and in between scenes we play video games. We should probably read more books, but PlayStation 2 is so darn good.”</p> <h2>Bill Bellamy, MTV VJ/actor,<em> The Brothers</em></h2> <p>“[PlayStation 2] is fascinating to see. The graphics are so incredible, so lifelike — it’s fast, it’s fun, it’s challenging, it brings people together. You feel like you’re really in the game. That’s the part that’s cool and that’s what people get excited about.”</p>

 <h2>Patricia Arquette, actress, <em>Little Nicky</em></h2> <p>“We can’t get enough of PlayStation 2 at our house.”</p> <h2>Lee Ann Rimes, singer</h2> <p>“It’s a total stress-buster at the end of a long day – it’s a lot of fun!”</p> <h2>Marlon Wayans, actor/writer, <em>Scary Movie</em></h2> <p>“It’s the truth. I played John Madden. . .one sack hit me so big, it broke my rib. You really feel like you’re playing the game. It’s the true experience. . .PlayStation 2.”</p> <h2>Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, actress,<em> X-Men</em></h2> <p>“When I saw my friend [playing PlayStation 2] I became determined to become as much of an expert as she is.”</p>

 <h2>Tom Arnold, actor, <em>Best Damn Sports Show Period, True Lies</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is so intense that when they play they don’t want to talk to anyone around them.”</p> <h2>Jermaine Dupri, So So Def Founder/Producer/ Recording Artist</h2> <p>“I am a die hard PlayStation 2 fan, I don’t like nothing else. But PlayStation is my favorite. . .You can play music, games, DVDs – there isn’t anything better.”</p> <h2>Billy Campbell, actor, <em>Once and Again</em></h2> <p>“It’s going to be a long time before anybody beats it…”</p> <h2>Brendan Fehr, actor, <em>Roswell</em></h2> <p>“In terms of graphics, it’s far superior to [the original] PlayStation. In between scenes, you see the players come out of dressing rooms, and there are little clips like you’re watching TV. It’s a lot of fun. . . PlayStation 2 is great because it plays both DVDs and games. . . and the graphics are so cool.”</p>

 <h2>Carmen Electra, actress/model,<em> Scary Movie</em></h2> <p>“I grew up playing video games. PlayStation 2 takes it to the next level.”</p> <h2>Jeff Probst, host of TV’s <em>Survivor</em></h2> <p>“When we did the first <em>Survivor</em>, I didn’t realize I’d have some downtime between challenges and Tribal Councils, but for <em>Survivor 2</em>, I was ready. I brought a PlayStation 2 as my luxury item. So, we’d finish Tribal Council, head back to base camp, toss in a game and start jammin’. It was a great way to get your mind out of your work and not a bad way to relieve some tension as well.”</p> <h2>Joey Fatone, singer, NSYNC</h2> <p>“I use PlayStation 2 because it is fun and has good graphics. It gives us something else to do on<br> the bus and helps pass the time while traveling from city to city. Got a PS2 in my car too like Chris [Kirkpatrick], and I play at least four to five hours a day. PS2 is the BOMB!”</p> <h2>Joshua Jackson, actor, <em>Dawson ’s Creek</em></h2> <p>“I can’t go to a [movie] set without my PlayStation 2 ”</p> <h2>Sean Stockton, singer, Boyz II Men</h2> <p>“I am a huge fan of [PlayStation 2’s] <em>Grand Theft Auto.</em> . . for adults like me it is the bomb.”</p> <h2>Donald Faison, actor, <em>Scrubs</em></h2> <p>“PlayStation 2 is everywhere – they’re always at the most happening spots. It is the coolest brand.”</p>

 <h2>Drew Lachey, singer, 98 Degrees</h2> <p>“I’m keeping [my PlayStation 2] in my bunk on the tour bus because I’m afraid I’ll play it too much at home and cause fights with my wife.”</p> <h2>Eddie Cibrian, actor, <em>Third Watch</em></h2> <p>“You are talking to a true PlayStation 2 fan. I can’t wait for <em>Tony Hawk 3</em> to come out…I play <em>Madden</em> all day long.”</p> <h2>Bryan McFayden, MTV VJ</h2> <p>“At MTV, a PlayStation 2 is never more than 30 feet away from where we’re taping.”</p> <h2>Erik-Michael Estrada, singer, O-Town</h2> <p>“<em>NCAA Gamebreaker 2001</em> for PS2 is the most incredible college football game ever.
