            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-goes-zero-profit-on-beats-solo-4-50-hour-wireless-headphones-at-cyber-monday-low-2000648763</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In the premium headphone market, big names like Apple, Sonos, Bose, Sony, and Beats compete with each other by offering different features and prices to different types of listeners. The <strong>Beats Solo 4 is the perfect choice if you want great sound quality, spatial head tracking, and modern connectivity features</strong> without having to pay extra for active noise cancellation.</p>
<p>This Cyber Monday weekend, Amazon has the lowest price ever on this model which competes directly with models that cost a lot more: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5737/">The regular price is $199, but it’s now only $129</a>. Instead of cramming in every possible tech feature, they focused on battery life, comfort, and sound quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5737/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Long battery life and compatibility with all devices</h2>
<p>Beats designed the <strong>Solo 4 to last up to 50 hours on a single charge</strong> which changes the way you use wireless headphones all week long. You can fly across the country several times, go to work every day for two weeks or binge-watch entire TV shows without having to look for a charging cable. The USB-C charging port has fast fuel technology that lets you <strong>play for 5 hours on a 10-minute charge</strong> when you’re running late. The <strong>Solo 4 connects to both iOS and Android devices</strong> via Bluetooth so you don’t have to worry about being stuck in one ecosystem if you switch between platforms for work and play.</p>



<p>The<strong> 40mm drivers in each ear cup make Beats’ “custom acoustic platform,”</strong> which adjusts the frequency response to give you strong bass without drowning out vocals and instruments in the mid and high ranges. You will be able to hear the thump of kick drums and bass lines clearly while still being able to understand every word in podcasts or other content with a lot of dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>Dynamic head tracking and spatial audio</strong> make listening more immersive by tying sound to your device instead of your head movements. When you turn your head while watching a movie, the sound stays in the same place on the screen, just like it does in a real theater. This feature turns on automatically when you play content that works with it on Apple devices and some Android phones.</p>
<p>To fix the comfort issues that plagued earlier Solo models during long wear sessions, Beats changed the headband and ear cushions: The very light construction spreads pressure more evenly over your head, and the soft foam cushions make a tight seal without the vice-grip feeling that gives you headaches after an hour. The on-ear design folds flat into a small shape that fits easily into backpacks or carry-on bags.</p>



<p>The matte black finish doesn’t show fingerprints and scratches as easily as glossy finishes, which show every smudge within hours of opening the box. <strong>Beats comes with a 3.5mm audio cable</strong> so you can connect to older devices that don’t have Bluetooth or keep listening when the battery dies after a long time of use.</p>
<p>This Cyber Monday deal brings the price of the Solo 4 down from $199 to $129 and puts it in direct competition with budget models that give up battery life, build quality, or platform compatibility. You’re getting a high-end Beats product for less than what many mid-range brands charge, plus the brand recognition and customer service that come with owning an Apple product.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonos-beam-with-dolby-atmos-hits-record-low-on-amazon-black-soundbar-for-cyber-monday-at-zero-margin-2000648759</link>
            <guid>1368214</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sonos is known for making high-quality audio products and the Beam (Gen 2) shows why <strong>the company is still the best in the soundbar business</strong>. TVs these days are getting thinner and more stylish but that slim design comes with a trade-off: the built-in speakers don’t have enough room to make good sound. This makes a frustrating gap between beautiful 4K visuals and disappointing audio that ruins movies, shows, and music.</p>
<p>The Sonos Beam fixes this by turning your living room into a mini theater with Dolby Atmos support and smart home integration. For Cyber Monday weekend, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/">you can get it for $349, which is $150 less than its normal price of $499</a>. This is the lowest price ever and makes premium sound more affordable than ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>High-Quality Sound Technology in a Small Package</h2>
<p>The Beam has great hardware in a surprisingly small frame that won’t take over your entertainment center. The <strong>speaker array has one center tweeter, four full-range woofers, and three passive radiators</strong> that work together to make 200 watts of total output power. Five Class-D digital amplifiers power the array. With this setup, the soundbar can handle frequencies as low as 50.4 Hz and gives it deep bass without needing a separate subwoofer for most people. <strong>Dolby Atmos</strong> processing is what really makes the magic happen: It makes virtual height channels that bounce sound off your ceiling to make it sound like it’s coming from above.</p>



<p>The Beam from Sonos is more than just a TV and movie player: When your screen is off, <strong>the soundbar becomes a high-tech music streaming device</strong> that connects to Spotify, Apple Music, Amazon Music, and many other services through built-in Wi-Fi. The <em>Trueplay</em> tuning technology uses the microphone on your iPhone to figure out how sound travels in your room and automatically changes the sound profile to make up for furniture, wall materials, and the shape of the room.</p>
<p>You can use the Sonos app, your current TV remote through HDMI-ARC, Apple AirPlay 2 for iOS users, or voice commands through Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant to control everything. It only takes a few minutes to set up because you only need two cables: one HDMI cable to connect to your TV and one power cord. This means you won’t have to deal with the mess of wires that come with most surround sound systems.</p>



<p>Sonos is better than its competitors because you can add more devices to it while their ecosystems are closed and don’t allow for many upgrades. You can start with just the Beam and then add a Sonos Sub for deeper bass or pair two Sonos One speakers as rear channels to get real 5.1 surround sound. You can play music in different rooms or make a whole-home audio system that plays the same content in all of them because every Sonos speaker connects wirelessly to your home network.</p>
<p>This Cyber Monday deal is a great deal for anyone who takes their home entertainment seriously because it’s only $349 instead of the usual $499. Soundbars that work with Dolby Atmos usually cost $600 or more. Cheaper options, on the other hand, may not be as well built, may not support apps, or may not be able to be expanded in the future.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Digital Picture Frame Hits 55% Off on Amazon, 60K Photo Storage Cheaper Than Basic Wall Frames Now]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/digital-picture-frame-hits-55-off-on-amazon-60k-photo-storage-cheaper-than-basic-wall-frames-now-2000648754</link>
            <guid>1368202</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Digital picture frames fix the problem of printed photos collecting dust in albums that no one ever opens: They turn your favorite memories into a display that changes every day and is seen by everyone. With modern WiFi-enabled frames, family members can send photos from anywhere using a simple app which means that grandparents can get pictures of their grandkids right away without having to know how to use cloud storage or email attachments.</p>
<p>The 10.1-inch frame from <em>Euphro</em> makes everything easier with a touchscreen interface that anyone can use, even if they’ve never owned a smartphone or tablet. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6098/">Cyber Monday sale brought the price down from the usual $99 to $45</a> which is the lowest price ever on Amazon. That discount makes sense for a frame that has a lot of storage, a clear display, and easy photo sharing, all in a package that anyone can use without any technical knowledge.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6098/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>WiFi Sharing That Works and Isn’t Confusing</h2>
<p>The <strong>frame connects to your home’s Wi-Fi network</strong> through a simple setup process that shows you how to do it on the touchscreen. Once it’s connected, anyone you give permission to can send photos through the free <em>Uhale</em> app which is available for both iPhone and Android devices. Family members can easily get to your frame by downloading the app, making an account and asking for access with a unique code and you can then approve their request with just one tap. When you send photos through the app, they show up on the frame right away: This is the magical moment when grandma sees her grandson’s first day of school photos pop up in real time from hundreds of miles away.</p>



<p>The <strong>10.1-inch IPS touchscreen has a resolution of 1280×800</strong> which is enough to show photos clearly without the blurry, pixelated look that cheaper frames give. IPS technology keeps the colors true and bright even when you look at the screen from the side. Older LCD panels would wash out if you weren’t standing right in front of them. You can pause the slideshow to look at a favorite photo or skip over pictures you’ve seen recently with the touch interface, which responds smoothly to swipes and taps. Depending on how you set it up, you can turn the frame from portrait to landscape mode.</p>
<p>The <strong>internal storage can hold up to 32GB, which is enough for about 60,000 photos</strong> at the resolution of a typical smartphone so you’ll run out of wall space before you run out of memory. The <strong>frame can also take microSD cards</strong>&nbsp;but most people never get close to filling up the internal storage, even after years of regular photo uploads. You can send files directly from cameras, phones, or computers without having to worry about compatibility issues because JPEG, PNG, and MP4 files are just a few of the many image and video formats that work without conversion.</p>



<p>You can change how photos look by changing the order they show up in, the speed of the slideshow, and the transition effects between images. If some photos don’t fit the season or mood, you can hide them from the rotation. The frame will remember these settings until you change them. You can set the display order to show the newest photos first, shuffle them randomly, or play them in order of when they were taken.</p>
<p>Cutting the price by $54 makes this frame cheap enough to buy on a whim, and it has features that frames that cost twice as much have a hard time matching.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[JBL Loses All Margin This Black Friday Week, 5.1-Channel Soundbar Crashes to an All-Time Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/jbl-soundbar-and-subwoofer-for-150-off-2000638894</link>
            <guid>1368199</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You should want the best out of your home entertainment setup. And that doesn’t just mean investing in a good TV for video quality. You’ve got to give audio some love too. Sure, a fancy 85-kinch OLED smart TV is going to look awesome in your living room, and while built-in TV speaker have gotten better over the years, they still don’t hold a candle to a dedicated surround sound system. This JBL soundbar and subwoofer combo offer a great improvement to your home entertainment soundscape without you needing to empty your bank account. And best of all, it’s on sale right now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6095/">Normally the JBL Bar 500 goes for $650, but for a limited time deal for Black Friday week, you can get it for just $400.</a></p>
<p>This JBL soundbar measures across at exactly 101.7 centimeters. That can comfortably fit atop your media center right in front of your TV. The subwoofer works wirelessly, which means you don’t need to hide cables running from one side of the room to the other. That measures 10 inches high and will be the difference between a bass that booms and a bass that&nbsp;<strong>BOOMS</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6095/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>With support for both Dolby Atmos and MultiBeam surround sound, you can bring theater-like quality sound and feels like it’s coming from all directions in a 3D space, fully immersing your in the audio. And it does so without actually needing any additional surround sound speakers — just the 5.1-channnel&nbsp; system.</p>
<h2>Enhanced Dialogue</h2>
<p>Now one of the main reasons to upgrade to a soundbar over your TV’s built-in speakers is dialogue. TV shows and movies nowadays have a tendency to be mixed with more robust audio setups in mind. This is why when playing off just your TV speakers, you might sometimes find it hard to actually make out what anyone is saying. However, if you go to increase the volume, suddenly the next scene has erratically loud sound effects like explosions, gun fire, or even just background music.</p>



<p>The JBL 500 sound bar gives you the option to enhance dialogue separately from the rest of the audio. PureVoice Dialogue Enhancements algorithmically isolates and amplifies vocal clarity so that you don’t feel forced to always watch with the subtitles turned on.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6095/">Tons of other smart features are packed into the JBL Bar 500 soundbar and subwoofer.</a> With Wi-Fi support, you can connect to your sound system from other devices on your network. Stream music to them over AirPlay from an iPhone or MacBook. You can even pair the soundbar with an Alexa smart home hub can control the speaker with voice commands.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Quietly Moves Its Remaining 15.6″ Portable Gaming Monitor Stock Into Record-Low Clearance After 10K+ Black Friday Sales]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/15-6-inch-kyy-portable-gaming-monitor-2000644924</link>
            <guid>1368178</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A single screen can often feel limited, especially if you’re someone who needs to work with multiple applications at the same time. Those who use a laptop as their main work or play device can benefit from adding a second, portable display to their setup, and today is a great time to bring one home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6084/">Amazon is currently offering quite a few impressive Cyber Monday deals, which also drops the price of the 15.6-inch KYY portable monitor to just $66.</a> That’s after a 34% discount on its $100 price tag, and the offer is open to all shoppers. Both Prime and non-Prime members can take advantage of it. Though it’s best to get your orders in fast, as we’re expecting the discount to wrap up soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6084/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Display Modes for All Your Needs</h2>
<p>In a sleek, lightweight build, you’re getting a nice 15.6-inch screen. The size is similar to what most standard laptops offer, so you won’t feel a drastic difference when switching between both. The same goes for the visuals. The portable monitor offers a 1920×1080 resolution, which translates into brighter colors and sharper details. The advanced IPS matte screen supports a 178-degree full viewing angle, meaning you can enjoy consistent visuals from all directions. Basically, you don’t have to sit directly in front of the screen to view the content. This is great for when you have multiple people around; those at the back or on the side will be able to see just as clearly.</p>



<p>You can choose between multiple display modes (including mirror, extend, second screen only, and portrait mode), depending on what you need. Need to run two programs side by side? The extended mode gives you access to both. Reading through long documents? Portrait mode should work best!</p>
<p>The monitor includes two fully functional USB-C ports, which means you can connect it with just a single cable for both power and display, as long as your device supports Thunderbolt 3 or USB-C with DisplayPort Alt Mode. The setup is plug-and-play, so you don’t need to worry about installing any complicated drivers to get started.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6084/">Even better, it comes with a smart cover that not just protects it from everyday wear and tear, but also doubles as a stand you can use to prop the monitor up</a>. In short, if you have been wanting to expand your work or play setup with something that’s easy to carry around, this portable monitor can be a valuable addition.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dyson V11 Reached 20K Units Sold This Week, Amazon Goes Even Lower With New All-Time Price for Cyber Monday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-v11-reached-20k-units-sold-this-week-amazon-goes-even-lower-with-new-all-time-price-for-cyber-monday-2000648745</link>
            <guid>1368163</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dyson comes out with a new vacuum model almost every year, and the V11 is a big step up in the brand’s cordless line with 185 air watts of suction that makes a real difference on both carpets and hard floors.</p>
<p>On Cyber Monday weekend, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">the price dropped from $629 to $399 which is a new all-time low</a> for a model that still competes with Dyson’s newest models. That discount is important because you’re getting tech that was top-of-the-line just a few years ago, but now it’s priced more like mid-range competitors that can’t match its suction power, autonomy or build quality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Three Power Modes</h2>
<p>You can switch between three different power settings on the V11 using a button on the handle and it lets you control how much battery life you give up for cleaning power.<em> Auto mode</em> uses sensors in the cleaner head to figure out what kind of floor it is and changes the suction automatically. It increases suction on carpets and decreases it on hard floors to save battery life while still cleaning well. <strong>Eco mode extends runtime by up to 60 minutes</strong> by lowering suction to its lowest effective level. This is great for quick daily cleaning of hard surfaces that don’t need maximum power. When you turn on <em>boost mode</em>, it gives you the full 185 air watts for a few minutes of deep cleaning.</p>



<p>The <strong>LCD screen on top of the vacuum shows you what power mode you’re in</strong>, how much time is left until it runs out, and maintenance alerts when the filters need to be cleaned or there are blockages. This real-time feedback takes away the guesswork that comes with other cordless vacuums. You won’t have to wonder if you have enough power to finish the room or if the loss of suction means a clog or just a full bin.</p>
<p>The Motorbar cleaner head has a <strong>brush bar that spins and has technology that keeps long hair and pet fur from getting stuck</strong> in the bristles: This means you don’t have to spend as much time cutting up tangles off the roller with scissors. The brush bar works on all kinds of floors without needing to be adjusted by hand and it moves smoothly from area rugs to tile to hardwood while still cleaning well.</p>



<p>It only takes a <strong>few seconds to switch the vacuum to handheld mode</strong> by removing the wand and connecting tools directly to the motor body. This makes it a powerful tool for cleaning furniture, stairs, and car interiors. The mini soft dusting brush can clean delicate surfaces and electronics without scratching them, and the crevice tool can get into baseboards and tight corners that regular vacuum heads can’t reach.</p>
<p>Advanced <strong>HEPA filtration catches 99.99% of particles as small as 0.3 microns</strong> which includes common allergens like dust mites, pollen, and pet dander that can make people allergic. The sealed filtration system makes sure that the air that comes out of the vacuum cleaner is cleaner than the air that goes in and it is a big help for people with asthma or allergies.</p>
<p>Dyson offers a<strong> two-year warranty on the V11</strong> and <strong>lifetime support through their app</strong> which has maintenance guides and troubleshooting help when problems come up. The vacuum is only 6.6 pounds when fully assembled, which makes it light enough to carry up the stairs without any trouble but heavy enough to handle daily use. The docking station that hangs on the wall charges the battery and keeps the vacuum and tools in one neat place so you don’t have to search through closets to find them.</p>
<p>Taking $230 off the price of a Dyson vacuum is a great deal, especially for a model that still works as well as vacuums that cost a lot more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Star Wars Outlaws (Gold Edition) for Nintendo Switch 2 at 50% Off Could Sell Out Before Cyber Monday Even Arrives]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-gold-edition-for-nintendo-switch-2-already-half-price-for-black-friday-2000648499</link>
            <guid>1368160</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Game prices have been a hot topic of conversation surrounding the Nintendo Switch 2. <em>Mario Kart World</em>, the first launch title for the console, comes with an outlandish $80 price tag. Nintendo’s favorite ape has taken centerstage once more in <em>Donkey Kong: Bananza</em>, priced at $70. Third party titles seem to be sticking with the standard $60 for the time being. Those also tend to actually go on sale unlike first party Nintendo titles (which do, but far less frequently and with far less substantial discounts). <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6083/">So right now during Black Friday weekend, it’s pretty expected to find these Nintendo games are still full price while an awesome title like&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>has come down by 50%.</a></p>
<p>Previously unavailable on Nintendo consoles, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> first arrived in 2024 on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. With the launch of the Switch 2, Nintendo is now able to supports a lot more graphically-demanding third party titles. We’ve seen Nintendo Switch 2 releases for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, and now <em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>too.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6083/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>came to the Nintendo Switch 2 back in the beginning of September, selling at a full retail price of $60. Now, just a couple short months later, it’s down to just $30—for a limited time at least.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagate-goes-zero-profit-on-2tb-external-hard-drive-500000-photo-storage-at-new-record-low-2000648741</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cloud storage sounds great until you realize you’ll have to pay monthly fees forever and hope your internet connection stays strong when you need to get to something important. External hard drives solve both problems by letting you physically control your files without having to pay for them over and over again. Plus,<strong> with 2TB of space, you can store about 500,000 photos or hundreds of hours of video</strong> before you even think about running out of space.</p>
<p>Because it works right away with almost any device you own and only needs a USB cable to start transferring files, Seagate’s portable drive has become one of Amazon’s most popular storage options. This Black Friday weekend, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3788/">the price of the 2TB model dropped from $79 to $64, which is the lowest it’s ever been</a> for a drive that is always one of the best-selling in its category.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3788/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Storage That Works Everywhere</h2>
<p>The drive connects through USB 3.0 which in <strong>real-world tests speeds up transfers to 120MB per second</strong>&nbsp;which means that moving a full movie file takes less than a minute instead of the slow speed you’d have to deal with with older USB 2.0 connections.</p>
<p>You can also plug it<strong> right into Windows PCs, Macs, PlayStation consoles, or Xbox systems</strong> without having to install drivers or reformat it in most cases because is because Seagate ships the drive with broad compatibility already set up. People who use Macs may need to reformat their drives for Time Machine backups, but this only takes a few clicks, and once you set it up, the drive does backups automatically without any problems.</p>



<p>The <strong>metal case protects the device well from small drops and bumps</strong>&nbsp;but if you’re putting it in a backpack with other gear, you should get a padded case. Seagate offers a <strong>one-year rescue service</strong> that includes data recovery in case the drive fails which gives you peace of mind because professional recovery services usually cost hundreds of dollars and can’t always guarantee results.</p>
<p>The<strong> USB connection provides power directly so you don’t need a separate power adapter</strong> that could get lost in a drawer or make your desk look messy. You can use this drive anywhere there is a USB port like in coffee shops or airport lounges, without having to look for an outlet. The drive spins at 5400 RPM which is a good balance between speed and reliability and it also uses very little power so it can be used with laptops without draining the battery.</p>



<p>This drive can be used as <strong>extra storage for PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X systems</strong> that fill up their internal storage faster than you can delete old games. You can store PS4 and Xbox One games on the drive and play them right away without having to copy them back to the console’s internal storage. However, you have to transfer PS5 and Series X games back to the console’s SSD before you can play them.</p>
<p>For $64, you can get 2TB of reliable storage that is $20 to $50 less than most other drives. Plus, you get Seagate’s reputation for durability and a rescue service, so you don’t have to worry about buying an unknown brand. The price works out to about 3 cents per gigabyte, which is better than cloud storage subscriptions after just a few months of use.</p>

              <p>Have little ones who can’t get enough of dinosaurs? Surprising them with a buildable T. rex skull is going to light them up instantly, and today is a great time to pick one up.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6082/">LEGO’s Jurassic World Dinosaur Fossils: T Rex Skull building set, which gets you a posable T. rex skull, plus a fossilized footprint with a plaque, is currently sitting at just $25 on Amazon.</a> That’s after a 38% discount on its retail price of $40, and the price is the lowest we have seen in quite some time. It’s a Cyber Monday deal, and the holiday rush is going to set in quickly. We recommend grabbing it fast, as the offer (or the stock) is likely going to end soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6082/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Display Worthy</h2>
<p>This fun set is made for ages 9 and up, and gets you a total of 577 pieces. It’s not going to be one of those massive projects that require week-long dedication, and won’t be a super quick job either. Think of it as a fun little weekend activity that your kids can begin on a Saturday and be done with by Sunday.</p>
<p>Attention to detail is truly impressive. You’ll be building a fairly realistic dino toy; a T. rex skull with dinosaur bones that sits on a display stand. You can choose to keep the jaws open for a scary look or close them when letting the beast rest. The skull is paired with the fossilized footprint, plus a plaque that displays some cool facts about the Tyrannosaurus. Kids can learn about the height of the giant, its weight, dietary preferences, and more as they build. There’s a hidden amber piece added somewhere in there to add a little mystery for the curious minds, too. Finish off by adding some LEGO plants around for a foresty feel.</p>



<p>Once made, the set measures over 8 in. (21 cm) high. Place it on a shelf in the living room, or in the kids’ play area; it’s going to look stunning everywhere. You can display the skull, amber, and footprint in different ways. It’s going to look great on its own, and even pair it with other Jurassic World kits for a fuller setup.</p>
<p>Like all LEGO sets, this too comes with a detailed instruction manual. The guidebook takes you through each step, and is pretty easy to follow. But for additional assistance, you can install the LEGO Builder app, as well. The platform offers 3D instructions, plus lets you zoom in on the blocks from each angle to get a better understanding. Kids can save all their sets, track progress, and even build with friends!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6082/">This deal lets you grab it for just $25, which is basically nothing for the experience the set offers</a>. Now is a great time to bring one, or even two of these home for the little dino lovers in your life without blowing your budget. That said, there’s plenty more going at a discount right now. Black Friday is over, but you can still pick everything from kitchen essentials to high-ticket items like TVs, smart home devices, tech gadgets, and more without paying the full price. Just note that most discounts are short-lived. If you see something you like, don’t wait too long to grab it.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Smart Plug With Alexa Costs Pocket Change This Black Friday, Turns Any Outlet Smart]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-smart-plug-with-alexa-costs-pocket-change-this-black-friday-turns-any-outlet-smart-2000648737</link>

              <p>If you want to modernize your home without getting rid of all your old appliances, traditional stores can be very frustrating. A <strong>smart plug is great because it turns any regular appliance into a connected device</strong> without you having to buy expensive smart versions of everything: You don’t need to spend $200 on a smart lamp when you can use a simple plug to make your $30 lamp respond to voice commands and set routines. But the good news is that during Black Friday, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5877/">Amazon’s smart plug goes down to $12 for Black Friday, which is less than its usual price of $24</a>. This looks like a move by Amazon to<strong> get more homes connected to Alexa</strong> without making any money.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5877/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Voice Control at a Reasonable Price</h2>
<p>The Amazon smart plug controls the flow of electricity to whatever you plug into it: This means that <strong>any device that has a physical on/off switch can be controlled by Alexa</strong>: Your coffee maker can start brewing before you get out of bed, your lamp in the living room can turn on when you say <em>“Alexa, good morning,”</em> and the box fan in your bedroom can turn off by itself when you fall asleep. The<strong> plug connects directly to your Wi-Fi network</strong> so you don’t need to buy a separate smart home hub and it only takes a few minutes to set up through the Alexa app. Once it’s connected, the plug will automatically reconnect after a power outage or Wi-Fi problem.</p>



<p>The small size of 2.2 inches deep by 3.2 inches wide by 1.5 inches high k<strong>eeps your second outlet free</strong> for another plug or device. This is more important than you might think because a lot of smart plugs are too big to fit in both outlets so you have to choose which device to use. The plug works with any household item that runs on 120 volts, from table lamps and fans to coffee makers and holiday lights. You can also<strong> use the Alexa app to set up routines</strong> that link together different tasks: For example, when you say <em>“Alexa, I’m home,”</em> your entryway lights will turn on and your coffee maker will start.</p>
<p>You can control devices from anywhere in your home <strong>without getting up because the plug works with Alexa’s voice control system</strong>, and you can also control <strong>everything from the Alexa app when you’re not home</strong>. This lets you turn off devices you forgot about or make it look like someone is home while you’re away. You can set your lights to turn on at sunset or your fan to turn off after two hours without having to remember.</p>
<p>For $12, this is a great deal for making your current devices smart instead of buying expensive new ones that are already connected. A smart lamp usually costs $50 to $100 more than a regular lamp: With this plug, you can add the same features to any lamp you already own for a lot less money. Black Friday is the best time to buy them if you want to automate several outlets in your home without spending hundreds of dollars on separate smart devices.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bose QuietComfort Headphones Are Now Priced Like Budget Earbuds, 43% Cut Leaves Zero Margin Behind]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-popular-bose-quietcomfort-noise-cancelling-headphones-are-back-to-its-lowest-price-ever-for-black-friday-2000648466</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="146" data-end="748">The holiday season is in full swing, with city streets glowing under festive winter lights and all of us eagerly searching for the perfect gifts for friends, family, and loved ones. Black Friday weekend has officially arrived, too, bringing some of the year’s most attractive deals on popular tech products. One standout offer on Amazon features a major discount on a top-rated pair of Bose headphones. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6081/">For a limited time, the Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth headphones are available at an impressive 43% off</a>. The price has dropped from the usual $349 to just $199, giving you a substantial $150 in savings.</p>
<p data-start="750" data-end="1214">People who spend lots of time on public transportation or endure frequent flights can really benefit tremendously from a solid pair of noise-canceling headphones. The Bose QuietComfort headphones can help you create a calm, focused soundscape by removing unwanted background noises. Enjoy you music, podcasts, audiobooks, or any other audio without being interrupted by the bustle of everyday life.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6081/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="750" data-end="1214">How Does Noise Cancellation Work?</h2>
<p data-start="1216" data-end="1714">The underlying technology of noise cancellation is pretty ingenious. Built-in microphones positioned on the outside of the headphones listen to the sounds around you. The headphones then generate soundwaves that mirror incoming noise but invert those waves. When the original noise and the inverted signal meet, they effectively cancel each other out. This process reduces these distracting background noises significantly, leaving only the audio coming from your connected device.</p>
<p data-start="1716" data-end="2199">The Bose QuietComfort headphones offer two distinct listening modes: Quiet and Aware. Quiet mode engages full noise cancellation, ideal for situations where total focus is desired. Aware mode, on the other hand, allows outside sounds to flow through naturally. This option is good for when staying alert to one’s surroundings is important, like working in an office and someone might need to get your attention or when navigating busy areas where hearing traffic and other activity is key for your own safety.</p>


<p data-start="1716" data-end="2199">The plush padding of the over-ear cushions and headband are designed for all-day comfort—and you might even be finding yourself wearing them all day with the exceptional battery life.</p>
<p data-start="1716" data-end="2199">The headphones can provide a full 24 hours of listening time on a single charge. This will keep you able to listen to your favorite turns through your whole commute, entire work day, and commute home. If you every find yourself having forgotten to charge the headphones, no sweat. Plugging in the Bose QuietComfort headphones for just 15 minutes will grant you up to two and a half additional hours of playtime. The headphones charge over USB-C.</p>
<p data-start="2201" data-end="2672">The QuietComfort headphones come in a wide assortment of colors, so you can choose a style that suits your preference. Options include cypress green, chilled lilac, petal pink, twilight blue, sandstone, moonlight gray, white smoke, and a classic black. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6081/">All of these colors are priced at the discounted $199 level for Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</a></p>
