There have also been rumors about a remake of the OG game. Now, Halo Studios, formerly 343 Industries, has stepped forward to explain that it will provide actual information later this year. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195371" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Long-Lost Halo Demo Comes To Life" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="109" data-playlist="195371,196909,195840" data-current="195371"><div><p>Long-Lost Halo Demo Comes To Life</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195371/195371_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20829.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-halo-ce-remaster-forza-horizon-6-gears-1851784012&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-halo-ce-remaster-forza-horizon-6-gears-1851784012">Earlier this month</a></span>, Xbox boss Phil Spencer ended the company’s Summer Showcase with a tease for what’s coming in 2026, promising a new <em>Fable</em>, a new <em>Gears of War</em>, the next <em>Forza</em>, and hinting at <em>Halo</em> by saying: “and the return of a classic that’s been with us since the beginning.” This followed reports that <em>Halo</em> would leap to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/halo-master-chief-collection-ps5-switch-2-port-1851737175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/halo-master-chief-collection-ps5-switch-2-port-1851737175">PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025.</a></span><em> Gears of War</em> is making that leap later this year, so it seems plausible Halo might do the same. The rumors and speculation have grown so large that Halo Studios has directly addressed them in a new blog post. </p><p>On June 30, Halo Studios Esports Lead Tahir “Tashi” Hasandjekic <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/halowc25-june&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/halowc25-june" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared a blog post</a></span> about the <em>Halo </em>World Championship happening in October and how people can buy tickets for the event. But the blog post also addressed all the speculation about <em>Halo</em>. </p><p>“Over the past few weeks, there’s been a fair amount of speculation about when and where more details might emerge about any of the multiple projects Halo Studios is actively working on,” said Tashi. “We don’t usually comment on such matters, but this time we want to enter the chat and share a little more perspective for <em>Halo </em>fans who might be on the fence about whether to attend this year’s event.”<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/halo-6-infinite-unreal-engine-ue5-ce-remake-343-1851666611?_gl=1*ot29lu*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTEzMTQ0NzAkbzE2MSRnMCR0MTc1MTMxNDY0NCRqNTckbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/halo-6-infinite-unreal-engine-ue5-ce-remake-343-1851666611?_gl=1*ot29lu*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTEzMTQ0NzAkbzE2MSRnMCR0MTc1MTMxNDY0NCRqNTckbDAkaDA.">Tashi explained that last October</a></span>, during <em>Halo </em>WC, the studio unveiled “A New Dawn,” a short video revealing the news that 343 was becoming Halo Studios and shifting to Unreal Engine. He further explained that “A New Dawn” was “just the beginning” and that at this year’s <em>Halo </em>WC, the team “look(s) forward to continuing the conversation.”</p><p>“Speculation is always fun, but if you want the official scoop on what Halo Studios has been working on, you won’t want to miss this year’s<em> Halo </em>World Championship,” said Tashi. “We really hope you’ll join us in Seattle this October!”</p><p>So <em>Halo </em>might be coming to PS5. There might be a remake of <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> happening. There might be more to share beyond that. But we have to wait until October to find out. Ironically Tashi’s post, meant to address speculation, will likely lead to even <em>more </em>speculation<em> </em>and rumors appearing online. October can’t come soon enough. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/halo-wc-october-remake-remaster-news-trailer-rumor-xbox-1851785384]]></content:encoded>

While they might look the same, choosing between an Alpha or Beta version of an armor is important. The choice is even more difficult now that the first Gamma set has been added.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It is admittedly daunting when the disparities aren’t instantly obvious. I know I struggled at first trying to understand what was different or better. Luckily, it’s easier than you think! Let’s go over Alpha, Beta, and the new Gamma armors.</p><h2 id="h859"><a id=""></a>Alpha vs Beta Armor</h2><p>Aside from a handful of armor sets, most have an Alpha set and a Beta set. Discerning the differences between the two can be hard at first glance. Although they have slightly altered colors, that doesn’t matter as you can customize your armor pigments. They even share the same defense and resistance values.</p><p>Skills and slots are where the armor types differ the most. <strong>Alpha armor will give you more preset equipment skills, while Beta armor will instead give you extra and/or higher-level Decoration slots.</strong> Beta pieces are the preferred option for creating a custom build. If you don’t have any worthwhile decoration pieces for your proposed build or simply don’t enjoy going super in-depth with these mechanics, sticking with Alpha can be a viable option. As an example, let’s compare the same Rey Dau armor piece across both variants:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Rey Sandgreaves Alpha:</strong> Provides a single level-three Decoration slot and both Latent Power and Maximum Might as level-one skills</li><li><strong>Rey Sandgreaves Beta:</strong> Provides a single level-three Decoration slot, two level-one Decoration slots, and the Latent Power skill at level-one</li></ul><p>You’ll receive a different Group Skill depending on which set you use. Rey Dau Alpha Armor has the <em>Inspiration</em> Group Skill, while the Beta Armor has the <em>Resuscitate</em> Group Skill. Both of these do have the same Armor Set Bonus Skill with <em>Rey Dau’s Voltage</em>.</p><h2 id="h860"><a id=""></a>Is Gamma Armor Better?</h2><figure id="" data-id="817ca5fd2a9b4f48309f1027a69c2432" data-recommend-id="image://817ca5fd2a9b4f48309f1027a69c2432" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Forge/Upgrade Armor screen, showing a hunter in Rey Dau Gamma armor and highlighting the Rey Sandgreaves Gamma piece." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Forge/Upgrade Armor screen, showing a hunter in Rey Dau Gamma armor and highlighting the Rey Sandgreaves Gamma piece." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="817ca5fd2a9b4f48309f1027a69c2432" data-recommend-id="image://817ca5fd2a9b4f48309f1027a69c2432" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Forge/Upgrade Armor screen, showing a hunter in Rey Dau Gamma armor and highlighting the Rey Sandgreaves Gamma piece." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Depending on the monster, you might have more armor options than just Alpha or Beta. Arch-Tempered monsters, for example, can reward you with a unique material to forge Gamma Armor. The only example of this so far is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762">Arch-Tempered Rey Dau</a></span>, so we’ll be using that monster’s set to estimate what’s different.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-mon-hun-arch-tempered-rey-dau-1851782762"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>’ Electric Wyvern Is Harder To Beat IN Its New Form, But It Can Be Done</a></span></p><p><strong>Gamma Armor can best be described as a set that stands out with higher defense values, higher-level equipment skills, and a brand-new Group Skill.</strong> Let’s go over how it changes the same leg piece that we compared before:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Rey Sandgreaves Gamma:</strong> Provides eight more defense, a single level-three Decoration slot, the Stun Resistance skill at level three, and the Stamina Surge skill at level two.</li></ul><p>It seem like Beta Armor is still the best for personal builds. If you love to get into the nitty-gritty of customizing decoration slots, I can’t argue with that. However, I will point out that the entire Rey Dau Gamma Armor set still has the same equipment skills as the prior versions. They even match the highest levels or exceed them from either set. The only difference is that they’re spread out differently among the five pieces.</p><p>Even though the enhanced defense and skills are great, one of Gamma Armor’s will always give you more options. Pairing pieces from Alpha and Beta sets can feel pretty monotonous since they share the same equipment skills. Gamma Armor genuinely feels different due to the mixed skill placements, allowing for more variance with entirely separate pieces or even some from the beta set. I know I’ve had a lot of fun running a mix of Gamma and Beta Rey Dau armor.</p><p>It all depends on how you like to play at the end of the day. Some hunters like using precise skills, and others just like seeing big damage numbers. Choose the pieces that fit you best and have some fun!</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-armor-alpha-beta-gamma-arch-1851785351]]></content:encoded>

However, the game’s publisher collapsed in 2003, and the nearly finished game was canned.</p><p><em>Hollywood Hypnotics</em> features point-and-click adventure game-like mechanics as well as some 2D platforming. It is a Game Boy Advance game based on a kids’ cartoon. Of <em>course</em>, it has some 2D platforming in it! That was the law back then. The unfinished build is fully playable on modern GBA emulators. I tested it out and it worked perfectly. </p><p>The plot of the game revolves around Warner siblings Yakko, Wakko, and Dot trying to stop the famous lab mice Pinky and the Brain from turning the iconic WB Water Tower—where the trio live in the animated series—into a rocket, with the nefarious duo using hypnosis to make their evil plan happen.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/animaniacs-90s-cartoon-gba-game-canceled-found-wb-saved-1851785377]]></content:encoded>
