              <p>Something simple you can do to your home to feel a bit safer is install a home security system. One or more outdoor cameras can bring you peace of mind, allowing you to monitor your home and keep it safe from unwanted intruders. Heck, even just having a visible camera attached to your house can be enough to deter someone from stepping onto your property. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4873/">Reolink as both a 5MP and 8MP security camera that’s solar-powered and happens to be part of an Amazon limited time deal. Right now, you can get either of these outdoor cameras for 27% off.</a> That brings the 5MP model down from $120 to $88, saving you $32 and the 8MP camera down from $150 to just $110, saving you $40.</p>
<p>The 5MP Reolink security camera is capable of recording in a detailed resolution of over 2K while the 8MP can capture even more details, recording in full 4K. The cameras work both day and night as they have support for night vision. And this isn’t that crappy kind of night vision you see in the movies. This records in full color even after dark.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4873/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The 2K+ and 4K security cameras can pan and tilt, able to survey nearly a full 360 degrees. You’ll be able to view the the full extent of your property right from your laptop, phone, or tablet.</p>
<h2>Security Camera That Powers Itself</h2>
<p>The Reolink security camera system is solar-powered, which of the three ways to power a security camera is clearly the best. Lots of wireless security cameras are battery powered, so over time you’ll need to get the ladder out of the garage and up high to replace the batteries. A wired solution will never run out of charge, but you’re now limited in where you mount it to somewhere nearby an outdoor outlet. Solar power is the best of both worlds. The freedom to install it anywhere you need with the convenience of setting it up once and letting it just do it’s thing.</p>



<p>Just 10 minutes of daylight is enough to power the Reolink security camera systema full 24 hours. Five hours of sunlight will give it enough juice to run for up to four months, so no need to worry about a cloudy or rainy day every once in a while.</p>
<p>Installation is easy as pie. It’s wire-free and just clicks into place inside its mount. Should take your no more than five minutes of your day.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! Today, we’re talking about a viral misquote from Mario’s dad, getting an update on the<em> Sleeping Dogs</em> movie, finding out why <em>Dead Cells 2</em> was never made, and checking out the duck-themed extraction shooter that is also the latest Steam sensation. Oh, and it’s Monday. Boo! But hey, not every day can be as cool as Saturday. Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <h2><strong>An Inaccurate Miyamoto Quote About Old Games Went Viral Over The Weekend</strong></h2> <p>On Sunday, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/stealth40k.bsky.social">video game collector and content creator Stealth40K</a> shared a quote from a recent interview with Mario creator and legendary game designer Shigeru Miyamoto about old games becoming unplayable and movies lasting forever. “Games eventually stop running when newer versions come out, but films remain forever,” was the quote shared by the account.</p>

 <p>The post, now deleted, quickly went viral online, as many thought it was very funny that someone from Nintendo, a company that has made it very difficult to preserve and emulate old games, would seemingly moan about retro titles becoming unplayable one day. Lots of takes were shared and jokes made. Except there was one problem: The quote was potentially inaccurate and possibly taken out of context.</p>

 <p>As pointed out by many, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/erasu.bsky.social/post/3m3kwej7aqk2g">including Erasu on Bluesky</a>, the quote Stealth40K shared online was from a press release that seemingly pulled a quote from a longer answer from a <a href="https://www.ndw.jp/nintendomuseum-interview-240925/">September 2024 interview</a> <em>Nintendo Dream Web </em>conducted with Miyamoto that delved into Nintendo IP, preserving old games, and using movies and other media to keep characters like Mario around, even as old games become harder to access. Of course, the original quote has to be translated, so unless you natively speak Japanese or ask the designer himself, it’s impossible to fully understand what Miyamoto meant, but here’s a translation of the full quote:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“Ultimately, what people remember are the IPs. Games become obsolete when new versions come out. But that’s incredibly sad. We started video production partly because of that sadness -seeing our creations become playable only on Virtual Console. Even making them playable in a museum has its limits, but video content can endure forever. I envision more and more of these things accumulating, making Nintendo itself a huge brand.”</p></blockquote> <p>And to be clear: I’m not 100 percent sure this translated version of the interview is exactly what Miyamoto meant, or <a href="https://english.kyodonews.net/articles/-/63038">if the quote included in the press release</a> was an accurate translation or a completely new quote from Miyamoto reiterating the point he made back in 2024. But what I can tell you for a fact is that you should be careful when you see a juicy quote from a famous person or creator, as it’s possible that it’s not accurate or that it’s taken completely out of context. Be careful out there, folks.</p>

 <h2><strong>New Report Reveals More About The Rumored <em>Resident Evil 0</em> Remake&nbsp;</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-resident-evil-0-remake-in-development-new-casting-and-plot-details-unearthed">A new report from <em>MP1st</em> corroborates</a> previous rumors and reports about Capcom’s work on a <em>Resident Evil 0</em> remake. The outlet claims that<em> Guardians of the Galaxy</em> video game voice actor Jon McLaren is involved with the project, which is codenamed Project Chamber. It’s believed he will star as Billy Coen, one of the game’s co-protagonists. The report also details some changes the remake is allegedly making to the source material, though the reported info is a bit spoilery, so I’ll let you read the full article if you want to learn more.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This new Resident Evil Zero Remake leak/rumor is true, and I believe the first real details on RE:0 shared online outside me talking about it's existence, delay, change of hands on developer, &amp; 2028 release window previously:<a href="https://t.co/xMKCsDyyvI">https://t.co/xMKCsDyyvI</a></p> <p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1980233514579845448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Dusk Golem, a well-known Capcom and<em> Resident Evil</em> insider who has a solid track record, shared the report on Twitter and claimed it was accurate. The unannounced<em> RE0 </em>remake is reportedly launching sometime in 2028, following a previously reported <em>Code Veronica</em> remake that is in development.</p>

 <h2><strong>New Duck-Themed Extraction Shooter Sells Half A Million Copies In 72 Hours</strong></h2> <p>Here’s a great reminder that you can’t predict what will be successful on Steam. <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3167020/charts/"><em>Escape From Duckov</em></a>, a top-down single-player extraction shooter starring cute little ducks, has sold over <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/escape-from-duckov-crosses-500000-sales-in-3-days">500,000 copies in three days</a>. Wowza! Meanwhile, over on SteamDB, the game reached 180k concurrent players over the weekend. That makes it one of the most popular games on the platform, putting it above giants like <em>Rust </em>and <em>Grand Theft Auto V.</em> Will people still be playing the game in two weeks, or will everyone move on to some other new viral game? No idea, but for now at least, some cute ducks with guns have taken over Steam.</p> <h2><strong>The <em>Sleeping Dogs</em> Movie Has A Finished Script</strong></h2> <p>For nearly <a href="https://deadline.com/2017/03/donnie-yen-sleeping-dogs-neal-moritz-original-film-1201948700/">a decade now,</a> Square Enix and Hollywood have been trying to make a movie based on 2012’s open-world action game <em>Sleeping Dogs</em>. Over the weekend the film’s star, Simu Liu, posted a screenshot of the completed <em>Sleeping Dogs</em> script. So it seems like people are still trying to make a <em>Sleeping Dogs</em> movie. Good luck, I guess.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">in honour of our sleeping dogs script draft being done, here’s my sleepy dog 👍 <a href="https://t.co/l1KsFNDj5V">pic.twitter.com/l1KsFNDj5V</a></p> <p>— Simu Liu (@SimuLiu) <a href="https://twitter.com/SimuLiu/status/1979664278459388314?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2><strong><em>Dead Cells 2</em> Isn’t A Thing Because The Devs Ignored Fan Demands And Made Something New</strong></h2> <p>A lot of people love 2018’s roguelike platformer <em>Dead Cells.</em> A lot of those people would love a sequel. Instead, developer Motion Twin went and made a different follow-up game called <em>Windblown</em> that people seem to like as well, but not nearly as much as <em>Dead Cells.</em> And Motion Twin’s co-creative director and designer, Yannick Berthier, doesn’t seem to mind.</p> <p>“We are driven by what we want to make,” <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/dead-cells/2-why-it-never-happened">Berthier told <em>PCGamesN</em> in a recent interview</a>. “If we were a ‘business,’ we would be talking about <em>Dead Cells 2</em> right now. We are not talking about <em>Dead Cells 2.</em> We are talking about <em>Windblown</em>, because we are a collective of individuals that are creative and want to create stuff. [If] we would have been [part of] another company, maybe the pressure to do a sequel would have been way, way stronger – I mean, internally. Externally, it’s super strong. Every post we do, we tend to have a few comments like, ‘OK, cool, when <em>Dead Cells 2?</em>‘ But it’s fine. That’s our reality.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-mortal-kombat-mod-2000636690">Someone turned <em>Red Dead 2</em> into <em>Mortal Kombat</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reverts-conquest-ticket-change-48-hours-angry-backlash-2000636658"><em>Battlefield 6</em> reverted its big Conquest change after just 2 days</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-rog-xbox-ally-x-pc-gaming-handheld-comparison-2000636643">The Switch 2 stands toe-to-toe with the $1,000 ROG Xbox Ally X</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

              <p>There’s no reason for you to spend over $1,000, or even over $500, on a reliable everyday laptop. No, we’re not talking about a refurbished machine or one from a brand hardly anyone’s ever heard of.</p>
<p>We’re bargain hunters, and we just spotted a hard-to-miss deal. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4872/">Amazon is offering the 14-inch Asus Vivobook Full HD laptop for just $480, which is a full 40% off its original price.</a> It was already quite affordable at $800, but grabbing it for less than $500 is practically a steal. Like most good discounts, we don’t expect it to last long, so we recommend grabbing one for yourself sooner rather than later.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>You know, about 24 hours ago I had every intention of pitching a post for </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> about how I could finally forgive </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-celestial-guardians-alolan-raichu-1851777665"><span>Alolan Raichu</span></a><span>, the surfing, psychic, pancake-loving regional variant of my favorite Pokémon, for its crimes. For many years, I have looked upon Alolan Raichu with disdain as it usurped the Kanto original as The Pokémon Company’s favorite Pikachu evolution. The Alolan mouse was featured in </span><i><span>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</span></i><span>, is a playable character in the MOBA </span><i><span>Pokémon Unite</span></i><span>, and received some significant promo in the anime and </span><i><span>Sun </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span>. Meanwhile, my boy’s legacy </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-raichu-alolan-pikachu-anime-1851011570"><span>has mostly seen him overshadowed by his own pre-evolution</span></a><span>, and this all began with an episode of the anime that painted him as inferior to Pikachu in battle decades ago. Then, Game Freak announced he was getting not one, but </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>two Mega Evolutions</span></a><span> in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s DLC</span></a><span>. For a moment, it seemed Raichu would finally get some respect put on his name. I’d decided I could finally forgive Alolan Raichu for stealing the spotlight and let the electric rats coexist in my mind…until this little shit showed up in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> with the audacity of someone who’s never been told “no” in his life.</span></p> <p><span>If you’re wondering where Alolan Raichu is in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, know it is only available in the post-game. I hadn’t given the regional variant much thought until I was heading to do a quest in Lumiose City. There I was, walking toward the Quasartico Inc. building minding my own business, Raichu by my side, when all of a sudden, I see this agitating, dopey, maple-syrup-smelling twerp hovering alongside a woman on the way in. “Pshaw!” I say in my mind as the side quest marker hovers above them, as if inviting me to inquire about this odd-looking rodent when I have spent 30 hours having only seen Raichus that are orange and have their feet planted firmly on the ground. I know who you are, Alolan Raichu, and you’re a war criminal. But then I think, maybe if I do this side quest, they’ll go away and I won’t have to see them next time I come to Quasartico’s office. So I speak to the woman. She introduces herself as Griddella, a member of CHARGE, or “Committee to Highlight Alolan Raichu and Generate Excitement.” I guess even serial killers have fandoms.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000637260" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637260"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637260">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Griddella asks if our Raichus can battle, and she wants to make some ceremony of it. I have to remove all my other Pokémon from my party before I can complete the quest, so it’s just me and Raichu against Griddella and the Pocket Monster equivalent of Bizarro from </span><i><span>Superman</span></i><span>. The Alolan Raichu we face is decently powerful at level 64, but my guy’s at level 70 and we just finished the endgame, so we’ve faced much tougher foes than this imposter. Raichu smacks Alolan Raichu around the field a bit and then Griddella congratulates us on our win. Alright, cool. Kanto Raichu supremacy has been established. Let’s get back to what we were doing, Raichu. But no, Griddella’s not done with us yet, as she then asks a baffling question: “Let’s trade: your Raichu for my Alolan Raichu! What do you say?”</span></p> <p><span>What do I say, Griddella? I say “Hell fucking no, are you kidding me?” But the game only lets me say “No thanks,” so you will never hear the disgust with which I decline your insult of an offer. Not only have I gone to hell and back with this guy throughout </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s story, but he also just whooped your faker’s ass in the middle of a crowded area of Lumiose City. Why would I reward my king’s loyalty and strength by giving him to you for this second-rate phony? He’s been with me since Day One, and we have journeyed through every region of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe together, saving the day while this guy serves pancakes to people in Alola. When the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC comes out, he’s finally going to undergo Mega Evolution like he should have a decade ago. The Pokémon Company may not respect him, but I do. I’ll never trade my OG for a pretender. Even if it means I’ve gotta see him every time I go to Quasartico’s building because they will not leave unless I make the trade. Guess that quest’s not getting finished. “Ken, just catch another Raichu and trade it.” No! It’s the principle!</span></p>

              <p>If you’re out there making content for TikTok or Instagram Reels, there’s one small change you can implement to your work that will make a world of difference. Get a microphone. Seriously. Creators underestimate the importance of good audio. Whether you’re filming simple vlogs from the comfort of your couch or conducting one of those man-on-the-street styled interviews. Those watching are going to notice your sound quality. They may not even be directly aware of it, but on an unconscious level, they might get the feeling your content seems subpar, but can’t exactly point to why. 9 times out of 10, it’s the audio. Nip that in the bud with a set high-quality lavalier microphone that’s on sale.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4871/"> Right now, the DJI Mic Mini two-person vlog bundle is down 34%, bringing the price from $119 top just $79.</a> I don’t know about you, but saving $40 sound pretty good to me.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4871/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Tiny But Mighty</h2>
<p>These wireless microphones are low-profile without sacrificing quality. They are ultralight, weighing only 10 grams. They are discreet and aesthetically pleasing on camera, plus they’re easy and comfortable to wear.</p>
<p>Each mic is capable of delivering high-quality sound to the receiver at a maximum transmission range of up to 400 meters. That’s a quarter mile away from the receiver you can be.</p>



<p>They’re great for recording in bustling outdoor environments like a busy street or a crowded convention. That’s because each mic is capable of pro-level noise cancelling. It can be set to two different mode of intensity. Basic is good for quiet indoor settings while the strong mode is ideal when outside in a noisy environment. They are also able to automatically limit the volume input if it detects the sound being too high. This prevents clipping and can be an absolute lifesaver when it comes to editing your content.</p>
<p>The DJI Mic Minis can be connected to your own greater DJI OsmoAudio ecosystem. pair them easily with an Osmo Action 5 Pro without even needing the receiver.</p>
<p>Each transmitter and receiver come with a long battery life so you can stay out there and film for as long as you need for the day. The DJI Mic Minis offer a maximum operating time of up to 10 hours on a single charge. Great for interviews and livestreaming that may go on for a while.</p>

              <p>A good Bluetooth speaker is one of those things that everyone should just have. Whether you’re heading to the park with some friends and planning to listen to some music while you hang or are just at home folding laundry and catching up on the latest episode of your favorite podcast, you’re gonna want a solid speaker. The JBL Clip 3 isn’t the latest model, but it still produces quality sound at an inexpensive price point. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4870/">Amazon has the Bluetooth speaker on sale right now so you can get one for 16% off</a>. It’s normally listed at $45, but for a limited time you can grab yours for just $38. That’s not too steep of a savings, but hey, $7 is still $7.</p>
<p>JBL has a built a name for itself in the world of portable Bluetooth speakers. With the JBL Clip 3, you can expect big sound from a small speaker that can clip onto your bag or belt. Yes, that’s where the name comes from. This ultra-compact speaker has a carabiner clip built into the side of it so you can hang it on your person or perhaps the back of your beach chair so it doesn’t have to sit in the sand.</p>

<h2>Bring Great Sound Anywhere</h2>
<p>Take it to the beach or even poolside as the JBL Clip 3 is waterproof. No need to worry about a little splash, spill, or rain. Heck, the whole thing can even be fully immersed in water and come out fine. The exterior is made with a durable fabric material and a rugged rubber house to protect it, even if it gets dropped onto hard concrete.</p>
<p>Battery life is reliably long. It wouldn’t be that great of a portable speaker if it had to spend most of its time plugged into an outlet. Well, the rechargeable lithium ion battery can hold onto a full 10 hours of playtime on a single charge.</p>



<p>If you want to take a call form your phone, you can do so while connected to the Bluetooth speaker. The JBL Clip 3 even has noise and echo-cancelling so when using it as a speaker phone, the folks on the other end will be able to hear you crystal clear.</p>
<p>JBL speakers come in a large assortment of colors and the JBL Clip 3 is no different. A couple are out of stock, but you can still pick between gray, blue, red, sand, white, yellow, green or even camo patterns in both black or green. All of which are currently on sale for the low price of just $38.</p>
