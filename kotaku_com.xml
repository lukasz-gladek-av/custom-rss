            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive spent the last week teasing a big announcement, and now it’s finally been revealed: <em>Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival</em>. The first proper, single-player adaptation of the famous horror franchise showcases the return of Pinhead actor Doug Bradley and includes a red-band version of the trailer you won’t find on YouTube.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Discover the tale of Aidan, who must unlock the dark powers of the Genesis Configuration, a mysterious puzzle box, to save his girlfriend from a hellish abyss,” reads the official description for <em>Hellraiser</em>. “Playing as Aidan, you will harness the box’s infernal abilities in order to survive your pact with the sinister Pinhead and battle against the twisted cult that worships him and his Cenobites. Fail, and your suffering will become a legend, even in Hell.”</p><p>Horror makes me queasy, and I’ve never been able to sit through an entire <em>Hellraiser</em> movie before. So, it didn’t take much for the game’s first official trailer to gross me out. But the real <em>Hellraiser: Revival</em> trailer is actually only hosted on the game’s website. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://hellraisergame.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://hellraisergame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">It does not hold back</a></span>. I can’t embed that one, though, so here’s the YouTube version:</p><p>It shows Aiden and his unnamed girlfriend having sex before she solves the puzzle box, summons the Cenobites, and is subsequently ripped apart by chains as the extra-dimensional, sadomasochistic cult is wont to do. Taking the women in refrigerators trope to new hellish depths, we then get a quick sizzle reel of Aiden using melee weapons to beat the crap out of various monstrosities. No release date was teased, but it’s coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. </p><p> Saber Interactive is making <em>Hellraiser: Revival </em>with Boss Team Games, who it previously collaborated with for<em> Evil Dead: The Game</em>. However, that adaptation, which featured the return of Bruce Campbell but faced mixed reviews over its lack of content, was primarily an asymmetric multiplayer game. <em>Hellraiser: Revival</em> looking like a traditional first-person action adventure should be a lot more reassuring to fans who want another story in that universe rather than another knock-off of<em> Dead by Daylight</em>. </p><p>Saber Interactive confirms this is a brand-new Hellraiser story within the established canon. The most recent film was the 2022 reboot directed by David Bruckner. While no sequel has been announced, one is reportedly in the works. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hellraiser-pinhead-doug-bradley-red-band-trailer-saber-1851786676]]></content:encoded>

That’s to say nothing of the Disney+ show <em>Ironheart</em>, which felt like it was just unceremoniously dropped on the service with little promotion or fanfare. In righting the ship, Marvel just can’t seem to hit smooth sailing.</p><p>Naturally, then, with the release of the studios newest movie, <em>The Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>, there’s bound to be some good old-fashioned hand-wringing about the state of the MCU. On paper, the movie is splashy and full of exciting talent. <em>WandaVision</em>—one of the MCU’s biggest successes of what we’ll call its “expansion era”—director Matt Shakman is at the helm, joined by a quartet of beloved actors in the form of Pedro Pascal as Mr. Fantastic/Reed Richards, Vanessa Kirby as the Invisible Woman/Sue Storm, Joseph Quinn as the Human Torch/Johnny Storm, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach as The Thing/Ben Grimm. From a visual perspective, it boasts a <em>Jetsons</em>-like retro-futurism that’s both timeless and an exciting departure from much of Marvel’s recent output. Shakman also committed to a (welcome) sense of practicality, with an “emphasis on practical sets and props,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/fantastic-four-first-steps-space-race-kubrick-exclusive/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.empireonline.com/movies/news/fantastic-four-first-steps-space-race-kubrick-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">per a report from <em>Empire</em></a></span>. All of these signs point to exciting, well, <em>first steps</em> toward ensuring the film is of the utmost quality.</p><p>Yet, <em>Fantastic Four</em> arrives with a healthy dose of concern, under some pretty burdensome circumstances. At once, it’s one of the handful of projects that fell under the great reshuffle, the third reboot of Marvel’s first family in 20 years, and one of the last solo Marvel movies before the release of <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em> in December 2026. That last point is especially pertinent, as the lead villain for the upcoming <em>Avengers</em> is none other than <em>Fantastic Four</em> antagonist, Doctor Doom, which means <em>Fantastic Four</em> has to do some more heavy lifting than, say, <em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings.</em></p><p>Played by Robert Downey Jr, in a decision that still reads as a desperate attempt at chasing the heyday of MCU years’ past, Doctor Doom <em>is</em> an incredible foe, when done correctly. Doom and Reed’s relationship is richly layered. In comic books, their rivalry dates back to their days at college, where they become bitter rivals with a begrudging respect for one another. They’re mirror images of one another, with Doom isolating himself from others while Reed embraces friends and family. They can’t exist without each other, forged forever in a fire of spite and anger, with Doom refusing to acknowledge that Reed is his superior. This often involves Doom trying to drag Reed down to his level, not unlike the Joker trying to pull Batman into having one bad day.</p><p>The relationship between Doom and Reed informs the backbone of <em>Secret Wars</em>, written by Jonathan Hickman with art by Esad Ribić. After a series of multiversal impacts tear the fabric of reality apart, Doctor Doom manages to salvage the existing universes into a patchwork reality. The culmination of the story involves Reed and Doom facing off, where Doom eventually admits that his tried and true foe would have found a proper way to restore all the disparate universes. Here, at the end of all things, Doom realizes that all his faculties are nothing in the face of Reed.</p><p>With the MCU looking to adapt—either directly or in parts—that very same <em>Secret Wars </em>story in the next two <em>Avengers</em> films, the future of Marvel storytelling hangs on the success of <em>Fantastic Four</em>.</p><p><em>Fantastic Four</em> needs to be a hit. Not only to prove that non-<em>Avengers</em> Marvel movies still have the juice, but to set up the Four and Reed as critical figures before introducing Doom. It’s telling that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZXBFirj6b4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aZXBFirj6b4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the famed chair video</a></span>, which revealed the expansive cast of the movie, Pedro Pascal’s chair appeared right before Downey Jr’s, seemingly indicating the pair will be critically important to the next <em>Avengers</em> films, a fact confirmed by Shakman who told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/news/fantastic-four-director-interview-matt-shakman-casting-auditions-1236461087/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/fantastic-four-director-interview-matt-shakman-casting-auditions-1236461087/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Variety</em></a></span> that Reed will be <em>leading</em> the Avengers by the time it’s all said and done. Audiences need to invest in Pascal’s performance as Reed for the emotional throughline of <em>Doomsday</em> and <em>Secret Wars</em> to work. Those <em>Avengers</em> movies may not hit the financial pinnacles of the pre-pandemic success of <em>Infinity War </em>and <em>Endgame</em>, but Disney’s surely counting on them to get as close as humanly possible.</p><p>Every Marvel movie this year has faced some level of concern. But <em>Fantastic Four</em> feels like it has so much riding on it. With such a large gap between this film and <em>Doomsday</em>, a sour note could be the thing that causes the worm to turn on Marvel writ large. But if done right, it’s the buoying force that could sustain a new level of optimism and enthusiasm for the MCU just when it’s needed the most.</p><p>Marvel Comics achieved tremendous success when Stan Lee and Jack Kirby introduced the Fantastic Four in 1961. Now, almost 64 years later, the MCU is looking to four intrepid heroes to do so once again, ushering in a new era of excitement. Will history repeat itself?</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-dr-doom-doomsday-avengers-1851786672]]></content:encoded>
