              <p><span>In the wake of the assassination last week of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk, the Trump administration and other reactionary movements have wielded the act as a tool to silence critics of Kirk’s views, and those who are critical of the Trump administration more broadly. One of the most highly publicized instances of this was Disney-owned ABC’s pulling of </span><i><span>Jimmy Kimmel Live</span></i><span>, following pressure from the FCC, after the talk show ran a segment that said the Trump administration had latched onto the event in order to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aHT7ICvMtlA"><span>“score political points.”</span></a><span> In response, several public figures have spoken out in protest, including some actors who have prominently worked for Disney by appearing in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</span></p> <p><span>Marisa Tomei, who plays Spider-Man’s Aunt May in the superhero franchise, took to Instagram to urge people to boycott Disney, including the Marvel movies she starred in, from </span><i><span>Captain America: Civil War </span></i><span>in 2016 to </span><i><span>Spider-Man: No Way Home </span></i><span>in 2021. May was killed in the last </span><i><span>Spider-Man </span></i><span>movie by the Green Goblin, and given that her death was a thematic pillar of the film, it was unlikely that Tomei would have been asked to reprise the role, but still, speaking out against one of the most powerful companies in modern media isn’t nothing.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Marisa Tomei reshares post urging for the boycott of Disney brands. <a href="https://t.co/7Ni0CSu3ui">pic.twitter.com/7Ni0CSu3ui</a></p> <p>— Buzzing Pop (@BuzzingPop) <a href="https://twitter.com/BuzzingPop/status/1968833688759591240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 19, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>Meanwhile Tatiana Maslany, the actor behind the titular hero of </span><i><span>She-Hulk: Attorney at Law</span></i><span>, posted on social media urging people to cancel their Disney+ subscriptions. Maslany’s post was even more pointed, with her Instagram story featuring a photo of her in a motion capture suit while shooting the </span><i><span>She-Hulk </span></i><span>series.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Not everyone would risk their entire career for what’s right. Tatiana Maslany just did.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning. Zack here, filling in as your host today for your regularly scheduled Ethan edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily roundup of news and other stuff you might care about. Let’s get through this thing together, and then at the end we can listen to some music and celebrate the upcoming weekend.</p> <h2><strong><em>Battlefield 6</em> contains a big list of licensed songs and a lot of Limb Bizkit</strong></h2> <p>According to a new <em>Battlefield 6</em> leak, <a href="https://x.com/BFBulletin/status/1968725668042063960">as reported by <em>Battlefield Bulletin</em>,</a> the upcoming military shooter contains a surprisingly large list of licensed music. <em>BF Bulletin</em> says these songs will be played on the radio when driving in-game vehicles, but EA has yet to confirm any of this. Here’s the track listing, which contains three different songs credited to Limp Bizkit. Seriously.</p> <ul> <li>“Awake” – Godsmack</li> <li>“Bodies” – Drowning Pool</li> <li>“Break Stuff” – Limp Bizkit</li> <li>“Can’t Stop” – Red Hot Chili Peppers</li> <li>“Domination” – Pantera</li> <li>“Got Each Other” – The Interrupters ft. Rancid</li> <li>“Hey Man, Nice Shot” – Filter</li> <li>“Invaders Must Die” – The Prodigy</li> <li>“Making Love to Morgan Wallen” – Limp Bizkit</li> <li>“Master of War” – Bob Dylan</li> <li>“Nuthin’ But A G Thang” – Dr. Dre and Snoop Dogg</li> <li>“Pain” – Chalk</li> <li>“You’ll Never Guess Who Died” – The Kinison</li> <li>“Battlefield: The After-party” by Henry Jackman &amp; Limp Bizkit</li> </ul> <p>Interestingly, <a href="https://youtu.be/iCEGrHGmb1o">one of the listed Limp Bizkit songs was uploaded to Limp Bizkit’s official YouTube channel last week</a>. And the artwork for the song includes the singer on a tank that has <em>BF6</em> graffiti on it and the song’s credits list EA Music.&nbsp; So, yeah, I think we can deduce that this list is probably accurate.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190">When I traveled to Los Angeles earlier this year</a> to attend the game’s big multiplayer reveal, I was shocked that its big trailer featured the Limp Bizkit song “Break Stuff.” I assumed it was a fun joke or a one-off thing. But it seems like EA and the people making <em>Battlefield 6</em> have partnered up with Limp Bizkit in some capacity, and folks, I’m not sure how I feel about any of this.</p> <h2><strong>Intel is still going to make its own GPUs following the Nvidia deal</strong></h2> <p>Yesterday, it was announced that GPU maker and tech giant Nvidia was partnering up with Intel as part of a large, long-term plan. Nvidia is investing billions into Intel and the two will work together on new products. Wild stuff. And if you were wondering if this meant the end of Intel’s own GPUs, that doesn’t seem to be the case for now. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/processors/intel-says-arc-gpus-arent-going-anywhere-just-yet-despite-the-new-nvidia-collaboration/">As <em>PC Gamer</em> reports</a>, Intel still has plans to keep making Intel Arc cards for the foreseeable future. We’ll see how long that lasts.</p>

 <h2><strong>It seems like you can just buy a Switch 2 on Amazon now</strong></h2> <p>If you’ve been wanting to buy a Nintendo Switch 2, well, it’s pretty easy to do now. As pointed out by <em><a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/nintendo/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-for-sale-on-amazon-no-invite-required-132503609.html">Engadget</a></em>, Amazon is now selling the console in the United States without any waiting list or hoops to jump through. You just fork over $500 and wait a couple of days, and there you go. I’ve also seen multiple Switch 2 units at my local Target. So it seems like you’ll be able to snag a Switch 2 without much effort ahead of the holidays.</p> <h2><strong><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>‘s excellent soundtrack now available on Nintendo’s Music app</strong></h2> <p>I’m so mad at myself that I’ve not finished <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>. And a big reason for that is because I miss listening to the 3D smasher-jumper, which has one of the best Nintendo soundtracks in years. Thankfully, the songs are now available on the Nintendo Music app. Now, I just need to find time to finish that game.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-devs-have-a-button-that-blows-up-everything-in-a-map-and-its-fun-to-press-it-2000626898"><em>Battlefield 6</em> and the big button that blows everything up</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-steam-library-valve-discord-radicalization-2000626897">Law enforcement is reportedly digging into the gaming history of Charlie Kirk’s killer</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/light-of-motiram-horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-monopoly-2000626858">The legal battle between Sony and Tencent over a knock-off <em>Horizon</em> game continues</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p>Sure, why not?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[If You Went for the iPhone 7, This Official 2-Pack of 20W Chargers Costs Only $11]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/if-you-went-for-the-iphone-7-this-official-2-pack-of-20w-chargers-costs-only-11-2000627118</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/if-you-went-for-the-iphone-7-this-official-2-pack-of-20w-chargers-costs-only-11.1302621/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Purchasing chargers is just as overwhelming as buying the phone itself. Apple actually sells and endorses Anker products in their own retail stores, so that says a lot about how much confidence the brand has established. And ight now, Anker’s 20W fast USB-C charger (the exact power rate needed to fast charge iPhones such as Apple’s new iPhone 17 and 17 Pro) is available on Amazon basically impossible to pass up. With the coupon, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/">you can obtain a 2-pack with cables for just $11, down from $19</a>. That’s<strong> basically $6 per charger</strong>, when Apple charges an identical standalone version for $30.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3718/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why This Charger Deal Is Too Good To Pass Up</h2>
<p>If you’ve owned an iPhone in the past few years, you may have noticed that <strong>Apple started no longer putting wall chargers in the box</strong>. Now, you’re stuck either paying Apple’s own adapter for way too much or settling for slower, less convenient knockoffs. The Anker 20W fast charger solves that problem without cutting corners. It’s certified and just as reliable as the official Apple version – except you’re paying a fraction of the cost.</p>



<p>Beyond the obvious savings, the performance is what you’d expect from a charger in 2025. The 20W output gives you the charging speeds that newer iPhones are built to handle. Insert an iPhone 15/16/17, and y<strong>ou can fuel up to 50% battery in around 30 minutes</strong>. The<strong> included USB-C to USB-C cable</strong> ensures you’re set from the start without hunting down extra accessories, and it’s Apple-certified for safety and reliability.</p>
<p>A <strong>USB-C and a USB-A port are both included</strong> in every charger block, so you can charge two devices at once (your iPhone and your AirPods, for example) without sacrificing charging speed. It’s small enough to throw into a pocket or travel case, so you don’t have to spend much time thinking about what’s going on before you head out of the house.</p>
<p>Anker also gives you peace of mind with its MultiProtect safety system. That’s a <strong>multi-layered system that guards against overheating, overcharging, and short circuits</strong>. It’s the type of feature that you don’t even consider until you need it, and it’s another reason why Apple feels comfortable to recommend this brand.</p>
<p>At this price, the deal is more than an accommodation: It’s about having a sufficient number of chargers where you need them. You leave one at home, the other in your pocket so that you never end up digging around in the office or airport lounge. And at about 6 dollars an item, you can equip both locations for under the cost of a single Apple adapter.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/with-the-new-sony-model-out-1000xm4-plunges-to-an-all-time-low-on-amazon-2000627115</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/with-the-new-sony-model-out-1000xm4-plunges-to-an-all-time-low-on-amazon.1302576/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Finding the right pair of noise-canceling headphones can feel overwhelming these days: Every brand has half a dozen variations, and the differences are often so subtle that paying top dollar for the latest release is tough to justify.</p>
<p>Sony’s newest flagship climbs well past the $500 mark which isn’t exactly pocket change. That’s why the WH-1000XM4 feels like such an easy decision right now: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/">this proven model is back on Amazon at an all-time low of $228, down from its original $348</a>. That’s more than $100 off for headphones that still strike the perfect balance of sound quality and features without being too expensive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why The WH-1000XM4 Still Feels Like The Smart Choice</h2>
<p>Its <strong>active noise cancellation</strong> remains among the best you can purchase: Powered by Sony’s Dual Noise Sensor technology, it uses microphones on each earcup to pick up and eliminate unwelcome sounds in real-time. On a plane, it calms the engine rumble to a whisper. In a busy café, it creates a bubble of silence around you so that you can actually hear the lyrics in your music or podcasts.</p>



<p>Sony quotes these headphones for 30 hours of playback which will even get you through the longest international flights without needing a charge. And just in case you do leave them uncharged, a ten-minute top-up from the included USB-C cable yields about five hours of music.</p>
<p>Controls are simple too: The touch on the right earcup means you can tap to skip tracks or pause, slide your finger for volume, or summon your assistant without having to grasp your phone. It’s the sort of thing that becomes second nature and saves time compared to digging for your phone every time you need to fiddle with something. Calls on the WH-1000XM4 are better than that: With five microphones built in and sophisticated signal processing, voices are clean on both sides.</p>
<p>Among the pleasant Sony touches is the Speak-to-Chat function: The <strong>cans naturally lower the volume when they recognize you’re talking</strong>. Imagine bumping into a friend on the platform of the train. You don’t have to fight for a pause button: the audio slows down so you naturally have a few words, then picks up again when the talk ends. Pausing the sound when you remove the cans entirely is another nice but very useful addition.</p>
<p>At $228, this deal on Amazon brings them to their lowest price ever.</p>
