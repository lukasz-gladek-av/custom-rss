              <p>If you’re looking for a more immersive way to play your favorite titles, where the digital world becomes your reality in every sense, you need a VR set in your setup. These not only offer better visuals, but also unique sensations based on whatever’s happening in the game, pulling you into action.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6302/">PlayStation owners should consider grabbing the PSVR2, especially now that it’s going at a 25% discount at Amazon.</a> This brings its usual $400 price down to $299, which, while not the lowest price ever, is still not bad considering all the features the bundle comes packed with. It’s open to all shoppers, and you don’t have to worry about any delivery charges either. Just be sure to grab it quick. Amazon hasn’t specified an end date for this one, but we’re not expecting it to stick around for more than a couple of days.</p>

<h2>Immersive Visuals and Sound</h2>
<p>The bundle includes the PlayStation VR2 headset and a pair of Sense controllers. The headset is comfortable to wear, featuring a rear band that sits a bit low on the back of your head for stability. Once on, the two 2000 x 2040 OLED displays push incredibly sharp and vibrant 4K HDR visuals, which are four times better than the original PSVR. There’s support for eye tracking that simulates emotional responses from the version of you in the game for a better sense of realism, especially when playing with friends. The headset is also designed to be responsive with vibrations, meaning in-game sensations can be felt like they’re happening right in your living room.</p>
<p>For instance, when cars race past, you’ll feel a burst of movement around through the headset. But of course, visuals alone can’t offer a truly immersive experience, and for that, there’s 3D audio that surrounds you and adapts to your position with head movements. Everything from whispers to footsteps, gunfire, and screams will be heard as if you’re right in the middle of the battlefield. Best of all, you can still keep an eye on what’s happening in the real world with the See-through View function.</p>



<p>As for the controllers – these offer haptic feedback for you to physically feel your in-game responses in the form of vibrations, intense pulses, and more. Finger touch detection lets you feel elements of the virtual world even when you’re not pressing any buttons, while adaptive triggers make it easy to sense the digital tension and resistance. The latter is great for feeling that bowstring pull when you’re just about to hit a bad guy, or sensing objects crumple as you crush them in your hand just before delivering an Oscar-worthy line.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking to play your favorite titles in a way that makes you feel like you’re a part of the action, a VR bundle can deliver exactly that and more. This one, in particular, offers immersive, 4K visuals that show every in-game detail in a lifelike manner, plus let you feel all that’s happening in the digital world with unique sensations through the controllers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6302/">The bundle typically retails for $400, but you can now snap it up for $299 after a sweet 25% discount.</a> Amazon won’t be this generous for long, and considering how there are no major sales lined up, it’s best to get your orders in as soon as you can.</p>
