We’ve seen the reintroduction of ex cards, the return of Trainer Pokémon, and even a new invasion from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001">Team Rocket</a></span>. At the same time, we’ve also seen a <em>lot</em> of drab sets with pull-rates that ensure you’ll get <em>something</em>, while making the most desirable full-art cards near impossible to collect. Then, during fall 2024, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">everything got out of control</a></span>. The hobby saw a new surge of interest, driven by skyrocketing prices made vastly worse by scarcity caused by scalpers, and ever since it’s been close to impossible to buy a new pack of Pokémon cards from the store without waiting in line, or engaging in a fist fight. Multiple attempts to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771">thwart scalpers have failed</a></span>, and even pre-ordering a new set months in advance is now a lottery. Unless you want a pack of the entirely unloved Twilight Masquerade. Everywhere has that poor set.</p><p>It’s into this furore that the English-language’s first ever split set is launched. Black Bolt and White Flare are two overlapping sets of cards, each with their own unique Pokémon and cards, released as a so-called “special set” to finish off the <em>SV</em> generation. Except, “special set” actually means, “harder to buy for some reason,” where packs are only sold as part of collection boxes, or in Elite Trainer Boxes, with no single packs available (unless you go to a canny specialist store, that’ll strip the collection boxes down for their packs), and certainly no 36-pack booster boxes. Then, released as a split set, it’s twice as hard to collect all the cards you might want, given you not only need to be able to find any at all to buy, but you also need to be sure to get the right half of the collection. Yay?</p><h2 id="h698586"><a id=""></a>All 156 Pokémon from...Unova?</h2><p>Black Bolt and White Flare feature all 156 Pokémon from the Unova region, as featured in the 2010 <em>Pokémon Black</em> and <em>White</em> video games. Why? Gosh that’s a good question.</p><p>Obviously, if you’re a fan, you’ll know the set features fan-favorite Legendary Pokémon Zekrom and Reshiram. And then, um, oh dear. Look, if 2010 was your entry into the hobby, then I imagine the Pokémon within have a special place in your heart. But looking back across all the new monsters, it’s surely by far the worst. Filled with deeply unimaginative creatures, like three different evolutions based on flipping ice cream and a second pigeon-based pocket monster, I struggle to muster passion for such a derivative set. Oh, and it also forced Pansear, Pansage and Panpour on us, three creepy-faced monkey-things in a game that was already just fine with Aipom. (Simisear, the evolution of Pansear, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2016/6/17/unpopular-pokmon-launches-pr-campaign-to-improve-image&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.crunchyroll.com/news/latest/2016/6/17/unpopular-pokmon-launches-pr-campaign-to-improve-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was once voted the least popular Pokémon</a></span>, ever.)</p><p>This means it’s not easy to get worked up about seeing the set get celebrated here, especially when—and italicized all-caps is really the only option here—<em>THIS IS THE LAST SET FROM SCARLET &amp; VIOLET</em>. Maybe celebrate that set? Just perhaps?</p><figure id="" data-id="cfa654aacef0320640abb9ca40b4e0a2" data-recommend-id="image://cfa654aacef0320640abb9ca40b4e0a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Five of the cards featured in the set." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Five of the cards featured in the set." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cfa654aacef0320640abb9ca40b4e0a2" data-recommend-id="image://cfa654aacef0320640abb9ca40b4e0a2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Five of the cards featured in the set." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-white-flare-zekrom-reshiram-1851786202&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-white-flare-zekrom-reshiram-1851786202">some absolutely gorgeous art</a></span> to be found in the packs, along with the brand new all-black and all-white Zekrom and Reshiram cards, but based on my experience of opening 35 packs, you’ll be lucky to see the rarer ones. Pull rates are tricky to convey at this point, because  Black Bolt and White Flare are packed with so many twiddly extras that you’ll inevitably get <em>something</em> out of a couple of packs. Because, oh my, there are so many variants here.</p><p>There are new holo Energy cards that show up pretty frequently, and then the most egregious array of reverse holo versions of every card. So, for every Basic Pokémon (the ones with the small window art on the top half), there are <em>four</em> different versions. The regular, the standard reverse holo, then a Poké Ball holo pattern, and <em>then</em> a Master Ball holo pattern. This means to complete a master set, you’ll need to collect a ridiculous 800 cards, and also be a billionaire scalper who lives in a Pokémon card factory.</p><h2 id="h698587"><a id=""></a>What about pull rates?</h2><p>To give you an idea from my unscientifically small sample of 35 packs (very kindly supplied by The Pokémon Company, and roughly half Black and half White) I pulled a gratifying seven full-art cards (six Illustration Rares, one Ultra Rare full-art Trainer), four standard ex cards, eight holo Energies, 14 Poké Ball holos, and one Master Ball holo. And written down, that might sound like a really impressive haul. But given just how common Poké Ball variants clearly are, they immediately didn’t feel special, and the Energies are much the same, while ex cards have been bland throughout the last three years. So, it’s really only those seven full-arts and the Master Ball that felt like special pulls. Still, eight out 35 is vastly better than we’ve seen from other sets, and not to be sniffed at.</p><p>The other side, however, is that this meant I didn’t see a single Special Illustration Rare at all, from either Black Bolt or White Flare, meaning those 18 valuable cards must be incredibly tough to find. Obviously I could have just gotten unlucky, but if they’re really fewer than one in 30 or so, that’s going to be grim.</p><p>The collection sets themselves are pretty nice. The poster collection’s poster is just <em>enormous</em>, while the binder collections come with a top-quality 3x3 side-loading binder, featuring either Reshiram or Zekrom. ETBs have nine packs of either Black or White, depending on the box, while the two-pack mini tins have one of each. As ever with Pokémon, everything is super-good quality, none of the extras feeling like tat.</p><figure id="" data-id="d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-recommend-id="image://d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The black Zekrom card everyone will want." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The black Zekrom card everyone will want." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-recommend-id="image://d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The black Zekrom card everyone will want." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But, you know, I’m left feeling a lot of anticlimax. Is that really it for <em>Scarlet &amp; Violet</em>? Does it not even go out with a whimper, but not even starring in its own branded packs?! (This is, after all, “Scarlet &amp; Violet: Black Bolt”.) Also, was that it for Trainer Pokémon? We had the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-review-pull-rates-iono-1851772464&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-review-pull-rates-iono-1851772464">awful Journey Together set</a></span>, followed by the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001">fantastic Destined Rivals</a></span>, and then...they’re all gone. There are no Trainer Pokémon here at all, so I guess that’s just done already? Next up we have the first of a whole new era, presumed to plug the gap after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-scarlet-violent-sword-shield-switch-2-1851766786&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-scarlet-violent-sword-shield-switch-2-1851766786">no new mainline Pokémon game has been revealed for this year</a></span>, simply called Mega Evolution.</p><p>Perhaps it’s a bluff, and next January we’ll see a proper goodbye to Paldea and its new monsters, get the Crown Zenith equivalent the region deserves. I do hope so. But if not, then Black Bolt and White Flare is a pretty naff way to end things. If you can find it, you’ll likely pull something glittery out of it, but given it’ll be a Unovan Pokémon, won’t add anything radical to the table-top game, and is extremely unlikely to be rare, it’s hard to get all that excited. The sets are available from Friday, July 18.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/black-bolt-white-flare-pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-1851786465]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The battlefield just got a whole lot bigger. <em>Off The Grid</em> officially launched on Steam today, meaning players of the cyberpunk battle royale game can now compete across devices to be the last avatar standing.</p><p>Set in a dystopian universe crafted by Hollywood filmmaker Neill Blomkamp—who directed <em>District 9</em>, <em>Elysium</em>, <em>Gran Turismo</em>, and more—<em>Off The Grid</em> was initially released for early access back in October of last year. The free-to-play title has steadily gained popularity since that time, thanks to its fluid third-person shooter gameplay, vast array of looting possibilities, and consistent, thoughtfully crafted updates that keep the in-game experience fresh. Players are especially drawn to <em>Off The Grid</em>’s unique mechanic of switchable cyberlimbs, which grant special abilities and make each session feel completely different from the last. These cyberlimbs can be looted from the map, stolen from other players, or purchased through the player-to-player marketplace, offering a wide range of distinctive abilities and customization options.</p><p>“Every major step forward has been shaped by player feedback,” stated Vlad Korolov, the CEO and Co-Founder of Gunzilla Games. “This launch is a celebration of that collaboration, and it’s only the beginning.”</p><p>Founded in 2020, Gunzilla Games is an independent AAA video game developer that has continued to emphasize innovation and a “gamer-first ecosystem” that “pushes the limits of the games” industry. With <em>Off The Grid, </em>their first and primary title, Gunzilla seeks to bend and reshape the battle royale genre in bold, unexpected ways.</p><p>Unlike traditional battle royales, <em>Off The Grid</em> leans deeply into narrative depth. Players complete PvE missions within a PvP environment, so they might find themselves competing with—or against—others while pursuing their own objectives. This adds unpredictability and strategy beyond what’s offered with the standard shrinking-map formula. The result is a living, breathing world where actions have consequences for other online players, and no two sessions feel quite the same.</p><p>Meanwhile, the community “strands” that constitute the game’s DNA are reflected in frequent enhancements centered around performance, expanded maps, new swappable cybernetic limbs and weapons, and all-new game modes. Deathmatch and Solo Mode, for example, are designed to challenge different playstyles and encourage experimentation and creativity.</p><p>On Steam, <em>Off The Grid</em> is now available to the platform’s more than 130 million active users from every corner of the gaming universe, as it enables seamless cross-play among PC, Xbox, and PS5 gamers.</p><p>“Bringing <em>Off The Grid</em> to Steam is a major milestone for us,” said Korolov. “Not just because of the platform’s reach, but because it allows us to welcome an entirely new wave of players into [the] game.”</p><p>Steam’s powerful community integration tools align with Gunzilla’s aims for <em>Off The Grid</em>. From digital forums and user-generated guides to live broadcasts and support functions, the platform fosters a deeper, more meaningful level of engagement between developers and players. It also allows Gunzilla to gather instant feedback, monitor technical issues, and deploy improvements quickly, helping the team respond to user needs faster and keep the game evolving smoothly. That kind of real-time connection will be invaluable.</p><p>An additional benefit of <em>Off The Grid</em>’s presence on Steam is that the platform’s auto-update capabilities ensure that players stay synced with the latest builds. In effect, there are no patches, software updates, or downloads to chase, creating a hassle-free experience.</p><p>The cyborgs are calling. Whether you’re a first-time player or a seasoned veteran, get plugged in and go <em>Off The Grid</em>. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/off-the-grid-steam-neill-blomkamp-game-1851786461]]></content:encoded>

It’s certainly <em>playable</em>, hitting a semi-decent 30 FPS that doesn’t necessarily feel <em>that</em> terrible to play. How it looks on Valve’s handheld PC, however, is another story.

It hovers at a 30-40 FPS status, which isn’t too bad, but the odd visuals, I think, actually make me play worse (I’m also used to playing this game on mouse and keyboard, not the gamepad layout of the Steam Deck, to be clear).</p><p>Yes, it will sorta settle down at times when rendering and FSR3 catch up, but it’s still not great. And the second you move, distant options look all crunchy and shitty again.</p><h2 id="h697896"><a id=""></a>What about the new class options and other features?</h2><p>I’ve been playing on the hardest difficulty in <em>Avowed</em> with a ranger-ish build that primarily uses rifles. Surprisingly, it feels like playing a first-person shooter more than something like <em>Fallout 4</em> did. My brain is sorta in <em>Doom</em> mode when I’m playing. While the game put up a tough fight early on, I eventually reached a certain level of power where I was annihilating everything. I’m also doing every quest and finding everything on every map, so my character has a lot of experience invested in her stats.</p><p>The fighter and ranger got new active and passive abilities. And the update refunded everyone’s skill points, so you can already get to trying out new builds. From the looks of things, this is only going to make me more unstoppable than I already am. The “Sharpshooter” ranger passive looks like it will make my pretty sweet rifle even deadlier. That said, abilities like “Shadow Step,” a previously NPC-exclusive ability that lets you vanish and appear behind your target, feel a little redundant since I can already go invisible. </p><p>I’m going to need to mix and match these new abilities for a while to judge just how transformative they are for a game I didn’t find that challenging anyway. So maybe I’m not the best judge of how helpful the new build options are. I’ll get back to you if something really blows my mind.

It’s a serious contender for GOTY in my book—just don’t play it running natively on Steam Deck if you can help it.

Next year’s <em>Hoppers</em> has just released its first trailer, and it shows what looks like a delightful talk-to-the-animals movie. But will it be enough to rescue the studio after <em>Elio</em>’s box office bombing?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,197586,197589" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I hope so! And from this first lighthearted teaser trailer (although, given this plays out like a regular trailer, I don’t think the word “teaser” has any meaning left at all), it sure looks like it deserves success. Pixar certainly thrives when it comes to meatier discourse, exploring complex emotions and relationships, but it’s hard to argue against the studio aiming for a more broad comedy.</p><p>The premise—a group of scientists create a device that allows a human mind to inhabit a mechanical animal so as to blend in and learn about their culture—is so blatantly lifted from <em>Avatar</em> that the opening of the teaser just flat-out acknowledges it. However, subject Mabel Tanaka gets into the body of a beaver and then refuses to leave, in order to help the local creatures battle an evil construction company set to destroy the local habitat.</p><p>The two-minute trailer shows lots of fun observation humor about animal life, based on Mabel’s sudden ability to understand what the other creatures are saying. It’s the sort of goofball territory I feel Pixar hasn’t reveled in since the days of <em>A Bug’s Life</em>, and I’m very happy to see it happening. However, I’m also pretty aware that this is perhaps considered Dreamworks’ territory—the rival animation house dominates the field with its <em>Madagascar</em> and <em>Kung Fu Panda</em> franchises, and even the brief life of <em>Over the Hedge</em>. It’ll be interesting to see how that works out.</p><p><em>Hoppers</em> isn’t quite Pixars last chance—Enrico Casarosa’s (<em>Luca</em>) next animated feature <em>Gatto</em> is due for early summer 2027, featuring a black cat called Nero who befriends a Venetian graffiti artist while attempting to escape from the feline mob. That’s <em>quite</em> the pitch. <em>Luca</em>, sent straight to Disney+ during the pandemic, became a sleeper hit with a massive fanbase, so if Disney can figure out how to market <em>Gatto</em> to that audience—i.e. market it as if it were a sequel—it could fly.</p><p>Otherwise, it <em>is</em> just sequels. Pixar’s upcoming roster for the next few years includes <em>Toy Story 5</em>, <em>Incredibles 3</em>, and <em>Coco 2</em>, with <em>Inside Out 3</em> all but inevitable. But the reality is, their top-grossing movies all have at least a “2” in the title, with no original property ever hitting the all-important $1bn box office. However, the wise person might want to point out you cannot ever have any of those billion dollar sequels if you don’t have the first movie first! Hopefully someone at Disney can recognize this—even if <em>Hoppers</em> isn’t the all-consuming megahit they way, <em>Hoppers 2</em> very well could be.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hoppers-trailer-pixar-animation-teaser-inside-out-2-1851786456]]></content:encoded>
