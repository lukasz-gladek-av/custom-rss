              <p>Apple’s grand keynote happened only two days ago, and though <a href="https://gizmodo.com/airpods-pro-3-blur-the-line-between-health-wearable-and-wireless-earbuds-2000655557">the AirPods Pro 3 were the highlight</a>, Amazon had a different idea: clear out the remaining AirPods Pro 2 at an unbeatable price. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/">they’re down to $199 instead of the usual $249, and that’s as low as it gets for one of Apple’s most popular earbuds</a>. Amazon wants to move the last of its stock, and if you don’t care about extras like heart rate monitoring or calorie tracking, the AirPods Pro 2 are more than enough.</p>

<h2>Advanced ANC Earbuds</h2>
<p>The reason the drop is so tempting is that <strong>these earbuds remain some of the most advanced true wireless earphones</strong> Apple has ever produced. They pack the H2 chip which powers improved sound quality and smarter noise cancellation. Active noise cancellation works to block out the hum of traffic, chatter on your commute, or background noise in the office, and Transparency Mode lets the world back in whenever you need to stay aware. On top of that, Personalized Spatial Audio adapts sound to the shape of your ears for a immersive surround-like feel.</p>



<p>The earbuds’ sound profile is accurate and detailed, with bright, even balance between highs, mids, and bass. If you’re looking for audio quality without the bulk of over-ear headphones, this remains one of the best everyday choices.</p>
<p>Apple overhauled the fit to be more comfortable with several ear tip sizes in the box that help create a snug seal. That makes it more effective at noise reduction and reduces ear fatigue during extended listening sessions. Battery life is more than adequate for daily use, <strong>with up to six hours of continuous use on one charge and 30 hours total if you count the charging case</strong>. The case itself charges through USB-C now, so you can charge it with the same cord you’re using for a MacBook or iPad.</p>
<p>There’s the convenience factor, too: <strong>Pairing with iPhone, iPad, and Mac is virtually instantaneous</strong> and technologies like automatic switching mean you’ll remain connected without further tapping or change-of-setting crap. If you’re engaged in a FaceTime call on your MacBook and then get up to answer a call on your phone, the AirPods Pro 2 switch just along with you.</p>
<p>It’s rare to see Amazon cut the price this aggressively on a flagship Apple product. If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to grab a pair, this is pretty much it. At $199 instead of $249, the AirPods Pro 2 bring high-end Apple features to your daily routine without asking you to overspend.</p>
