            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Rockstar’s parent company, Take-Two Interactive, reconfirmed that <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> is set to launch this November during its quarterly earnings report and conference. Take-Two’s CEO even revealed that marketing for the long-awaited crime sim will start this summer.</p> <p>On Tuesday, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-marketing-will-kick-off-this-summer-as-take-two-confidently-reaffirms-november-release-date?utm_source=bluesky,threads,twitter">as spotted in a press release about Take-Two’s Q3 2026 earnings results by <em>IGN</em></a>, the company confirmed that it plans to start marketing <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> sometime in the summer, which seems to indicate that the game, which has been delayed a few times now, is actually (for real) getting close to launching later this year.</p>

 <p>“I feel good about it. Very good about it,” said Zelnick when asked by the outlet how he felt about <em>GTA 6</em>‘s November 19 release. “Of course, because any time you’re getting closer to marketing beats, you’re obviously in a place where your confidence level is as high as it can be.”</p> <p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/take-two-ceo-googles-project-genie">Zelnick told newsletter <em>The Game Business</em></a>&nbsp;this when asked about the confirmation that<em> GTA 6</em>‘s marketing blitz was just a few months away: “You know me pretty well, for me to even say we’ve got marketing beats coming this summer is a huge departure from what I usually say, which is that our labels will make marketing announcements.”</p>

 <p>Normally Take-Two doesn’t provide details like this, opting to let Rockstar provide those details later, so this is a good sign that <em>GTA 6</em>‘s development is on track. You don’t start committing to expensive marketing plans and telling the press about them unless everyone involved is very confident in the game’s development status. And yes, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-date-delay-borderlands-4-fall-2025-1851757501">in the past, Zelnick has told investors and the public he felt good about <em>GTA 6</em>‘s release date</a>, and then it was delayed. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-strauss-zelnick-ceo-take-two-interview-rockstar-games-2000617237">But in those cases</a>, he and Take-Two hadn’t committed to a marketing timeframe like this before. And while things can always change, at least for now it seems <em>GTA 6</em> is finally, for real, actually launching as planned on November 19.</p>

              <p><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>is an amalgamation of every facet of pop culture, which can sometimes lead to weird moments of whiplash as it veers between awesome crossovers and properties I wouldn’t want to touch with a 10-foot pole. Take, for instance, the battle royale following up its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-harry-potter-skins-leak-jk-rowling-transphobia-2000654659"><i><span>Harry Potter </span></i><span>collaboration</span></a><span>, facilitated by the series’ </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hogwarts-legacy-review-harry-potter-rowling-transphobia-1850127849"><span>transphobic creator</span></a><span>, with skins of one of the most visible queer artists in the music industry right now. That’s right, Chappell Roan is finally coming to </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>with several skins and cosmetics, and they look fantastic.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000665446" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665446"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665446">© Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Roan is <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/chappell-roan-the-midwest-princess-rides-into-fortnite-festival">headlining the next iteration of </a></span><i><span>Fortnite Festival</span></i><span>, with new and old Jam Tracks like “Good Luck, Babe,” “HOTTOGO,” “The Giver,” and “Pink Pony Club” all either returning to the shop or joining the playlist as part of the Heartcore Music Pass. Buying the pass will get you the pink Chappell Roan skin of the star sporting the iconic “Pink Pony Club” outfit, and there will also be an unlockable red version. There’s also an outfit inspired by her </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/chappell-roan-video-music-awards-vmas-good-luck-babe-1851646872"><span>2024 VMAs fit</span></a><span> called “Roan of Arc,” which has the singer dressed in a suit of armor. Each skin comes with accessories, including special instruments like a keytar, drum set, and mic stand, and the Roan of Arc fit has a special sword and Pink Pony Sidekick.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000665447" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665447"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665447">© Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Since Roan’s big blow-up in 2024, she’s said multiple times that she plays </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>and wanted to collaborate with Epic. Several of her songs were previously added as Jam Tracks, but this is definitely the most substantial presence she’s had in the game. She joins artists like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/lady-gaga-fortnite-festival-skin-twitter-tweet-1851271119"><span>Lady Gaga</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-radio-stations-ariana-grande-skin-travis-scott-1850284448"><span>Ariana Grande</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-sabrina-carpenter-icon-skin-leak-festival-1851772197"><span>Sabrina Carpenter</span></a><span> as pop girls that have been featured in </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Don’t spend too much time playing </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>now that you’re in it, Ms. Roan, we’re still waiting on the new album over here.</span></p>

              <p><em>Highguard’s</em> 5v5 mode, which launched over the weekend as a temporary experiment, is now a permanent mode in the free-to-play raid shooter. And while the new mode is better than the old 3v3 option, I’m not sure it’s enough to save this thing.</p> <p>On January 30, after some teasing, <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-big-update-free-shooter-future-patch-notes-wildlight-2000664584"><em>Highguard’s</em> devs announced a new 5v5 mode</a> was being added to the game immediately following fan feedback that the original 3v3 mode wasn’t exciting enough. At the time, <em>Highguard</em> labeled the new option as a “limited time mode.” However, apparently so many players liked it, and the reaction to it was so positive, that the mode is going to stick around permanently alongside the 3v3 mode, which isn’t going away.</p>

 <p>“You’ve been asking, and we’re happy to share—5v5 Raid Mode is here to stay,” <a href="https://x.com/PlayHighguard/status/2018459289933787412?s=20">posted <em>Highguard’s</em> official Twitter account.</a> “We appreciate everyone hopping in over the weekend to give the mode a try. We saw a fairly even split between 3v3 and 5v5, which helped inform our decision.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">You've been asking, and we're happy to share—5v5 Raid Mode is here to stay! ⚔</p> <p>We appreciate everyone hopping in over the weekend to give the mode a try. We saw a fairly even split between 3v3 and 5v5, which helped inform our decision. <a href="https://t.co/S0QfgCE7vK">pic.twitter.com/S0QfgCE7vK</a></p> <p>— Highguard | LIVE NOW! (@PlayHighguard) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayHighguard/status/2018459289933787412?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 2, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Credit to developers Wildlight Entertainment for implementing a 5v5 mode into <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguards-patch-note-fov-ps5-crash-pc-optimization-2000664201"><em>Highguard</em> </a>so shortly after the game’s January 26 launch. And after playing a few 5v5 matches over the last few days, I do think it’s a better version of the game. In my experience, having more players on the map has led to more frequent firefights before the shieldbreaker fully spawns. It also makes raids bigger and more chaotic. It did cause some performance issues during those fights that involved most or all of the players, something Wildlight warned could be an issue. Hopefully, performance can be improved in 5v5 matches because it’s easily the best way to play <em>Highguard</em> and likely should have been the primary mode the game launched with last month.</p>

 <p>All that said, <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646">I’m not sitting here suggesting <em>Highguard</em></a> is suddenly a great game now. A lot of <em>Highguard’s</em> issues aren’t solved by adding more players. There are still too many competing mechanics causing issues, the visuals are bland, heroes are dull, combat seems too sweaty for more casual players, and collecting loot isn’t much fun. 5v5 doesn’t change that, even if it does make the game more fun to play.</p>

 <p>I suspect this 5v5 mode will be enough to help <em>Highguard</em> escape <em>Concord’s</em> fate and let it stick around for a few more weeks at least. Beyond that, I’m not sure. I’m not convinced the world needed another online-only team-based PVP hero shooter, even if it now supports 10 players in a match.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/stardew-valleys-1-7-update-marriage-map-editor-children-2000665425</link>
            <guid>1424494</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Stardew Valley</span></i><span> is on the verge of turning 10, but it’s not slowing down any time soon. While developer Eric “ConcernedApe” Barone previously stated he was shifting away from development on </span><i><span>Stardew </span></i><span>to work on his next game, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/haunted-chocolatier-stardew-valley-abandoned-release-date-2000664261"><i><span>Haunted Chocolatier</span></i></a><span>, he’s now doubling down on </span><i><span>Stardew Valley </span></i><span>with news about an upcoming update.</span></p> <p><span>In </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-turns-10-the-big-concernedape-interview"><span>a massive interview with </span><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span> published on Tuesday, Barone revealed some exciting details about the game’s 1.7 update. Possibly most importantly, he revealed that he’s adding two more marriage candidates, though just who they are will remain under wraps until the game’s tenth anniversary on February 26. He also teased long-awaited improvements to the game’s children, which are considered notoriously boring by…most of the game’s players.</span></p>

 <p><span>Other features possibly headed to 1.7 include a farm map editor, which would allow players to build their own maps instead of using the game’s presets. He even raised the idea of adding a social feature to let players share their map designs, which he tied to a staunch refusal of generative AI: “I’m interested in ways to make the game more just infinitely replayable without the use of AI. That’s never going to happen.”</span></p> <p><span>Barone has been occasionally teasing 1.7 since September, but prior to Tuesday, he’s only </span><a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2001186320765583409?s=20"><span>vaguely hinted</span></a><span> at “new character/social stuff” as well as the update’s obligatory new farm type.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Aside from 1.7, he also said he’d consider developing </span><i><span>Stardew Valley 2 </span></i><span>(and even started work on a sequel at one point but seemingly abandoned it). “In fact, I would love to because it would be fun to work on a whole new set of characters, a whole new world, maybe capture some of that original energy that I had back in 2012,” he said.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Chocolate Versus Countryside&nbsp;</b></h2> <p><span>While Barone clearly has big plans for </span><i><span>Stardew Valley</span></i><span>, he’s also spent the past few weeks opening up about the struggle to balance new </span><i><span>Stardew </span></i><span>content with work on </span><i><span>Haunted Chocolatier</span></i><span>. In </span><a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2026/01/28/update-im-still-working-like-always/"><span>a blog post late last month</span></a><span>, he revealed he feels that he “shouldn’t have announced the game so early.”</span></p> <p><span>Barone has seemingly flipped between development on the two games quite a bit. Initially, </span><i><span>Stardew</span></i><span> wasn’t even supposed to receive a 1.7 update—in 2025, Barone assured us that he was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-concerenedape-haunted-chocolatier-update-1851778392"><span>“committed to not working on </span><i><span>Stardew Valley </span></i><span>until I’m done with </span><i><span>Haunted Chocolatier</span></i><span>.”</span></a><span> In this latest interview, though, he said that he’s still working on both and has even expanded his team in order to delegate work on </span><i><span>Stardew </span></i><span>updates. While he admitted “the progress isn’t as fast as I would like,” he stated he feels he’s able to take his sweet time on </span><i><span>Haunted Chocolatier</span></i><span> thanks to its lack of preorders and crowdfunding.</span></p>

 <p><span>In the meantime, </span><i><span>Stardew’s </span></i><span>1.7 should tide us over. I’m especially intrigued by the promise of new marriage candidates. Is he adding entirely new characters to the game? Does the addition of exactly two candidates imply that there was some big, juicy divorce in town? We’ll have to wait until the game’s anniversary rolls around on February 26 to find out.</span></p>

              <p><i><span>Magic: The Gathering </span></i><span>is coming for my throat again with a new </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i></a> <span>Secret Lair drop that includes cards featuring party members like Gale and Shadowheart.</span></p> <p><a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/secret-lair-roll-for-initiative-superdrop"><span>The </span><i><span>Magic </span></i><span>x </span><i><span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </span></i><span>“Roll For Initiative” drop</span></a><span> isn’t just </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3 </span></i><span>characters, but Gale and Shadowheart are getting five cards each alongside several other more general </span><i><span>D&amp;D</span></i><span> characters in a seven-part super drop with a total of around 30 new cards.</span></p> <p><span>The cards will go on sale on February 9 at 9 a.m. Pacific, but the Shadowheart and Gale sets are the major draw. The two join Karlach and Astarion as </span><i><span>BG3</span></i><span> characters who have previously been part of Secret Lair. Because I am a clown, I will be in the queue for the Gale cards, though I am flabbergasted they have a card from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-sex-scene-romance-intimacy-halsin-gale-1850865892"><span>his astral projection sex scene</span></a><span> from the game. Thank you, Wizards of the Coast. “Why confine ourselves to the pleasures of mortal flesh?” it reads underneath an image of Gale naked and gazing lovingly into the camera. Crazy.</span></p>

I’m sure people who actually care about this game are annoyed it’s becoming </span><i><span>Fortnite: The Card Game</span></i><span> with all its crossovers, but to me they are just pretty pieces of cardboard with characters I like.</span></p>
