It’s a remake done right, and its new features and mechanics only serve to enhance the fundamental experience. One of these very welcomed additions is the Monster Wrangler, an extremely strong vocation that wasn’t available in the original game.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195905" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="195905,195719,196572" data-current="195905"><div><p>Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21419.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-3-remake-review-hd-2d-changes-quality-of-l-1851700918&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-3-remake-review-hd-2d-changes-quality-of-l-1851700918"><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D</em> Is A Gorgeous Remake That Stays Stubbornly Faithful To An RPG Classic</a></span><br><strong>Order Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fdragon-quest-iii-hd2d-remake%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fdragon-quest-iii-hd2d-remake%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Bundle</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.link/b5tna58zaaqyu&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.link/b5tna58zaaqyu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Buy</a></span></p><p>But what exactly is the Monster Wrangler, and is it worth adding one to your lineup?</p><h2 id="h11126"><a id=""></a>How Does The Monster Wrangler Work?</h2><p>The Monster Wrangler is a vocation that allows you to tame monsters and use their abilities in battle. Unlike most vocations, this one requires you to invest time outside of battle to find monsters and earn their abilities for yourself, so it’s not recommended for anyone seeking a straightforward, no-frills party setup.</p><p>As you continue to level up, you’ll eventually earn an ability known as “Animal Instinct”, which lets you know when there are monsters nearby that you can tame. However, recruiting them won’t always be easy, as you’ll sometimes need to meet certain requirements or use special items to ease them into befriending you. It’s worth the effort, though, as filling out your abilities list is the only meaningful way to advance this class.</p><h2 id="h11127"><a id=""></a>Is The Monster Wrangler Any good?</h2><figure id="" data-id="936be02ad1311881791d4335acb16fa2" data-recommend-id="image://936be02ad1311881791d4335acb16fa2" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters choose vocations in a fantasy inn." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Characters choose vocations in a fantasy inn." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="936be02ad1311881791d4335acb16fa2" data-recommend-id="image://936be02ad1311881791d4335acb16fa2" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters choose vocations in a fantasy inn." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Monster Wrangler is certainly one of <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em>’s most unique vocations, but is it actually worth using over other options? </p><p>The short answer is, well, <strong>yes</strong>!</p><p>The Monster Wrangler begins the game feeling slightly underpowered compared to more traditional vocations because it doesn’t have many offensive options at its disposal at first. But it eventually becomes a powerhouse as players advance through the campaign adding more and more monster abilities to their arsenal. </p><p>This vocation is especially useful for late-game grinding, such as facing off against Metal Slimes, as you can use its Call of the Wild/Monster Pile-On ability to call in your animal companions for multi-hit damage against random enemies (or just an onslaught of attacks against a single foe). Additionally, it can use whips and boomerangs, which are both excellent weapons for hitting multiple enemies at one time.</p><p>Ultimately, whether the Monster Wrangler is right for you will depend entirely on what type of party you’re trying to build. But most groups are likely to benefit from this vocation’s various high-damage abilities and support potential, so don’t shy away from it just because it’s a bit slow to get going!</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
