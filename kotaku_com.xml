              <p>Back in December, <em>Battlefield 6</em> came under fire for releasing cosmetics that appeared to be made at least partly with generative AI. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-ai-stickers-cosmetics-bundle-2000655167">As<em> Kotaku</em> reported at the time</a>, EA was aware of the issue and trying to investigate the cause throughout the winter break. Were players right to freak out? EA isn’t saying. The closest we’re getting to an answer is a new patch that changes some of the in-game items accused of being slop.</p> <p>“Updated the Objective Ace and Winter Warning cosmetics to better align with <em>Battlefield</em>’s visual identity,” reads one of the changelog notes for Friday’s <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/2017266697183412713">1.1.3.6 <em>Battlefield 6</em> update</a>. The company doesn’t go into any further detail about what was changed and why, but players immediately connected it back to last month’s Christmas week controversy.</p>

 <p>The original backlash came when players noticed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1pt4ihv/multi_billion_dollar_company_ea_selling_ai/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-ai-stickers-cosmetics-bundle-2000655167">an M4A1 emblem</a> from the winter cosmetic pack that EA was selling had two barrels. That sparked an investigation of other recent additions to the game for anything that looked vaguely off, including a bear that seemed to have extra claws. Some fans also criticized EA in early January for the Objective Ace operator mask that looked very similar to that worn by <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s Ghost.</p> <p>How could such a glaring rip-off make it into the game? Once again, some players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1pzqhui/this_is_litteraly_a_cod_ghosts_mask/">blamed the use of genAI</a>. <em>Kotaku</em> reported last month that one of the potential issues had to do with the sheer volume of content promised for <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s launch and beyond. Without proper resources and quality checks, junk could make it into the game in any number of ways. <em>Call of Duty</em> has had its own challenges with genAI garbage <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-generative-ai-call-duty-gamescom-2025-slop-2000618833">slipping through as well</a>.</p>

 <p>Despite EA CEO Andrew Wilson’s embrace of emerging AI technology to fundamentally reshape the company, EA VP Rebecka Coutaz, who oversees DICE and the other teams making&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xrkxdkkrno">told the BBC</a> last year that no genAI would make it into the final game. She didn’t promise, however, that it wasn’t being used at all during the development process. EA is currently set to be <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-ownership-trump-jared-kushner-2000649726">sold to Saudi Arabia</a> and a group of other investors sometime this summer.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hitman-mission-mindseye-build-rocket-io-interactive-2000664566</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>MindsEye</span></i><span> was one of last year’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-10-worst-games-of-2025-according-to-metacritic-mindseye-fire-emblem-glover-2000653114"><span>worst-reviewed games</span></a><span>. It was published by IO Interactive and was supposed to get a special </span><i><span>Hitman</span></i><span> crossover mission. According to a new report from </span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/build-a-rocket-boy-io-interactive/"><i><span>Insider Gaming</span></i></a><span>, that’s no longer happening and developer Build a Rocket Boy and IO Interactive have decided to bail on the failed joint venture.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>What this means for the future of </span><i><span>MindsEye</span></i><span>, once pitched as the first building block in an ambitious open-world metaverse </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/everywhere-mindseye-ex-gta-devs-fortnite-dreams-roblox-1850258651"><span>called </span><i><span>Everywhere</span></i></a><span>, is currently unclear. But apparently the </span><i><span>Hitman</span></i><span> mission, the shooter’s highest-profile bit of upcoming content, is canceled.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Build a Rocket Boy and IO Interactive didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.</span><span><br> </span></p> <p><span>The most surprising part of </span><i><span>Insider Gaming</span></i><span>’s</span><span> report is that Build a Rocket Boy was apparently the one pushing to end the ill-fated partnership, a decision influenced by the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-development-leslie-benzies-gta-bugs-union-layoffs-2000633983"><span>ex-</span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span> producer-led studio</span></a><span>’s&nbsp; “desire to bring its publishing in-house and gain more control over its future.”</span></p> <p><span>IOI Interactive and Build A Rocket Boy announced the deal that would see the&nbsp;<em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>maker publish <em>MindsEye</em>,</span><span>&nbsp;the first third-party game distributed through IOI Interactive’s IO Partners program, back in October 2024. The </span><i><span>Hitman </span></i><span>mission was announced onstage at Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest 2025, but </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-worst-game-2025-update-hitman-crossover-delay-1851787011"><span>later delayed</span></a><span> amid layoffs and Build a Rocket Boy’s rush to clean up</span><i><span> MindsEye</span></i><span>’s messy launch.</span></p>

 <p><span>IOI Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak commented on the debacle during an interview with </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span> last September. “Well, that was definitely tough, right?” he said at the time. “It was a tough reception. It wasn’t what they hoped for, and also what we didn’t hope for at IOI Partners. They’re working hard on turning that around to regain the trust of the gamers out there, and they have tons of potential and content they’re working on. So hopefully they’ll succeed with that in the future.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Perhaps the only people who will truly be distraught at this news are the streamers and content creators who are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-update-twitch-sponsored-streamer-2000661013"><span>still being paid to promote </span><i><span>MindsEye</span></i></a><span>. At least we’ll know for sure IOI Interactive had been the one bankrolling the sponsored content should the “#MindsEyePartner”-tagged streams suddenly come to an end in the near future.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Developers Hate AI, Want Unions, And Are Abandoning Xbox According To This New Survey]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/gdc-2026-survey-ai-union-layoff-xbox-ps5-trump-2000664245</link>
            <guid>1421011</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The 2026 Game Developers Conference (GDC), which has been renamed the GDC Festival of Gaming, takes place in early March. Ahead of the San Francisco-based industry event, GDC has released <a href="https://kotaku.com/gdc-2025-developer-survey-generative-ai-pc-switch-2-1851744292/2">its annual survey of game industry developer sentiment</a>. Over 2,300 industry professionals responded on topics ranging from genAI to layoffs, providing a small snapshot of what’s going on across video game companies big and small. It’s not a pretty picture.</p> <h2>A majority of game developers now think genAI will hurt the game industry</h2> <p>Back in 2024, game makers were relatively split on the advantages and downsides of the emerging LLM craze. Now they are increasingly horrified by it. Last year, 13 percent of respondents <a href="https://kotaku.com/google-ai-genai-nintendo-zelda-breath-wild-mario-64-project-genie-2000664227">thought genAI</a> would have a positive impact on the game industry. In 2026 it’s just 7 percent. Instead, 52 percent think the technology will have a negative impact, up double digits from just 12 months ago. Artists, storytellers, programmers–they’re all down on it. Still, actual adoption of the technology for things as simple as writing emails is growing.</p>

 <h2>Developers are bailing on making games for Xbox</h2> <p>According to the new survey, roughly 40 percent of respondents said they were interested in making their next game for PlayStation 5 or Switch 2. Only 20 percent were planning to bring it to Xbox Series X/S. That’s still above Android, iOS, and the original Switch, but <a href="https://kotaku.com/games-skipping-xbox-microsoft-asks-devs-studio-why-ps5-1851663611">it’s a steep drop-off</a> from last year when the Xbox number was 34 percent. PC is still far and away the most popular platform. Maybe that’s why Microsoft is pivoting to it.</p> <h2>Union support is surging</h2> <p>Over 80 percent of U.S.-based developers told the survey they support unionization, with 62 percent saying they were interested in joining one. Those numbers show there’s likely room for <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-devs-win-first-ever-union-contact-at-a-major-g-1851783142">many more game studios to organize</a>, as only 13 percent of respondents said they’re actually currently in a union. Union drives have been sweeping through Microsoft-owned subsidiaries thanks to a neutrality clause the company previously agreed to, but unions have struggled to take hold at many other big publishers like Electronic Arts and 2K Games.</p>

 <h2>A third of U.S. developers said they were laid off in the last two years</h2> <p>That’s a devastating number which shows that the full impact of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492">recent downsizing spree</a> will still be with the industry for years to come. Meanwhile, 17 percent of respondents said they were laid off within the last 12 months, a steady annual increase over the previous two years. Even worse, nearly 50 percent of people laid off weren’t able to find another job in the video game industry during that time.</p>

 <h2>Trump take game</h2> <p>The administration’s trade war and anti-immigrant crackdown appears to be taking <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881">a real toll on the game industry</a>. According to the survey, 31 percent of respondents canceled travel plans to the U.S. while another third are currently reconsidering future travel. A whopping 60 percent of non-U.S. industry leaders said the policies had negatively impacted their desire to conduct business based in the country. On the trade side, 38 percent of respondents said tariffs had impacted their financial decisions.</p>
