              <p data-start="129" data-end="916">If you’re creating content for TikTok or Instagram Reels, there’s one small tweak you can add to your workflow that will dramatically elevate your results: get a microphone. Seriously. Many creators overlook how crucial solid audio is. Whether you’re shooting laid-back vlogs from your couch or doing those man-on-the-street style interviews, viewers will pick up on your sound quality. They might not consciously notice it, but something about your video will just feel a bit lackluster. In most cases, it’s the audio. Fix that immediately with a high-quality lavalier mic that’s currently discounted. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4871/">At the moment, the DJI Mic Mini two-person vlog bundle is 50% off, cutting the price from $119 to just $59. Personally, saving $60 sounds pretty great to me.</a></p>
<p data-start="918" data-end="1144">These wireless mics are low-profile yet don’t compromise on performance. They’re ultralight, weighing only 10 grams. They stay discreet and look clean on camera, plus they’re simple to get working and comfortable to wear.</p>
<p data-start="1146" data-end="1306">Each microphone can deliver crisp audio to the receiver at a maximum transmission distance of up to 400 meters. That’s a quarter mile range.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4871/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="1146" data-end="1306">Powerful Noise Cancelling</h2>
<p data-start="1308" data-end="1749">The DJI Mic Minis are excellent for recording in energetic outdoor settings like crowded conventions or busy streets. This is thanks to their pro-level noise cancellation. You can choose between two intensity modes. Basic works well for quiet indoor spaces, while the strong mode is ideal for loud outdoor areas. They can also automatically limit audio levels when sound gets too loud. This prevents clipping and can be a huge help once you begin editing.</p>
<p data-start="1308" data-end="1749">Switching up these settings is simple enough. Just tap the power button to enable or disable noise cancellation. In order to swap between the two modes of Strong or Basic can be done using the DJI Mimo app (supported on iPhone and Android).</p>
<p data-start="1751" data-end="1905">The DJI Mic Minis integrate seamlessly with your wider DJI OsmoAudio setup. You can pair them with an Osmo Action 5 Pro without even needing the receiver.</p>


<p data-start="1907" data-end="2139">Each transmitter and receiver has a long-lasting battery so you can film all day if needed. The DJI Mic Minis provide up to 10 hours of operation on a single charge, making them great for livestreams or long interviews. If your content only has one speaker, then you effectively have 20 hours of operation since you can always swap to the other. Heck, you can get even more than that since realistically you can start charging your first after it dies while using the second.</p>
<p data-start="1907" data-end="2139">As an additional add-on, you can pick up the DJI Mic Mini charging case. This can house both transmitters and the receiver, providing you with up to 48 hours of operation.</p>
<p data-start="2141" data-end="2261" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4871/">Right now, you can grab this bundle with two DJI Mic Mini microphones and the DJI receiver for only $59, saving you $60.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-jbl-go-4-tiny-bluetooth-speaker-leftover-cyber-monday-stock-goes-to-record-low-2000650147</link>

              <p>Amazon kept some Cyber Monday deals running on select items including this JBL Go 4 that punches way above its weight class in the sound department. The speaker <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6199/">is currently down to $39 from its regular $49 price, which is an all-time low</a> that makes it an easy pick for personal use or as a <strong>holiday gift at a reasonable budget</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6199/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How JBL Made a Small Package Sound Big</h2>
<p>The sound engineering that went into this small speaker is all about<strong> getting bass response that usually needs much bigger drivers and enclosures</strong>. JBL tuned the parts inside to make what they call <em>“punchy bass”</em> which means that you can feel the low-end frequencies instead of just hearing the tinny mids and highs. A single driver and passive radiators in the speaker boost the bass without needing extra power or space. This means you get fuller sound from something that weighs less than half a pound. The JBL Go 4 is great for times when you want to hear real music instead of the thin, high-pitched sound that most ultra-portable speakers make.</p>



<p>With moderate volumes,<strong> the battery lasts up to seven hours of continuous playback</strong>&nbsp;which is enough for most day trips or outdoor activities without having to find an outlet. The <em>Playtime Boost</em> feature adds two more hours by changing the audio processing to use less power. However, you will lose some volume and bass depth in exchange for longer battery life. This is helpful when you’re at the beach or camping and remember you forgot to charge it the night before and it gives you enough power to keep the music going until sunset.</p>
<p>The <strong>IP67 certification</strong> means that the speaker can stay submerged in up to one meter of water for 30 minutes and is also completely dustproof. After a day at the beach, you can rinse it off under the tap, use it in the shower, or leave it by the pool without worrying about splashes ruining the electronics. The tough outside is made of recycled plastic and has a fabric grille that protects the driver while letting sound through clearly. This environmentally friendly construction doesn’t make the speakers less durable; the materials can handle drops and bumps that would break less sturdy speakers.</p>



<p>With the $10 off, this speaker is now cheap enough that you might buy it on a whim instead of thinking about it first. For less than the price of good wired headphones, you get IP67 protection, surprisingly strong bass, and a battery that lasts all day. JBL built their name on providing high-quality sound at reasonable prices. This is the lowest price ever for a portable speaker that doesn’t sound like a toy and it’s easy to grab one and try it out for yourself.</p>
