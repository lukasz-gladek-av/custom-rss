              <p>Robot vacuums range from basic bump-and-go models that randomly wander your floors to sophisticated machines that map your home with surgical precision, and Roborock always positioned itself at the premium end with innovations that justify higher price tags. Each new model brings features that push the category forward, but that innovation typically costs serious money, with the flagship Saros 10R normally demanding $1,599 from your wallet.</p>
<p>The great news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5750/">Amazon’s Black Friday deal slashes $600 off that price to bring it down to $999 (38% off)</a> hitting an all-time low that makes this ultra-premium cleaner actually accessible instead of just aspirational. This discount transforms the most advanced robot vacuum on the market into something you can justify buying, and once it starts handling your cleaning routine, you’ll wonder how you ever tolerated doing floors manually.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5750/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Engineering That Solves Real Cleaning Problems</h2>
<p>The <strong>ultra-slim 3.14-inch profile lets this robot slip under furniture</strong> that standard vacuums can’t reach, thanks to the StarSight Autonomous System 2.0 that eliminates the raised LDS dome making most robot vacuums too tall for low-clearance spaces. You get cleaning coverage under beds, sofas, and cabinets where dust bunnies normally live undisturbed for months because your regular vacuum can’t fit.</p>
<p><strong>3D sensing technology maps your home with precision</strong>, even in tight spaces under narrow-legged furniture, while the VertiBeam system navigates around cables without getting stuck or needing you to pre-clean your floors before the robot can do its job. Improved algorithms recognize and adapt to 108 different obstacle types, so it handles everything from pet toys to chair legs without calling for help every five minutes.</p>



<p>The <strong>22,000 Pa HyperForce suction pulls dirt, pet hair, and debris</strong> from hardwood, tile, and carpets with enough power to handle embedded mess that weaker vacuums just push around. Combined, the <span>Zero-Tangling DuoDivide</span> main brush and anti-tangle omnidirectional wheels mean you never spend ten minutes cutting hair wraps off the roller bar-which, if you have long hair or pets, is basically the worst part of owning robot vacuums. The <strong>FlexiArm side brush and mop automatically extend to reach corners</strong> and edges that circular robots typically miss, sweeping along baseboards and into tight spots where crumbs accumulate.</p>
<p>The AdaptiLift chassis <strong>climbs over obstacles as high as 4 cm</strong> and tackles thresholds and furniture legs that stop lesser robots dead in their tracks and turn your open floor plan into an actual open floor plan rather than a series of isolated zones. The dual-spinning mops automatically lift when carpets get detected to avoid getting your rugs soaked while still making thorough mopping possible on hard floors.</p>



<p>The Multifunctional Dock 4.0 does the dirty work you would avoid by automatically washing mops in 176°F hot water and drying them with 131°F hot air to prevent mildew and smell. <strong>Auto dust collection works for 60 days before needing attention</strong> while auto tank refilling and detergent dispensing mean the robot maintains itself between the occasional check-in you give it.</p>
<p>At $999 instead of the usual $1,599, you’re saving $600 on a machine that brings flagship features reserved for people with unlimited home automation budgets. This Black Friday price opens up the most advanced robot vacuum technology to households wanting exceptional cleaning results without compromise on coverage, power, or convenience.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-t7-ssd-goes-for-pocket-change-now-2tb-drive-selling-68-off-original-price-2000647374</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-t7-ssd-goes-for-pocket-change-now-2tb-drive-selling-68-off-original-price.1364884/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung earned its reputation as the <strong>most reliable brand for SSDs</strong> through years of consistent performance and the T7 has been an iconic model in portable storage since its launch a few years back. Traditional external hard drives (HDD) feel painfully slow once you experience the speed difference that solid-state technology delivers, and even more as <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4613/">this T7 model just hit a record low at $168 instead of the usual $187 (and $399 at launch!) for Black Friday on Amazon</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Most color options already sold out completely</strong> which leaves only the gray version in stock so you’ll need to move fast if you want one before inventory disappears entirely. This<strong> drive transfers files at speeds up to 1,050MB/s</strong> which means copying a full 4K movie takes under a minute instead of the 5+ minutes you’d spend waiting with an old spinning hard drive.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4613/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Forget Your Old HDD</h2>
<p>The USB 3.2 Gen 2 interface pushes<strong> read speeds to 1,050MB/s and write speeds close behind</strong>, which gives you transfer rates that actually match modern file sizes and project demands. You can edit 4K video directly from the drive without pre-copying footage to your computer’s internal storage, saving time and preserving precious laptop SSD space for applications and system files. With a <strong>total capacity of 2TB, you’ll have room for approximately 500,000 photos</strong>, 50 hours of 4K video, or your entire game library plus room for new titles.</p>



<p>Measuring <strong>smaller than a credit card and weighing only 58 grams</strong>, the compact design disappears into any bag pocket without adding noticeable bulk or weight to your carry. The metal construction provides shock resistance that protects your data against drops from as high as 2 meters-though you obviously shouldn’t test that limit on purpose, just because the specs say it can handle it.</p>
<p><strong>Efficient thermal management</strong> keeps the drive cool during extended file transfers, preventing performance throttling when you’re moving massive amounts of data for longer periods. <strong>Password protection and AES 256-bit hardware encryption</strong> secure your files in case the drive gets lost or stolen, providing peace of mind that your client projects or personal photos will not end up in random hands.</p>



<p>Cross-platform compatibility works <strong>seamlessly across Windows, Mac, Android devices</strong>&nbsp;and gaming consoles without requiring reformatting or special drivers for basic use. The<strong> included USB-C to C and USB-C to A cables</strong> cover connection to virtually any modern device, though you’ll want the C-to-C cable for maximum speed with newer computers. Samsung’s Magician software provides drive health monitoring, firmware updates, and performance optimization tools that help maintain peak performance over the years. <strong>The three-year limited warranty</strong> backs up Samsung’s confidence in the drive’s reliability, covering manufacturing defects and giving you recourse if something goes wrong.</p>
<p>At $168 for 2TB of fast and reliable Samsung storage, you’re getting the brand’s proven track record at one of the lowest prices this model has ever seen which makes it the right moment to upgrade from slower storage solutions. This Black Friday deal delivers great portable storage at a price that finally makes sense for people who need speed and capacity without emptying their wallets.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Offloads 65W 3-Port Block Charger, 2-Pack Selling for 4x Cheaper Than One Apple Charger]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-offloads-65w-3-port-block-charger-2-pack-selling-for-4x-cheaper-than-one-apple-charger-2000647316</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Buying official chargers from tech companies feels like highway robbery when you see Apple charging $59 for a basic 35W single-port USB-C adapter which makes you wonder if they think everyone has unlimited money to burn on accessories.</p>
<p>The <strong>Baseus 2-pack 65W charger bundle</strong> flips that equation completely by <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5748/">giving you two three-port chargers for $28 total, dropping from the usual $49 price tag</a> to hit an all-time low for Black Friday on Amazon. Each charger pushes 65W when you plug in a single device which means you can actually fast-charge a MacBook Air at full speed instead of watching the battery percentage crawl upward like a lazy snail. You get <strong>six charging ports total across both units</strong>, and that’s the kind of flexibility that solves the eternal problem of fighting over outlets.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5748/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>65W, Two Chargers</h2>
<p>The intelligent charging technology inside these blocks automatically figures out how much power each connected device needs and <strong>splits the 65W accordingly</strong>&nbsp;so you’re not manually calculating wattage or worrying about frying your phone because you plugged it into the wrong port. You can charge your laptop, phone, and earbuds simultaneously from a single charger without everything slowing down to a frustrating trickle, though connecting<strong> three devices does divide that 65W among them</strong> based on what each one can handle. It also operates on a <strong>92% energy conversion rate thanks to the GaN chip technology</strong>&nbsp;which means less wasted electricity and noticeably cooler operation compared to older, silicon-based chargers that get hot enough to cook an egg.</p>



<p>The compact size is <strong>41% smaller than Apple’s original 65W brick</strong> and matters more than you think once you’re trying to fit chargers into already-stuffed laptop bags or tight outlet spaces behind furniture. <strong>Foldable prongs</strong> collapse flush against the body so they won’t snag on clothes or scratch other gear rattling around in your backpack.</p>
<p>You can fast-charge an<strong> iPhone 17 from 0 to 50% in about 30 minutes</strong> or power up a Dell laptop without the need for its original, bulky charger. The <strong>USB-A port handles older devices</strong> that haven’t made the USB-C jump yet and saves you from having to carry separate adapters for wireless headphones, older tablets, or that one weird gadget that just refuses to adopt modern standards.</p>



<p>The <strong>lower operating temperature</strong> keeps these chargers safe to touch even after hours of continuous use, unlike some cheap alternatives that get concerningly hot and make you nervous about leaving them plugged in overnight. Each port delivers consistent power without the voltage fluctuations that can damage batteries over time, protecting your expensive devices while they charge.</p>
<p>At $28 for two 65W three-port chargers, you’re spending less than half what Apple charges for their wimpy 35W single-port adapter, and you’re getting roughly six times the functionality in return. This Black Friday price works out to $14 per charger which is basically impulse-purchase territory for accessories that’ll get daily use for years.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sony Goes Zero-Profit on WH-1000XM5, 2x Cheaper Than AirPods Max and Bose]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-goes-zero-profit-on-wh-1000xm5-2x-cheaper-than-airpods-max-and-bose-2000647400</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-goes-zero-profit-on-wh-1000xm5-2x-cheaper-than-airpods-max-and-bose.1364857/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony just launched the <em>1000XM6</em> headphones, pushing the XM5 model into second place in the lineup but <strong>the performance gap feels like a minimum</strong> while the price difference stretches over… $200! The new XM6 demands $449 <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5629/">while Amazon just dropped the WH-1000XM5 to $248 from its usual $399</a> (38% off), hitting a record low that makes this generation the obvious choice.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5629/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>This deal also positions the <strong>XM5 at roughly half the price of Apple’s AirPods Max</strong> which costs about $550 and delivers similar specs without justifying that massive premium. The feature sets across all these flagship models is nearly identical with slight tweaks that don’t justify paying double and makes<strong> this almost 40% Black Friday discount surprisingly aggressive</strong> for headphones that rank among the best available.</p>

<h2>Noise Cancellation That Blocks the World</h2>
<p><strong>Adaptive noise cancelation technology</strong> automatically adjusts to your environment and head position with multiple microphones that sample ambient sound and produce opposing frequencies that cancel unwanted noise. You get great silence on planes, trains, and busy offices where background chatter normally destroys concentration and forces you to crank the volume to dangerous levels.</p>
<p>The Auto NC optimizer analyzes a<strong>tmospheric pressure and adjusts cancellation accordingly</strong>&nbsp;which matters more than you might think when you’re flying at altitude, where changes in air density alter how sound travels. This system works so well that you’ll sometimes take the headphones off to check whether the announcements are playing or whether the cancellation merely served to block them out completely.</p>



<p>With noise canceling activated,<strong> battery life extends to 30 hours</strong> and covers weeks of daily commutes before needing a charge. Quick charging saves you when you forget to charge overnight and rush out the door: three hours of playback from just three minutes plugged in. The lightweight design distributes pressure evenly across your head, preventing the fatigue and headaches that plague cheaper headphones after an hour of wear. <strong>Soft ear cushions seal around your ears</strong> without creating that uncomfortable vacuum feeling, maintaining comfort during marathon listening sessions where lesser headphones become unbearable.</p>
<p>Sound quality delivers Sony’s<strong> signature balanced profile, with detailed mids, clear highs, and controlled bass</strong> that doesn’t overwhelm everything else into muddy soup. The 40mm drivers produce accurate audio reproduction across all frequencies, letting you hear instrument separation in complex mixes and subtle details in well-produced tracks.</p>



<p>Alexa voice control responds to commands without touching your phone, though Google Assistant and Siri also work if you prefer different ecosystems. The speak-to-chat feature automatically pauses music when you start talking, then resumes after you finish your conversation and removes the annoyance of manually controlling playback during brief interactions.</p>
<p>Multipoint connectivity lets you <strong>pair with two devices at once</strong> and fluidly switch from your laptop for work calls to your phone for music without needing to constantly disconnect and reconnect. Touch controls reside on the ear cups and manage volume, track skipping, and call management via swipes and taps, though the learning curve takes a few days before gestures become second nature. <strong>A carrying case with the headphones protects them during travel</strong> and folds flat to save bag space, while the headphones themselves fold into a compact shape rather than just having the ear cups swivel flat.</p>
<p>At $248 instead of $399, you’re saving $151 on headphones that match or outperform the competition at significantly higher price points including Apple’s AirPods Max at double this Black Friday price. That value gets even clearer when you put this deal up against the new XM6 at $449; for $201 extra, you’re getting marginal improvements that most won’t notice in real-world use.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-airtag-4-pack-goes-for-pennies-now-samsung-and-tile-made-copies-but-nobody-beats-the-real-thing-2000647334</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple refuses to discount products on its own website even for items that have been around for years like the AirTag which means you need to shop smarter and hit up retailers with actual pricing flexibility like Amazon. These <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">Bluetooth trackers just dropped to $64 for a four-pack from the usual $99,</a> which marks an all-time low with the kind of discount you rarely see on Apple products.</p>
<p>AirTags solve the daily frustration of searching for misplaced items by letting you ping their location through your iPhone’s <em>Find My</em> network and turns frantic morning searches into quick 30-second retrievals.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Precision Finding That Actually Works in Real Life</h2>
<p>The <em>Find My</em> network uses <strong>hundreds of millions of Apple devices to detect the location of your AirTag</strong> anonymously and relay that information, creating a crowdsourced tracking system that works even when your tagged item ends up miles away from you. You get precision finding with iPhone models that feature the U1 chip, which uses ultra-wideband technology to guide you directly to your lost item with on-screen arrows and distance measurements.</p>



<p><strong>Setup takes literally one tap</strong> when you hold an AirTag near your iPhone or iPad, with the device automatically recognizing it and walking you through naming and assigning it to an item. The <strong>CR2032 battery lasts over a year</strong> before needing replacement, and swapping it out requires just a quick twist of the AirTag’s back cover rather than sending the whole unit back to Apple or dealing with proprietary charging cables.</p>
<p>There’s also a <strong>built-in speaker for playing sounds</strong> to help find items when they’re nearby but buried in couch cushions or hiding in your coat pocket. Its volume could be louder to find tags in noisy environments.<strong> Water and dust resistance</strong>, thanks to its IP67 rating, means your AirTag survives being caught in rain, dropped in puddles, or living inside your gym bag with sweaty clothes.</p>
<p><strong>Privacy protections</strong> prevent creepy tracking scenarios by alerting you if an unknown AirTag follows you around, addressing concerns of people using these devices to stalk others without consent. The system regularly rotates Bluetooth identifiers so that random people can’t track your movements by detecting the same AirTag signal repeatedly over time. If you find a lost AirTag, you can tap it with any NFC-capable phone to see the owner’s contact information if they’ve marked it as lost, making returns possible even for non-iPhone users.</p>



<p>The <strong>four-pack setup gives you enough AirTags</strong> to cover your most frequently misplaced items, such as keys, wallet, backpack, and luggage, without needing to constantly move a single tracker between items. You can label each AirTag with custom names and emojis in the Find My app, making it easy to tell “work backpack” from “gym bag” at a glance. The system works seamlessly across your Apple devices, so you can trigger an AirTag sound from your iPad when your iPhone is the thing you actually lost.</p>
<p>At $64 for four AirTags, instead of the usual $99, you pay $16 per tracker instead of nearly $25 and that finally brings the cost per unit down to something reasonable rather than feeling like the Apple tax in full effect. This Black Friday discount makes equipping your entire life with tracking capabilities actually affordable, especially compared to buying AirTags individually at a price of $29 each when you need more than one or two.</p>
