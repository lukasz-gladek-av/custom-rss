              <p>Trick or Treat season is here so why not <em>treat yourself</em> to something special? Everyone deserves a solid pair of earbuds —especially a set with noise-cancellation. What used to be a luxury is now an assumed standard as the cost of the tech has come down. Take a look at these Beats Studio Buds+. They’re normally priced at $170, but right now are part of a 41% discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3983/">You’ll save $70 and then these active noise-cancelling earbuds can be yours for just under $100.</a></p>
<p>The great news is all four color options are part of the sale. You can choose between ivory, cosmic silver, transparent, or black/gold (yes that last one is one color). I’m particularly fond of the transparent colorway. Brings me back to a time when all tech was see through. This once futuristic style of tech is now nostalgic. Funny how that happens.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3983/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Turn off the World Around You</h2>
<p>The Beats Studio Buds+ support two listening modes. <strong>Active Noise Cancellation</strong> will silence the sounds coming from your surrounding environment. This way, you hear only what you want to hear whether that is music, the latest episode of a podcast, or the next chapter of your audiobook. When the time comes you need to hear those background noises again — suggest as a co-worker approaching with a pertinent question — you can flip back to Transparency Mode. This will allows outside noise to play through the earbuds’ speakers so you can stay aware of your surroundings.</p>
<p>These earbuds have a battery life that can keep up with you all day. When considering the charging case battery, the Beats Studio Buds+ will last you a full 36 hours.</p>



<p>Perfect for gym-goers, the Beats Studio Buds+ are sweat resistant. If your lifting weights or out for a run, these earbuds are designed to stay firmly in place and be able to withstand the elements. It comes with four different sizes of silicone tips so you can use the ones that fit perfectly to your ear shape.</p>
<p>With Bluetooth, you can connect the Beats Studio Buds+ quickly and easily to your phone, laptop, or tablet. With newer phones and other devices, you can pair the earbuds with a simple touch. No holding a button down and scrolling through settings to establish a connection.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3983/">For a limited time, you can save 41% on the Beats Studio Buds +, getting a pair for just under $100.</a> They’re down from $170 so you’d be saving a good $70.</p>

              <p>Those first couple of boss fights that have been taking people down are to get slightly easier in <em>Silksong</em>‘s first update. As ridiculous as it may be, there really are few more contentious topics in the world of gaming than <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-difficulty-hard-damage-criticism-2000624031">difficulty</a>, and that topic is riding high once again with the release of <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, a single-player game that’s proving so enormously popular <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hits-over-half-a-million-players-on-pc-alone-after-crashing-steam-2000623193">it’s routinely hitting half a million concurrent players</a> every day on PC alone. But among them, many are really struggling, demonstrated by <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksongs-most-popular-mods-make-it-easier-too-hard-boss-fights-2000624107">the most popular mods all helping lower the challenge</a>. Now, developers Team Cherry are joining in too, with the game’s first patch also set to make the earliest stages of the game easier, including making Moorwing and Sister Splinter slightly less monstrous.</p> <p>In what’s surely to be a controversial move, the game’s <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595159519774039622/">first set of patch notes</a> detail a range of bug fixes and tweaks that are due to arrive “mid next week,” and among them are “some slight balance adjustments early in the game.” However, PC players can access the patched version straight away by <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595159120097716330/">opting into the public-beta branch</a> on Steam and GOG.</p> <p>After a list of fixes for glitches that players have found since launch, the update provides a little detail on what’s been made easier. “Slight difficulty reduction in early game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter,” is the first, and an awful lot of people will be breathing a sigh of relief. If you can hear past the tedious roar of the “git gud” assholes, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1nb6u1r/my_wife_has_been_waiting_for_years_for_silksong/">an awful lot of people</a> are reporting that Moorwing was the very early point in the game they were desperately looking forward to that ended their option to keep playing.</p>

 <p>Next up is a “reduction in damage from Sandcarvers,” a “slight increase in pea pod collider scale,” and a “slight reduction in mid-game Bellway and Bell Bench prices. Added to that you’ve got a “slight increase in rosary rewards from relics and psalm cylinders,” and finally an “increase in rosary rewards for courier deliveries.”</p> <p>Oftentimes, especially when a game’s development goes on for as long as&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>‘s, the people creating the game can forget they’ve had seven years’ experience playing it more than the soon-to-arrive audience, and as such elements that will prove especially challenging near the start of a game can be lost sight of. So it’s extremely normal to use data from players to make such adjustments for how the game is being widely received. There will always be voices who respond in disgust, furious that others might not have to achieve the same challenge as they did, or declaring humanity redundant as a result of the tweaks that place all others beneath them, but they’re a tiresome minority and safely ignored.</p> <p>Here’s the full list of changes in the patch, due to arrive on PC and consoles next week:</p> <blockquote><p>– Fixed situation where players could remain cloakless after Slab escape sequence.<br> – Fixed wish Infestation Operation often not being completable during the late game.<br> – Fixed wish Beast in the Bells not being completable when Bell Beast is summoned at the Bilewater Bellway during the late game.<br> – Fixed getting stuck floating after down-bouncing on certain projectiles.<br> – Fixed courier deliveries sometimes being inaccessible in Act 3.<br> – Fixed craft bind behaving incorrectly when in memories.<br> – Fixed Lace tool deflect soft-lock at start of battle in Deep Docks.<br> – Fixed Silk Snippers in Chapel of the Reaper sometimes getting stuck out of bounds.<br> – Fixed Claw Mirrors leaving Hornet inverted if taking damage during a specific moment while binding.<br> – Fixed Snitch Pick not giving rosaries and shell shards as intended.<br> – Removed float override input (down + jump, after player has Faydown Cloak).<br> – Slight difficulty reduction in early game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter.<br> – Reduction in damage from Sandcarvers.<br> – Slight increase in pea pod collider scale.<br> – Slight reduction in mid-game Bellway and Bell Bench prices.<br> – Slight increase in rosary rewards from relics and psalm cylinders.<br> – Increase in rosary rewards for courier deliveries.<br> – Various additional fixes and tweaks.</p></blockquote>
