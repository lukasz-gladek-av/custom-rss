There’s a crossover event on the way. But in actuality, you might be too distracted by the likelihood that Blizzard has used AI-generated art (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/blizzard-ai-art-stable-diffusion-concept-activision-1850463809&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/blizzard-ai-art-stable-diffusion-concept-activision-1850463809">again</a></span>) to create promotional materials. Fans have taken to social media to point out what look to be telltale signs of slop, and the evidence is pretty convincing. But here’s the thing: even if this isn’t AI, or wasn’t produced entirely by AI, the fact that we’re reflexively scanning the minutiae of various images speaks to the state of fear this rampant technology is instilling in us.

To play the contrarian that I am for a brief moment, I’ve spent enough time in Photoshop to know that quick comp work that’s often done on a tight deadline due to corporate demands <em>can</em> produce similar effects. Assets get borrowed from previous work, and how layers intersect with one another isn’t always paid direct attention to. </p><p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Blizzard to verify whether or not the image is AI, but did not hear back prior to publication.</p><p>When humans produce similarly weird things, it’s usually an oversight, and in marketing, that does happen more often than you probably think. When AI does it, it’s because it doesn’t understand the image it’s creating. It’s just using patterns of pixels it’s digested from gobbling up other people’s art. </p><p>As many folks have pointed out, another reason why it’s highly likely that this is produced by AI is that Microsoft owns Blizzard by way of its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-cma-uk-xbox-1850864469&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-cma-uk-xbox-1850864469">Activision purchase a couple of years ago</a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/news/713715/microsoft-copilot-appearance-feature-age-mustafa-suleyman-interview&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/news/713715/microsoft-copilot-appearance-feature-age-mustafa-suleyman-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft <em>loves</em> AI</a></span>. And it’s particularly sucky, as <em>Hearthstone</em> fans have highlighted, that the game “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1m5v4d1/comment/n4f4y77/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/hearthstone/comments/1m5v4d1/comment/n4f4y77/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">prides itself on its artwork</a></span>.” </p><p>Swim around in this same Reddit comment thread or elsewhere on the internet, and you’ll find some pushback to fans’ concerns. These people’s counterarguments essentially boil down to “Who cares?” Or the assertion that some people just always need something to complain about, and AI is just another thing for folks to score virtue-signaling points on the internet with. </p><p>To that, I’d say not so fast. </p><p>It’s so obvious that AI has been created and deployed specifically to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/20TAkcy3aBY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/20TAkcy3aBY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>eliminate</em> labor</a></span> (and with seemingly zero concern for the potentially irreversible energy impact on our dying planet, Cloud), that the deep concerns so many feel are not just about weird melty hands and odd ear physiology. They’re about what those things <em>represent</em>, what message this medium is communicating to those of us who value humanity in the artistic process or desire to become masters of art forms ourselves, and the fact that companies with massive power are doing what they can to restrict our abilities to sustain our lives, emotionally or financially, with said art. </p><p>This art, if it is indeed created by AI, tells us that our creations don’t have value and that those who make them are no longer needed. You can be indifferent to that, but it is what’s being said, and it is <em>not</em> the world many of us wish to live in.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/hearthstone-diablo-ai-art-blizzard-microsoft-1851787162]]></content:encoded>

I’d be confused, too. </p><p>Reactions online about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@itztherizzler&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@itztherizzler" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Rizzler</a></span> playing <em>Mario Kart World </em>with big stars were all over the place, with some congratulating the celebs for finally meeting a real bigshot, others joking about how absurd the situation is, and others still believing that this was a sign of the end. </p><p>“I’m so glad they’re doing Make A Wish for all these unfortunate actors, it must be an honor meeting such a legend,” posted one person on Instagram. </p><p>“I don’t usually trash kids but this Rizzler mf is like a horseman of the apocalypse,” said a different user on social media site BlueSky.</p><p>This isn’t the first time The Rizzler, who became extremely famous after appearing with the Costco Guys on TikTok, has promoted Nintendo games. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gonintendo.com/contents/47137-nintendo-enlists-the-rizzler-as-an-official-partner&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gonintendo.com/contents/47137-nintendo-enlists-the-rizzler-as-an-official-partner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Earlier this year</a></span>, he and his dad created a bizarre video ad for <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em> for the Nintendo Switch that is either a hyperaware piece of satire mocking sponsored content or is just the most unnatural attempt at “hanging out” I’ve seen in a long time. </p><p>Anyway, I can’t wait to vote for The Rizzler in a future presidential election, likely against some streamer who played<em> Dark Souls</em> for 53 days straight while eating Doritos or something. This all seems good and healthy and not a sign that everything is collapsing around us as monoculture dies and is replaced with the algorithm. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/the-rizzler-mario-kart-world-sdcc-celebs-reedus-brie-1851787157]]></content:encoded>

Veterans will know this is a feature that gives players special rewards. This can be in an item drop or an event, but it’s also how Game Freak sometimes delivers special Pokémon to players.<em> Legends: Z-A</em> will give early adopters a Ralts holding a Gardevoirite so it can Mega Evolve when it reaches its final form. The Publisher Information description explains how the player can acquire this gift, and notes that they will have to get about an hour-and-a-half into the game to access something called the “Link Play” menu.<em> Legends: Arceus</em> didn’t have this menu, even when it let players trade critters, and the term “link” has a specific connotation in the <em>Pokémon </em>franchise, as the original <em>Red</em> and <em>Green</em> games allowed you to play against other players with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Game_Link_Cable&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Game_Link_Cable" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Link Cable</a></span>.

If you scroll down a little further, you’ll see it specified that <em>Legends: Z-A </em>only supports one player.

It’s entirely possible we hear more about the game then, and given that the competitive community will have its eyes locked on the show, that seems as good a time as any to announce multiplayer if it exists. For now, however, we’re left with more questions. <em>Legends: Z-A </em>launches on Switch and Switch 2 on October 16.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-link-play-multiplayer-switch-2-1851787158]]></content:encoded>

Itch.io quietly updated its list of banned content over the weekend with the following section on adult games:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The following is a non-exhaustive list of prohibited themes present in card processing networks. We are unable to support the sale of any works containing these topics:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Non-consensual content (real or implied)</li><li>Underage or “barely legal” themes</li><li>Incest or pseudo-incest content</li><li>Bestiality or animal-related</li><li>Rape, coercion, or force-related</li><li>Sex trafficking implications</li><li>Revenge porn / voyeur / hidden cam</li><li>Fetish involving bodily waste or extreme harm (e.g., “scat,” “vomit”)</li></ul></blockquote><p>Developers can appeal individual bans, but with thousands of listings removed and someone needing to actually play each individual title to adjudicate claims, that process seems all but unworkable in the short term. “It’s almost impossible to come up with an exhaustive list of unacceptable products to sell, so often we have to take content reviews one at a time,” Itchi.io writes on the site. “If an issue arises with your account that isn’t already covered by our policy, then we will contact you and share what options you may have.”<br></p><p>While Steam has also banned hundreds of games revolving around rape or incest in response to pressure from Visa, Mastercard, and other payment processors.

According to its creator, it includes the option for incestual relationships between characters but doesn’t not demand it. It remains available on Steam but was one of those games purged from Itch.io last week. </p><p>“This completely destroys me—so many games published with love on this platform, and now they won’t reach anyone new,” wrote<em> Love’s Heart</em> creator Capky Games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://itch.io/blog/993219/all-nsfw-games-removed-from-search-listings&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://itch.io/blog/993219/all-nsfw-games-removed-from-search-listings" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a blog post</a></span> last week. “I don’t have an audience elsewhere; I depend on itch.io to grow.
