            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If high laptop prices have been holding you back from upgrading, now is the time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6736/">The 15.6-inch HP business laptop is down to $400 at Amazon, after a massive 56% or $500 discount on its usual $900 price.</a></p>
<p>The bundle includes a Microsoft Office 365 subscription, Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, and a recovery USB. Delivery is free, so you’re saving a bit on that front too, which brings the overall cost down even further. But as you’d expect, the discount is around for a short time. We’re not expecting it to last longer than a day, so it’s best to get your orders in without wasting much time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6736/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Expandable Memory and Storage</h2>
<p>For just $400, you’re getting a sleek laptop that features a nice 15.6-inch Full HD display. With a resolution of 1920 × 1080, the screen delivers crisp details and vibrant colors for an immersive viewing experience. The anti-glare coating keeps it easy on the eyes, allowing you to use the laptop comfortably in all lighting conditions. Working on an important work presentation or just catching up on your favorite show, expect vivid, sharp visuals consistently.</p>
<p>The machine is powered by the latest Intel Core i3-1315U processor that features 6 cores (2 performance cores + 4 efficiency cores) and 8 threads to deliver fast, efficient performance. Intel Turbo Boost Technology helps it reach up to 4.5 GHz, meaning you can rely on the laptop for everyday work tasks, plus casual use (browsing, streaming, checking emails, communicating). Paired with the laptop is a modest 8GB RAM, which keeps everything running smoothly at the backend. It’s not massive, so you won’t exactly be able to multitask, but here’s the good part – the memory is expandable up to 64GB. That means you can always upgrade as your needs grow. The same is the case with the 628GB SSD (128GB SSD+500GB external). It’s sufficient to house important files, work documents, and media content, but the PCIe NVMe SSD supports capacities up to 2 TB. If it ever feels tight, you expand the capacity to keep the system running smoothly.</p>



<p>Port-wise, you’re covered with Ethernet (RJ-45) for speedy wired networking, an SD card reader, USB-C, two USB 3.2 Type-A, HDMI output, and a headphone/microphone combo jack. That’s more than enough to create a productive setup for both office and studies. You can add external drives, and even connect another monitor if you need more than one screen.</p>
<p>Freebies add even more value to the bundle. You’re getting a Microsoft Office 365 subscription, which offers access to efficient apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote, and more. You will also enjoy 1 TB of OneDrive cloud storage, handy AI features, and other useful tools that make remote productivity and creativity a breeze. Windows 11 Pro also comes pre-installed, which means you can get started with using the laptop right away. And finally, there’s a WOWPC recovery USB in the bundle, which offers quick and convenient system restoration in case of software issues.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6736/">This future-proof HP laptop is now sitting at just $400 at Amazon.</a> It’s practically nothing considering all the features the machine is packed with. We highly suggest grabbing it as soon as you can before the price shoots back up to $900.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/division-3-definitive-edition-remaster-destiny-2000658970</link>
            <guid>1404412</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/tom-clancys-the-division-the-kotaku-review-1766431754"><em>The Division</em></a> came out nearly a decade ago. You can still go and play it but it hasn’t received a meaningful update since 2018. That could all be about to change. Marketing for “<em>The Division: Definitive Edition</em>” recently appeared in Japan suggesting the Tom Clancy-branded loot shooter could be getting a modern version to bring players back into its snowy, post-apocalyptic New York City.</p> <p>A mural advertising the unannounced version was spotted at the <a href="https://twitter.com/domen0204/status/2010224815131766796?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2010224815131766796%7Ctwgr%5E03918b0436fb66d4f458378427f25deceae49e55%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fit-looks-like-the-division-definitive-edition-is-on-the-way-10-years-after-its-initial-release">FPS Day X esports event</a> where Ubisoft shared other info about the franchise, like a new “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zo5k8xkeHs">Realism Mode</a>” for <em>The Division 2</em> that will make the RPG play more like a traditional shooter with quicker time-to-kills and other more lethal tweaks. The first <em>Division</em> game originally launched back in March 2016, so it’s likely that whatever this Definitive Edition is could become available in just a few months.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="qme" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/FPSDayX?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#FPSDayX</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheDivision2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheDivision2</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%87%E3%82%A3%E3%83%93%E3%82%B8%E3%83%A7%E3%83%B32?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#ディビジョン2</a> <a href="https://t.co/1ySkfSb98B">pic.twitter.com/1ySkfSb98B</a></p> <p>— Domen🐻Gaming | ドウメン (@domen0204) <a href="https://twitter.com/domen0204/status/2010224815131766796?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 11, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>What a Definitive Edition would actually entail has been the subject of much speculation over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/1q9ywr5/the_division_definitive_edition_spotted_at_fpsday/"><em>The Division</em> subreddit</a>. Will it be a current-gen remaster that brings the game natively to PS5 and Xbox Series X/S? <em>The Division 2</em> never got one, making that theory seem unlikely to some. Others would be happy if the game simply got support for 60fps on console and other quality-of-life improvements. Some fans have also suggested the possibility of new story content, or the merging of certain mechanics and modes from the current game back into the older one.</p>

 <p>Of course, it’s very possible that what Ubisoft might mean by a “Definitive Edition” is that it’s bringing all of <em>The Division 1</em> and <em>The Division 2</em> into a single cohesive package. That would seemingly be a much bigger undertaking and it’s hard to see exactly how it would work. The second game’s Warlords of New York added the first game’s location, but there’s still a ton of missions, story, and other content that could make its way there. A single package would also make it a more obvious candidate for a Switch 2 port.</p>

 <h2><em>The Division</em> seems to be doing exactly what <em>Destiny</em> fans keep begging for</h2> <p>Assuming that whatever this Definitive Edition is, it brings the old game forward for new and returning players to enjoy fresh in 2026 in some way, developer Massive will be fulfilling the dream that many <em>Destiny</em> fans have had ever since <em>Destiny 2</em> wrapped up its big, 10-year story arc with <em>The Final Shape</em>. While Bungie has brought some of the best parts of the old game forward into <em>Destiny 2</em> over the years, it also ditched most of the sequel’s original campaign to make room for ongoing expansions.</p>

 <p>A perennial request of fans is for the Red War and other cut content to return. Another pie-in-the-sky wish is for the old <em>Destiny</em> to return in some “vanilla” form similar to<em> World of Warcraft Classic.</em> It would be the original game but with a visual overhaul and on modern platforms so that players feel like there’s a reason for everyone to go back at the same time. The third request you’ll find in the replies for almost any new announcement from the <em>Destiny</em> social media account is for Bungie to simply start fresh and make <em>Destiny 3</em>.</p>

 <p>https://x.com/blueberriesGG/status/2010713900975902762</p> <p>Those are all very tall orders for a studio that’s suffered tons of layoffs, cuts, and player attrition in recent years, especially as it works on getting its new sci-fi shooter, <em>Marathon</em>, out the door alongside ongoing <em>Destiny 2</em> updates. But this is kind of what fans of <em>The Division</em> are in for right now. Executive producer Julian Gerighty recently teased that <em>The Division 3</em> is “<a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-leak-division-3-fable-ps5-2000658489">shaping up to be a monster</a>.” In addition to its recently revealed Realism Mode, The <em>Division 2</em> is also getting its delayed Survivors mode later this year.</p>

 <p>If this Definitive Edition of the original game doesn’t disappoint, fans of the apocalyptic shooter will be eating well. <em>Destiny 2</em> fans might even be envious. Something they’ve never had much reason to feel before, if ever.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-3-0-update-prep-restart-island-resetti-2000658987</link>
            <guid>1404373</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>It wasn’t April Fool’s Day when Nintendo announced a big, new update for </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span>—but mid-20s programmer Lemmy still thought it was a joke. His girlfriend sent him a link on Instagram, and he thought it was a fake announcement. He went straight to the source: Nintendo, where he realized that yes, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-update-free-2000640118"><span>Nintendo </span><i><span>was</span></i><span> releasing a new update for the five-year-old game</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Nintendo’s 3.0 update and Switch 2 upgrade for </span><i><span>New Horizons </span></i><span>will be released on January 15, the first big update to the game since 2021. </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> is far from a dead game, but its massive playerbase—which swelled during the COVID-19 pandemic—has, naturally, fell off. Those of us who spent hundreds of hours on our </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> islands for a year and a half have moved on; many of us haven’t visited our islands since. We’ve left messes on our islands, and remain forever indebted to Tom Nook. With the economy inevitably stalling after we took our “go get ‘em!” industriousness with us, the villagers we left behind have spent the last couple of years fending for themselves.</span></p>

 <p><span>“[My girlfriend and I] played </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> when it released and then I pretty much played it every day for a year, and maybe a little less often for another six months,” Lemmy said. “I think I fully stopped playing it summer 2023.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The new content and quality-of-life improvements it introduces make Nintendo’s 3.0 update the push many players needed to return to the game. But that raises a big question: To nuke or not to nuke? For some players, like Lemmy, the </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span> 3.0 update was the perfect excuse not only to return to the game, but also to make a fresh start. “When I saw and heard about the update it persuaded me to restart,” he said. “I did that just before the new year.”</span></p>

  <p><span>Morri Koester, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCf8BqWN05p7W_TOoFB7d9oA">a YouTube creator</a> who has played</span><i><span>&nbsp;New Horizons</span></i><span> for more than 5,000 hours and built a dozen or so islands, told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> that they aren’t making a new island, but are still using the new update “as an excuse to do things differently”—”new year, new me sort of vibes,” they said. Koester has been working on their current island for two years at this point, and unlocked nearly all of the DIYs and catalogue items. The big reason they’re not doing more to totally overhaul their island or start anew is because the 3.0 update has a feature that’ll essentially do that itself—Resetti. Resetti’s Reset Service is a quality-of-life feature intended to clear up big swaths of an island; it’ll remove flowers, decorations, and fencing from a specific area. (Everything, including flowers, shrubs, and trees, will go straight into inventory.)&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“My island is a mess because I refuse to do the man’s work for him, but I can’t wait to see that mess just poof into a blank canvas to start my new island theme,” Koester said.</span></p> <p><span>Instead of completely restarting, Koester spent the time between the 3.0 announcement and the update’s release day working on a series of different goals—primarily, prepping to complete the Nook Miles goals they set for themself. The 3.0 update’s bulk crafting mechanic, which lets players craft in bulk straight from their inventory, means it’ll be easier to finish some of the harder Nook Miles tasks. One of the Nook Miles challenges that’s notoriously hard to complete is crafting 3,000 furniture items. Koester is looking to reach this goal in a day when the update is released; they’re collecting coconuts so they can craft nearly a thousand Coconut Juices—a furniture item in </span><i><span>New Horizons</span></i><span>, which requires only coconuts to craft—in a day.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I know everyone has a specific opinion or strategy for preparing for the update, whether it’s cataloguing items or gathering resources, but my personal opinion is to prepare for what is going to give you the most joy in the game,” Koester said. “If that means restarting your island on update day to get the full 3.0 experience on a new island, do that. If that means cleaning out your inventory on your five-year-old forever island, do that! If that means collecting a crapton of coconuts like an obsessive gaming gremlin, do that. Prep is all in the mindset, not in specific gameplay.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Lemmy, meanwhile, has spent the time between the update announcement and January 15 working through the early hours of any new island—opening the museum, saving resources.</span></p> <p><span>“I just wanted a fresh start, especially to experience some of the changes and the DLC with a clean canvas, making use of the new items and features without ripping everything up first,” he told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “My preparation is kind of just that—restarting. But also I’m just saving resources, not worrying about decorating my island or anything yet, and just progressing through the early parts of the game with as little planning as I can.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000659000" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000659000"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000659000">Image: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Players that are restarting don’t have to go it alone, though: Lots of players on social media and forums are offering to help support players looking to start over. “I’ve been going on and off mystery islands to collect materials for restart care packages,” </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1pqbpn7/comment/nut7toc/"><span>one person on Reddit wrote</span></a><span>. There’s no right or wrong way to experience a new update, but some players, indeed, do feel pressure to do things the “right” way; lots of players have spent a lot of time on their islands, perfecting every little detail, or rushing to gobble up all the new content.</span></p>

 <p><span>But Koester wants to remind players that even the most seasoned players, like them, don’t necessarily feel prepared.</span></p> <p><span>“It’s a big change to the game, with new mechanics, new buildings, new NPCs, and new items,” they said. “Seasoned and new players alike will experience it at the same time for the first time, which in itself is a pretty magical feeling to share. If you’re worried, just know that everyone is going through the ‘new’ feeling, and take it slow. Not everything has to be experienced at once. So no matter what, whether you’re starting a new island, had your island for years, stopped playing for a time, there is no being late to experiencing joy. You’re fashionably on time.”</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-3-0-update-prep-restart-island-resetti-2000658987]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1404325</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div dir="auto" data-message-author-role="assistant" data-message-id="5578d516-004a-443d-9021-2e45e479675c" data-message-model-slug="gpt-5-2">
<p data-start="0" data-end="554">For many people today, space is a luxury. City living often means smaller apartments, compact desks, and the constant challenge of fitting everything you need into a limited footprint. When it comes to computers, that reality can make a bulky PC tower feel impractical, if not impossible. You want something powerful enough to handle work and play, but small enough that it doesn’t dominate your workspace. This is where mini PCs step in—and KAMRUI’s Hyper H1 mini gaming PC is a compelling example of how much performance can be packed into a small box.</p>
<p data-start="556" data-end="985">KAMRUI has been steadily building a reputation for compact computing solutions, and the Hyper H1 is designed with gamers and power users in mind. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6735/">Right now, the Hyper H1 is seeing a significant discount, with savings of up to 31% off its original $549 price. Depending That drops the price down to just $379 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6735/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="987" data-end="1503">At the heart of the Hyper H1 is an AMD Ryzen 7 6800H processor. This is an 8-core, 16-thread mobile CPU capable of boosting up to 4.7GHz, which gives it plenty of horsepower for demanding everyday tasks. Paired with 32GB of RAM and a 512GB SSD, the system is well-equipped for multitasking, productivity, and moderate gaming right out of the box. For users who want more headroom, memory can be upgraded to 64GB, and storage can be expanded up to 4TB with a compatible SSD.</p>
<p data-start="2040" data-end="2558">Connectivity is another strong point. The compact chassis houses six USB-A 3.2 ports, making it easy to connect a mouse, keyboard, controller, or external drives. There’s also a USB-C port, along with HDMI and DisplayPort outputs, allowing support for up to three monitors simultaneously. The Hyper H1 can drive displays at up to 4K resolution and 60Hz refresh rates, which is impressive for a mini PC. On the networking side, it includes dual-band Wi-Fi, Gigabit Ethernet, and Bluetooth 5.2 for flexible connectivity.</p>


<h2 data-start="2560" data-end="2870">Why Go Mini?</h2>
<p data-start="56" data-end="447">Although many TVs now include built-in streaming apps and affordable devices like Fire TV and Roku are widely available, a mini PC can still be an excellent choice for powering your home theater. A mini PC supports a broad range of video formats and allows you to play media stored locally. Its compact design also makes it easy to tuck away behind your TV or inside an entertainment center.</p>
<p data-start="449" data-end="738" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Many users choose mini PCs as the foundation for a PLEX server, giving them access to their media libraries from virtually anywhere. They’re also well suited for retro game emulation, since older games require minimal processing power. Just make sure any ROMs you use are obtained legally. I’m sure you would never consider downloading a ROM you don’t own…</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-goes-all-in-on-galaxy-s25-ultra-clearance-at-a-record-low-as-the-new-s26-launch-approaches-2000658989</link>
            <guid>1404301</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Now that’s its 2026, Samsung is likely to announced a refresh to its flagship lineup of smartphones with their anticipated S26 versions. Though a goods way to save some cash while staying mostly up to date with the latest tech is to pick up the previous year model whenever you’re looking to upgrade. The Galaxy S25 Ultra, S25+, and S25 aren’t going anywhere and still remain some of the best choices for Android users.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6734/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<h2>Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra</h2>
<p data-start="30" data-end="301">The high-end Galaxy S25 Ultra comes in several configurations with different storage options. Samsung has eliminated the 128 GB model from the prior generation, streamlining the lineup into a 256 GB version ($1,300), a 512 GB version ($1,420), and a top-tier 1 TB option. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6734/">Right now, Amazon has the 256GB model on sale for as low as $1,020 which is a discount of 22% saving $280.</a> Likewise, the 512GB model has come down to as low as $1,100. That’s 23% discount, saving $320. Amazon currently isn’t offering the 1TB model.</p>

<h2 data-start="303" data-end="319">What You Get</h2>
<p data-start="321" data-end="512">The S25 Ultra stands as Samsung’s latest flagship smartphone, packed with premium features throughout. Driven by Galaxy AI, many capabilities see notable upgrades compared to its predecessor.</p>
<p data-start="321" data-end="512">If you’re finding yourself increasingly relying on AI, Gemini Live allows you to speak freely and naturally with the onboard AI to attain information in real time like you would a regular person.</p>
<p data-start="321" data-end="512">The 6.9-inch display delivers sharper imagery and more vibrant colors than ever before. The camera system features a 50MP Ultra Wide lens designed to capture the full scope of your surroundings. With the help of Galaxy AI, the camera intelligently detects ambient lighting to produce accurate skin tones and detailed textures, bringing portraits to life without the need for extra editing. Video recording is smoother than ever with Night Video and Audio Eraser, allowing you to shoot vivid footage in low-light environments while reducing unwanted background noise using Galaxy AI.</p>


<p data-start="1099" data-end="1368" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Across the Galaxy S25 Ultra, S25+, and S25 lineup, you can choose from a handful of sleek color options. The S25 Ultra specifically comes in a titanium metal case, including the colors Titanium Black, Titanium Gray, Titanium Silverblue, and Titanium Whitesilver.
