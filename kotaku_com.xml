              <p>Spooky season is upon us, and that means the movie theater schedules are stacked with horror movies. This year, more than ever, bigger names are being drawn to the genre as it proves one of the most resilient ways of getting butts in seats. With Guillermo del Toro’s <em>Frankenstein</em> leading the pack, we’ve also got Ethan Hawke returning for&nbsp;<em>Black Phone 2</em>, Keira Knightley in&nbsp;<em>The Woman in Cabin 10</em>, and both Justin Long and Kate Bosworth appearing in&nbsp;<em>Coyotes</em>. And so many more besides. So, to be helpful, we’ve rounded up the trailers for all of October’s scariest upcoming horror movies.</p> <p>Horror is big business right now, with studios having finally noticed that if you put more than no money into a scary film, you can still make them super-cheap and see some stellar returns. As such, we’re seeing some bigger names wanting to get involved, alongside the gloriously kitsch and classically gory. Below, in order of U.S. release date across October, are our picks for flicks to scare you out of you knicks.</p> <h2><em>Good Boy</em></h2>  <p>Out today (<strong>October 3</strong>) and getting rave reviews (including <a href="https://kotaku.com/good-boy-does-the-dog-die-horror-movie-indy-showtimes-2000631497">this praise from <em>Kotaku</em>‘s own Kenneth Shepard</a>),&nbsp;<em>Good Boy</em> is a horror movie from the perspective of a dog. Indy the doggo is determined to protect his human buddy Todd from evil forces in a surprisingly short film—just 72 minutes. It’s written and directed by Ben Leonberg, his first feature-length movie, and stars his own pet dog Indy—a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever—in the lead role. The human cast are relative unknowns (although perhaps not for long) Arielle Friedman and Shane Jensen, alongside Hollywood stalwart portrayer of homeless gentlemen, Stuart Rudin.</p> <h2><em>Bone Lake</em></h2>  <p>Has there been a more on-the-nose name for a horror movie since 1999’s ridiculous&nbsp;<em>Cherry Falls</em>?&nbsp;<em>Bone Lake</em> is a sexy horror flick from director Mercedes Bryce Morgan, previously best known for, er,&nbsp;<em>Stargate Origins: Catherine</em>. The Bleecker Street release is clearly attempting to evoke a little bit of&nbsp;<em>Saltburn</em>, but in a story about two couples accidentally booking the same AirBnB for the same weekend. Except, for some reason, everyone keeps taking their clothes off and/or being chopped up by axes and chainsaws. I mean, it sounds like all the elements for a stone-cold B-movie classic. The first handful of reviews have been middling, but then this was never a movie to win over the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>. It too is out today, <strong>October 3</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Coyotes</em></h2>  <p>Yet another <strong>October 3</strong> release is comedy horror film <em>Coyotes</em>. Real-life couple Kate Bosworth <em>(Superman</em> <em>Returns</em>, <em>Before I Wake</em>) and Justin Long (<em>Weapons</em>,&nbsp;<em>Galaxy Quest</em>) reunite after appearing together in 2022’s&nbsp;<em>Barbarian</em>, as parents trapped in their home by a savage pack of…you guessed right, coyotes. It looks tremendously silly, incredibly violent, and contains the line, “GET THE FUCK OFF MY HUSBAND.” That’s all I need. It’s directed by Colin Minihan (<em>What Keeps You Alive</em>,&nbsp;<em>Grave Encounters</em>) and looks like some very schlocky fun.</p>   <p>The infinite arms of the&nbsp;<em>V/H/S</em> franchise reach out yet again, this time with a collection of seven Halloween-themed shorts, one of which comes from director Casper Kelly, the man behind Adult Swim’s&nbsp;<em>Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell</em>,&nbsp;<em>Stroker &amp; Hoop</em>, and the infamous <em>Infomercials</em> episode,&nbsp;<em>Too Many Cooks</em>. It’s on Shudder from today, <strong>October 3</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Scared Shitless</em></h2>  <p>The final <strong>October 3</strong> release (you could watch new horror movies all night tonight!) is&nbsp;<em>Scared Shitless</em>, which looks like it should be hilarious, but the trailer doesn’t have me convinced. It looks like it’s trying a bit too hard with its glove puppet toilet monster and overly wacky goofs. If you recognize the older lead guy, that’s because he’s Steven Ogg, Trevor Phillips from <em>GTA V</em>! His son is played by Daniel Doheny (<em>Brand New Cherry Flavor</em>) wearing what looks like his first beard, starring alongside the mighty Julian Richings and Mark McKinney. It’s the first theatrically released movie from Canadian comedy director Vivieno Caldinelli, who is more usually shooting skits for sketch shows.</p> <h2><em>Vicious</em></h2>  <p>Paramount Plus gets in on the spooky action <strong>October 10</strong> with Dakota Fanning in&nbsp;<em>Vicious</em>. It seems to set itself up as a film about a woman who is cursed to find three objects, one she loves, one she hates, and one she can’t live without, and put them all in a box before midnight. Should she fail, she’ll die. That’s a great premise, given how hard it would be to look inside yourself and answer those three questions truthfully, but the trailer suggests things are going in about seventy-three other directions too. Clearly Dakota Fanning is a big win for Paramount’s streamer, in a movie written and directed by Bryan “<em>The Strangers”</em> Bertino.</p> <h2><em>The Woman in Cabin 10</em></h2>  <p>On the same day, <strong>October 10</strong>, rival streamer Netflix has its own big-name horror release with <em>The Woman in Cabin 10</em>. Kiera Knightley leads, with Guy Pearce (<em>Memento</em>,&nbsp;<em>L.A. Confidential</em>) pulling off a very convincing British accent. It’s all about a reporter on a luxury yacht who thinks she sees a death, and is then hounded and gaslit by the super-posh people on board. Part scary thriller, part whodunnit mystery, it’s directed by Simon Stone, the Swiss director behind 2021’s well-respected&nbsp;<em>The Dig</em>.</p> <h2><em>Black Phone 2</em></h2>  <p>2021’s&nbsp;<em>The Black Phone</em> was an interesting choice for star Ethan Hawke. More usually mumbling through indie roles directed by Richard Linklater, here he jumped into the post-<em>Saw</em> trend for terrifying iconic horror villains: a serial child-killer known as the Grabber. Four years later, Hawke returns to the Blumhouse production for a classic-style sequel, with a should-be-dead enemy returning for revenge against the older cast of the original. Director Scott Derrickson is hit or miss, with a dreadful remake of <em>The Day the Earth Stood Still</em> and some middling horrors like&nbsp;<em>Sinister</em> and&nbsp;<em>The Gorge</em>, but he also gave us the solid <em>Doctor Strange.&nbsp;</em>The trailer looks fantastic, seeming to repeat the Wes Craven meets Stephen King ’70s vibes of the original. It’s out <strong>October 17</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Frankenstein</em></h2>  <p>Netflix has funded Guillermo del Toro’s version of&nbsp;<em>Frankenstein</em>, with a short theatrical release on <strong>October 17</strong> before it arrives on Netflix November 7. (Clearly the streamer thinks there could be trophies in this one.) It’s sticking to the gothic horror of Shelley’s novel, looking like a relatively faithful interpretation, albeit through del Toro’s extraordinary imagination, with Oscar Isaac (<em>Ex Machina</em>, <em>Moon Knight</em>) <em>as</em> Dr. Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi (<em>Euphoria</em>) as his creation, alongside Mia Goth (<em>Pearl</em>, <em>Infinity Pool</em>) as Elizabeth. Del Toro doesn’t miss, so there’s every reason to be very excited for this one.</p> <h2><em>R.L. Stine’s Pumpkinhead</em></h2>  <p>I could pretend it wasn’t this trailer that made me want to write this entire article, but I’m not ashamed. 81-year-old Robert Lawrence Stine, the author of the&nbsp;<em>Goosebumps</em> novels, has his name glued to the title of this&nbsp;<em>Pumpkinhead</em> remake (the original starring Lance Henriksen came out in 1988), but he is neither writer nor director. Both those roles fall to Jem Garrard, the director behind last year’s Tubi queer vampire flick <em>Slay</em>. They are back with Tubi for this movie too, a kid-friendly (although not&nbsp;<em>that</em> friendly) film that reimagines the very adult original as something a touch more tame. It’s on Tubi <strong>October 17</strong>.</p> <h2><em>The Hand That Rocks the Cradle</em></h2>  <p>Yup, it’s back. Curtis Hanson’s 1992 classic, starring Annabella Sciorra, Rebecca De Mornay and Matt McCoy, as well as Ernie Hudson, Julianne Moore and Madeline Zima, had one of the darkest plots of all time. A sexual predator is caught and kills himself, which causes his widowed wife to miscarry, and in turn drives her to seek revenge on one of his accusers by becoming her nanny and destroying her life. This time, however, the film is less thriller, more horror, given it’s directed by Mexican horror pro Michelle Garza Cervera. And it doesn’t seem to be following the original film’s motives for its characters, either, with nanny Polly Murphy (Maika Monroe of <em>Longlegs </em>and&nbsp;<em>It Follows</em>) hired by upper-class mom Caitlin Morales (Mary Elizabeth Winstead of <em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em>), who then begins infiltrating her life and marriage. But also, there’s some other weird darkness going on here, something more overtly creepy. It comes to Hulu and Disney+ <strong>October 22</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Shelby Oaks</em></h2>  <p>Arriving on big screens <strong>October 24</strong>,&nbsp;<em>Shelby Oaks</em> looks fucking terrifying. It has the big boost of Mike Flanagan as an executive producer, and is directed by former YouTube movie critic Chris Stuckmann (<em>Chris Stuckmann Movie Reviews</em>). There are some real mixed media vibes to the trailer, in a film about a woman trying to find her missing sister, and beginning to suspect that a demon they imagined in their childhoods might be a bit too real. Camille Sullivan (<em>She Talks to Strangers</em>) is the lead,&nbsp;<em>Mayor of Kingstown</em>‘s Michael Beach is here as a detective, and I’m delighted to say it also stars the always-wonderful Keith David.</p> <h2><em>In Our Blood</em></h2>  <p>“Indie horror” too often means rubbery monsters shot on iPhone, but that’s not the case here.&nbsp;<em>In Our Blood</em> has the vibes of an indie that scoops all the awards at a film festival, but harnessed here to deliver a super-weird and disturbing lo-fi movie about filmmakers making a documentary about reuniting with an estranged mother. However, she’s disappeared, and the reasons why are dark and terrible. It’s directed by Pedro Kos, who has been Oscar nominated for his documentaries, but now turns his hand to narrative. The lead is Brittany O’Grady, one of the stars of the first series of <em>The White Lotus</em>, without any other major names to take away the faux-realism of the flick. It’s in theaters <strong>October 24</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Queens of the</em> <em>Dead</em></h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/george-a-romeros-daughter-zombie-drag-queen-movie-queens-trailer-2000626904">Tina Romero’s <em>Queens of the Dead</em></a> is an attempt to make her own mark following the legacy of her father’s movies. George A. Romero’s&nbsp;<em>Night of the Living Dead</em> and its sequels are certainly memorable, but none of them followed the adventures of a group of drag queens and club kids attempting to survive the zombie apocalypse. Sillier than her dad’s films, <a href="https://www.thecurb.com.au/suff-interview-tina-romero-queens-of-the-dead/">she says</a>,&nbsp;<em>Queens of the Dead</em> is a celebration of queer culture and aims to be uplifting in its politics during a very dark time in real life. Starring Jaquel Spivey (<em>Mean Girls 2024</em>), Katy O’Brian (<em>The Mandolorian</em>,&nbsp;<em>Love Lies Bleeding</em>) and Margaret Cho, it’s getting fantastic early buzz, and will be on big screens <strong>October 24</strong>.</p>

              <p>We’re just days away from Big Prime Deals Day over at Amazon. This is a multi-day sales event put on during the slower purchasing months to help kickstart some sales. That means if you’ve been patient, waiting for the right moment to buy that espresso maker or bidet you’d been eyeing, next week on October 7 and October 9 might be the best time to pull the trigger. And yet, even though it’s not officially here yet, some items have already begun dropping in price. Take this mini PC for example. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4467/">You can get the AceMagic mini PC right now for 25% off. It’s normally going for $200, so you’ll save a good $50 as it comes to just $150 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4467/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Get a Mini?</h2>
<p>If you don’t have that large of a living space, like if you live with roommates or just have&nbsp; one bedroom or studio in an expensive city, you probably consider what little space you have to be precious. You may not want to take up your entire desk with a massive PC tower. A mini PC offers versatility while keeping the footprint small.</p>
<p>Lots of modern TVs already have built-in smart features, allowing you to download app like Netflix and Hulu directly to them. And if your happens not to be one of those, streaming sticks like the Fire TV and Roku are pretty cheap to come by. That all may be the case, but there are still reason to power your home theater with a mini PC instead. They are full-on Windows devices after all. That means you’d have a wider range of compatibility, playing various video formats and even playing locally saved media. And the small form factor is easy enough to keep hidden behind your TV or within its stand.</p>
<p>Mini PCs also make for wonderful PLEX servers which means you can access your media files anywhere you are. Some gamers tend to flock toward mini PCs are they are the perfect emulation machine for retro games given the minimal amount of processing power they require. Now if you are choosing to do that, be sure it’s only for storing ROMs of games you already happen to legally own. I won’t be personally checking, so you don’t have to pinky swear me anything.</p>



<h2>Specs on Specs on Specs</h2>
<p>This mini PC from AceMagic is equipped with the 2025 Twin Lake N150 processor along with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. It’s pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro and has multiple USB ports to connect to your peripherals.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4467/">Get the mini PC ahead of Prime Big Deals Day for just $150.</a></p>
