            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft has announced the the first list of games being added to Xbox Game Pass <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-price-subscription-renewal-delay-xbox-2000632625">since the service’s unpopular price hike news rolled out last week</a>. It includes <em>The Grinch: Christmas Adventures – Merry &amp; Mischievous Edition</em>, the update to a 2023 co-op holiday adventure that I’m sure fans have been waiting for.</p> <p>The “festive platformer” has you searching for collectibles, snowboarding down Mount Crumpit, and even parachuting through Whoville. Apparently that was not enough to impress many of the only 27 people who reviewed the $40 Steam version. “This game is BAD!” wrote one. “Quite terrible all things considered,” wrote another. “The original game from the 90’s was a world play style game with objectives and missions…this is a game for a 5 year old.”</p>

 <p>Don’t let that completely dissuade you from checking it out though! Here’s everything coming to the various, newly priced tiers of Game Pass in October 2025:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><strong><em>Supermarket Simulator&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – October 8</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>Baldur’s Gate and Baldur’s Gate II: Enhanced Editions</em></strong><strong>&nbsp;(PC) – October 9</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>The Casting of Frank Stone </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – October 14</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>Ball x Pit </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – October 15</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>The Grinch: Christmas Adventures </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – October 15</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>Eternal Strands </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – October 15</strong><br> Now with Game Pass Premium</li> <li><strong><em>He Is Coming&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>(Game Preview)</strong><strong>&nbsp;(PC) – October 15</strong><br> Now with Game Pass Premium</li> <li><strong><em>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – October 15</strong><br> Now with Game Pass Premium</li> <li><strong><em>Pax Dei&nbsp;</em></strong><strong>(PC) – October 16</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>Keeper </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – October 17</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>Evil West </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, Console, and PC) – October 21</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, Game Pass Premium, PC Game Pass</li> <li><strong><em>Ninja Gaiden 4 </em></strong><strong>(Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) – October 21</strong><br> Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>That is 12 games in total, and some of them are shaping up to be quite good, especially <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>. But it’s also worth noting that only three of these games require Game Pass Ultimate. The rest are all available with Game Pass Premium or Game Pass PC. This is the last batch hitting before the new $30-a-month price hits most Ultimate subscribers on November 4, so while Microsoft might be trying to win players over with a few surprises in November, this month is mostly what we expected it to be.</p> <p>The three games leaving Game Pass on October 15 are <em>Cocoon</em>, <em>Core Keeper</em>, and <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed.</em> <em>Cocoon</em> in particular is an outstanding puzzle adventure you can finish in just a couple of sittings. If you haven’t given it a try or already beaten it, I highly recommend checking it out in the next week before it’s gone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Prime Day deals are going in full swing, making it a great time to invest in a gaming monitor. If you’ve been looking for something feature-packed at a more approachable price, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4641/">we’ve just spotted the 27-inch LG UltraGear QHD gaming monitor going for $297 on Amazon, which is a 41% discount off its regular price.</a></p>
<p>This is a significant drop, but it’s only limited to Prime users at the moment. Non-Prime users can snag it up for $349, which is also a nice $151 off. Prime members also enjoy free delivery, but just be sure to get your orders in soon. The retailer has marked it as a limited-time deal, and we won’t be surprised if it expires soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4641/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Better Color Accuracy on a Massive Screen</h2>
<p>The 27-inch screen size is quite spacious, offering a decent 2560×1440 QHD resolution. The IPS panel offers vibrant colors, exceptional contrast, and impressive detail – all of which come together to create an immersive gaming or streaming experience. It also supports VESA DisplayHDR 400 and covers up to 95% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, so you can expect deeper blacks and more visual accuracy. There’s an ultra-fast 1ms (GtG) response time, paired with a 240Hz refresh rate to keep slowdowns and lags at bay. Racing past opponents or engaging in competitive matches where every second counts; this monitor won’t disappoint.</p>



<p>It’s officially G-SYNC Compatible and also supports AMD FreeSync Premium. You can choose a GPU without worrying about screen tearing or stutter. Connectivity options are plenty – HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, and a 4-pole headphone out that supports DTS Headphone:X. The stand is also adjustable, so you can play around with tilt and height to get the right viewing angle for yourself. This is also great for setups that multiple people use. You don’t really have to settle for an awkward angle while trying to make it work for you.</p>
<p>LG also includes an Enhanced Gaming GUI that lets you choose between display presets like Gamer, FPS, or RTS modes for an even better view.</p>
<p>All in all, this deal gets you an impressive, high-resolution gaming monitor for less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4641/">If you’re a Prime member, you can get it for under $300. Non-prime members are in luck, too, since they can grab one for $349, which is still a good discount on a model this packed.</a> It’s a limited-time discount, so if you’ve been thinking of making the upgrade, we recommend grabbing it as soon as you can.</p>

              <p>Smartphone upgrades are usually expensive, especially if you’re looking to grab the latest model from top brands like Apple, Samsung, Google Pixel, etc. But that’s not the case today.</p>
<p>Now is a great time to pick a new smartphone for yourself or gift it to a loved one, thanks to Amazon’s Prime Big Deals Days.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/"> The retailer has slashed the price of the Samsung Galaxy S25 Ultra (256GB) down to $935 for Prime members and $950 for non-members.</a> That’s up to a massive 28% off. This model comes unlocked and even includes a 1-year U.S. warranty for peace of mind.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Features Samsung’s Highest-Resolution Ultra-Wide Lens</h2>
<p>In a slim, sleek build, you’re getting a whole bunch of useful features packed inside. There’s a Snapdragon 8 Elite processor that makes day-to-day usage both fast and smooth, plus 256GB of storage that lets you keep all your favorites close. This storage capacity sits between the 128GB and 512GB versions, and should be enough for most people, unless you want a beast to store large 4K videos or tons of games.</p>
<p>The 6.9-inch display pushes 2960 x 1440 resolution, so whether you’re streaming or browsing, visuals stay crips and vibrant. Navigation is made super easy with the included S-Pen. Of course, cameras deserve a special mention – it’s Samsung after all. You’ve got the brand’s highest-resolution ultra-wide lens here. The main 200MP wide-angle lens offers incredible clarity, with 2x optical quality zoom. Then there’s a 50MP ultra-wide lens, a 50MP telephoto lens with 5x and 10x optical zoom, and a 10MP telephoto with 3x optical zoom. The 12MP front camera keeps your selfies detailed and gram-worthy. Galaxy AI takes your photos and videos to the next level by letting you make quick edits and even clean up background noise for better clips.</p>



<p>The powerful 5,000mAh battery is designed to last an entire day of use, so you won’t have to worry about juicing it up mid-day. Those using a Galaxy smartwatch can enjoy some helpful health and fitness features with the two devices are paired together. And since it’s an unlocked model, you can use it with any carrier of your choice, from T-Mobile to Verizon, Xfinity, and others.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4640/">On a regular day, this smartphone will cost you around $1,300 without any discounts. The current deal lets you grab it for under $950, and the offer applies to several color options.</a> It won’t last long since Prime Day wraps up tonight, so be sure to hurry.</p>

<p>This device typically retails for $100, so this $31 discount is a nice chance to snag it up for less. The deal is part of the Prime Big Deals Days happening right now.

If this looks like something you’ve been wanting to invest in, we recommend acting fast to get your orders in sooner rather than later.</p>

There’s also a bunch of free stuff included that you can watch without paying for a subscription. Navigation is made easy with the included remote, which also features backlit buttons for easy usage in the dark. Hands-free voice control lets you just use your voice to manage everything, whether you want to lower the volume or pause the movie.</p>



<p>Wi-Fi 6 support reduces buffering, and there’s also a Bluetooth headphone mode for when you want a more private listening experience without disturbing the others around.</p>
<p>Altogether, it’s going to be a solid entertainment upgrade. You’re getting a ton of content from both streaming apps and live channels right there in one place. Plus, there’s no compromise on the visual or audio quality. The included voice remote makes it easy to browse through the wide selection, put on your favorite movies, and manage sound settings. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4639/">This deal brings the price down to less than $70, making it quite affordable to upgrade.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Was Netflix’s<em> The Witcher</em> trying to give Cavill the boot as early as season 2? Did <em>Borderlands 4</em> cut one of the previous game’s most unpopular characters during development? And why is Atari making it harder to play an all-time classic on PC? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Craft breweries <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/05/business/craft-breweries-close-sales-decline.html">are apparently on the decline</a>, the surest sign yet that the millennial zeitgeist is dying. This is <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/05/business/craft-breweries-close-sales-decline.html">not a good thing</a>. I am also part of the problem, having traded my beloved Hazy IPAs at the <em>local</em> bar for cheap pounders from the grocery store.</p> <h2>The original <em>System Shock 2</em> is disappearing from stores thanks to the remaster</h2> <p>As spotted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-system-shock-2-will-be-delisted-from-steam-soon-then-lumped-in-with-the-more-expensive-remaster">by<em> Rock, Paper, Shotgun</em></a>, the 1999 sci-fi immersive sim classic will be delisted from PC storefronts on October 10. From that point forward, the only way to access it will be as part of the 25th anniversary remaster. The original game was just $10 to buy individually, but will cost $30 to access as part of the remaster. “Existing owners of <em>System Shock 2</em> (1999) will still be able to re-download and play it from their library, but new users will no longer be able to purchase <em>System Shock 2</em> (1999) as a standalone product,” <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/866570/view/542243728060844444?l=english">reads a notice</a> from publisher Atari.</p>

 <h2>Netflix deletes an important date in its report about Liam Hemsworth taking over for Henry Cavill in <em>The Witcher</em></h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Either that's typo or that Henry Cavill shit was even messier than we think, because season 2 premiered in 2021 and Cavill didn't even announce he was leaving until the end of 2022 <a href="https://t.co/v2pHao4f5k">https://t.co/v2pHao4f5k</a></p> <p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/1975657153420742935?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The streaming company <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/features/liam-hemsworth-the-witcher-geralt-transformation">published its own profile</a> of Hemsworth alongside a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HK9dU6JIroU"><em>Witcher</em> season 4 trailer</a>, but it included a very curious detail. According to the original version of the article, Hemsworth was first contacted about taking over the role back in 2020. That was between when season 1 and 2 aired, and two years before Cavill was officially replaced. This data point might add more fuel to the intrigue surrounding <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-netflix-henry-cavill-season-4-superman-why-1849723343">his messy departure</a>, but Netflix has now gone back and <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/features/liam-hemsworth-the-witcher-geralt-transformation">deleted the date</a> from the profile altogether without any explanation. So now it’s&nbsp;<em>definitely</em> fueling more intrigue.</p>

 <h2>A controversial <em>Borderlands 3</em> character was seemingly cut from the sequel</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Alright I guess we're gonna talk about it:</p> <p>AVA WAS CUT FROM BORDERLANDS 4</p> <p>There are numerous files related to her in the game, more specifically outlining that she was completely replaced by Amara late in development. This means yes, she was originally going to team up with… <a href="https://t.co/QF8ESnQp0p">https://t.co/QF8ESnQp0p</a> <a href="https://t.co/tBoVNJ8hpq">pic.twitter.com/tBoVNJ8hpq</a></p> <p>— EpicNNG (@EpicNNG) <a href="https://twitter.com/EpicNNG/status/1975222704094814674?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Ava debuted in <em>Borderlands 3</em> as Vault Hunter Maya’s apprentice. Many players did not like her and were relieved she did not return in <em>Borderlands 4</em>. But <a href="https://x.com/EpicNNG/status/1975223565248299443">new datamining</a> of the files suggests that might have not always been the plan. File names suggest her role may have been replaced by the new Vault Hunter Amara, indicating Gearbox was paying very close attention to feedback from the last game when trying to nail the new one’s story, which it mostly does.</p>

The irony is that Sony spent much of the PS4 console generation and this one paying Activision extra to promote its platform as the best place to play <em>Call of Duty</em>, complete with exclusive early access and other perks. Microsoft has promised versions of new entries in the series would have platform parity and Sony, understandably, now has little interest in helping to promote its rival’s biggest blockbuster.</p>

              <p>It’s a fairly safe bet that even if you’re a huge <em>Star Wars</em> fan, you’ve never seen these six characters from&nbsp;<em>The Phantom Menace</em> like this before. That’s because Anakin Skywalker, Queen Amidala, Qui-Gon Jinn, and the others have assumed LEGO BrickHeadz form in <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4638/">this eye-grabbing and fun LEGO Star Wars set that’s marked down by 31% in a new Prime Big Deal.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>This cool set for kids 10 and up contains six collectible buildable characters — Anakin, Amidala, Qui-Gon, Darth Maul, Captain Panaka, and Jar Jar Binks, each with movie-authentic details in BrickHeadz form. In total there are 732 pieces, with each figure measuring over 2.5 inches high, 1.5 inches wide, and 2 inches deep. Each has its own baseplate, and some have their own accessories like young Anakin’s hammer and Darth Maul’s double-bladed red lightsaber. Once built, these unique collectible figures are more displayable than playable, and make great decorations or conversation pieces.</p>

<h2>Great Anytime Gift</h2>
<p>It’s never too early to start thinking about the holidays and knocking items off your list, but this LEGO BrickHeadz The Phantom Menace set is a terrific anytime present — birthday, great report card, or just a thoughtful gift for a young <em>Star Wars</em> fan in your life. The six BrickHeadz figures are fun for boys and girls age 10 and up to build, and then great decorations for any kid’s bedroom.</p>
<p>Even in the fun and unique-looking BrickHeadz form, the detail LEGO adds to these six figures from&nbsp;<em>The Phantom Menace</em> is exceptionally cool. Anakin Skywalker comes in his podracing outfit, while Queen Amidala’s dress comes with gem elements to snap in place. All 10 of Darth Maul’s horns are in place, and Qui-Gon Jinn’s Jedi outfit is easily recognized.</p>



<h2>Unanimous Reviews</h2>
<p>All of the Amazon reviews on the LEGO BrickHeadz The Phantom Menace collectible set are raves — it’s one of the very rare Amazon items that has a unanimous 5-star rating, but then again, how can you go wrong with Star Wars figures from LEGO? This is also a collectible set, part of LEGO’s larger 25th anniversary celebration of both&nbsp;<em>The Phantom Menace</em> being released in theaters and the first LEGO Star Wars building sets being released in stores.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4638/">The Prime Big Deal at Amazon takes 31% off the price of the LEGO BrickHeadz The Phantom Menace collectible set, bringing it from its usual $55 all the way down to just $38.</a> But, as with all of these Prime Day deals, you’re on borrowed time. Once Prime Day’s over, so is this Prime Big Deal.</p>

              <p>It’s quite the pickle. You’ve got a well-loved 2016 indie hit, and you figured it’d be nice to make it free on Steam for a bit. But then, a good while later, you decide it’s time to give it a graphical overhaul, update it with a whole new online multiplayer mode, and start charging a little bit for all that work. Except, nope. It seems there’s a limit for how many times you can switch your game from free to paid. So, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beloved-co-operative-platformer-pico-park-classic-edition-has-been-accidentally-made-free-on-steam-forever">spotted by&nbsp;<em>Eurogamer</em></a>, Tecopark’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/461040/PICO_PARKClassic_Edition/"><em>Pico Park: Classic Edition</em></a> and its new multiplayer mode is stuck at free, and will always be.</p> <p>Japanese developer Tecopark’s&nbsp;<em>Pico Park</em> games have proven hugely popular multiplayer games over the last ten years. Alongside the&nbsp;<em>Classic</em> version, there’s 2021’s re-imagined&nbsp;<em>Pico Park</em>, and most recently 2024’s&nbsp;<em>Pico Park 2</em>. They’re all cooperative puzzle games for between two and eight players, in which you’re challenged to collect a level’s keys via collaborative platform action. As you might imagine, this can become chaotic extremely quickly as groups attempt to arrange their cute cat-like characters into stacked piles to reach platforms, or assign themselves to pressing multiple buttons at once to open doors. And in the <em>Classic</em> version, that madness could go up to as many as 10 players. Albeit, until recently, only in local multiplayer.</p>

 <p>Tecopark’s Shunsuke Miyake posted to the game’s Updates page on August 20, “I’m thinking of updating&nbsp;<em>Classic Edition</em> for the first time in nine years… Since I’m doing it anyway, I’ll update it with online support.” He added, “<wbr>I might charge a small fee for it. I recommend installing it while it’s still free.”</p>

 <p>Come September 13, that update had happened, and the game now had art that matches its two sequels, ran on monitors running over 60Hz, added Steam inputs, and most significantly, now included online multiplayer. Miyake added, “We’ll keep it free for about a week.” Which was pretty generous!</p>

 <p>Then this last weekend, a new update appeared. The title is “<em>PICO PARK&nbsp;: Classic Edition</em> is permanently free!” with the text explaining this change.</p> <blockquote><p>“I was planning to switch to a paid plan after updating the online support, but I forgot that once you switch from paid to free, I can never go back to paid! : )”</p></blockquote> <p>He then adds, “If you enjoy playing this free version, be sure to try the series (<em>PICO PARK</em>, <em>PICO PARK 2</em>) too.”</p>

 <p>The 2021 version of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1509960/PICO_PARK/"><em>Pico Park</em></a> was an updated port of the Switch’s 2019 game (keep notes, there’s a test at the end), with all-new levels and online multiplayer, along with a bunch of new modes and ways to play. It even lets you use your phone as a controller for party gaming around one screen, rather than forcing you into the hassle of hooking up eight Xbox controllers at once.</p>

 <p>Last September’s&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2644470/PICO_PARK_2/"><em>Pico Park 2</em></a> offered a brand new set of levels, along with all the previous features, including cross-platform support. Both games are extremely well received, eliciting very creative Steam reviews from people broken by their experiences. “This is the game where friendships go to DIE,” says one positive review. Another says, “this game ruined my relationships with all my friends and I am now left alone. Great game.” My personal favorite reads, “You get to see who’s stupid among your friends, then realize it was you all along.”</p> <p>And now, it seems, you can experience the original version of all this in its prettier glory, and online, for free! Poor ol’ Tecopark. For real, go buy a sequel if you enjoy it! Poor people just wanted to make a well-earned buck. Honestly, they should add it as a free game on Itch.io too, where at least people can then choose to pay for it if they want to.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock has built its reputation as the premium brand in robot vacuums but that prestige comes with a price tag. Most of their newer models sail past the $1,000 mark and puts serious automated cleaning out of reach for many households. The <strong>Qrevo QV 35A</strong> breaks that pattern as one of Roborock’s more accessible options, especially during Amazon’s<em> Prime Big Deal Days</em> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4636/">where it’s dropped to $399, down from $649</a>. This <strong>Prime-exclusive deal expires tonight</strong> and gives you limited time to snag a high-end robot vacuum and mop combo.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4636/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The 8,000Pa sucking power places this unit in the high-end level of cleaning power that is robust enough that it <strong>can suck out ground-in dirt from carpet fibers and snatch up debris from hardwood grout lines</strong>. Most entry-level bot vacs hover around the 3,000-4,000Pa level so this unit provides almost triple the force, which makes a major difference on carpets or homes with pets that continuously shed. The <strong>new-generation anti-tangle brushes</strong> resolve one of the pain points with owning a robot vacuum by eliminating the tendency for the brush bar to wrap around with hairs.</p>
<h2>The All-in-One Dock Does the Dirty Work</h2>
<p>The real value comes from the <strong>all-in-one docking station that handles mop washing automatically</strong>. After cleaning, the robot returns to its dock where the station washes the dual spinning mops with clean water, and removes the grime they’ve picked up. This means you’re not dragging dirty mops across your floors on subsequent cleaning sessions. The mops spin at 200 RPM and creates mechanical scrubbing action that tackles stuck-on spills and stains rather than just wiping moisture around.</p>
<p>The <strong>self-emptying dustbin is what makes the system hands-off</strong>, really. The dock self-sucks messes out of the internal dustbin on the robot into a larger bag back at the base station. You <strong>can abandon the vacuum for weeks on end</strong> as the base can accommodate as much as seven weeks’ worth of accumulated dirt and dust, depending on the size of your home and mess level. Dump the bag every month or every two months instead of dealing with a small dustbin after every cleaning pass.</p>



<p>What’s more, <strong>intelligent collision avoidance employs sensors and AI detection</strong> to steer around typical floor hazards such as shoes, wires, pet toys or unexpected spills. It illustrates the layout of your home during initial uses, and becomes familiar with the best cleaning paths and retaining room boundaries. No-go areas can be designated via the app which can be programmed to schedule varying cleaning modes per room or time of day.</p>
<p>The mop function provides real added value beyond ordinary vacuuming: The water tank maintains a stable moisture level on the spinning mops, appropriate for sealed hardwood, tile, laminate, or vinyl flooring. Water flow can be varied as appropriate to floor type or how grimy your floors become on average. Vacuum-then-mop, all in one automated pass, saves the time that would be taken on separate passages.</p>
<p>This Roborock at $399 comes with features that would be common on $800-1,000 units from the same company. Just the all-in-one dock would be a few hundred as a separate accessory on lower-end bots. This is the <strong>Prime-member deal that ends tonight</strong>, so grab yours before the price goes back up.</p>
