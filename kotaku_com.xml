Details of the deal haven’t yet been released, but the union says it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/game-actor-strike-ai-sag-aftra-zenless-zone-zero-1851769447&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/game-actor-strike-ai-sag-aftra-zenless-zone-zero-1851769447">includes “necessary AI guardrails”</a></span> as companies adopt tools to copy, replicate, and alter the work of actors. <br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,197582,197580" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The 10 companies involved in the agreement are Activision Productions Inc., Blindlight LLC, Disney Character Voices Inc., Electronic Arts Productions Inc., Epic Games Inc., Formosa Interactive LLC, Insomniac Games Inc., Take 2 Productions Inc., and WB Games Inc. SAG-AFTRA says more about the deal will be shared after members vote to ratify it in the coming weeks. The two sides are still hashing out the terms of the strike suspension agreement, however, so actors will remain on strike for a little longer. <br></p><p>“Everyone at SAG-AFTRA is immensely grateful for the sacrifices made by video game performers and the dedication of the Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee throughout these many months of the video game strike,” SAG-AFTRA chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said in a press release. “Patience and persistence has resulted in a deal that puts in place the necessary A.I. guardrails that defend performers’ livelihoods in the A.I. age, alongside other important gains.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-splatoon-3-raiders-upgrade-price-maps-1851784179&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-splatoon-3-raiders-upgrade-price-maps-1851784179">The strike began last July</a></span>, and while it involved demands for pay raises and better onsite working conditions, the biggest sticking point throughout negotiations was the role AI might play in voice recording and performance capture. While actors are currently paid on a session by session basis for specific performances, AI models would make it easy for companies to take that data and replicate an actor’s voice or movements, either altering their creative output or replacing it altogether. </p><p>Back in March, Ashly Burch who plays Aloy in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ashly-burch-ai-strike-aloy-horizon-zero-dawn-sony-1851770412&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ashly-burch-ai-strike-aloy-horizon-zero-dawn-sony-1851770412">shared her concerns</a></span> about AI replacing actors after an internal tech demo at Sony showed an AI-controlled Aloy having a conversation with a player. SAG-AFTRA <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-sagaftra-ai-darth-vader-ulp-voice-actor-strike-1851781401&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-sagaftra-ai-darth-vader-ulp-voice-actor-strike-1851781401">recently filed an unfair labor practice</a></span> against Epic Games for using an AI-voiced Darth Vader in <em>Fortnite</em> while still in negotiations. Meanwhile, Epic CEO Tim Sweeney <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fortnite-darth-vader-ai-npc-epic-disney-1851783545&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-darth-vader-ai-npc-epic-disney-1851783545">has said he foresees a possible future</a></span> in which all NPCs are AI-controlled. </p><p>As the strike continued throughout last fall and into 2025, actors in some games saw themselves replaced by other artists in projects like<em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>, as game companies sought to continue releasing updates. Games like <em>Destiny 2</em>, meanwhile, simply left some characters completely silent who would have otherwise voiced dialogue. Some SAG-AFTRA actors voiced their frustration with the duration of the strike in recent weeks. </p><p>“I hope SAG-AFTRA is aware that, either intentionally or through negligence, an environment has been created around IMA negotiations whereby it is impossible to express a good-faith disagreement without being dismissed as anti-union, a management shill, or both,” voice actor William Salyers, who voiced Otto Octavius in <em>Spider-Man 2</em>, wrote on Threads last week. “The damage being done by this will persist long after the strike is settled.” Jennifer Hale, best known as Commander Shepard in <em>Mass Effect</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/jhaletweets/status/1930733720547545454&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/jhaletweets/status/1930733720547545454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added</a></span>, “Vilifying those differences only divides the community.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo decided to hold the Switch 2 upgrade for <em>Splatoon 3</em> until the week after the new console arrived, announcing it Tuesday morning alongside an entirely new spin-off called  <em>Splatoon Raiders</em>. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197562" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="197562,196395,196165" data-current="197562"><div><p>THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23086.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The new game doesn’t have a release date yet but Nintendo did tease it with a brief trailer showing players taking control of a mechanic as they join the Deep Cut trio to explore the mysterious Spirhalite Islands, trapped inside a storm. It certainly <em>looks</em> like a mostly single-player PVE affair, building out the story campaigns found in the multiplayer shooter franchise, but Nintendo is staying tight-lipped about what players will actually do in <em>Splatoon Raiders</em> for now. </p><p>Here’s the trailer breakdown:</p><p>Nintendo also revealed a Switch 2 upgrade for<em> Splatoon 3</em> arriving June 12. It’ll include improved visuals and performance and feature cross-gen play with people on the original Switch. Both games will also get the free Splatlands update that day which adds new weapons and raises Freshness caps. The Urchin Underpass map from the original Wii U game will also return. </p><p>Here’s the full description from Nintendo’s press release:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><div><p> The update features the Splatlands collection, consisting of new weapons from the Barazushi and Emberz brands. Based on previous weapons, these new additions have fresh looks with different sub and special weapons. There are a total of 30 new weapon kits in this collection. A returning stage from the original <em>Splatoon</em> game on Wii U, called Urchin Underpass, will also be added to the stage rotation.</p><p>&nbsp;Plus, all weapon Freshness caps will be raised and players can earn new in-game Badges. A new stat will be added for Anarchy Battle (Series) called Series Weapon Power. It will track a player’s effectiveness per weapon based on their win/loss ratio in battles – and will then match them with players of a similar power. This makes it possible for players to try new weapons without being disadvantaged and push the limits their favorite weapons.</p></div></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Further, with this new update <em>Splatoon 3</em> players on Nintendo Switch 2 can enjoy more detailed visuals and a smoother appearance in locations like Splatsville and the Grand Festival Grounds. Today’s trailer also confirmed that <em>Splatoon 3</em> players will be able to play together across both Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2.</p></blockquote><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
