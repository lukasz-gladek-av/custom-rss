Each glimpse we get of him using his powers appears to be from one of two scenes in the movie. This final trailer shows him just a little more, but I still want to see that stretchy king smack someone around with long, flailing limbs. I hope the fact that Marvel has kept it under wraps in the trailers isn’t indicative of him not being in the action as much.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197556" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="GTA 6 Trailer 2: 13 Details You Might Have Missed" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="210" data-playlist="197556,197583,197586" data-current="197556"><div><p>GTA 6 Trailer 2: 13 Details You Might Have Missed</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197556/197556_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197556/197556_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197556/197556_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23080.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The final trailer for <em>First Steps </em>doesn’t really tell us much that we didn’t already know. Galactus is coming and the Silver Surfer is here to foreshadow his arrival. We still don’t see more than the planet-eating invader’s foot in this trailer, and at this point, I guess we won’t get a really good look at him until the film premieres on July 25. These trailers have shown a lot of the same stuff each time—this latest trailer perhaps showing even less than previously—and the most charitable read I can give is to assume that Marvel is keeping this movie’s secrets close to its chest. The Fantastic Four’s debut is a big deal for the MCU, and maybe you don’t want to spoil every surprise and cool sequence, but in doing so it’s kept me from finding anything to latch onto. How many different times can I hear Invisible Woman say that they’ll handle this apocalyptic moment as a family? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-first-steps-trailer-silver-surfer-mcu-1851776570&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-first-steps-trailer-silver-surfer-mcu-1851776570">Julia Garner still looks pretty sick as the Silver Surfer, though</a></span>.</p><p>Check out the full trailer below:</p><p><em>Fantastic Four: First Steps </em>is the first film in the MCU’s Phase Six, and then the movies will take a break for a bit until the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-secret-wars-delay-gta-6-1851782163&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-secret-wars-delay-gta-6-1851782163">recently delayed <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em></a></span> premieres on December 18.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-first-steps-last-trailer-mcu-marvel-1851785068]]></content:encoded>

To mark 15 years since PS Plus launched, Sony is also wrapping up June with some special deals for subscribers, as well as new perks like an extended free trial of<em> Monster Hunter Wilds </em>for Premium members.</p><p>PS Plus has had some decent months this year, which might be why a price hike feels like it’s coming just over the horizon. PlayStation CEO Hideaki Nishino recently remarked that players kept signing up for more expensive tiers even after the last round of increases. “The PlayStation Plus service offers great value for our players, and we will continue to add more value and adjust our pricing strategy in a dynamic way to maximize profitability,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marathon-concord-sony-live-service-ps5-hermen-hulst-1851784483&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-concord-sony-live-service-ps5-hermen-hulst-1851784483">told investors earlier this month</a></span>. </p><p>Ever wonder what the most popular games on the service are?

They are mostly single-player games, including four first-party Sony blockbusters: <em>God of War Ragnarök</em>, <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em>, and <em>The Last of Us Part I</em>. Others include <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> and<em> Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em>, alongside no-brainers like<em> Grand Theft Auto V</em>. Less obvious top-performers are <em>Dead by Daylight</em>, <em>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege</em>, and <em>UFC 5</em>. </p><p>PlayStation’s global services VP Nick Maguire told <em>Game File </em>the company remains committed to bringing its big first-party games to PS Plus no earlier than 18 to 24 months after they comes out. Instead, it’s been wooing subscribers to upgrade to the priciest tier with PS1 and PS2 classics, while streaming for PS3 games has been rarer. “Through streaming, we’ll still continue to look at those ones,” he said. “We haven’t ruled them out. The opportunities are there. But there are a lot of PS3 games already streaming.”</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-2025-diablo-4-kof-15-price-monster-hunter-wilds-1851785063]]></content:encoded>
