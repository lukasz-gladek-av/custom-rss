              <p>Winter power outages seem to pick the worst times to strike, such as during holiday gatherings of friends or when you are hosting game night in your living room. Portable power stations solve this anxiety by keeping your most-used devices running when the grid goes down, and EcoFlow has launched its Black Friday deals with aggressive pricing that makes premium backup power surprisingly affordable.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5131/">EcoFlow Delta 3 Classic has been cut from $599 down to just $399</a>, which undercuts even budget gas generators while d<strong>elivering 1800 watts of clean, silent power without fumes or maintenance headaches</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5131/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Real Electric Power</h2>
<p>The <strong>continuous 1800-watt output</strong> is ready to power refrigerators, microwaves, laptops and space heaters and do that for several devices at the same time in case of outages. That <strong>3600-watt surge capacity handles the surge in power</strong> that happens when things like refrigerator compressors kick in to prevent tripping or shutdowns when your refrigerator compressor comes on. It offer <strong>two USB-C ports (100W and 30W), one USB-C port and three AC outputs</strong>.</p>



<p>The 1024 Wh LiFePO4 battery offers ample capacity to <strong>run a typical refrigerator for around 12 to 15 hours</strong> and keep your food from spoiling during extended blackouts. This automotive-grade battery chemistry offers superior safety and longevity, compared to standard lithium-ion cells, retaining more than 80% of its original capacity even after 4000 complete charge cycles. That’s <strong>more than 10 years of use daily</strong> which makes this a lifetime investment rather than a disposable emergency tool.</p>
<p>X-Stream Fast Charging Technology provides <strong>charging from completely dead to 80% capacity in as little as 45 minutes</strong> with a standard wall outlet. That kind of speed is critical when weather forecasts predict an incoming storm and you have forgotten to keep your battery topped up. The system intelligently identifies the optimal voltage and current to maximize charging speed, and avoids battery degradation that many cheaper units with aggressive charging profiles suffer from.</p>



<p>A <strong>UPS switching time of less than 10 milliseconds safeguards desktop computers, servers, NAS systems</strong> and medical equipment against power interruptions. This near-instant transition happens so fast that most electronics won’t be able to detect the changeover, thus preventing data loss, system crashes or disrupted medical treatments. The pure sine wave output provides grid-quality power, just like what’s coming out of your wall outlets, to ensure sensitive electronics get clean electricity free of voltage fluctuations that can burn out circuit boards.</p>
<p>The cell-to-chassis construction design shields the battery from drops, bumps, and transport vibrations that would destroy loosely mounted cells. This automotive-inspired structural approach insulates the battery cells from external impacts, improving thermal management by direct contact with the chassis. The unit operates reliably in temperatures from freezing cold to scorching heat, handles 95% humidity levels and resists 5% salt spray which makes it perfect for coastal areas and harsh environments where cheaper power stations just don’t cut it.</p>
<p>At $399 instead of $599, this Black Friday deal undercuts the price of budget gas generators and delivers superior convenience, safety, and long-term value in return.</p>

              <p>It’s getting more expensive to fill my <a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-candy-ranking-worst-best-list-chocolate-bar-1851679251">Halloween trick-or-treat bowl</a> each year as the bags at the store get pricier but smaller. First Trump <a href="https://mashable.com/article/trump-take-egg-meme-explained">took egg</a>. Then he <a href="https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-administration-white-house-halo-gamestop-2000639566">took video game</a>. Now he <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-tells-kid-trick-or-treaters-you-have-no-weight-n815196">take candy</a>.</p> <p>I normally wait until the last minute to pick up candy for Halloween. This entails going to the supermarket during my lunch break on Halloween only to find that all of the Halloween-themed bags have already been replaced with Christmas ones. This usually leaves me with no option but to buy the only candy that normally comes individually wrapped in bulk: blow-pops and stacks and stacks of fun-sized chocolate bars. Beggars can’t be choosers. I pay whatever the Halloween gods demand. No child will leave my house emptyhanded on All Hallows’ Eve.</p> <p>This year I broke with tradition and headed to the supermarket a few nights ahead of time. The pickings were still slim but not altogether terrible. The prices, on the other hand, stopped me in my tracks. It was supposed to be a quick shop. In and out. Instead, I stared at the bags of Snickers and Reece’s Cups like I was picking which arm to get amputated. A big bag of assorted Hershey’s candy was almost $17. That couldn’t be right. I checked again. Ouch. I went for a small bag of Butterfingers. It was $6.59. That would not be nearly enough. Five smaller bags or two bigger ones? Either way, I was getting hosed.</p>

   <p>The irony, of course, is that I do not need nearly this much candy. I always have a ton left over, sitting in the bowl and rotting my teeth through mid-November. But what if this year is different? What if busses of children roll up to my street demanding dispensation? Better safe than sorry. And so I pay to subsidize the fat cats at Mars and Hershey. Apparently I have it easy. One particularly grim thread on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/inflation/comments/1oiotkg/has_anyone_noticed_the_cost_of_the_halloween/">the inflation subreddit</a> tells a different story.</p>

 <p>“I just spent $95 on 4 small bags of candy bar minis (110 mini pieces per bag), and 1 bag of jolly rancher gummy minis that will not get me through the night,” it reads. Some say they’ll just hide in their bedrooms that night watching TV with the lights out. Others are downgrading to cheaper candy. “Stopped doing chocolate and candy bars as that is where inflation is taking the biggest hit,” one person wrote. “Gummy and hard candies are still reasonable. $16 got us like 80 small packs of sour patch kids and when there are gone, they’re gone. Lights out. No more.”</p>

 <h2>Tariffs and bad cocoa harvests</h2> <p>Is candy actually getting way more expensive? Why yes, yes it is. <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/data-shows-halloween-candy-prices-are-even-higher-2025-2024-rcna238904">NBC News reports</a> that multiple years of bad cocoa harvests in regions like West Africa, due in part to rising temperatures and changing climate conditions, have created a shortage that’s led to skyrocketing prices. “The cost of chocolate has surged nearly 30% since last Halloween,” <a href="https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/halloween-candy-hauls-shrink-chocolate-swapped-cheaper-alternatives">reports Fox News</a>.</p>

 <p>But gummies and other non-chocolate candy is also up. “General manufacturing costs for candy makers, including energy, labor and transportation, have risen 37 percent since early 2024,” one supply chain analyst <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/data-shows-halloween-candy-prices-are-even-higher-2025-2024-rcna238904">told NBC News</a>. One TikTok deal hunter told the outlet that her normal go-to discount tricks have still gone from $1.50 a bag to $2.50 in some cases this year.</p>   <p>And of course there’s the Trump tariff factor. “The tariffs have hit every single piece of what goes into every single thing,” a small chocolate business owner in North Carolina <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/26/business/why-halloween-candy-is-getting-more-expensive-and-less-chocolate-y">told CNN</a>. “There is no new normal.” As <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/30/halloween-candy-prices-trump-tariffs-climate-change"><em>The Guardian</em> reports</a>, “Donald Trump has placed tariffs on the biggest exporters of chocolate to the US. Imports from the Ivory Coast, the largest producer of cocoa, are taxed with a 21 percent tariff. Ecuador, the second-largest producer, faces a 15 percent tariff.” Prices of Tootsie Roll lollipops alone are up 30 percent on average this year, according to a recent report <a href="https://tcf.org/content/commentary/tricks-treats-and-tariffs-how-trump-is-making-halloween-more-expensive/">by The Century Foundation</a>.</p> <p>Perhaps the cruelest part of all of this is that amid the current government shutdown, the Trump administration is set to let SNAP food benefits for the poorest Americans run out on November 1, the day after Halloween. Anyone on food assistance this week is stuck salvaging every penny they can instead of splurging on some candy for the neighborhood kids or their own. <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/millions-face-food-aid-cliff-us-government-shutdown-standoff-2025-10-29/">The program currently has</a> access to $5.5 billion in reserve funds that Republicans are refusing to spend as they hold families hostage in negotiations with Democrats.</p>  <p>What Trump take, others can give back. You can <a href="https://www.feedingamerica.org/find-your-local-foodbank">search your area for a local food bank</a> to donate to. If you can afford it, try matching the funds you spend on candy this Halloween for food assistance in your region.</p>

We were there when you found your first settlement and explored its charm and denizens. We were there when you fought pirates, tigers, corrupted, ghosts, and all manner of hazards across the land. We were there when you set foot on forsaken sands filled with lost secrets and hidden dangers. We were there when you discovered the untamed wilds filled with beasts and verdant jungles. We were there when you crept into the dark heart of lands filled with opulence, madness, and terror.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Through it all, we watched. We delighted. We reveled in your enjoyment of every perfect moment, every carefully crafted story, and we even bore witness to the joining of two souls who met here in Aeternum.
