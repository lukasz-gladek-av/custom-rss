              <p><span>Do you guys think </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/surprise-press-conference-reveals-trump-still-not-dead-2000622401"><span>Donald Trump</span></a><span> might have some kind of humiliation kink? Is someone with such a myopic view of the world, enabled by all the yes-men in his corner and the cult-like following of his supporters, even capable of perceiving embarrassment? Well, if the last 79 years of the businessman-and-reality-star-turned-U.S.-president’s life weren’t embarrassing enough, his press conference yesterday, September 22, in which he </span><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/22/health/trump-autism-announcement-cause-tylenol"><span>tried to link autism to taking Tylenol during pregnancy</span></a><span>, with zero scientific evidence or backing, would be enough to haunt the average self-aware person for the rest of their days. But for those of us who watched the president dribble out this absolute nonsense, it was a tremendous day to post.</span></p>  <p><span>If you want to watch the hour-long press conference in which </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881"><span>Trump</span></a><span> attributes a condition first recognized in 1912 to a pain medication that was introduced in 1955, it’s right here, but you will likely find the most interesting bits clipped on social media. Some highlights include Trump saying nonsense like “Nothing bad can happen, it can only good happen,” and his being unable to pronounce acetaminophen. But to summarize, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/south-park-trump-episode-satan-white-house-response-1851786980"><span>Trump</span></a><span> and his merry band of misfits allege that if someone takes Tylenol while pregnant, their baby could pop out with the uncanny ability to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-ice-pokemon-song-video-2000627900"><span>remember the names of all 1000+ Pokémon</span></a><span>. He says that pregnant people should avoid Tylenol at all costs “unless medically necessary.” You know, “if you can’t tough it out.” Notably, the conference constantly name-drops Tylenol, which is Kenvue’s brand name for over-the-counter acetaminophen, rather than more widely attributing this fake science to acetaminophen itself. So we’ll see if Tylenol itself decides to pursue any sort of legal action.</span></p> <p><span>The entire thing was so nonsensical that the internet had a field day with the insinuation that Tylenol could be the cause of something that pre-dates it by several decades, and the jokes about having babies with special interests came aflowing.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">so ur telling me my mum had a headache and now im stuck like this forever</p> <p>— Aoife 🐝 Bee 🏳️‍⚧️ (@Aoife_Bee_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Aoife_Bee_/status/1970250170999693678?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">if we take acetaminophen instead of a name brand while pregnant will the autism be generic or nah? i’m trying to have a savant</p> <p>— Sydney Battle (@SydneyBattle) <a href="https://twitter.com/SydneyBattle/status/1970248358209167865?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 22, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Forget the Tylenol.

At least they’re laughing at him.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Hello everyone. I’ve got a lovely spread of stories below for you to enjoy on this fine Tuesday. Sure, the world is on fire and everything is horrible, but at least you have Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of news and stuff you might care about. That’s something to be happy about, right? Today we have news about a lawsuit against Sega, the reveal of a new <em>Palworld</em> game, bad news for Xbox fans, and some friends bonding over the fun of skateboarding.</p> <h2><strong>Costco seemingly done selling Xbox consoles and games</strong></h2> <p>If you try to buy an Xbox console or video game on Costco’s website, you’ll discover that the company no longer sells Xbox-related gear or software. <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/costco-removes-xbox-consoles-games-series-x-s-from-us-uk-websites/">As reported by <em>TheGamer</em></a> and spotted by others online, Costco has quietly stopped selling Xbox consoles and games on its online shop with no warning in both the UK and the United States. If you try to search for Xbox on Costco’s website, you’ll be greeted with a message saying nothing was found. Interestingly, the retail giant still sells PlayStation and Nintendo games and devices as well as VR-related gear. Some have recently <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1mxs76a/xbox_items_at_costco/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reported that physical stores</a> are stocking fewer Xbox consoles, controllers, and games, too.</p> <p>What’s going on? Well, it’s possible that Xbox consoles and games just haven’t sold well at Costco over the years, and the retailer is cutting its losses and moving on. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-physical-game-low-sales-digital-1851218453">In 2024, it was reported</a> that some retailers weren’t sure if they would keep selling Xbox games in the future due to poor sales. It likely doesn’t help that the price of an Xbox in some places keeps going up and up. Just last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-s-price-hike-raise-trump-tariff-microsoft-2000627228">Xbox raised prices again on all Xbox Series X/S consoles</a>.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Palworld</em> farming spin-off announced two weeks after <em>Pokémon</em> revealed a similar game</strong></h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨Palfarm – A Palworld Spin-off!🚨</p> <p>Create your own amazing farm with your favourite Pals!🌱<br>Till fields, grow crops, and enjoy a carefree, slow-paced life in this Palworld spin-off game!</p> <p>Currently in development by a new team! <a href="https://t.co/ldwQyLmd9W">pic.twitter.com/ldwQyLmd9W</a></p> <p>— Palworld (@Palworld_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Palworld_EN/status/1970292031139217701?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-devs-announce-farming-sim-spin-off-palworld-palfarm">On September 22, <em>Palworld</em> developers PocketPair announced a new game, </a><em>Palworld: Palfarm.&nbsp;</em>As the name might suggest, this is a spin-off of the company’s incredibly popular <em>Palworld</em>, aka “Pokémon with guns” aka <a href="https://kotaku.com/palworld-pokemon-company-lawsuit-nintendo-pocketpair-1851652124">that game Nintendo is suing</a>. The new spin-off looks to be a cozy farming sim in the spirit of <em>Stardew Valley</em> and<em> Animal Crossing.</em> There is no release date for <em>Palfarm</em>, and at the moment, it appears to only be in development for PC.</p>

 <p>Interestingly, less than two weeks ago, The Pokémon Company announced its own cozy farm life spin-off, too. There’s no way that PocketPair created this trailer and game in two weeks, but the timing of <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-animal-crossing-switch-2-nintendo-direct-2000625331"><em>Pokémon Pokopia</em>‘s announcement</a> being closely followed by <em>Palfarm</em>‘s reveal is funny considering the whole situation between the companies involved.</p>

 <h2><strong>One of <em>Sonic</em>‘s most famous songs is still in legal limbo</strong></h2> <p>Late last year,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-adventure-2-hedgehog-live-learn-crush-40-lawsuit-1851724753">Crush 40 musician Johnny Gioeli sued Sega</a> over ownership of “Live and Learn,” a song closely associated with the hedgehog since appearing in<em> Sonic Adventure 2.</em> Gioeli argued he fully owned the master recording of the song and that Sega had used it in multiple games, and in the live-action film<em> Sonic 3</em>, without proper permission. Now, as reported by <em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lawsuit-over-ownership-of-sonic-theme-live-and-learn-dismissed-but-fortnite-collab-proves-song-remains-in-limbo-says-songwriter">Eurogamer</a></em>, the case has been dismissed without a judgment given, leaving the famous song in legal “limbo.”</p>

 <p>“Everyone- the news is out that the case against SEGA was dismissed,”<a href="https://x.com/Crush40Johnny/status/1970123862810525733/photo/1"> said Gioeli in a statement posted online.</a>&nbsp; “I want you to understand that the reason for the dismissal was based on time, not on ownership. The song remains in ‘limbo’. Just 2 weeks ago, I was contacted by Epic Games to potentially use ‘Live &amp; Learn’… and the amazing part is SEGA had them call <em>me</em> for the rights to use the song. So there you have it. The most epic song remains in the ‘abyss of ownership’.”</p>

 <p>Gioeli ended his statement saying that the beloved track is his and not Sega’s, adding: “I wrote it with Jun, I sing it, I created the melody, I recorded the vocals in my studio.”</p> <h2><strong><em>Arc Raiders</em> is doing one final and very large open beta</strong></h2> <p>There have been a lot of playtests and betas for the upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/arc-raiders">sci-fi extraction shooter<em> Arc Raiders</em></a><em>,</em> and there’s going to be one more. But this time, everyone is invited in an effort to test the highly anticipated shooter’s servers before it launches next month. On September 22, the devs behind <em>Arc Raiders</em> announced one final open beta. The idea behind this multi-platform open beta, which starts on October 17 and ends on October 19, is to slam the game’s servers ahead of its October 30 release date.</p> <p>“Please invite your friends and give those servers a challenge,” <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/server-slam-pre-orders/">asked the devs in a post announcing the final beta test</a> as well as revealing some pre-order bonuses.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Stardew Valley</em> creator warns people not to get too hyped (yet) for the 1.7 update</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-concerenedape-haunted-chocolatier-update-1851778392">In April,</a> <em>Stardew Valley</em> creator Eric Barone, known online as ConcernedApe, explained that after<em> Stardew Valley</em>‘s massive 1.6 update, he was going to focus on finishing up and launching <em>Haunted Chocolatier.&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardewValley/comments/1n49ht4/ca_confirms_therell_be_a_stardew_valley_17_update/">And then in August</a>, he announced a 1.7 update was in the works for <em>Stardew Valley</em>. Since then, he’s been mostly radio silent about the update.</p> <p>That changed on September 21 when a fan reshared his old 1.7 tease with a sad face. Barone asked why they were sad, and they admitted they just hated waiting. When another fan asked Barone to give people a tease for 1.7, he promised that information about the update would arrive in the future. For now, though, he doesn’t want people to get too hyped because there’s still a long wait.</p> <p>“More will come,” <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1970002493901000833">posted the <em>Stardew Valley</em> creator on Twitter</a>.&nbsp; “I just don’t want too much hype at this point. It’s going to be a while before the update is ready.” Will Barone ever stop updating <em>Stardew Valley</em>? Time will tell, but I know what I’d bet on.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4s-super-jump-bug-cricket-jumping-legendary-gun-gearbox-patch-pc-2000627659">People are using a bug to fly in <em>Borderlands 4</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/tiktok-grinch-christmas-ornament-disney-belle-mickey-2000627636">AI-generated Christmas ornament slop is flooding TikTok</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/mandalorian-grogu-trailer-disney-boycott-2000627542">Disney released the first trailer for the <em>Star Wars Mandalorian</em> movie</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

              <p>If you’re sitting at your desk, do me a favor and look around for a moment. What’s your setup look like? Do you have a good keyboard? How are your speakers? How big is your monitor? Is there more than one? When it comes to PC gaming, there’s so may areas you can upgrade, and we didn’t even cover the stuff under the hood like your GPU and CPU. with all the shiny, new products you can buy level up your space, it’s easy to overlook something small but important—the mouse.</p>
<p>Your mouse is 50% off how you’re interacting with the games you play, assuming you use mouse and keyboard.&nbsp;It’s time to ditch that ten dollar mouse you picked up in the checkout lane of Staples, and get something solid. The Logitech G Pro X SuperLight 2 wireless gaming mouse right now goes for $180. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4251/">However, an Amazon limited time deal is currently bringing it down to just $130. That 28% discount saves you $50.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4251/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
