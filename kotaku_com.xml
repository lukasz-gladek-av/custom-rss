That’s a shame because the bones of this tactical RPG are some of the strongest around, even if the surrounding fluff can get in the way sometimes.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196086,196599" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>A sequel to Image &amp; Form’s 2015 3DS game, <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> trades its predecessor’s sci-fi setting for a <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>-infused take on the high seas, but otherwise the bulk of it still revolves around turn-based encounters in side-scrolling 2D maps where gunshots ricochet and grenades blow up cover to create memorably chaotic fights.</p><p>You’re still looting procedurally generated levels and trying to escape as bullets and lasers go whizzing past your crew’s mechanical heads, but there’s a major difference in <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>. Unlike the first game, in which characters were each ingrained with specific class archetypes, the sequel lets you give any crew member any weapon and then start building their kit around that. Equip a sniper rifle and you become a sharpshooter that specializes in dealing critical damage from afar. Wield a hammer and you become a brawler who gets extra turns and other bonuses from smashing foes up close. </p><p>This offers a lot of flexibility and freedom, but <em>SteamWorld Heist II </em>goes a step further and lets characters mix and match skills from different classes once they’ve unlocked them, rewarding experimentation and incentivizing a hunt for synergies that will break the game and help you take no prisoners when breaking into high security bases in search of powerful treasure. It’s basically the inverse of the<em> Final Fantasy Tactics </em>job system where skill trees were linked to classes rather than weapons. The result is a refreshing change-up that’s more streamlined without ditching too much depth. </p><p>I finished the game last summer on Switch (it’s also on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC) and loved every minute in which I found myself analyzing bullet trajectories, blast radiuses, and the odds of success if I sacrificed one character to cover the rest of the crew’s tactical retreat. Even through procedurally generated maps where any lollygagging will quickly find you overrun by enemy forces, <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>’s ingredients form an excellent recipe for tense moments, analytical showdowns, and seat-of-your-pants escapes. It cleverly iterates on the best elements of the first game and makes them even more robust and fun. </p><p>The only downside to <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> is that it lacks the first game’s concise 12-hour runtime. It’s almost twice as long, with the extra hours going toward some late-game grinding and a new overworld exploration system in which you explore as a submarine gunning down enemy ships in real-time in exchange for small rewards that quickly stop being worth the trouble. Like the rest of <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>, the shoot-‘em-up sections are smartly designed and control well but ultimately feel like unnecessary time wasters and frustrating distractions from the excellent 2D tactical combat at the game’s core. </p><p>Ultimately, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fsteamworld-heist-ii%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fsteamworld-heist-ii%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>SteamWorld Heist II</em></a></span><em> </em>is like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with an extra piece of bread in the middle. Still delicious but eventually way more than you want to eat. I still ended up finishing the game because the 2D <em>XCOM</em>-like shootouts are good enough to make wading through all the filler worth it. <em>SteamWorld Heist II </em>is a great tactics RPG that genre acolytes will be doing themselves a disservice to overlook.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The table comes with all kinds of whimsical bells and whistles and an all-star voice cast, and it can be yours starting at $7,000. Or you could pay nearly double that for the limited edition version.</p><p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Tyrant’s Eye</em> takes players into the Forgotten Realms to face off against owlbears, gelatinous cubes, a red dragon, and Xanathar the beholder, all with just a pair of flippers and a few steel balls. Trap doors unlock new dungeons and dice rolls will dictate how the adventure unfolds. I don’t have a spare down payment for a new car lying around, but I do have a basement just waiting to be renovated where this would fit perfectly. </p><p>  “Battle Rath the Relentless, the red dragon, the most advanced animatronic mech in pinball, [who] intelligently reacts to player action with multi-axis motion and features omnidirectional impact sensing technology,” writes Stern in a press release. “Voiced by the iconic Michael Dorn, players will attempt to defeat Rath the Relentless with pinballs and by hitting the 3-bank target, steal its treasure. When Rath the Relentless breathes his magnificent fire, multiple pinballs shoot from its mouth but be prepared. Players can activate a metal shield between the flippers to not only defend against attacks but also assist with playfield shots.”</p><p>I’m by no means a pinball connoisseur, but that all sounds rad. Critical Role fans are also in for a treat since Matthew Mercer, Laura Bailey, and Marisha Ray are also part of the <em>D&amp;D </em>pinball machine’s voice cast, along with Kevin Smith, Luke Gygax, Chris Prynoski, Brendon Small, and Gerard Way. And the table even incorporates the Stern Insider app to save progress. It’s effectively a <em>D&amp;D</em> pinball roguelike. In fact, that would be a great idea for an actual video game too. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s the notion that there’s only one core route through a game, a pre-determined path down which all players must tread, where we do not have the freedom to pick our own directions. As such, looking back from our current era in which open-world games dominate the AAA landscape, this can give the appearance of a design that removes or restricts player agency to a deletory result.</p><p>And to be incredibly clear, some corridors did just that. While first-person games were born in level-based mazes (<em>Return to Castle Wolfenstein</em>, <em>Doom</em>, etc), there did come a wake of games that were almost literal corridors, so ridiculously restrictive that it felt like being dragged down their inevitable tunnel by your nostrils, shoulders scraping the claustrophobic walls all the way. To name names, the very worst of these were the <em>Call of Duty</em> campaigns from <em>Black Ops</em> onward—games that killed you if you dared to walk left or right, rather than straight on, and pushed you to the back to watch the NPCs play the game for you.</p><p>But I would argue that almost no one who played <em>BioShock</em> in 2007 reacted by saying, “Damn, that was just a corridor.” Because it was a game that, despite having only one core pathway, allowed players to feel an enormous sense of freedom. You chose <em>huge</em> amounts in <em>BioShock</em>, from how you actually played (run-and-gun shooter, device-based trapping and stealth, immersive sim), to how you responded to the nature of the world around you, not least in how you treated the Little Sisters. People celebrated the game for the amazing amount of freedom it offered within such a tightly scripted narrative, and all of that is to ignore that the game being a prescribed corridor was <em>the <strong>entire point</strong></em>.</p><p>Sorry to spoil an 18-year-old game, but the fact that you had no choice but to follow the instructions you were given was the massive third-act reveal. That the game was set in an inescapable corridor is so much of why <em>BioShock</em> was brilliant, because if it had let players visit any point in the underwater city of Rapture whenever they wanted, everything else about it would have fallen apart.</p><p><em>BioShock</em>’s drama so often depends on you being exactly where the game designer wants you to be, at exactly the moment they want you there, and that kind of precise narrative choreography is the result of a corridor. By rejecting such game design as a failure, we’re losing this kind of experience, and I really believe it’s something we should instead be fighting to save.</p><figure id="" data-id="dd3540bbcbb2c283baf7eff9528aa2de" data-recommend-id="image://dd3540bbcbb2c283baf7eff9528aa2de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alyx holds her hand up against the container sealing in her father." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Alyx holds her hand up against the container sealing in her father." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dd3540bbcbb2c283baf7eff9528aa2de" data-recommend-id="image://dd3540bbcbb2c283baf7eff9528aa2de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Alyx holds her hand up against the container sealing in her father." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Of course corridors are, and should be, only a part of games. I’m not silly, I love a fantastic open-world game, and of course have been playing RPGs since the 1980s that offer vast amounts of player freedom when approaching their worlds. I’m not for a moment arguing for anything more than a desire to preserve the corridor as an option among so much else, and therefore not to disparage it as if a failure of the past. Because damn, it brought so much success.</p><p>I don’t think I’m necessarily being that huge of a maverick here. In fact, if you look at any number of “all time best games” lists, and adjust for recency bias, there are certain names that come up again and again: <em>Half-Life 2</em>, <em>Deus Ex</em>, <em>Quake 2</em>, <em>Halo</em>, <em>Dishonored</em>. They share space on those lists with games that do quite the opposite, the litany of wonderful RPGs that often eschew corridors entirely, but those games with straight paths undeniably dominate. Indeed, they are the shining examples of how to hide the corridor in the best possible ways.</p><p>But rather than getting into the nitty-gritty of how and why disguising the corridor was key to their success, let’s focus more on what’s being lost without them.</p><figure id="" data-id="cc6e3bd8c98d86e2a45be5f57af45d09" data-recommend-id="image://cc6e3bd8c98d86e2a45be5f57af45d09" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Commander Shepard faces the blue swirly boy at the end of Mass Effect 3." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Commander Shepard faces the blue swirly boy at the end of Mass Effect 3." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc6e3bd8c98d86e2a45be5f57af45d09" data-recommend-id="image://cc6e3bd8c98d86e2a45be5f57af45d09" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Commander Shepard faces the blue swirly boy at the end of Mass Effect 3." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Open worlds are <em>great</em>, and I’m very happy to be clearing up icons in an Ubisoft map or picking my own unique route through the acts of <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. But what they cannot do as well is puppeteer the player, creating deliberate, narrative moments on a deliberate, narrative path. They cannot offer something more akin to the scenes of a movie, where the impact of event B is so much more meaningful because it came directly as a response to the action of event A, and the consequence of this drives the emotional resonance of event C.</p><p>I remember, in the early 00s, at the beginning of the rejection of corridor gaming as a design choice, responding with the same argument that springs to mind now: “Do you reject having to read the pages of a book in order? Is the book a failure if page 37 comes after page 36 every time?” To which the immediate counter is, “Games aren’t books, that’s why we call them something else,” and sure, but my point is: games <em>can</em> aim to be like books in some of the best ways. Because, when your game is set in a corridor, when the scenes are as inevitable as the pages of the book, it’s how we interact with them that defines them. It places the emphasis on our own personal interpretation of what we’re offered, and rather than being a sandbox in which we can play god, we’re instead inside a story which we have the means to uniquely experience.</p><p>(In fact, this is the basis for why I’ve argued that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-right-with-mass-effect-3s-ending&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-right-with-mass-effect-3s-ending" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the end of <em>Mass Effect 3</em> is not a failure to recognize player agency</a></span>, but instead a scripted moment understood uniquely based on your personal experiences accrued across all three games.)</p><p>Agency can be wonderful, but it is often at a cost—the cost of a curated, directed, deliberate narrative experience. And yes, it wouldn’t be a good thing if all games were that, but it’s no better to look down upon it as an anachronistic shortcoming of game design. <em>BioShock</em> only worked <em>because</em> it was a corridor, and indeed was a thesis <em>on the corridor</em>, making it all the more odd of a game to throw under the bus of history. There’s value in experiencing a curated, pre-determined tale, boosted by our unique approaches born of how we turn those pages. I don’t want it to be lost, in the name of boasting “greater player agency.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
