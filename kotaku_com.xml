He’s a sexy fish man who’s a bit rogueish, with a suave voice that brings it all together. Any <em>Mass Effect </em>fan will recognize this voice as Brandon Keener, the actor behind turian vigilante Garrus Vakarian from the original trilogy. Some of my favorite reactions from <em>Avowed</em>’s early access players have been seeing them realize that Kai shares Garrus’ voice. Despite Garrus’ popularity among <em>Mass Effect </em>fans, Keener hasn’t done a ton of video game voice work in the years since. He’s done a lot of “additional voices,” but Kai is probably his most prominent role since Garrus. So for many fans, this is like hearing an old friend for the first time in over a decade.</p><p>The connection between Kai and Garrus doesn’t end in their voice actor, however. Obsidian’s writers are clearly <em>Mass Effect </em>fans, because they include a cheeky reference to Garrus in some of Kai’s dialogue. There’s a scene in <em>Avowed </em>in which a woman is challenging the player and Kai to a fight, to which the aumaua says he’s got plenty of “reach.” This seems like a reference to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-romance-rank-boyfriend-kaidan-garrus-thane-1850096380&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-romance-rank-boyfriend-kaidan-garrus-thane-1850096380">Garrus’ romance in <em>Mass Effect 2</em></a></span>, in which the character makes a joke about having <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xocKGaw0kxE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xocKGaw0kxE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“reach,” and another Turian he hooked up with having “flexibility.”</a></span></p><p>It’s a fun bit of connective tissue, but Kai is a great character separate from sharing a voice with Garrus, with a depth of personality, a backstory that plays out during the game, and performs the vital role of the faithful friend you know always has your back.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s become increasingly common for developers to name and shame those involved, though Epic Games recently escalated things even further. It not only sued a <em>Fortnite</em> pro who cheated while qualifying for a championship tournament; it also made him publish a video admitting to it. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196395" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="80" data-playlist="196395,194440,195752" data-current="196395"><div><p>The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21945.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Cheating is never a winning strat,” the competitive <em>Fortnite</em> X account <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/FNCompetitive/status/1891564240604999725&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/FNCompetitive/status/1891564240604999725" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a></span> on February 17. “We took legal action against a player who shared their account to unfairly qualify for FNCS. Now they’re banned from <em>Fortnite</em> tournaments forever and their undeserved prize money was donated to charity.”</p><p>The notice linked to a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XouE9KalIVA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XouE9KalIVA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube video</a></span> posted by Morgan “RepulseGod” Bamford that elaborated on what went down. “I shared my Epic Games account with another user, Forbes, to qualify for the 2023 <em>Fortnite</em> Championship Series Grand Finals,” a screenshot from the silent video read. “My actions violated Epic’s rules and I was disqualified from the tournament.”</p><p>The video goes on to explain that Epic sued Bamford and took back his winnings as part of the settlement, which were subsequently donated to the Child’s Play charity. While the exact amount wasn’t mentioned, Forbes went on to place first in the FNCS 2023 - Major 3: Oceania - Grand Finals for a total prize of $10,000. Prior to that, Bamford had total life winnings of over $70,000 in pro <em>Fortnite</em>.</p><p>“Cheating in tournaments ruins the fun for the players who earned their spot in tournaments and I apologize to the<em> Fortnite</em> community for my actions,” he wrote. The comments under the video, which has already been viewed over 200,000 times, ate it up. “I won’t ever cheat in <em>Fortnite</em> again,” Bamford wrote, to which one user responded, “No shit bruh you banned lmfao.”</p><p>Tens of thousands of cheaters are banned from online multiplayer games like <em>Call of Duty</em> every month, but it’s rarer for companies to have to step in an punish top players in the community. Epic no doubt hopes that making an example out of Bamford will dissuade others from playing fast and lose with its terms of service and making a mockery of its tournaments. </p><p>It’s hard to imagine what more it could do at this point. Maybe anyone caught cheating in the lead-up to the <em>Fortnite </em>Champion Series 2025 will be forced to do a public walk of shame at the September Global Championship grand finals. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
