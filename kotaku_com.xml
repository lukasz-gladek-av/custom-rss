              <p>The rivalry between Samsung and Apple extends far beyond smartphones, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the premium… earbuds market. Apple just launched the AirPods Pro 3 a few weeks ago, but Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, despite being a few months older, pack even more powerful (AI) features under the hood.</p>
<p>Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">has slashed these pro-level earbuds from $249 down to $189, an all-time low that makes Apple’s pricing look almost unreasonable</a>. If you’ve been tired of dealing with mediocre sound quality on crowded commutes or struggling to hear your calls clearly in noisy environments, these earbuds solve those exact frustrations.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Samsung has redone the fit and comfort formula with the Buds 3 Pro, and abandoned that classic in-ear rubber tip form that lots of us find uncomfortable after a long period of wear. Instead, it uses a <strong>new ergonomic form that holds pressure more evenly across your ear</strong> so you’re able to wear these for extended periods of time on long flights, work marathons or at the gym without that pesky pain that causes you to reach for relief.</p>
<h2>Why They Beat Other Earbuds</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro’s<strong> active noise cancellation works on a different plane than budget models and actually holds its own with Apple’s</strong>. Samsung uses adaptive ANC tech that’s always scanning your world and tweaking cancellation power in real time. What this means in practical terms is that the earbuds automatically understand that you transitioned from a quiet office to a noisy street and turn up the cancellation. It’s a profound difference: plane engine hum vanishes, subway roaring dissipates, and that noisy coworker’s keyboard typing is barely a nuisance.</p>



<p>The sound-optimizing feature uses AI to analyze what you’re listening to and shifts equalizer settings automatically&nbsp;: If you switch from a podcast to a bass-heavy hip-hop beat, your earbuds sense this move and shift audio profile dynamically. This happens transparently in the background so you get studio-quality sound on every kind of content without having to manually shift settings via an app.</p>
<p>Call quality has been wireless earbuds’ Achilles’ heel, but the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro remediate this with a <strong>high-end three-microphone system on each bud</strong>. They work in conjunction with <strong>AI-driven voice processing</strong> to separate your voice from ambient noises. On video or phone calls, others at the receiving end will hear you distinctly even if you’re strolling on a windy street or at a coffee shop. The wind cancelling algorithm identifies that pesky whooshing sound that always compromises outside calls, making these buds truly useful for individuals who work from home or receive calls on foot.</p>



<p>Battery life comes in at approximately <strong>six hours with ANC active, with a further 24 hours of juice contained in a charged case</strong>. There’s a rapid charge facility that delivers an hour of listening time from a mere five minutes in the case, which comes in useful on hurried mornings which you had planned to charge overnight. Support for wireless charging allows you to plonk the case on any Qi-enabled pad which adds a convenient touch to your day.</p>
<p>This special Amazon exclusive release comes with a <strong>two-year extended warranty</strong> instead of a typical warranty of one year. With a price tag of just $189, which is below that of most mid-range pairs that cannot compete with such powerful noise cancellation, sound, or intelligent features, it really is almost ridiculous that they undercut AirPods Pro 3 by such an amount.</p>

              <p>If there’s one smartphone that fashion lovers and trendsetters have been obsessing over, it’s the <strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7</strong>. This premium flip phone isn’t just a tech gadget, it’s a statement piece that solves the eternal struggle of wanting a full-sized smartphone that actually fits in your pocket.</p>
<p>Here’s the good news: Samsung seems to be quietly moving stock through Amazon rather than their official site, and right now<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3984/"> you can snag this 256GB beauty for $849 instead of the usual $1,099</a>. That’s a $250 discount on a phone that rarely sees price cuts this aggressive, and honestly, we’re kind of obsessed.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3984/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Galaxy Z Flip7 addresses something we’ve all felt: that moment when you’re trying to stuff your phone into a clutch, a tight jeans pocket or a small bag and it just won’t cooperate. This <strong>phone literally folds in half and gives you all the screen real estate you need when it’s open</strong> (perfect for scrolling, watching videos, or texting), then collapsing into a compact square that slips anywhere. It’s the best of both worlds without compromise.</p>
<h2>Why This Flip Phone Upends It All</h2>
<p>Samsung has genuinely improved the <em>FlexWindow</em> on the Z Flip7, that outside screen you get when you close the phone. This no longer just shows notifications: With this new <em>MultiStar</em> integration, you get to personalize this external cover screen with your favorite apps, your widgets and shortcuts. This revamped edge-to-edge display gets everything more in reach, gets rid of that awkward moment of reaching for your phone for just about anything.</p>



<p><em>Now Bar</em> feature warrants a special mention as it actually simplifies your life. This smart strip on your cover screen gives you contextual information during your day. Watching a sports game? You get live scores. In the middle of a workout? You get your progress. Waiting for a delivery? You get your tracking information there. All this comes without opening your phone, which translates to staying informed but not getting bogged down in that endless scroll pit.</p>



<p>Google Gemini integration with FlexWindow raises the bar for convenience: You’re able to <strong>carry on complete conversations with Gemini’s AI assistant</strong> directly from the cover screen, asking questions, making reminders, or getting directions without taking your hands off the wheel. Galaxy AI-driven Now Brief identifies your patterns and automatically brings to your attention personalized information, such as your day’s calendar summary in the morning, bad-weather alerts, or traffic for your commute.</p>
<p>The <em>FlexCam</em> feature is where this phone comes into its own for content creators, as well as for selfie takers: Since the phone is able to support itself at different angles at a partially unfolded state, you’re provided with a <strong>built-in tripod for hand’s free photos as well as videos</strong>. Auto Zoom ensures that you’re always perfectly framed, whether you’re alone or with a crowd, automatically zooming in to get everyone in shot. No more struggling to hold your phone at arms length or asking strangers for a photo.</p>
<p>Under the hood, the Z Flip7 won’t compromise on performance for its slender body. Multitasking with its powerful processor, from playing games to video editing, will come easy, as will not having to constantly search for power outlets with its all-day battery. With storage of 256GB, you get ample storage for your photos, apps, and videos with no worries about running out of storage space. This matters as you’ll be taking lots of <strong>high-quality shots with a 50MP main camera</strong>.</p>
<p>This is an <strong>unlocked phone with a full one-year factory warranty</strong> from Samsung, which means you’re free to use it with any wireless carrier and won’t worry about quality. This phone at a price of just $849 offers an <strong>all-time lowest price</strong> for a phone that was originally launched at a price of $1,099 a few months ago.</p>
