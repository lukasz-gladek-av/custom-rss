The good news is the multiplayer game is getting <em>Killzone </em>Helghast  skins as it approaches its one-year anniversary. The bad news is the entire bundle of virtual cosmetics costs $20, half the price of the paid game itself. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196395" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="80" data-playlist="196395,196653,195371" data-current="196395"><div><p>The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21945.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“We decided a long time ago to do crossovers only if and when they make perfect sense for the game,” the development team wrote in a new blog post on Steam. “So in that spirit, we’re hyped to announce our very first crossover: <em>Killzone 2</em>. <em>Helldivers 2</em> x<em> Killzone 2</em> belongs to a new tier of special Premium content reserved for collaborations and other uniquely-themed work. Our plan is to offer you something distinct and special.”</p><p>The premium collaboration comes at a premium price, however. Buying everything in the set costs 1,975 Super Credits, an in-game currency players can slowly earn while playing or pay roughly $20 per 2,100 for. That makes the <em>Killzone</em> set the most expensive gear you can currently purchase in the <em>Starship Troopers</em>-inspired alien shooter, a game regularly priced at $40 with battle passes called Warbonds that include many more unlockables for just $10 each. </p><figure id="" data-id="eba5b8802d4b9a464ab45e29884a1965" data-recommend-id="image://eba5b8802d4b9a464ab45e29884a1965" data-format="png" data-width="1894" data-height="1062" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu shows new items for purchase in Helldivers 2.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After several years of skin-flation across popular live-service games like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, and <em>Overwatch 2</em>, $15-$20 has become the new norm for crossover skins that bring in popular outside characters and styles. But unlike those games, <em>Helldivers 2</em> is not free-to-play and has already set a certain precedent for its in-game pricing system. Within that existing framework, the Helghast tributes look great but feel way overpriced. They’re also only in the shop for five days, meaning players can’t even take their time trying to grind for Super Credits across hundreds of missions. </p><p>“No set should costs over 1000sc,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgywpl/the_new_superstore_update_is_bad/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgywpl/the_new_superstore_update_is_bad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reads one thread</a></span> currently shooting up to the top of the<em> Helldivers 2</em> subreddit. “Even if we forget the armor set, a new AR?? They seriously add a new gun and lock it behind a 600sc paywall!?” Another player responded that the<em> Killzone</em> set should have been its own Warbond instead, with more content and a lower price point at the cost of having to unlock each piece individually. </p><p>Others have pointed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgyj28/new_gear_just_dropped/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgyj28/new_gear_just_dropped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to a slippery slope</a></span> where red lines for <em>Helldivers 2</em>'s in-game shop have gradually been crossed. At first it was only cosmetic armor, later stratagems, the cool arsenal of war machinery that fuels the gameplay, were added to a paid Warbond, and recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hekecs/dont_sell_weapons_in_the_shop/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hekecs/dont_sell_weapons_in_the_shop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weapons have made it into the shop’s FOMO rotation</a></span>. Players who have purchased every Warbond since the game launched without using free credits would have spent $90 by this point.</p><p>Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Shams Jorjani took to the game’s Discord to try and diffuse the situation. “Hey - quick comment on the Helghast stuff,” he wrote on Wednesday. “Firstly - this is our first collaboration so we’ll be figuring it out as we go along. Let us know what you’d like to see in the future. Secondly it’s optional - the more of this we sell - the more illuminate type stuff we can keep dropping for free.”</p><p>The suggestion that players need to swallow higher prices in order to keep getting free updates didn’t go over to well. “You cannot be serious,” wrote one player in response. “These prices are fucking egregious. Your game is NOT FREE. We have already paid, you don’t get to hide behind a 20 dollar skin as if that makes the difference.” Jorjani simply wrote back, “noted!”</p><p>One of the biggest games of 2024, <em>Helldivers 2</em> has previously butted heads with its community a couple of times this year. The first was over a controversial PSN login requirement on Steam that saw the game’s rating review-bombed to smithereens until it reversed course. The second was a series of patches nerfing some of players’ favorite gear and loadouts, including things they’d purchased from paid Warbonds, which eventually lead the studio <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-charger-framerate-1851622269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-charger-framerate-1851622269">to commit to an apology tour</a></span> of buffing things instead and focusing on addressing performance, stability, and other issues in the meantime. </p><p>That recent revival was capped off with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-illuminate-omens-tyranny-free-update-1851720355&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-illuminate-omens-tyranny-free-update-1851720355">the free Omens of Tyranny update this month</a></span>, that added the game’s third Illuminate faction and new urban warfare maps. It’s a great new chapter in the game’s ongoing Galactic War whose fanfare might be cut short by the bungled <em>Killzone </em>skin rollout, even if the studio was banking on those to help pay for it. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So it is that tomorrow’s teaser trailer for the upcoming James Gunn-led relaunch of the DC cinematic universe, <em>Superman</em>, has just received its own teaser trailer.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Given the premise—a piece of marketing material designed to have you intrigued to watch a forthcoming piece of marketing material that’s designed to have you intrigued to watch a film—the resulting diminishing returns are a collection of shots that tell us almost nothing whatsoever about the film it’s all intended to promote. We see reaction shots of people’s astonishment at seeing—presumably—a man who can fly, stop bullets, and leap tall buildings in a single bound. We also see less than a second of the super man himself.</p><p>Well shit, it worked, didn’t it? We posted it.</p><p>Let’s insist we’re doing it as a cultural observation of the sheer audacity of hype, of the fever pitch Warner Bros. and DC Studios are informing us we’ve reached, over finally seeing a tangible glimpse of this movie. They likely wanted that, too.</p><p>What strikes me as most interesting about what <em>is</em> shown here is how defiantly generic it is when it comes to Superman-based media. Forgetting the shots of crowds looking agog that makes up the bulk of the footage, we’ve got a glimpse of a generic Daily Planet office (including Rachel Brosnahan’s Lois Lane and Skyler Gisondo’s Jimmy Olsen), a split-picosecond moment of Superman flying through the ice inevitably surrounding his Fortress of Solitude, and a tiny dot of Superman disappearing up into the clouds. Each could be lifted from just about any adaptation of the character, from the early ‘90s <em>Lois &amp; Clark</em> to the grey slop of 2006’s <em>Superman Returns</em>—hell, we only know it’s not from 1948's <em>Superman </em>serial or 2013's <em>Man of Steel </em>because it’s in color.</p><figure id="" data-id="1765d9a09d7112c38b6b1b83e14e9dca" data-recommend-id="image://1765d9a09d7112c38b6b1b83e14e9dca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1237" data-height="661" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="One of the split-second glimpses of Superman, here flying through an icy ravine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="One of the split-second glimpses of Superman, here flying through an icy ravine." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rotten Tomatoes Trailers / DC Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1765d9a09d7112c38b6b1b83e14e9dca" data-recommend-id="image://1765d9a09d7112c38b6b1b83e14e9dca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1237" data-height="661" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="One of the split-second glimpses of Superman, here flying through an icy ravine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, it’s also arguable that all of this is an act of boldness, a real statement from Gunn (although who knows how involved he is in the marketing), and that’s  backed up by two other factors: the title and the score.</p><p>Calling your movie <em>Superman</em>, with no subtitle, is a statement. There already was a <em>Superman</em>, in 1978, and Richard Donner’s version has never been improved upon in any of the six films across three relaunches since (let alone the character’s repeated flogging in Snyder’s DCU). It was originally to be called <em>Superman: Legacy</em>, and dropping the suffix is ballsy. Gunn invites direct comparison with the Christopher Reeve classic—a beautifully shot movie that holds up almost 50 years later.</p><p>Then there’s the theme. It’s right there, subtle at first, then—amid the obligatory bassy “thommmm”s that all superhero movie trailers must feature by law—out emerges a faint rendition of John Williams’ classic tune. Again, it’s an unflinching declaration that this film is operating at the same level and evoking the same tonal reverence as the classic that, arguably, both ushered in the era of the modern superhero film, and defined it.</p><p>Gunn’s a fun movie maker, and has had well-deserved success via funny, schlocky films like <em>Slither</em> and <em>Super</em>, followed by the cartoon-like jubilance and hilarity of the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> trilogy and <em>The Suicide Squad</em>. I’m genuinely excited that he’s trying to make something un-terrible from DC properties, ending the era of Snyder’s well-intentioned but grimly dreary attempts, and he’s an obvious fit for the sillier, more subversive side of the comic franchise. But playing <em>Superman</em> this straight, this on-the-nose? I’m fascinated to see what comes of it. Even if I doubt tomorrow’s “teaser” will tell us anything useful.</p><p>My desperate hope is that this could be, finally, <em>finally</em>, the moment someone writes a <em>Superman </em>script that doesn’t depend on unSupermanning him in order to introduce any peril or plot. My “time to Kryptonite” stopwatch will be running, and god, I hope it never has to stop. It’s the great flaw of the great American hero, that the only way anyone can find for an invincible, all-powerful god-like to be interesting on film is to incessantly make him incapable and all-vulnerable, and rely on enemy hubris to save the day.</p><p>(Massive shout-out to CW’s recently finished <em>Superman &amp; Lois</em>, which despite featuring some hoary old cliches and a miserable over-reliance on all shades of Kryptonite, managed to make Clark Kent vulnerable in <em>far </em>more interesting ways, not least in its extraordinary third-season arc following Lois’s cancer story.)</p><p>So, are you hyped for the teaser trailer to hype the six months of trailer-trailers, to hype the movie, ahead of its July 11, 2025 release date? I really hope we’re not exhausted by its simple existence by then.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some movies simply use Christmas as a sort of emotional backdrop for their naughty deeds. Meanwhile, other movies use the holiday as a narrative device meant to highlight a character’s road to redemption and triumph with a feeling of togetherness familiar to all. It’s easy to tell what’s a Christmas movie. It’s not so easy to tell which ones are naughty and which ones are nice.</p><p>A movie overflowing with cursing like <em>Friday After Next </em>is actually a nicer Christmas movie than the family-centric <em>Home Alone</em> because the former uses the feeling of Christmas goodness to overcome its vulgar obstacles while the latter is entirely about an innocent kid surviving a life-or-death situation. One film’s core is a quest to engineer a Christmas miracle to save characters from homelessness, and the other film is just a home invasion comedy thriller set during Christmas. </p><p>All of this and more will be explained once you dive into our examples of some of the best naughty and nice Christmas movies.</p></div></div><div><p><em>Die Hard </em>may very well be a wholesome Christmas movie, given its story about a man wanting to patch things up with his estranged wife. (At least that’s how <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.avclub.com/die-hard-jeb-stuart-interview-35-year-anniversary-1850633919&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.avclub.com/die-hard-jeb-stuart-interview-35-year-anniversary-1850633919">screenwriter Jeb Stuart</a></span> argues on its behalf.) But that doesn’t excuse the fact that John McClane racks up a body count of <em>ten</em> men by the time the end credits roll. Sure, they’re all international criminals posing as terrorists who would have killed far more without McClane to stop them. But if Snoopy and the Red Baron could set aside bloodshed on Christmas night, surely John and Hans could have done so too.</p></div><div><p>Disregarding the 3D-ness of it all, <em>A Very Harold and Kumar 3D Christmas</em> goes down smoother than fast food sliders ever could. John Cho, Kal Penn, and Neil Patrick Harris reunite for one more, seemingly final round as the estranged best friends rediscover their bond after taking their first steps into real adulthood. See past the R-rated vulgarity, gun violence, and claymation dongs and you’ll find <em>A Very Harold and Kumar 3D Christmas</em> to be the gift that keeps on giving.</p></div><div><p><em>Home Alone </em>doesn’t have nearly enough holiday cheer, nor its young star quite enough charm, to cover up the film’s child abandonment resulting from a faulty alarm clock. John Hughes’ seminal film may be a Christmas classic, but that doesn’t mean it’ll ever get off the naughty list. For children, Christmas is a time for the joyful innocence of awaiting Santa Claus’s arrival to  reward your good year with great presents, as you maybe leave him some milk and cookies to sweeten the deal. It’s not about a kid fighting for his life by leaving nails for thief Marv (Daniel Stern) to step on, and a scolding hot doorknob for Harry (Joe Pesci) to burn his hand on, as both try to rob the child’s home. Sorry to say, but one of the greatest Christmas movies ever is also one of the naughtiest.</p></div><div><p>Everything about <em>Elf</em> is a Christmas miracle. Springing from the mind of screenwriter David Berenbaum and executed by the dynamo duo of Jon Favreau and Will Ferrell—the latter considered a liability among executives at the time, given his previous starring role in the bawdy <em>Old School</em>—<em>Elf</em> defied expectations to become the premier holiday classic of the new millennium. Its spellbinding sense of unabashed joy and its story concerning one man’s search for family are powerful enough to thaw even the iciest hearts. And few can resist the simple hilarity of six-foot-three Will Ferrell in emerald stockings.</p></div><div><p>Never judge a book by its cover, but always judge a Christmas movie by its Santa. Billy Bob Thornton, as Willie T. Soke, portrays arguably the crudest department store Santa Claus in history. Telling a child on your lap that you contracted a disease from sleeping with Mrs. Claus’s sister and then showing up to work drunk is sacrilegious to anyone who celebrates Christmas. The movie takes an exceptionally dark turn when Willie attempts suicide—something no Christmas story should have to endure. While preteen Thurman Merman (Brett Kelly) ultimately gains the gift of lasting friendship with Willie and the confidence to stand up to his bullies, it only comes after Willie is shot by the police while wearing his Santa costume and Thurman flips off his harasser. You can’t slap a few ornaments on a lump of coal and call it anything but naughty.</p></div><div><p>I know what you’re about to say, and you’re correct: <em>Friday After Next</em> had more F-words that weren’t “frolicking” or “family” in it than any Christmas movie should have. But it was all in service of preserving what makes Christmas great. Craig Jones (Ice Cube) and Daymond “Day-Day” Jones (Mike Epps) make ridiculous attempts at paying rent after a thief dressed as Santa Claus robs them of their rent money and gifts. That, along with Katt Williams’ Money Mike character thwarting sexual assault by clinching Damon “Triple O.G.” Pearly’s (Terry Crews’) testicles with pliers, is antithetical to the Christmas spirit. However, gathering people for a Christmas Eve party to help them pay their rent, along with Christmas carolers getting retribution for those who harassed them while they spread holiday cheer, are beautiful examples of the power of Christmas. Plus, catching the robber in the ’hood, getting the money back, and leaving him on a roof for the cops to collect is nothing short of a Christmas miracle.</p></div><div><p>Nothing is more awkward than your boss hooking up with your crush. So imagine being Jack Lemmon in Billy Wilder’s <em>The Apartment</em>, whose boss isn’t just sleeping with his crush (Shirley MacLaine) but doing the deed in his own pad! (Even worse: Imagine the cleaning bill on all of his own bedsheets.) Beloved as it may be with its sweet happy ending and the triumph of personal happiness over professional ambition, the central predicament of <em>The Apartment</em> is just about the epitome of the holiday blues. The very kind Elvis sang about. </p></div><div><p>No, revealing someone’s sex work past and a cancer death aren’t really what Christmas is all about. Those are just the lowlights, however, in an illuminating Christmas classic, <em>The Best Man Holiday</em>. The sequel to 1999's <em>The Best Man</em> finds a fractured yet still familial group of friends spending the holidays together when infidelity, financial mismanagement, and betrayal strike. The performances from the film’s incredible ensemble, which includes Taye Diggs, Nia Long, Terrence Howard, and Regina Hall, are all rooted in the type of redeemable honesty that inspires the forgiveness that Christmas calls for. Coordinated displays of love, like wearing the same ugly Santa sweater as your partner and going Christmas caroling, are quintessentially in the Christmas spirit. Thanks to <em>The Best Man Holiday</em>, you can add four men doing a choreographed rendition of New Edition’s “Can You Stand the Rain” for the women in their lives (while decked in enough leather to cause a heat stroke in slightly hotter conditions) to that list.</p></div><div><p>Hot chocolate and pecan pie can set the Christmas mood perfectly—unless they’re consumed under duress while your kidnappers are seconds away from pummeling you. Starring Ben Affleck, Charlize Theron, and <em>Forrest Gump</em>’s Gary Sinise, <em>Reindeer Games</em> follows ex-con Rudy Duncan (Affleck) as he assumes the identity of his late cellmate Nick (James Frain) to win over a woman named Ashley (Theron) and spend time with her family for Christmas after being released from prison. However, he soon finds himself entangled in a dangerous plot led by Ashley’s brother Gabriel (Sinise), who believes Rudy (posing as Nick) can help them rob a casino. Kidnapping, excessive blood and guns, and a deadly finale are all cardinal sins of Christmas movies, banishing this one to the naughty pile.</p></div><div><p>Paul Giamatti may be a perpetual Grinch in his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-dc-dune-penguin-golden-globes-1851716634?_gl=1*cq8jjv*_ga*MTQ2OTgzNDI5MS4xNzMyMjkzNzkx*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDQ1MzQ0Ni43MC4xLjE3MzQ0NjM0MTkuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-dc-dune-penguin-golden-globes-1851716634?_gl=1*cq8jjv*_ga*MTQ2OTgzNDI5MS4xNzMyMjkzNzkx*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDQ1MzQ0Ni43MC4xLjE3MzQ0NjM0MTkuNjAuMC4w">Golden Globe Award</a></span>-winning performance as boarding school <strike>dictator</strike> teacher Paul Hunham in <em>The Holdovers</em>, but that just makes the Christmas joy he helps engineer all the more sacred and earned. No one should be alone on Christmas, and <em>The Holdovers </em>immaculately demonstrates that as Hunham, petulant student Angus Tully (Dominic Sessa), and grieving cafeteria manager Mary Lamb (Da’Vine Joy Randolph) are all stuck at Barton Academy boarding school over the holidays, life passing each of them by in particular ways. They band together and help each other reconnect with family and the joy of life.

But that still doesn’t mean it gets on Santa’s nice list. While this wildly underrated Christmas comedy champions the endurance of male friendships and taking personal accountability, there’s still a whole lotta lies, drugs, and unprotected sex in dive bar bathrooms during this oh-so-holy night. Also, while things ultimately work out for Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Lizzy Caplan, it’s never a good idea to spring a public marriage proposal on your ex.</p></div><div><p>“Isn’t there anyone who knows what Christmas is all about?” cries Charlie Brown. “Sure Charlie Brown, I can tell you what Christmas is all about,” a calm Linus says before cueing the stagelights and recounting the story of the First Christmas. It’s an iconic emotional climax to an equally iconic Christmas movie, one that stands the test of time thanks to just how much poor old Charlie Brown buckles under the weight of expectations and hollow artificiality. Linus’ Bible lecture isn’t religious dogma, not really. Just a calm reminder that the real intentions of these end-of-year celebrations are, as he puts it, “peace [and] good will toward men.”</p><h2 id="h157399"><a id=""></a></h2></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Depending on your playstyle and the build you’re after, you might need an early-game skill to clear standard mobs, but you’ll quickly realize that many of the Mercenary’s abilities prove potent well into the late-game, too. For now, let’s focus on three must-have skills.</p><p><strong>Tier I: Explosive Grenade</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="fb621940e200e41f7fbc91b9813cea79" data-recommend-id="image://fb621940e200e41f7fbc91b9813cea79" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Explosive Grenade skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Explosive Grenade skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fb621940e200e41f7fbc91b9813cea79" data-recommend-id="image://fb621940e200e41f7fbc91b9813cea79" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Explosive Grenade skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the most powerful early-game skills you can unlock for the Mercenary, specifically an AoE (area-of-effect) ability that deals Physical and Fire Damage to mobs, is the <strong>Explosive Grenade</strong>. It’s an effective party starter of a skill, as tossing one into a small group will whittle down an enemy’s health and soften them up. It’s also effective for keeping up the pressure against bosses.</p><p><strong>Tier III: Incendiary Shot</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="d87309fd8513353c7cb06887174e5010" data-recommend-id="image://d87309fd8513353c7cb06887174e5010" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Incendiary Shot skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Incendiary Shot skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d87309fd8513353c7cb06887174e5010" data-recommend-id="image://d87309fd8513353c7cb06887174e5010" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Incendiary Shot skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Incendiary Shot </strong>is as effective as it is flashy. It’s slow to reload and cast, but the AoE effect of igniting everything in front of you on fire cannot be ignored. Igniting enemies and clearing low-level mobs are excellent ways to kick off a fight and simultaneously damage large groups.</p><p><strong>Tier V: Rapid Shot</strong></p><figure id="" data-id="0e7a8570ffb387f0289f7fe433c3af1c" data-recommend-id="image://0e7a8570ffb387f0289f7fe433c3af1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Rapid Shot skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Rapid Shot skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0e7a8570ffb387f0289f7fe433c3af1c" data-recommend-id="image://0e7a8570ffb387f0289f7fe433c3af1c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the Rapid Shot skill for Mercenary in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’ve been following along, you should now have two powerful AoE abilities, but now it’s time to focus on single-target damage that deals with rapid-fire DPS (damage-per-second) to quickly whittle down a boss’s health pool. <strong>Rapid Shot </strong>effectively turns your single-shot crossbow into a fast-firing machine gun, slinging steel bolts at enemies with an impressive clip size. This ability is how I finally bested Count Geonor at the end of Act 1.</p><p><br><em>Path of Exile 2</em> is currently available via paid Early Access via Steam on PC. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Whether he’s torching his own birthday cake with a flamethrower or dancing with himself through a field of lasers, it’s never easy to shake the sense that the movie was more focused on achieving GIF-able moments than telling any kind of coherent story.﻿<br></p></blockquote><p>In the end, Zilko’s assessment is that <em>Sonic 3</em> might be fun for young kids and diehard fans, but it can’t end soon enough for everyone else. He might be right. But as the perfect mark for a Sega nostalgia cash-in with Sonic-loving kids of his own, I’m ready to revel in the franchise brain rot no matter what. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
