Just what it will mean for gamers around the world, however, may not be clear for some time. </p><h2 id="h109617"><a id=""></a>A History Of Streaming</h2><p>For about 20 years now, companies have been trying (and mostly failing) to let gamers stream console and PC titles via the internet without having to download anything. As early as 2005, a service called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-cluster&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-cluster" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">G-Cluster</a></span> was  offering this. Perhaps you’ve heard of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnLive&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OnLive" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OnLive</a></span>, which let players stream games from big publishers starting around 2009. (Both services are now defunct.) </p><p>However, things didn’t start heating up in the video game streaming space until <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Now#:~:text=PlayStation%20Now%20was%20launched%20in,coming%20later%20in%20the%20year.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Now#:~:text=PlayStation%20Now%20was%20launched%20in,coming%20later%20in%20the%20year." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2014 and the arrival of Sony’s PlayStation Now service</a></span>. That was the first time one of the bigger players really got involved. In the decade since, Xbox has started offering more ways to stream games, Sony has expanded its offerings, and Amazon, Google, and Nvidia have hopped into the streaming wars, too. (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stadia-google-refund-cloud-streaming-assassins-creed-1849597014&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stadia-google-refund-cloud-streaming-assassins-creed-1849597014">Google’s Stadia service famously flopped</a></span> and is no longer around.) </p><p>Through all of this, streaming games has never felt like it was really a <em>thing</em>. It was an option, sure, but I rarely met anyone who used these services. It seemed like a neat idea, but not something anyone was really using.</p><p> That’s changed recently, however, as I now know more people who stream games on their phones and other devices. This shift has happened as Xbox has ramped up its cloud streaming offerings alongside Sony and the other tech giants. </p><h2 id="h109618"><a id=""></a>Xbox and PlayStation expand their streaming services</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps-portal-new-update-cloud-streaming-ps5-beta-test-1851703376&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps-portal-new-update-cloud-streaming-ps5-beta-test-1851703376">On November 19</a></span>, Sony announced that its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-ps5-resell-ebay-sold-out-restock-1851031015&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-ps5-resell-ebay-sold-out-restock-1851031015">PS Portal</a></span> handheld device would now be able to stream some games without a console. Xbox has been letting players do that for a few years now, letting you stream Game Pass titles on your phone or browser. But on November 20, the day after Sony’s announcement, Xbox declared it was also going to start letting people stream games they own on supported devices. </p><p>Game streaming is now a part of many different video game ecosystems. You can stream Xbox titles on your phone, and PlayStation games on your PC. Some publishers have even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-trilogy-comes-to-switch-via-cloud-stream-1847800725&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-trilogy-comes-to-switch-via-cloud-stream-1847800725">released streaming-only games on the Nintendo Switch</a></span> to get around the aging console’s weaker specs. It’s clear that cloud streaming is no longer an oddball experiment, but instead a key part of multiple company strategies moving forward. </p><p> “Our biggest growth in Xbox players is on PC and cloud,” Xbox boss Phil Spencer told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/xbox-console-future-cloud-ceo-phil-spencer-1235166597/#:~:text=Speaking%20about%20consoles,in%20more%20places.%E2%80%9D&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/xbox-console-future-cloud-ceo-phil-spencer-1235166597/#:~:text=Speaking%20about%20consoles,in%20more%20places.%E2%80%9D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Rolling Stone</em> in a recent interview</a></span>. </p><p>“The console space isn’t growing, across all of them. We love those customers, but in terms of continuing to expand and grow Xbox, it’s about PC, it’s about cloud, and it’s about making our games more available in more places.” </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-says-it-will-soon-reveal-agressive-plans-for-cloud-gaming/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-says-it-will-soon-reveal-agressive-plans-for-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In May 2023</a></span>, PlayStation’s then-CEO Jim Ryan said during a business call that “cloud [gaming] will be fundamental” and explained that Sony has “fairly interesting and quite aggressive plans to accelerate our initiatives in [game streaming].” </p><p>Amazon, one of the biggest companies around, is investing heavily into streaming with its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tweaktown.com/news/91358/activision-ceo-says-amazon-luna-has-the-most-game-streaming-customers/index.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/91358/activision-ceo-says-amazon-luna-has-the-most-game-streaming-customers/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">own Luna service</a></span>, which lets you play big and small games across multiple devices.

A lot of people, both inside and outside these tech companies, seem to expect cloud streaming to become more and more popular in the coming years.</p><p>In 2024, more people are playing games via the cloud. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1760300717334462498&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1760300717334462498" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox boss Phil Spencer said in February that at least 10 percent</a></span> of all hours spent on Xbox are now via players streaming games on their phones or other devices. It makes sense that as games get bigger, consoles get more expensive, and phones get better, a lot of people might decide to just stream the latest <em>Call of Duty </em>or <em>Grand Theft Auto</em> instead of spending money on a new console, downloading the game, and playing it in one spot. </p><p>Anecdotally, a lot of younger people I know stream games on their phones and prefer it over playing with a controller or keyboard on their TV or PC. That might send a shiver down your spine, but the reality is that this is our future. I don’t think offline games are going away, but it’s clear that as console sales stagnate, cloud gaming looks like a potential goldmine to big game companies, publishers, and tech giants, if they can make the tech work and keep their costs reasonable.</p><p>Today, I know plenty of people who stream games via Xbox cloud or their PS Portal. I’ve now started streaming some games to my phone when I’m lazy and just want to do some grinding in an RPG or online game. It’s easier than ever and works better than it once did, too.

The $5 sandwich apparently isn’t tempting fate enough for some enthusiasts, so for just $20 more, people can also pick up a half-gallon of the McRib sauce to do god knows what with. I can already see someone livestreaming the first McRib hot tub session. Nudity is banned on Twitch, but highly processed sauce-related acts of depravity are not. </p><p>The McRib was first introduced at the fast-food chain back in 1985. It was so disgusting, even for the sons and daughters of the Reagan Revolution, that it was removed from the menu just a few years later.

And although the opening fortnight’s craziness is beginning to calm down, it’s still a surprisingly pricy collection.</p><p>Cards have held their value well into the second week, when we’d normally see them crashing down, though I still strongly suspect we’ll see a bunch of those prices dropping by the end of November.</p><p>However, I think what we’re seeing with Surging Sparks is another of the <em>Pokémon TCG</em>’s occasional peaks, those moments when it grabs the zeitgeist once again and everyone’s jumping in for a bit of speculation. That’s likely driven in part by the expectations for January’s new set, Prismatic Evolutions—a set that has already sold out on early pre-orders because of its focus on Eevee-lutions. Everyone always goes nuts over those, and it’s likely to see prices that make Surging Sparks’ look minimal.</p><p>I’ve ripped open about 60 packs of Surging Sparks (in part thanks to The Pokémon Company, who sent <em>Kotaku</em> a hefty pile), and haven’t had good luck at all. Pull rates seem about standard for 2023-24, a disappointing one in five for a standard ex or better, and far lower if you want to see any of the astonishing number of gorgeous artworks in the set.</p><p>It’s getting to a point where it just feels silly to let artists create so much beautiful work, and then make it so phenomenally difficult for anyone to see any of it. And given Pokémon isn’t seeing any of the profits made by those reselling them, the financial incentive is only in hoping that people will just buy more packs to try to find them. But given that everyone’s getting used to the horrible chances, that’s not a great long-term strategy. Grimly, I managed to get <em>three</em> of the ghastly full-art Bruxish cards (the art is great, the Pokémon is hideous), and comprehensively missed out on any of the 35 different cards I’d hoped to pull. The full-art Castform is lovely, though, and I’m pleased to have it.</p><p>Still, you may have been far luckier. Usually when we put these articles together, there’s one card teetering at around a hundred bucks, and then it’s down into the teens by card five or six. Not so in Surging Sparks.</p><p><em>As ever, all prices are correct at the time of writing, but these things change pretty rapidly.

God knows why anyone’s paying <strong>$26 </strong>for a gold version of a bland  Trainer card, with the useful but not exciting ability to pull a Pokémon or Energy card from your discard pile. While gold cards used to hold some collectability, that faded with Sword &amp; Shield, with TPCi desperately trying to reinvigorate interest with a series of quickly abandoned alternatives. (Those green and gold ones? Bleurgh.)</p><p>Even sillier, there’s a much nicer Alolan Exeggutor ex gold card that’s in 12th place, at $23, and Night Stretcher is even out-pricing the Ultra Rare version of the Pikachu ex card everyone’s going so nuts over, which is in 11th place at $24.

It’s already idiotically inflated, given it’s just a decent ex card with quite a pretty piece of art that just caught fire due to the mimesis of collectors. It’s obviously no more powerful than the $8 regular version, which is what you should buy if you want that 300 attack in your deck, and if you’ve got the SIR to sell, sell it now before everyone entirely comes to their senses. And for god’s sake, <em>don’t buy it </em>at this price.</p><p>That it ever reached such highs will likely cause the price to remain artificially inflated for a while to come, but I bet my trousers this’ll be down to $200 by December, and then gently drift down further by the New Year.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For example, if you were a member, you could play the <em>Halo Master Chief Collection </em>on your phone via cloud streaming. But, if a game you wanted to stream and play wasn’t included in the Game Pass catalog, you were screwed. That changes today, though only for some games. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/20/stream-your-own-game-xbox-cloud-gaming-beta/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/20/stream-your-own-game-xbox-cloud-gaming-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On November 20, Xbox announced</a></span> that it would finally let people stream some games they already own.

You can, however, stream them on all other devices and browsers that support it.

I know, because I just did that. </p><p>Currently only 50 games are supported, but that’s better than before when it was zero.
