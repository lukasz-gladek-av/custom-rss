              <p>Laptops are miracles of productivity, but they’re limited to just one screen of workspace. Even the big boys with their ultra-sharp 17-inch displays are, well, just one 17-inch display for all of those windows you multitasking mavens want to have open at one time. Reaching the full potential of your laptop or even your tablet requires an extra screen, or maybe even two, and the <strong>Anker USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter </strong>is the perfect tool to make that happen. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3881/">Even better, it’s just $25 right now in a limited-time Amazon deal</a>.</p>
<p>The Anker USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter requires no extra software or drivers, just plug-and-play with any compatible laptop or tablet with an USB-C port. Windows laptops can be extended to two additional 4K monitors either in mirror mode, with all three screens showing the same image, or extended desktop mode with A-B-B or A-B-C configuration. MacOS laptops can extend to two additional 4K monitors in mirror mode or A-B-B extended desktop mode. Smartphones with a USB-C port can also be connected to a dual-HDMI display.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3881/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Huge Configuration Potential</h2>
<p>While the Anker USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter can definitely be thought of as an ideal laptop-to-external monitor device, its capabilities don’t end there. On the USB-C source side of the adapter, compatible tablets and smartphones are also just a plug-and-play connection away from being mirrored onto a much-larger screen. That screen isn’t just limited to HDMI-compatible external monitors, either. TVs and projectors with an HDMI input port are also accessible to your USB-C devices, and without the need for a driver or app.</p>
<p>The potential use for these connections is nearly limitless. The productivity boost of going from one small screen to one small screen and two large 4K screens is obvious. But now instead of having to pass your smartphone or tablet from person to person to show off those pictures and videos you shot on vacation, you can connect your compatible USB-C device to an external monitor, big-screen TV, or projector and put on a show.</p>



<h2>Pocket-Sized Power</h2>
<p>We’ve seen hubs and ports that, while powerful and versatile, are large and/or requiring their own source of AC power. The Anker USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter is anything but bulky. It’s 2 inches by 2.5 inches in size — smaller than a credit card — and just under a half-inch thick. The adapter’s weight is negligible at 1.7 ounces, so you can stick it on your pocket or laptop bag and bring it out anywhere there’s a HDMI-compatible display at the ready.</p>
<p>The Anker name that’s so trusted for charging devices is also a sign of quality for this multi-device adapter. Anker covers the USB-C to Dual HDMI Adapter with a worry-free 18-month warranty should anything go wrong. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3881/">Amazon’s limited-time deal makes this a $25 accessory that guarantees you’ll never look at working on one small screen the same way again.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-a9-hits-clearance-level-pricing-ahead-of-new-s11-tablet-launch-2000622426</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-galaxy-tab-a9-hits-clearance-level-pricing-ahead-of-new-s11-tablet-launch.1287495/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>September is here and even though we still technically have a few more weeks of summer, culturally, it’s over. That’s because all the kiddos are headed back to the classroom to kick of the new school year. And with that comes tons of back-to-school sales.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/"> The Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ tablet which usually goes for $220 dropped by 30%.</a> That saves you $65, bringing the price down to just $155 for a limited time. You’re getting an 11-inch touch display for under $200.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great Look and Sound</h2>
<p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ is packing an LCD screen that has a resolution of 1200p with a refresh rate of 90 Hz. The built-in speakers supply a powerful and rich sound you can hear clearly with the help of Dolby Atmos. You’re getting cinema-like sound in the palm of your hands. Alright, you and I both know a tablet isn’t producing “cinema-quality” audio. Those are Samsung’s words and even though that “like” is doing a lot of heavy lifting, it’s still quite relatively speaking when talking about tablets.</p>
<h2>Portability</h2>
<p>At 11 inches across, the tablet is light and slim in design, yet remains durable. That makes it wonderfully portable so you can take it with you when traveling on long weekend trips, or just with you to your local coffee shop to get some work done or enjoy some reading with a change of scenery.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/">You have two choices or storage capacities.</a> To no one’s surprised, the less expensive model of the two is the lower capacity 64GB model. You have an option for twice that with 128GB. Storage is good for if you find yourself downloading a bunch of movies and shows, though if you’re just streaming everything anyway, the 64GB model will be perfectly suffice.</p>



<p>The Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ is running Android OS which can actually have multiple apps open side-by-side at once. You can switch back and forth between different tasks or have two more tabs open next to each other for easy viewing.</p>
<p>Moving files to and from the Tab A9+ is pretty simple. Quick Share allows you to just select a file and transfer it immediately to a nearby device. That even works for phones and tablets running something other than Android OS.</p>
<p>The Samsung Kids app makes this tablet a great choice for parents who might be sharing the tablet with their children. Not every kid needs their own dedicated smart device and the Kids app is filled with a bunch of playful content appropriate for kids.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-demo-hands-on-impressions-jrpg-2000622687</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/octopath-traveler-0-hands-on-way-more-than-just-a-mobile-game-remake.1287462/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I can’t say I expected <a href="https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-trailer-release-date-switch-2-1851787423">much from <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em></a>. I’ve long admired the HD-2D role-playing game series but each new entry eventually leaves me cold. All of the pieces are there but they don’t solidify into an experience that’s more than the sum of its grindy, retro-infused parts. So I was surprised by just how much I immediately clicked with Square Enix’s latest tribute to the genre’s pixel art golden age.</p> <p>It probably helped that the demo I played last weekend at PAX West pushed me right to the brink of failure in a tough boss fight I ultimately only survived after all of my healing items were depleted and only one party member was still barely left standing. Some fans have worried about <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> being based on a mobile game that came out several years ago called <em>Champions of the Continent</em>. While Square Enix <a href="https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-gacha-champions-continent-remake-1851787459">already confirmed the gacha gameplay elements</a> have been stripped out from this remake (the story has also been reworked), I can confirm, based on what I played at least, that <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> doesn’t feel like an obviously <em>lesser</em> entry in the series.</p> <p>My roughly 30 minutes with <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> was what anyone familiar with the old-school, turn-based RPG series would expect: I ran around town, fought enemies in a desert, and eventually made my way through a brief, cavernous dungeon peppered with treasure chests and dead ends to the boss fight within. The HD pixel art with soft focus backgrounds is still pretty and effective nostalgia bait, and the music in the section of the game I got to play was exceptional.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000622694" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000622694"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000622694">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>But my demo did highlight two of the main features that set <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em><em>&nbsp;</em>apart from its predecessors. The first is a settlement sim mini-game in which you get to rebuild a town burned down at the start of the game from scratch. This includes both structures that impact aspects of your recovery efforts and the village’s development, like how many villagers come to live with you and the kinds of resources they harvest, as well as purely cosmetic features like cobblestone roads, trees, and benches.</p> <p>You gather materials out in the world and build stuff by placing objects on a square grid. While I didn’t get much time to play around with how these systems interact with one another over time, it’s easy to see how the settlement sim elements offer another avenue of satisfying progression that will directly benefit the rest of your party on your travels. Combined with all of the characters you’re meeting and collecting on your adventure, it all feels <a href="https://kotaku.com/suikoden-1-2-hd-collection-review-rpg-features-ps1-1851767870">a bit <em>Suikoden</em>-coded</a> in the best way.</p>

 <p>Speaking of parties, <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> lets you wander the world with eight instead of just four. During combat, half are relegated to a back row while the rest take turns attacking on the frontlines. Whenever it’s someone’s turn you can swap them with their buddy in the back if you need to take advantage of a different skill to exploit an enemy’s weakness or increase survivability for an upcoming onslaught. Even though they don’t get to act from the back row, these members of your party still boost the squad with free health restoration, skill points, and Boost Points at regular intervals.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000622695" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000622695"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000622695">Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The result is combat that feels a lot busier but also more dynamic. Maybe someone in the back row has full BP so you swap them in to unleash a super attack and stun an opponent. Or you need the dancer to come out and buff the team before swapping her out with the spear guy who can target the enemy’s weakness. It speeds combat up and also creates a satisfying second layer of party management. For me it hit a sweet spot that the level of in-combat decision making in other <em>Octopath Traveler</em> games hasn’t always managed to.</p> <p>Out December 4 on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> seemed like a stop-gap release aimed squarely at existing hardcore fans while they wait for Square Enix’s Team Asano to eventually deliver <em>Octopath Traveler 3</em>. But as an <em>Octopath Traveler </em>sympathizer who’s long been <a href="https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-ii-impressions-rpg-partitio-osvald-1850179725">on the fence about the series</a>, my hands-on time convinced me this might finally be the one to break my skepticism.</p>

              <p>This console generation has been notable for many reasons, from the scarcity during a covid-era launch through to the unprecedented scale of failures and studio closures, but one aspect that’s more bizarre to see than any other is the continual <em>increase</em> in prices. Historically midway through a generation we would see prices start to drop—this time, however, we’ve only seen the cost go up. And now in an astonishing move, it’s looking like Sony might be downgrading the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition.</p> <p>While currently only affecting customers in Europe, the situation appears to be that the narrower PlayStation 5 Digital’s storage will be reduced from 1TB to 825GB, with the price remaining the same. That’s a price which, notably, has already been increased twice since launch. This is what’s being reported by billbil-kun on the French site <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps5-slim-numerique-chassis-e-vers-une-reduction-du-stockage-ssd-60471"><em>Dealabs</em></a>, based on information from <a href="https://kunkoku.jp/playstation5-cfi-2100-3.html">certification documents</a>&nbsp;that show the next version of the discless PS5 in Europe, the <span dir="auto">CFI-2116 model, will maintain the current €499 ($580) price, but lose 20 percent of its storage capacity. This is currently only affecting the digital PS5; the version with a disc drive is as yet unchanged.</span></p> <p>That €499 price, it should be noted, is €100 ($116) more expensive than the PS5 was at launch, after two €50 increases since 2020. In the U.S., the console has also increased in price. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-price-tariff-sony-pro-xbox-unit-sales-earnings-1851780593">Sony warned in May</a> that Trump’s implementation of tariffs would likely cause costs to increase, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873">last month that happened</a>. The PS5 Digital, which launched at $400, is now only available as the PS5 Slim at $500 (originally $450), though at least it still comes with a full terabyte of storage.</p>

 <p>Of course, any of this could change at any time. In previous generations, at around the four-to-five year mark in a console’s lifespan, we’d usually be seeing prices dropping on original builds, perhaps alongside a tweaked version at the original launch price. As such, it’s been weird enough to see this reversed, let alone then learning that new versions of the machines might become <em>worse</em> instead of better.</p> <p>825GB is far too little space in 2025. The PS5 Digital originally launched with that as its standard storage, before the “Slim” version replaced it in 2023 and upgraded things to 1TB. But given Sony’s software already takes up a huge chunk of the drive, that only leaves 667GB on an 825GB disc for your use. Given AAA games are routinely coming in around 150GB these days, you’re left with room for maybe four or five big titles? That’s&nbsp;<em>terrible</em>.</p> <p>But console manufacturers are clearly hurting when it comes to hardware revenue, given most are notoriously sold at cost or at a loss, and with tariff confusion and reality deeply hurting markets, there’s obviously a desire to shave costs wherever it’s possible. Putting the price of the console up a third time in five years in Europe is probably too big of an ask, so cutting corners could well be the next option. Which sucks. Big time.</p>
