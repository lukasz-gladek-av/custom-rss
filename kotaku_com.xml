It’s a fan-favorite due to its highly viable minion builds that sprint through zones, clearing mobs with reckless abandon. But for a new player, making it to the end-game with the Witch means picking the right starting skills—a strong foundation. Let’s go over what that foundation looks like and what your best options are when starting out as a Witch. I wish I had taken these skills for the Witch in <em>Path of Exile 2</em> on my first playthrough.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195734" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195734,196411,195189" data-current="195734"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21246.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h46926"><a id="active"></a>The best Witch early-game skills to snag<br></h2><p>In <em>Path of Exile 2</em>, the skills you’ll unlock for your class range from Tier 1 to Tier 13, albeit skipping a few in between. Let’s focus on Tiers 1, 3, and 5, which will provide you with an early-game foundation toward success.</p><h3 id="h46927"><a id=""></a><strong>Tier I: Skeletal Sniper</strong></h3><figure id="" data-id="f2348af7cf3439e730225ec41f75ea04" data-recommend-id="image://f2348af7cf3439e730225ec41f75ea04" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu screen shows the Skeletal Sniper skill in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu screen shows the Skeletal Sniper skill in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f2348af7cf3439e730225ec41f75ea04" data-recommend-id="image://f2348af7cf3439e730225ec41f75ea04" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu screen shows the Skeletal Sniper skill in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Unearth </strong>is a relatively basic-yet-functional AoE (area-of-effect) skill that is completely free during the prologue section on the beach. But if you want to enhance your area damage, choose <strong>Skeletal Sniper</strong> as your Tier I skill. This is a powerful minion spell that summons a skeleton archer wielding a poison gas bow and arrow.</p><h3 id="h46928"><a id=""></a><strong>Tier III: Skeletal Arsonist</strong></h3><figure id="" data-id="a935b6192025191c7db79f6cbd362f21" data-recommend-id="image://a935b6192025191c7db79f6cbd362f21" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu shows the Skeletal Arsonist skill in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu shows the Skeletal Arsonist skill in Path of Exile 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a935b6192025191c7db79f6cbd362f21" data-recommend-id="image://a935b6192025191c7db79f6cbd362f21" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu shows the Skeletal Arsonist skill in Path of Exile 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Keeping up with the AoE theme, your second ability (this one for Tier 3), should be <strong>Skeletal Arsonist</strong>. This is another minion summon spell that spawns a group of bomb-throwing skeletons to wreak havoc on a given area. It’s exceptional for controlling an arena, like during one of the game’s many optional boss fights.</p><h3 id="h46929"><a id=""></a><strong>Tier V: Raise Zombie</strong></h3><figure id="" data-id="caf93c203e684679d1b956ad6f328c4c" data-recommend-id="image://caf93c203e684679d1b956ad6f328c4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu screen shows the Raise Zombie skill." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu screen shows the Raise Zombie skill." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Grinding Gear Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="caf93c203e684679d1b956ad6f328c4c" data-recommend-id="image://caf93c203e684679d1b956ad6f328c4c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu screen shows the Raise Zombie skill." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Lastly, for Tier 5, consider<strong> Raise Zombie</strong>. It is, as expected, another minion summon spell, just one that’s on a short timer. You can raise up to 10 zombies, creating a horde of minions that lash out at enemies who come too close. With Raise Zombie and your Skeletal spawning skills, you’ll have a small, undead force to rampage through a map.</p><h2 id="h46930"><a id="passive"></a>Best passive skills for the Witch<br></h2><figure id="" data-id="ae307356176271e58c922cdf51c3f050" data-recommend-id="image://ae307356176271e58c922cdf51c3f050" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows the passive skill tree for the witch.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As should be obvious by now, the foundation we just discussed will lead you on to a heavy summons build in <em>Path of Exile 2</em>. As a new player, you may quickly feel overwhelmed by the passive skill tree, but it’s less intimidating than it appears. This is the passive skill tree for all classes, so you don’t have to worry about most of the tree, just your section where the game starts.</p><p>With that said, first, focus on the left-hand path, which<strong> increases</strong> <strong>Spell and Minion Damage</strong>. While it may change during Early Access, the first node provides a noticeable boost in your damage output,<strong> increasing Spell Damage by 8 percent and Minion Damage by 8 percent</strong>.</p><p>You should follow this path of the tree for a short while, then refocus your efforts on the right-hand node path, which will increase survivability. You’ll be a glass cannon initially, but it’s worthwhile to increase the power of your summons, which will handle the brunt of the work.</p><p>Of course, if you prefer a more tactical approach, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/path-of-exile-2-mercenary-class-guide-beginners-best-1851721613&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/path-of-exile-2-mercenary-class-guide-beginners-best-1851721613">new Mercenary class is considered one of the best in <em>Path of Exile 2</em> Early Access</a></span>!

Set in the Tamriel province of Cyrodiil, the RPG tasks the player with preventing an evil cult from opening up a portal to hell.

According to her, <em>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man </em>begins with Peter Parker entering his freshman year of high school, which sets it apart from the live-action Tom Holland film franchise that starts with Parker in his sophomore year. However, the animated series does follow some of the same timeline as Holland’s films as the show is “starting at a point in the MCU where Civil War has happened, so the Sokovia Accords have been ratified.” <br></p><p>At a certain point, though, it sounds as if things break off from the chronology we’re familiar with due to some kind of inciting incident. According to Vasquez-Eberhardt, during Parker’s first day at school “a thing happens that—and there goes your branch.” From then on, <em>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man </em>charts its own path. It’ll be one without Parker ever going to Midtown Technical High School, or meeting Ned and MJ. Before you cry foul, Vasquez-Eberhardt promises this divergence from the typical Spidey arc allows the show to delve into some intriguing ensemble pairings with Spider-Man.

Well, years ago Valve implemented cool stuff like Steam achievements, game cards, and badges. These are great features that incentivize people to play and buy more games. However, not long after these features were added to Steam, some shady devs started creating very basic “games” that were just designed to pad achievements, give players cheap cards to trade, and increase their collection stats. So Valve came up with a solution to stop that stuff. </p><p> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/profile&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/profile" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As explained by Valve via its Steam documentation website,</a></span> games arrive on Steam “limited” and missing features like trading cards. Only games that meet a certain (undisclosed) popularity and sales threshold are able to escape this limited status. The idea is that this is a quality check against shovelware and scams. And if you’re curious how many games released on Steam in 2024 are limited, well, the answer is <em>a lot</em>. </p><p>Over on LinkedIn, Twitch’s head of games Bill Young <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/posts/youngbill_19k-games-were-published-on-steam-in-2024-activity-7283203637084876801-IMZx/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/youngbill_19k-games-were-published-on-steam-in-2024-activity-7283203637084876801-IMZx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted an interesting breakdown</a></span> of how the majority of video game releasing on Steam these days are limited. According to SteamDB, in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2024 18,992 games were released on Steam</a></span>. But only <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/?tagid=1003823&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/stats/releases/?tagid=1003823" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4,041 of those games</a></span> racked up enough sales and attracted enough players to escape limited status. That means 14,951 games launched last year on Valve’s digital PC storefront were barely played or purchased. </p><p> That 14,951 works out to 79% of all games released on Steam in 2024. And this isn’t a new trend, as pointed out by Young. In 2020, 66 percent of all games launched on Steam were limited. In 2022, that number reached 72 percent. And now, it’s up to nearly 80 percent. If you’re curious about how 2025 is going to shake out, well, we’re only 13 days into the year and 444 games have already released on Steam. 389 of them are limited.</p><p>Some might argue that Valve shouldn’t throttle or limit any of these games. But the reality is that we would likely see an increase in shovelware, scams, and asset flips if Valve completely took down the barriers it currently has in place. And I don’t think the world needs 200,000 random games suddenly flooding Steam. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Their stories typically revolve around someone losing their humanity and sense of self, becoming driven solely by primal instincts to kill—often those they love the most—and death so often seems to be the only way to lift the curse. Or, you know, sometimes it’s about a basketball-playing teenager.</p><p>While werewolf movies may not hold quite the same cultural reverence or popularity as other paranormal entities, there are still some great examples out there that define the genre. With Leigh Whannell’s upcoming remake of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-wolfman-werewolf-universal-halloween-first-look-bad-1851641170&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-wolfman-werewolf-universal-halloween-first-look-bad-1851641170"><em>The Wolfman</em></a></span>—following his success with another Universal Studios monster movie remake, <em>The Invisible Man</em>—it feels like the perfect moment to revisit the lycanthrope canon.</p></div></div><div><p>A secluded and idyllic retirement community is rocked by deadly attacks, and it’s up to one of the residents—a blind, weather-worn veteran superbly played by Nick Damici—to lead the charge in defeating the hairy, bloodthirsty fiends. While <em>Late Phases</em> delivers plenty of gore, it lingers too much on the family drama without delivering enough scares, made worse by the special effects, which, while ambitious for a smaller indie film and admirably practical, lack realism. However, <em>Late Phases</em> does offer some thoughtful commentary on how the elderly are forgotten and neglected by society—even by their own family members.</p></div><div><p><em>Scooby-Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf</em> is a playful and family-friendly take on werewolves. The attention-grabbing title refers to Shaggy, who is turned into a werewolf by Dracula, no less, and has to reverse the curse by winning a monster road rally. It’s a funny concept because poor Shaggy is the last person that wants to have his routine of eating good snacks interrupted by becoming the type of monster he’s always scared of! I was obsessed with this movie as a kid and it still holds up today, offering a lot of clever gags and wacky shenanigans where the gang isn’t focused on solving a mystery but more on helping Shaggy break free from his hairy predicament. </p></div><div><p>The 1957 film<em> I Was a Teenage Werewolf</em> popularized the trope of the werewolf transformation as an allegory for puberty, self-discovery, and the loss of innocence during adolescence. <em>Teen Wolf</em> embraces this idea with ‘80s-style goofy antics. If you’re looking for a werewolf movie that’s less horror and more lighthearted fare, you can’t do better than <em>Teen Wolf</em>, which features the teenage lycanthrope surfing on top of a van to The Beach Boys’ “Surfin’ U.S.A.” Scott’s transformation leads him to become more popular, attract girls, and, somewhat inexplicably, excel at basketball. Thanks to Michael J. Fox’s boyish charm, the movie remains fun to watch, even as its silliness occasionally veers into stupidity.</p></div><div><p>Released the same year as the far superior <em>An American Werewolf in London</em>, <em>The Howling</em> also boasts impressive special effects, but it straddles the line between camp and horror with less finesse. Directed by <em>Gremlins</em>’ Joe Dante, this satirical take on cults and media sensationalism follows a television journalist (Dee Wallace) who, after helping the police catch a serial killer, is sent to a psychiatric retreat for recovery. Karen discovers there’s something more—and possibly supernatural—to the story. </p><p>The makeup and special effects, initially handled by Rick Baker before he left to work on <em>An American Werewolf in London</em>, were taken over by Rob Bottin. They are impressive, especially the formation of the protruding snout. However, some aspects like the bubbling in his face, enter silly territory, even with the unsettling bone cracking sounds. The constant cutting back and forth to Karen doesn’t help, either, because it takes so long for the scene to unfold that the transformation ends up being boring rather than scary. Still, <em>The Howling</em> remains an enjoyable, quintessentially ‘80s werewolf movie.</p></div><div><p>Amy Adams delivers yet another awards-worthy performance in <em>Nightbitch</em>, a feminist, quasi-werewolf film that highlights everything wrong with modern motherhood—the pressures of losing your identity, feelings of isolation, and little societal support. <em>Nightbitch</em> addresses these real-life issues with honest empathy and the supernatural elements with more absurdity. Nevertheless, it’s refreshing to see a werewolf movie that uses the metaphor in an entirely different way. The stay-at-home mom’s nightly transformations make sense because motherhood can become all about control and maintaining a perfect image, when what you really want is to release your rage and the intensity of your feelings. <em>Nightbitch </em>transforms the werewolf myth into something more contemporary and relatable—not just stories of tragic male heroes.</p></div><div><p><em>The Wolfman </em>had a lot of production problems, including a change in director, a new composer, re-shoots, budget inflation, all pushing back production schedules, and even faced cuts to reduce graphic content. But in the end, Joe Johnston’s retelling of <em>The Wolfman</em> is a Gothic thrill ride with lacerating violence and a brooding central performance from Bencio del Toro. He gives anguished layers to Lawrence Talbot, who travels to his ancestral home of Blackmoor in search for his missing brother only to become part of a supernatural family curse after being bitten by a werewolf. </p><p>While the film teeters between Rick Baker’s incredible makeup work and some shoddy CGI, the transformation and kill scenes are a thrilling mix of frightening and gory fun. The 1800s setting adds to the Gothic mystique, perfectly suited for an epic climax in aristocratic London, a time when legends and folklore were often considered closer to truth than fiction.</p></div><div><p>A podunk Utah town is shaken by a series of mysterious deaths that happen after each full moon. Writer, director, and star Jim Cummings once again proves he’s one of the best independent filmmakers out there, masterfully merging quirky dark comedy with grisly mystery and mischief. <em>The Wolf of Snow Hollow </em>is more than just a blood-soaked werewolf movie; it’s also a compelling character study, with Cummings playing a self-destructive alcoholic, and a touching father-son story, with the great Robert Forster playing his father. The film’s take on toxic masculinity is perfectly suited for a werewolf mythology about someone (mainly men) turning into the wildest version of themselves, driven by pure aggression, violence, and unbridled desire.</p></div><div><p><em>The Wolf Man</em> is a must-see classic that set the standard for werewolf cinema. The stark black-and-white cinematography, combined with forest landscapes cloaked in mist and images of fortune tellers and tarot cards, all work together to create an atmosphere of Gothic horror. Actor Lon Chaney Jr. was no stranger to monster movies, having played The Frankenstein Monster, The Mummy, and The Invisible Man, but there’s something about his portrayal of Larry Talbot-turned-Wolf Man that feels more somber. He brings to life a tortured soul unwittingly possessed by a savage creature. The makeup by Jack Pierce highlights his humanity, even in his animalistic form, which makes his curse all the more horrifying—as if he’s doomed to live in limbo, never fully belonging to either world. This also makes the tragic ending feel all the more poignant.</p></div><div><p>Female werewolves are not as common in horror, but <em>Ginger Snaps</em> is one of the few films that smartly pairs the supernatural curse with another real-life “curse” that most young women undergo: getting their first period. The story follows a pair of outcast sisters with a taste for the macabre and a desire to escape the mundanity of suburbia. After Ginger (Katharine Isabelle) is bitten by a dog, she goes through odd changes, becoming more aggressive, hypersexual, and menstruating heavily. </p><p><em>Ginger Snaps</em> skillfully interweaves themes of girlhood with lycanthropic folklore, such as questioning whether a silver navel piercing can offer a cure or seeking animalistic revenge on the cruel, bullying popular girls. With its feminist edge, <em>Ginger Snaps</em> is a sharp and wickedly funny take on teenage humiliation, not only a fierce werewolf film but also a great coming-of-age story.</p></div><div><p>There’s no other werewolf movie quite like John Landis’<em> An American Werewolf in London</em>. American tourists David and Jack (David Naughton and Griffin Dunne) are attacked by a werewolf after the locals warn them, “Beware the moon.” After Jack’s death, David is plagued by gruesome, surreal nightmares and eventually undergoes a terrifying transformation. The film brilliantly balances jet-black comedy—where ghosts tell David with a cheerful smile, “just put the gun to your forehead and pull the trigger”—with disturbing body horror. The transformation scene featuring the iconic work of makeup artist Rick Baker puts any other werewolf movie to shame. </p><p>The use of his incredible prosthetics makes the scene feel more real, tangible, and frightening. The way David lies on the floor with his newly hair-covered, animal-like hind legs twitching, and lets out a horrified screen—it is absolutely haunting. His bloodthirsty rampage across London culminates in one of the most ironic and hilarious music cue/smash cut combinations ever. <em>An American Werewolf in London</em> remains the ultimate werewolf movie—both tragic and darkly hilarious.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
