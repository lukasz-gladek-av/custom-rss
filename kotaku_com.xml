              <p>Oh great gaming gods, hear our prayer: Please may 2026 prove to be the year in which the AI bubble bursts. Amen. A rather splendid sign of at least one big-name tech company backing away from the bullshit claims comes from <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/dells-ces-2026-chat-was-the-most-pleasingly-un-ai-briefing-ive-had-in-maybe-5-years/">a <em>PC Gamer</em> interview</a> with Dell’s head of product, Kevin Terwilliger, who outright stated that consumers just don’t care about AI, and aren’t drawn in by its addition to products.</p> <p>“What we’ve learned over the course of this year,” says Terwilliger to&nbsp;<em>PCG</em>‘s Dave James, “especially from a consumer perspective, is they’re not buying based on AI. In fact I think AI probably confuses them more than it helps them understand a specific outcome.”</p>

 <p>This is not to say that Dell is backing away from AI as a feature within its tech (baby steps), but rather is just avoiding mentioning the topic during its latest raft of announcements during CES 2026. James reports that the Dell presentation from vice chairman Jeff Clarke only mentioned the near-meaningless two letters once, and in a pejorative fashion, saying “we have this un-met promise of AI.” Instead, the speech focused on new laptops and desktop computers, the challenges of tariffs, and some shiny new monitors. You know, like hardware manufacturers used to do.</p>

 <p>So when Dave James spoke to Dell’s Kevin Terwilliger, he brought up how conspicuous the topic was in its absence, given the tedious ubiquity of the subject for the last few years. “One thing you’ll notice is the message we delivered around our products was not AI-first,” Terwilliger told <em>PCG</em>. “So a bit of a shift from a year ago where we were all about the AI PC.”</p>

 <p>What strikes me most about this is not the lack of being AI-forward, but the willingness to call out that it was dumb to have been so in 2025. While he adds that “we’re very focused on delivering upon the AI capabilities of a device,” the change in emphasis feels very significant.</p>

 <p>The reality is, “AI” as a term means so many different things in so many different circumstances that it’s useless. For decades, in gaming, it was the term used to describe the programmed behavior of NPCs, until it was clumsily repurposed by companies like OpenAI, Google, and X to instead be shorthand for “generative-AI” like LLMs, the plagiarism machines that are fed all the content of the internet and then regurgitate it in slightly different, significantly less accurate forms. But when computer manufacturers use it, it’s something else all over again, software that “learns” based on experience, allowing for high-speed adjustments to ideally improve performance. In that sense, it’s somewhat more like the algorithms being used in scientific research to dramatically speed up fields like medical research, also usually just called “AI.”</p>

 <p>So hurrah to Dell for being bold enough to back away from the bullshit. May it be the first of very many, as we start to see “AI” exposed as the grift it truly has become, and hopefully a new emphasis on celebrating creativity and originality, whether it’s aided by AI-driven GPUs or not.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marshall Slashes Its On-Ear Wireless Headphones to Nearly 50% Off, Rivaling Sony Deals]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/marshall-slashes-its-on-ear-wireless-headphones-to-nearly-50-off-rivaling-sony-deals-2000657681</link>
            <guid>1399504</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Marshall makes some of the best audio gear on the market. If you want to hear bold, rich sound with deeper bass on the go, we recommend checking the Marshall Major V on-ear headphones out.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3934/">These typically sit at $170, but you can grab a pair for just $90 at Amazon today, after the retailer took 47% off the usual price</a>. This offer applies to the black color option. Other models are discounted, too. For instance, the brown and cream versions are sitting at $87. The blue option, on the other hand, is going for $100.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3934/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Durable Design, Bold Sound</h2>
<p>Major V headphones feature a rugged design that’s durable and made to handle everyday wear and tear quite well. The pair folds down for compact storage, making it easy to carry these around with you. When not in use, fold the headphones down, toss them into a bag, and get going!</p>
<p>You’ll enjoy the classic Marshall sound for all your favorite tracks. Expect thunderous bass, smooth mids, and crisp treble that bring music to life. Whether you’re listening to a podcast, streaming a show, or just vibing to an energy-filled song, audio comes through with exceptional clarity, with tunes felt deep into your bones. Even better, the audio doesn’t distort when you pump the volume all the way up, which is great for when you really want to immerse yourself in a track.</p>



<p>Getting started couldn’t be simpler. All you need to do is push and hold the control knob on the headphone until the LED turns to a slow blue pulse. Enable Bluetooth on your phone and select Major V from the list of available Bluetooth devices. Once the devices have been paired, download the Marshall Bluetooth app and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the setup. There’s a customizable M-button on one of the earcups, which can be used to access custom actions. By default, the button action is Spotify Tap, but you can tweak it to something else using the Marshall app. For instance, you can use it to launch EQ settings on the app or enable a voice assistant for hands-free management.</p>
<p>Battery life is exceptional and better than most other options in the same range. A single charge gets you up to 100 hours of playback, which is more than enough to go an entire week without running low! When it comes to recharging, the headphones support wired and wireless options. For wireless charging, you can place the right ear cup flat down on a compatible charging pad. When the LED light turns on, it indicates that the headphones are successfully being charged. It takes around 3 hours to fully recharge the pair.</p>
<p>Just note that Major V headphones aren’t water resistant, so we won’t recommend taking them to the pool or in the shower. If this isn’t a dealbreaker for you, now is a great time to pick the pair up without paying the full price. These deliver superior sound that helps you enjoy your favorite music to the fullest. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3934/">Act fast, though, as we’re expecting the discount to wrap up soon. Multiple color options are discounted, so you can pick the version that fits your aesthetics the best.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/against-mac-mini-deal-this-mini-gaming-pc-drops-below-black-friday-pricing-intel-core-i9-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-2000657686</link>
            <guid>1399450</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Not a fan of big, bulky PCs taking over your workstation? You might want to consider investing in a mini PC. These options pack significant power in a compact frame and are easy to carry around on the go.</p>
<p>The market is filled with options, but if you’re after something muscular that can handle both regular work and some resource-intensive projects with ease, the mini gaming PC by Acemagician is worth a look, especially at its current price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6688/">Amazon has now dropped the model by 30%, offering it for just $599, down from $856.</a> You’re saving a whopping $257 on a powerful option that comes with Windows 11 Pro pre-installed. Delivery is free, too, which sweetens the offer even more!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6688/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Incredible Performance, Spacious Storage</h2>
<p>This PC runs on the efficient Intel Core i9 13900HK processor, which features 14 cores (6 P-cores + 8 E-cores) with 20 threads, and turbo boosts up to 5.4GHz. It’s built on Intel 7 process technology with 24MB Smart Cache and 54W TDP to deliver speedy, reliable performance for all your tasks, whether you’re working on an office project or trying to get creative with a personal assignment. The processor outperforms options like i9 12900HK, 7840HS, and 6800H in overall performance, too. You can rely on it for content creation, 4K editing, business workloads, studies, and even gaming.</p>
<p>There’s a massive 32GB DDR4 RAM to keep things snappy as you push through productive days. It’s more than enough to help you multitask like a pro with ease. Think juggling multiple applications at the same time, hopping through a ton of tabs on a couple of different browsers, taking back-to-back video calls, and streaming while gaming – all this without experiencing noticeable slowdowns. Storage capacity is just as impressive, thanks to a 1TB PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD. It’s roomy enough to house all your multimedia files (photos, videos, movies), work documents, research papers, important programs, and more. Best of all, both the memory and storage are expandable up to 64GB RAM and 4TB, respectively. This means you can always upgrade the system as your needs grow, without relying on external solutions.</p>



<p>All these specs also make this mini PC great for playing your favorite games. While it won’t offer the performance of a full-fledged gaming PC, it’s more than capable of running titles like Fortnite, League of Legends, and Valorant on medium settings. Those who prefer a larger, more productive work/play setup will appreciate how it can support up to three displays at the same time. Other connectivity options include WiFi 6E, Bluetooth 5.2, and a 2.5GbE LAN port. Additionally, USB4 ports take the performance even further by offering up to 40Gbps transfer speeds. For reference, it can easily move a 3GB 4K video in just 1 second – quite literally.</p>
<p>Despite all this power, the mini PC stays fairly quiet while working. It comes with an advanced dual fan that ensures quiet and efficient operation, regardless of the task at hand. The PC itself is quite compact and can even be mounted at the back of a monitor for a cleaner setup. Windows 11 Pro comes pre-installed, too, so you can get started with using the device right away.</p>
<p>To wrap it up, if you’ve been looking to give your desktop setup a refresh, now is a great time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6688/">This efficient PC is now available for less than $600, and is sure to make both work and play a lot more enjoyable.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokémon’s Promo Card For Its Natural History Museum Collab Could Scare Off Scalpers]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-natural-history-museum-pikachu-card-scalper-2000657713</link>
            <guid>1399387</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>After the destructive shitstorm that happened when </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-van-gogh-museum-scalpers-pikachu-card-1850882131"><span>collaborated with Amsterdam’s Van Gogh Museum</span></a><span> in 2023, I’m surprised any esteemed establishment wants to partner with Pikachu and friends. Videos of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>scalpers pulling a Black Friday-level raid</span></a><span> on the museum’s store are still lodged in my brain, and when I heard the Natural History Museum in London was going to have a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>exhibit later this month, I started bracing myself for a repeat. It may still happen, but now that The Pokémon Company and the museum have </span><a href="https://www.pokemon.com/uk/pokemon-news/pokemon-natural-history-presents-pokecology"><span>announced the card</span></a><span> they’ll be giving out at the event, some fans are </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonTCG/comments/1q6bqwn/new_natural_history_museum_promo_for_the/"><span>letting out a sigh of optimistic relief</span></a><span> that scalpers might leave the whole thing alone.</span></p> <p><span>The “Pikachu at the Museum” promo card is super cute, and shows the little yellow guy excitedly walking through a museum adorned with what look like fossils of Aerodactyl and Tyrantrum. At a glance, it doesn’t look like a great card for competitive play, with reasonably low stats and good but not great damage output for the amount of energy cards you’ll have to feed into it, but none of that actually matters because this card won’t be used in a deck. It’s a jumbo card, not suitable for use in a playable deck or, perhaps more notably, for placement into a collector’s binder.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000657715" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000657715"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000657715">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This is significant because jumbo cards tend to go under scalpers’ radars, specifically because they’re often harder to sell. Though its rarity may still bring in vultures, fans are hopeful this choice will take the wind out of resellers’ sails. On top of this, the card will be available at select UK retailers on January 30, so if scalpers want it that badly, they might have better luck bothering a store than a museum.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I love how their scalping prevention is ‘let’s make it a jumbo, nobody cares about jumbos,’” ZVAARI wrote on Reddit. “Hope someone makes a nice normal sized reproduction of it, the art is cool and I’d like to have it in my binder.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Its both a shame it’s oversized (won’t fit in my collection nicely), but also will hopefully prevent too much hype,” PlopTheOwl wrote in the same thread. “Love the art. Would have liked it to be a full art, but honestly so pleased to see some Pokémon bones like in-game Pokémon museums.”</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000657714" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000657714"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000657714">© The Pok<span>émon Company</span></figcaption></figure> <p><span>After this announcement, I’m more concerned the collab’s exclusive merchandise might be targeted by scalpers, rather than the card itself. The museum will also be selling an exclusive collection of art, stationery, clothes, collectibles, and a Pikachu plush showing him hugging a miniature museum. These will also be sold online at the UK Pokémon Center shop and the museum’s online store. If nothing else, it seems the museum and Pokémon Company are trying to avoid a second Van Gogh debacle, but we’ll see if these safeguards actually amount to anything, as scalpers still find a way to ruin anything with Pikachu’s face on it. If nothing else, I hope the fans who show up to see the exhibit are able to have a good time without being trampled by someone looking to flip the merchandise.</span></p>

 <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>x Natural History Museum event will last from January 26 to April 19.</span></p>
