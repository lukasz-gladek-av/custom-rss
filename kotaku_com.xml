These islands, represented by a treasure chest on the map, offer on-the-ground combat against various criminals and unknown pirates, usually a boss and mini-boss along the way, and then a treasure chest at the very end. If you make it that far, opening up said chest will often grant you a ring or other lore item, the former of which you can wear to boost your abilities, along with resources to sell and money.</p><figure id="" data-id="2271ae2d24db7f5d30dffe7ffff60087" data-recommend-id="image://2271ae2d24db7f5d30dffe7ffff60087" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The treasure chest description in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The treasure chest description in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2271ae2d24db7f5d30dffe7ffff60087" data-recommend-id="image://2271ae2d24db7f5d30dffe7ffff60087" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The treasure chest description in Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Lastly, if you need a few dollars, roam landmasses to encounter random groups of enemies, most of which drop a handful of cash upon defeat.
