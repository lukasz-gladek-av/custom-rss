              <p>The WD Black 1TB C50 Xbox Storage Expansion Card provides 1 full terabyte of additional storage for the Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S, with the same speeds as the internal SSD. The C50 expansion card is a compact NVMe solid-state drive that fits into the dedicated expansion card slot at the rear of the console. It is compatible with Xbox Velocity Architecture, so the majority of your games will launch quickly and remain available via Quick Resume. The small black housing of the C50 is designed to match the console’s rear and provide a clean, clutter-free appearance when inserted into the expansion slot and secured by clicking into place.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6785/">You can find the WD Black 1TB C50 Xbox Storage Expansion Card currently for sale at Amazon.com for $150, down from the original price of $200, a savings of $50 and 25%.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6785/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A reliable expansion card for your Xbox console</h2>
<p>Because it has been certified by Microsoft for use with their latest generation of consoles and utilizes the expansion port of the console, the C50 allows you to store and run your most recent generation games directly from the card at the same speeds they would be accessed from the internal SSD. Quick Resume also functions as expected, so you can continue to switch between paused and resumed games, even when the storage limits of the internal SSD have been reached. Unlike external USB-based storage devices that only let you archive your Xbox Series X/S titles, the WD Black C50 enables you to install your titles directly to the card and play them just like they were on the internal SSD.</p>
<p>Installing the WD Black C50 is easy and requires no complicated steps. Power down the console, then slide the card into the identified expansion port at the back of the console. Securely insert the card by pressing firmly into place until you hear it click securely into the port. Once the console is powered back on, it will automatically recognize the card and present the new storage capacity to the user for selection and installation of their desired titles.</p>



<p>The WD Black C50 is compact and industrial-looking, and is designed to fit seamlessly into the console’s design rather than appear as an external device attached via a USB port. Additionally, the size and lightweight nature of the WD Black C50 make it unobtrusive regardless of whether the console is positioned vertically or horizontally in a home entertainment system. Included with the WD Black C50 are the card itself, a protective cover for the card, and a short, easy-to-follow guide that outlines basic installation procedures.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6785/">At a discounted price of $150, versus the original MSRP of $200,</a> the WD Black C50 provides plug-in storage capacity that operates at console-level speeds, allowing users to retain additional titles on their Xbox Series X/S consoles without degrading performance.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/razer-kishi-ultra-gaming-controller-is-almost-50-off-mobile-gaming-can-feel-way-better-for-much-less-2000661027</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Little cousins love to ask the question, “What games you got on your phone?” Not too long ago, the answer to that question would be a humble response. <em>Flappybird</em>, some <em>Tetris</em> ripoff, maybe <em>Words With Friends</em>. Or even that one app that makes it look like you’re drinking a beer, though that technically isn’t even a game.</p>
<p>But now? The answer to that same question in 2026? EVERYTHING. The App Store is full of real games now. <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Minecraft</em>, and<em> Roblox</em>—of course—all can be downloaded and played right from your phone. And with cloud gaming available with services like Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PS Remote Play, that list of games you can play grows exponentially. Though, many of these games are far better when experienced with a controller than with a touchscreen. So come bring your phone’s interface up onto the level of the games it can now play.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6784/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The Razer Kishi ultra gaming controller is exactly what your need, bringing you the ergonomics of an actual gamepad for when your gaming on your phone. Right now, Amazon happens to have the controller add-on for a massive discount. Normally set at $150, the price has been cut to nearly half. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6784/">A limited time Amazon deal has the controller discounted by a staggering 47%, meaning you end up only having to pay $80 to completely elevate your mobile gaming.</a></p>

<h2>Pro Grade Console Controls on Mobile</h2>
<p>All you do is just slot your phone or tablet in between the two sides of the controller and presto. You have yourself a gaming handheld, evoking the design of the Nintendo Switch or a Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The controller connects to your mobile device over USB-C. So if you’re still holding onto that old iPhone 15 or even earlier model, you best upgrade before purchasing this because it is not compatible with the discontinued Lightning port. Android users need not worry. And since it’s plug in, no need to worry about any latency.</p>



<p>The construction of the Razer Kishi is solid. The controller is equipped with a Mecha-tactile eight-way d-pad and action buttons, Hall Effect triggers, programmable buttons, and ultra durable TPSiV analog sticks. It even supports haptic vibrations.</p>
<p>The controller isn’t limited to mobile gaming. You can even plug it in over USB-C to a PC to use it like any other PC gaming controller. It’s a little funky looking without a phone or tablet stuck in the middle, and you might prefer a different controller for PC gaming. However, if you’re traveling and trying to pack light, you can use just the one controller for both mobile gaming and gaming on your laptop which is pretty rad.</p>

              <p>Valentine’s Day is less than a month away, and it’s the perfect excuse to tell your partner how much they mean to you. A thoughtful gift can, of course, sweeten that expression, and if you’re after something beyond flowers or chocolates – something that lets you both spend quality time together – the LEGO Art Love collectible building set deserves your attention.</p>
<p>You can create your own small version of Robert Indiana’s famous LOVE sculpture with this one, that too without paying the full price right now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6783/">It’s currently available at Amazon for just $64, down from $80, after the retailer slashed the price by 20%.</a> But as you’d expect, the offer is selling out fast. Hurry to pick one up, before it’s too late!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6783/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fun Weekend Activity</h2>
<p>This set comes with 791 pieces in total, and is based on the famous real-life sculpture with a similar design and colors (red, blue, and green). Less than 800 pieces means it won’t really be one of those massive building projects that take weeks to complete. It can be a fun weekend activity with your loved one, where you guys bond over the experience. You can take turns following the steps, or each focus on one letter, as the set comes with two building instructions. Prepare some hot chocolate, pull out a list of thoughtful questions, and get started with the thing. Before you know it, you won’t even realize how long it’s been since you last picked up your phone.</p>



<p>You can even gift it to a friend to appreciate their presence in your life, or a parent who enjoys creative activities. Once built, the model measures over 10 inches (25 cm) high, 10 inches (25 cm) wide, and 2.5 inches (6 cm) deep. It can be a great display piece anywhere you like; place it on a shelf in the living room, the dining area, or even your office to add some personality to it. The model is sure to turn some heads!</p>
<p>Getting started is straightforward. The included instruction books take you through each step of the process one-by-one. The booklets are quite easy to follow, but you can also download the LEGO Builder app for 3D instructions. The app offers zoom and rotate features that make it easy to view each block from every side.</p>
<p>The LEGO Art range features more such brick-built artworks that let you create iconic pieces and pop-culture figures. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6783/">We’re spotting quite a few sets at a discounted rate, which makes now a great time to grab the ones you’ve been eyeing for a long time.</a> As for the current discount, we’re expecting it to wrap soon. It’s best to act quickly to score the drop.</p>
