              <p><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ series finale continues to be a lightning rod for controversy. While plenty of people were fine with how the Netflix horror series wrapped up after a decade, there’s a loud subset of fans who are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663"><span>taking to the digital streets</span></a><span> to tear it down, say awful things about the people who worked on it, and declare it the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><span>next </span><i><span>Game of Thrones</span></i><span>-level failure</span></a><span>. Another fraction of that group, however, is holding onto a bizarre sliver of hope with the belief that perhaps the disappointing conclusion is not all it seems. The movement, which is calling itself Conformity Gate, has gathered “evidence” indicating that the events depicted in the finale are actually an illusion and that there is still a battle left to fight, which will play out in a secret episode that’s not available on Netflix right now.</span></p>  <p><span>Obviously, we’ll be discussing the fifth season of </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> here, so if you want to stay spoiler free, you should leave now. (Really, you probably shouldn’t have opened this article to begin with.) But the tl;dr of the theory is that the sterile and rushed nature of the finale is an intentional creative choice meant to reflect that it takes place in a distorted reality created by Vecna and everyone in the show is “conforming” to it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Admittedly, I fully planned to just roll my eyes at all this pretty wild speculation because I lived through the </span><i><span>Mass Effect 3 </span></i><span>ending controversy and the Indoctrination Theory, which fans believed explained that game’s finale as a hallucination but was really just a way for them to cope with not liking the way things turned out. But, I don’t know, there’s </span><i><span>some </span></i><span>compelling evidence in the theory, both based on what’s in the show and on how Netflix and show creators the Duffer Brothers have talked about it since.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Many of these details are subtle, such as the way that characters sit during the graduation scene resembling how villain Vecna sits at other points in the series, whereas others seem to be pretty overt, like Max calling out Mike’s </span><i><span>D&amp;D </span></i><span>epilogue for being too comforting, as if something is off. Here’s one of the quicker rundowns I could find, by @meechski on TikTok, but you can also find </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWAQbdjjaJk&amp;pp=ygUfY29uZm9ybWl0eSBnYXRlIHN0cmFuZ2VyIHRoaW5ncw%3D%3D"><span>much lengthier breakdowns on YouTube</span></a><span>.</span></p>

   <p><span>Also, as someone in the comments of that video points out, if you search “conformity gate” or “fake ending” on Netflix, </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>is the only search result for the latter, and one of two for the former alongside </span><i><span>Emily in Paris</span></i><span>. Make of that what you will.</span></p>

 <p><span>I don’t know that any one thing made me a full-blown believer, but taken all together, it was enough for me to at least become interested in seeing if it actually pans out. Conspiracy theories usually have at least </span><i><span>some</span></i><span> shred of plausibility that allows them to gain some traction, but they also tend to be made up of a lot of square pegs shoved into round holes. All these pieces of evidence could just be coincidences born of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-5-bad-dialogue-clips-video-will-mike-2000651378"><span>bad writing</span></a><span> and desperation.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">guys… notice how all of them are reading WHITE scripts when shawn levy confirmed the finale was printed on RED scripts… they are trying to confuse us with that trailer. i AM sure <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/confirmitygate?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#confirmitygate</a> <a href="https://t.co/Pje0LF13dm">pic.twitter.com/Pje0LF13dm</a></p> <p>— ʅǝɯ | ੈ✩‧₊˚ (@melinastapes) <a href="https://twitter.com/melinastapes/status/2008186236830421086?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Luckily, we won’t really have to wait long for these hopes to be shattered, as the entire theory hinges on this hypothetical secret finale premiering on January 7, when Netflix is </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfaW74zJlmk"><span>planning to announce something about its 2026 programming</span></a><span>. Of course, I don’t want any </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fans to have to suffer a worse ending than the one they’d hoped for, but after witnessing the behavior of some members of the community in the wake of a disappointing finale, I’m also wondering if those who have said some truly heinous things about the people who worked on this show even deserve a better ending.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hytale-vampire-survivors-mod-early-access-steam-minecraft-2000656708</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Hypixel Studios, developer of the </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>-inspired survival game </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>, has shown the sandbox game’s modding capabilities with a </span><i><span>Vampire Survivors-</span></i><span>like prototype that has fans excited ahead of the game’s Early Access launch later this month. In a </span><a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2007888131350212658"><span>social media post</span></a><span> over the weekend, Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme shared a 40-second gameplay clip showcasing a character fending off voxel-based hordes of enemies in a top-down view arena.</span></p> <p><span>According to Collins-Laflamme, the video shows a </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span> mod created by a team member in their spare time, and it’s intended as a proof-of-concept demo for “how different genres” could be realized within the game by fans and modders.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The following video showcases a server-side Hytale mod created by a Hytale team member in their spare time. It’s intended purely as inspiration for how different genres could be realized within Hytale! </p> <p>The gameplay shown represents only a small subset of our modding… <a href="https://t.co/YaszQv9kDb">pic.twitter.com/YaszQv9kDb</a></p> <p>— Simon (@Simon_Hypixel) <a href="https://twitter.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2007888131350212658?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>“The gameplay shown represents only a small subset of our modding capabilities and was used to build a simple, survivor-like experience,” Collins-Laflamme wrote. While the mod is not planned for release as part of the game, Hypixel “may publish it – or similar examples – as reference material for the community.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The video comes less than two months after Hypixel </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-hypixel-riot-canceled-revived-gameplay-minecraft-2000645466"><span>reacquired the rights</span></a><span> to</span><i><span> Hytale </span></i><span>from </span><i><span>League of Legends</span></i><span> maker Riot Games, which had previously canceled the project in June of last year. The team released a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-riot-price-low-minecraft-hypixel-2000646230"><span>16-minute gameplay trailer shortly afterwards</span></a><span>, but the latest clip is focused on </span><i><span>Hytale’s</span></i><span> potential to be a springboard for user-generated content like the Mojang hit that inspired it.</span></p>

 <h2>Hytale is gearing up for Early Access</h2> <p><span>“My prediction is, it will do very well initially and then it will slow down until the modders / servers and us start to release some major content and then it will keep growing for years to come. Especially as we add more modding tools and options,” Collins-Laflamme </span><a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2006936928026026273"><span>wrote on X</span></a><span>, responding to a user who suggested that </span><i><span>Hytale’s</span></i><span> release “will probably be something huge.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The reply came from a larger thread in which the co-founder expressed feeling “anger” as the studio gets closer to the early access launch of this new version of </span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>, which is slated for January 13. According to Collins-Laflamme, that’s due to pouring four years of engineering into rebuilding the game’s engine rather than working on gameplay features. In his eyes, that leaves the team with a “four-year gap and a lot of catching up to do,” alongside a rebuilt engine that is “never gonna be used.”</span></p>

 <p><span>As previously </span><a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/12/hytale-s-1st-faq"><span>stated by the developer in a FAQ</span></a><span>, the sandbox won’t be available on Steam at launch in order to focus on its existing community. That’s to avoid chasing “a flood of cold first impressions that could overcorrect the game’s direction.” Hypixel explained that while it doesn’t shy away from “honest, negative criticism,” the team is more interested in feedback from players who are already familiar with the game’s development background.</span></p>

 <p><span>Most importantly, the FAQ notes that Steam “currently doesn’t support” some of </span><i><span>Hytale’s</span></i><span> modding features, and that the developer “will be in contact with Valve in the near future” to try and fix that. Otherwise it might be a while before Steam users get to recreate the platform’s latest hits inside</span><i><span> Hytale</span></i><span>. </span></p>

              <p>The rising cost of PC parts is getting so bad that Nvidia is reportedly going to start making RTX 3060s again, so people have something to buy in the future while all the new shiny tech gets consumed by the AI industry.</p> <p>You’ve likely already noticed that in 2025, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-10-biggest-gaming-disappointments-worst-news-game-key-cards-gta-6-delay-2000655356#:~:text=Playing%20Video%20Games%20Is%20Becoming%20A%20Very%20Expensive%20Hobby">it became more expensive to build or upgrade a PC</a>. Thanks to hyperscalers and <a href="https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448">AI-focused tech companies gobbling up PC parts to build datacenters</a>, it’s becoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803">quite pricey and challenging</a> for your average person to buy PC RAM and graphics cards. Even the prices on prebuilt PCs from companies like HP, Dell, and Asus will increase by 15 to 20 percent, <a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3021660/computer-prices-could-go-up-by-20-due-to-ram-shortage-pc-makers-warn.html">according to <em>PC World.</em></a> Not great! This will also lead to PC handhelds getting more expensive, and experts expect consoles will undergo price increases too, thanks to growing demand for specific parts.&nbsp; And Nvidia, a company that is making billions from all of this, has a solution to provide PC players with a somewhat affordable GPU in 2026: Start making and selling its old RTX 3060 again.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">01.05update<br>rtx3060  Q1 come back… 🥲</p> <p>— hongxing2020 (@hongxing2020) <a href="https://twitter.com/hongxing2020/status/2008043115308065078?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>As recently reported by reliable Nvidia leaker Hongxing2020 and spotted by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-to-bring-back-geforce-rtx-3060-q1-2026-tackle-memory-shortages/"><em>Wccftech</em></a>, Nvidia is seemingly planning to restart production on the RTX 3060 in Q1 of this year. The card first launched in 2021 and is still one of the most popular gaming GPUs around, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/">according to data from Steam</a>.</p>

 <p>In 2024, Nvidia began retiring the card as it moved on to the 40 and 50 series of GPUs. However, due to DRAM being rapidly consumed for data centers, it has become harder and more expensive to procure the GDDR7 needed to produce the newer, more powerful RTX 5060. (Sidenote: <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-enshittifinancial-crisis/#the-upcoming-data-center-disaster:~:text=Now%2C%20you%E2%80%99ve%20probably,generation%20of%20GPUs.">Basically, every datacenter built or being built will be out of date in the near future, meaning the billions invested in them will be basically a waste!</a>)</p>

 <p>So it seems like the plan is for Nvidia to start producing 3060s again, using cheaper, easier-to-acquire components that aren’t top of the line and therefore aren’t being sought after by AI tech giants for their massive datacenters. If that is the case, hopefully Nvidia at least prices the new 3060s at $200 or less, as the only market for these cards will be gamers looking to upgrade a PC from an older GPU to something (somewhat) modern. But greed is a nasty thing and has infected all tech companies, including Nvidia, so I wouldn’t hold my breath on a sub-$200 price point despite the 3060 entering its fifth year in 2026.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sandfall-interactive-sequel-2000656692</link>

              <p><span>One advantage </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a> <span>had when it launched last year was that the RPG was unburdened by expectations out the gate. Sandfall Interactive was a new developer with a lot of industry talent on its roster, but it wasn’t yet a storied studio with a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-12-best-video-games-of-2025-2000656161"><span>Game of the Year-winning debut</span></a><span> to live up to. Now that it is, however, folks at the studio claim it won’t just be aiming to meet fan expectations with its next project.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><i><span>Edge</span></i><span> (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-devs-next-game-will-simply-focus-on-what-we-think-is-cool-ive-seen-too-many-tv-shows-and-books-be-swayed-trying-to-please-a-lot-of-people/"><i><span>GamesRadar+</span></i></a><span>), </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-ending-choice-canon-correct-2000633292"><span>lead writer Jennifer Svedberg-Yen</span></a><span> expressed that while she is “”a bit of a people pleaser” and is cognizant of fan expectations, Sandfall Interactive’s mostly concerned with their own interests rather than catering to fandom whims.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Creatively, we’ve always let our North Star be our own personal taste in terms of what we think is cool, what it is we enjoy and want to see,” she said. “I’ve seen too many TV shows and books be swayed trying to please a lot of people, and in the process you end up losing the heart of what’s there. So [we] feel like we need to trust our instincts and continue to trust the vision behind the studio.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Sandfall has been upfront about wanting to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sequel-sandfall-interactive-2000620688"><span>make another </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>game</span></a><span>, and fans are already clamoring for it to explore some of </span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span>’s unsolved mysteries, especially regarding </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1kffyby/painters_vs_writers/"><span>some of the major reveals in the RPG’s third act</span></a><span>. But it sounds like the stuff that fans are latching onto isn’t going to guide Sandfall’s creative decisions, so it’s possible the next game may be about something entirely different. It’ll be exciting to see what the studio comes up with, even if it’s not exactly what we’re hoping for. You already know they’re capable of making something great, so why not stay open to what it wants to do next?</span></p>
