To mark 15 years since PS Plus launched, Sony is also wrapping up June with some special deals for subscribers, as well as new perks like an extended free trial of<em> Monster Hunter Wilds </em>for Premium members.</p><p>PS Plus has had some decent months this year, which might be why a price hike feels like it’s coming just over the horizon. PlayStation CEO Hideaki Nishino recently remarked that players kept signing up for more expensive tiers even after the last round of increases. “The PlayStation Plus service offers great value for our players, and we will continue to add more value and adjust our pricing strategy in a dynamic way to maximize profitability,” he <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marathon-concord-sony-live-service-ps5-hermen-hulst-1851784483&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-concord-sony-live-service-ps5-hermen-hulst-1851784483">told investors earlier this month</a></span>. </p><p>Ever wonder what the most popular games on the service are?

They are mostly single-player games, including four first-party Sony blockbusters: <em>God of War Ragnarök</em>, <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, <em>Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em>, and <em>The Last of Us Part I</em>. Others include <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> and<em> Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em>, alongside no-brainers like<em> Grand Theft Auto V</em>. Less obvious top-performers are <em>Dead by Daylight</em>, <em>Tom Clancy’s Rainbow Six Siege</em>, and <em>UFC 5</em>. </p><p>PlayStation’s global services VP Nick Maguire told <em>Game File </em>the company remains committed to bringing its big first-party games to PS Plus no earlier than 18 to 24 months after they comes out. Instead, it’s been wooing subscribers to upgrade to the priciest tier with PS1 and PS2 classics, while streaming for PS3 games has been rarer. “Through streaming, we’ll still continue to look at those ones,” he said. “We haven’t ruled them out. The opportunities are there. But there are a lot of PS3 games already streaming.”</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-2025-diablo-4-kof-15-price-monster-hunter-wilds-1851785063]]></content:encoded>

While the game notes that it’s still weak against poison, it seemingly has much less of an effect this time around. Whereas the normal version would double over and spill poison on the ground after being hit enough times with a poison weapon and leaving itself momentarily vulnerable, the ES version just doesn’t do that. However, poison can briefly stun it at times.</p><p>ES Adel is much more aggressive and doesn’t let up. In this case, just equip the strongest weapons you have and pray for the best. Building up lightning resistance is helpful as well since a majority of its attacks contain that element. One of its attacks also can inflict Bleed, so bleed resistance is useful too. So during your runs, equip Relics that have these attributes, or find items that have them during your run.</p><h2 id="h3019"><a id=""></a>Fighting Everdark Sovereign Adel</h2><p>The differences between normal Adel and ES Adel are immediately apparent when the fight begins. Here, ES Adel will begin every single fight by launching from the ground and dive bombing you, creating a fissure of lightning that’ll explode. To dodge this, move out of the fissures way and avoid the glowing lightning parts.</p><figure id="" data-id="e284d2fa5b8ca924c6b0ca9512c83de6" data-recommend-id="image://e284d2fa5b8ca924c6b0ca9512c83de6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1711" data-height="959" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player character runs from a lightning storm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player character runs from a lightning storm." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e284d2fa5b8ca924c6b0ca9512c83de6" data-recommend-id="image://e284d2fa5b8ca924c6b0ca9512c83de6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1711" data-height="959" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player character runs from a lightning storm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When the battlefield starts glowing purple, Adel will fire off an AOE attack that hits everything surrounding it. Fortunately, this attack has a long wind up time and limited reach. The best way to avoid this attack is to simply run away from Adel.</p><p>Adel will also sometimes attempt to scoop you up with its jaws. If successful, both of you will be temporarily immobilized as it’ll be busy chomping down, inflicting bleed damage. This is an opportunity for your other teammates to do additional damage while it’s distracted. However, you can button mash your way if you unfortunately get caught. While you’ll still take considerable damage, that’s still better than taking the full brunt of the attack and your bleed meter won’t fill up completely, letting you escape without being inflicted with the blood loss status.</p><figure id="" data-id="581ea1d3b36636f75e09a00ec03836a8" data-recommend-id="image://581ea1d3b36636f75e09a00ec03836a8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player character races towards the boss." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player character races towards the boss." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="581ea1d3b36636f75e09a00ec03836a8" data-recommend-id="image://581ea1d3b36636f75e09a00ec03836a8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player character races towards the boss." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Last but certainly not least, ES Adel’s new most dangerous attack is that it’ll whip up a giant tornado and retreat into it. A bunch of Spiristreams will spawn around the large one. <strong>You must use one of the Spiritstreams to jump into the big one.</strong> There will be a button prompt to propel yourself upwards. <strong>You’ll take constant damage as long as you continue to stay outside the big tornado, so go inside of it ASAP.</strong></p><p>Once inside the big tornado, the battle carries on as usual, except that you have a much smaller battlefield to work with. Eventually, the tornado will subside and you’ll be able to have more room to move around again. Adel will do this attack 2-3 times during the fight.</p><figure id="" data-id="c70d59a00c3281e41ce50c41572005cc" data-recommend-id="image://c70d59a00c3281e41ce50c41572005cc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1078" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player character takes on a bleeding status during a boss fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player character takes on a bleeding status during a boss fight." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c70d59a00c3281e41ce50c41572005cc" data-recommend-id="image://c70d59a00c3281e41ce50c41572005cc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1078" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player character takes on a bleeding status during a boss fight." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When defeating these Everdark Sovereigns, you’ll earn Sovereign Sigils, which can be exchanged for special Relics and other rewards at the new Collector’s Signboard shop near the Roundtable hub.</p><hr><p>Elden Ring Nightreign is now available forPS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-nightreign-everdark-sovereign-adel-baron-1851785048]]></content:encoded>
