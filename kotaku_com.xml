              <p>Games don’t shut up anymore. At least most of the big-budget ones. There are potentially lots of reasons for that but it mostly sucks. Not sure what I’m talking about? Look no farther than this Unreal Engine 5 fan render of what a gritty Mario game might look like that’s going viral again thanks to a perfect set of new voiceovers.</p> <p>It’s actually broken up into two videos. The first was shared earlier this month on Instagram on by voice actor and cosplayer ryanstewartvo. It shows Mario navigating a dark, linear jungle environment at night with question blocks, Goombas, and green warp pipes. “A mushroom…I should take a look at that,” he says to no one in particular. He follows it up with other cringe dialogue barks like “A coin…this could be useful” and “maybe I should go this way.”</p>

 <p>It’s a perfect send-up of the type of hand-holdy presentation that’s become all too common in some AAA games.</p>   <p>The quotes ryanstewartvo voices were actually taken from the comments section for the original fan render video that was uploaded to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCVubOzbFzI">YouTube back in 2022 by Funkyzeit Games</a>. That, too, was meant to be a joke, but didn’t include any voice acting. It just used ultra-violent animations to convey gritty seriousness, another unfortunate tic of many modern blockbusters. Still, viewers could practically hear the Joss-Whedon-esque MCU banter just waiting to fill the silence.</p>

 <p>“This is a satire,” Funkyzeit Games wrote at the time. “It’s obviously an over-the-top alternate version of Mario that isn’t supposed to lecture you about what Mario game should be instead. I get that the ‘remake of X in UE’ and ‘HIRE THIS MAN’ have become a meme and you are free to joke about it (this video does to some extent), just don’t be the person that takes the video with Goomba blood-explosions too seriously.”</p>   <p>The new voice acting adds a fresh layer of parody that sends the whole thing over the edge, though. The first dub was so popular that ryanstewartvo ended up uploading a second one with fellow <a href="https://www.instagram.com/arielhckva/?utm_source=ig_embed">voice actor Ariel Hack</a> playing the role of Princess Peach, who chats with Mario over a comms signal.</p>

 <p>“A monarch’s job is never done,” she quips. “But we can talk more later. Bowser’s Castle should be just up ahead.” Mario responds, “I thought I smelt something burning…” Peach cuts him off. “Focus, M. Bowser’s got the Power Stars, and you&nbsp;<em>know</em> what that means,” she continues. It is pitch perfect in every way, including when she hints at giving him upgrades if he brings back enough red coins.</p>

 <p>All of this is of a piece with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-director-says-there-are-times-when-yellow-paint-is-definitely-needed-2000639876">backlash against yellow paint</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-previews-trailer-ncps-companion-2000644368">chatty NPC companions</a>. They can both serve important functions, but their pervasiveness has gotten to the point that players often feel like they’re just Band-Aids for hard-to-solve design challenges. Instead of implementing better workarounds, whether because of budget constrains, time issues, or other production limitations, the games saddle fans with absurd video game-isms that break immersion or make the experience more annoying.</p> <p>All that said, I would definitely play the full version of this <em>Mario</em> fan game.</p>
