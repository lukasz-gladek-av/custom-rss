              <p><span>After a week of viral clips and outrage from anime fans and AI-haters alike, Amazon has taken down the AI-generated English dub for </span><i><span>Banana Fish</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The embarrassingly bad dub of the action-packed yaoi was a first for Amazon and was labeled as an “AI Beta” in the series’ language options. Instead of hiring voice actors with all of Jeff Bezos’ fuck you money, Amazon uploaded an AI voice track that is monotone, weirdly mixed, and makes even the most exciting scenes sound like a boring text-to-speech demonstration. Anime is known for its dynamic voice performances, and this shit sounds like it barely gets above a whisper. Here’s a clip, and sorry for putting it somewhere you can hear it:</span></p> <div><blockquote cite="https://www.tiktok.com/@animedomainx/video/7577995965458648328" data-video-id="7577995965458648328" data-embed-from="oembed"> <section> <a target="_blank" title="@animedomainx" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@animedomainx?refer=embed">@animedomainx</a>  <p>This is Back ngl 🥀 Amazon has started using Al to dub shows, and the first anime to receive an English Al dub is Banana Fish. Many voice actors are speaking out against Amazon’s decision, criticizing the use of Al and the fact that human voice actors were not compensated. Banana Fish is an action-packed crime thriller that follows a young, intelligent gang leader named Ash Lynx as he investigates a mysterious d_rug called “Banana Fish” while trying to protect a pure-hearted Japanese boy, Eiji Okumura, in the dangerous underworld of 1980s New York City Follow For Daily Anime News <a title="bananafish" target="_blank" href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/bananafish?refer=embed">#BananaFish</a></p> <p> <a target="_blank" title="♬ original sound - Anime DomainX | Anime News" href="https://www.tiktok.com/music/original-sound-7577996058077301511?refer=embed">♬ original sound – Anime DomainX | Anime News</a> </p></section> </blockquote></div>  <p><span>After days of ridicule, Amazon has </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/anime-shows/after-widespread-criticism-for-the-use-of-ai-voice-actors-amazon-removes-ai-dub-from-anime-series-banana-fish/"><span>removed the fake English dub</span></a><span> from its streaming services. Bullying works. Hire actors. Bezos has </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/real-time-billionaires/"><span>billions of dollars</span></a><span>, and you’re telling me that man can’t afford to put someone in a booth?&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>As of this writing, the Spanish AI-generated dub is still available, but we’ll see if that lasts. The next question is, will Amazon continue to roll back this decision by releasing a proper English dub with real actors? God knows the company has the money to do it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Anime isn’t the only industry that has started relying on generative AI to add voices to creative works. Video games like </span><i><span>Arc Raiders </span></i><span>have AI-generated voices, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-gen-ai-arc-raiders-brendan-green-2000644914"><span>rich people are lining up to tell you</span></a><span> that replacing real voice actors with soulless droning machines is good, actually. A lot of AI apologia relies on the false notion that AI-generated content is good enough to replace human-made work, and if this is the best it has to offer, everyone will continue to rally against it.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[I Have No Idea Who Would Actually Want This $300 Stranger Things Set]]></title>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-ghosts-n-goblins-nes-arcade-error-2000649178"><em>Stranger Things</em></a> season five’s finale episode, which is also the series finale, will go live on Netflix on New Year’s Eve. To celebrate that, Lego and Netflix have teamed up with the series creators to create a $300 set that I’m not sure really hits the mark. And I’m a big <em>Stranger Things</em> fan and Lego sicko.</p> <p>On December 2, <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/stranger-things-creel-house-lego-set">Lego and Netflix revealed a new elaborate <em>Stranger Things</em>-themed set</a> that is based on the <a href="https://strangerthings.fandom.com/wiki/Creel_House">Creel House first seen in season four</a>. This is the place where a young Henry Creel lived and where some horrific shit went down. It also ended up being the home base for season four’s big bad monster man, Vecna. And while that does mean the Creel House is a very important piece of Stranger Things lore, I’m not excited to spend $300 on what mostly looks like a Lego haunted house set.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/stranger-things-the-creel-house-11370">The Creel House Lego set contains 2,593 pieces and 13 minifigs</a>: Eleven, Will, Mike, Lucas, Dustin, Steve, Nancy, Robin, Jonathan, Max, Holly, Mr. Whatsit, and Vecna himself. It also includes two vehicle builds. As you might expect, it contains a lot of Easter eggs referencing moments from every season of the popular Netflix series. Perhaps the most interesting tidbit about this set is that it can be split in a way that reveals the “interdimensional horror” below, with Lego and Netflix calling it the “first-ever transforming LEGO house.”</p>

 <p>“We grew up obsessed with the LEGO brand, so seeing <i>Stranger Things</i> rebuilt in bricks is honestly surreal,” explained <em>Stranger Things</em> creators Ross and Matt Duffer. “With the show heading into its final chapter — and hitting the 10-year mark — bringing the Creel House to life this way feels like the perfect celebration of the world and the fans who made all of this possible.”</p>

 <p>Personally, I’d have been much more interested in a Lego diorama recreating Hawkins or a few smaller sets depicting iconic locations and moments from the show that connect into a nice display piece. Something that feels instantly recognizable as <em>Stranger Things.</em> But at least for $300, the house looks detailed, splits apart, and contains a ton of figs. <a href="https://kotaku.com/legos-new-400-star-trek-enterprise-set-price-release-date-mini-figs-2000641658">I’ll be spending dumb amounts of money on a different big Lego set based on a popular show soon, so I’ll be passing on this house set</a>.</p> <p>The Creel House set will be available to buy on New Year’s Day, about 24 hours after the finale airs. Makes me wonder if there are some interesting spoilers hidden in the set. <em>Stranger Things</em> <em>Vol. 1</em> is out now on Netflix. <em>Vol 2.</em> arrives on December 25. And the finale airs on New Year’s Eve.</p>
