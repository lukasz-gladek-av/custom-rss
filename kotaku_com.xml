              <p>Microsoft’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-cancel-controversy-console-pc-2000631061">unpopular Game Pass price hikes</a> have caught the attention of Lina Khan. The former head of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) took to social media on Friday to once again criticize the company’s acquisition of <em>Call of Duty</em> maker Activision Blizzard. “As dominant firms become too-big-to-care, they can make things worse for their customers without having to worry about the consequences,” she wrote just a day after the price of Game Pass Ultimate rose to $30 a month.</p> <p>It was Khan’s FTC during the Biden Administration <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-activision-ftc-deal-court-call-duty-xbox-ps5-1850623628">that sued Microsoft to prevent the $70 billion Activision Blizzard deal</a> from going through. The regulator argued that further market consolidation in gaming would harm consumers, and ended up taking the matter to court. A judge ultimately ruled in favor of Microsoft, but that hasn’t stopped Khan and others from criticizing the outcome in the years since.</p>

 <p>“Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision has been followed by significant price hikes and layoffs, harming both gamers and developers,” she posted on X today alongside a chart showing Game Pass prices doubling since the trial concluded. “As we’ve seen across sectors, increasing market consolidation and increasing prices often go hand-in-hand.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision has been followed by significant price hikes and layoffs, harming both gamers and developers. </p> <p>As we’ve seen across sectors, increasing market consolidation and increasing prices often go hand-in-hand. </p> <p>As dominant firms become… <a href="https://t.co/FoI50tlEsL">https://t.co/FoI50tlEsL</a></p> <p>— Lina Khan (@linamkhan) <a href="https://twitter.com/linamkhan/status/1974192096841265511?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>A similar point was made <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-ftc-black-ops-6-appeal-1851599323">when Microsoft raised prices last year</a>. “Microsoft’s price increases and product degradation—combined with Microsoft’s reduced investments in output and product quality via employee layoffs, see FTC’s February 7, 2024, Letter—are the hallmarks of a firm exercising market power post-merger,”&nbsp;<a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24852374-24-07-18-ftc-letter-re-microsoft-game-pass-price-increases" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the FTC wrote</a> last July when it was still appealing the merger.”</p>

 <h2>Microsoft promised regulators Game Pass prices wouldn’t go up</h2> <p>Khan isn’t the only one going “I told you so” this week. Shortly after the latest Game Pass price hikes were announced, players started circulating the company’s old quotes back during the Activision merger fight. The UK’s Competition and Markets Authority also tried to block the deal over pricing concerns.</p>

 <p>“Game Pass prices will not increase as a result of the Merger, and certainly will not increase to a point that offsets the substantial benefits of Activision titles coming to Game Pass on a day and date basis,” the company <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/microsoft-insists-game-pass-prices-will-not-increase-as-a-result-of-activision-merger/">claimed back in 2023</a>. “This is especially so given Game Pass will continue to be constrained by B2P [buy to play].”</p>

 <p>In the years since, Microsoft appears to have done exactly that, <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-game-pass-call-duty-points-discount-changes-2000631483">adding <em>Call of Duty</em> to Game Pass</a> but jacking up the price as well, even though players can still choose to buy the game à la carte for $70 on console and PC.</p> <p>Microsoft might argue that $30 a month is a fair price to pay for subscription-based access to <em>Black Ops 7</em> and hundreds of other games. It’s impossible to know without access to rest of the Xbox math, most of which Microsoft stopped reporting to the public years ago. All we know is that according to Microsoft, Game Pass was profitable and generating $5 billion in revenue a year, even before the latest price hikes.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[5 Things To Know Before Starting Digimon Story: Time Stranger]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-tips-guides-side-quests-2000631593</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/5-things-to-know-before-starting-digimon-story-time-stranger.1316152/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>In most ways, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-the-kotaku-review-2000630341"><i><span>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</span></i></a> <span>isn’t a complicated RPG. The turn-based monster tamer’s battles are mostly straightforward, and it’s got waypoints telling you where to go for most missions. However, after spending 40 hours in the game, I do have a few quick tips for those of you heading to the Digital World now that the game is out. Grab your Digivice and let’s go.</span></p> <h2><b>You will lose access to side quests for dozens of hours</b></h2> <p><span>Easily the most frustrating thing I encountered in my first playthrough of </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>was the way it gates side quests. Without getting into spoilers, there’s a point when the game will warn you that some of the side quests you’ve been doing will be inaccessible for an undetermined amount of time. Years of playing video games had me expecting this meant I wouldn’t be able to complete those quests until I finished the story mission I was about to embark on. As it turns out, it would be dozens of hours before I could go back to those quests. This would normally have been fine, but side quests have a lot more to offer in </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>than just a side story and some loot. Throughout the game, you’ll get Anomaly Points that raise your Agent rank. Digivolution levels are gated behind leveling up this rank, and if you can’t complete more quests, you might be stuck at a lower rank and unable to level up your party until much, </span><i><span>much </span></i><span>later in the game. So heed this warning when you hit it, because it really fails to adequately warn you just how long it will be before you can go back to those missions.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Using items doesn’t cost you a turn</b></h2> <p><span>One of the merciful things </span><i><span>Time Stranger </span></i><span>does is that it allows you to use an item </span><i><span>and </span></i><span>attack each turn, rather than choosing between them. This means you’ll be able to heal up your team, raise stats, or remove a status effect without having to give up doing some damage as well. A lot of other turn-based RPGs tend to make you choose between these options as a strategic challenge, but you’ll be glad </span><i><span>Time Stranger</span></i><span> doesn’t when you endure one of its long, drawn-out boss fights.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Upgrading your Agent rank helps circumvent grind</b></h2> <p><span>Those Anomaly points you get for completing quests are used to upgrade your Agent rank, which enables you to unlock Agent skills on a skill tree. Some of these perks are universal, such as giving you access to new high-impact Cross Arts abilities that can benefit your whole team. However, some of them are applied only to certain Digimon with different personality types. If you go down one skill tree, you’ll be able to raise stats and experience for the friendly Digimon in your team, while another path will grant you those perks for brave Digimon. So don’t just go down these skill trees without some plan in place, as they can help you reach powerful new heights if you target specific traits and personality types. It’s much simpler than grinding random battles.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Don’t get precious about saving your Cross Art</b></h2> <p><span>Cross Arts abilities can have a wide variety of uses in battles. They can heal your team, raise their stats, or they can take a chunk of your enemy’s health bar down and leave them with debuffs for a few turns. Since they can be so impactful, you might feel like you need to hold your Cross Art for a big boss fight, but this ability charges up fast when you do pretty much anything in battle. Attacking an enemy or using an item can give you points toward your Cross Arts gauge, so it’s pretty easy to fire off multiple uses of this in a longer fight. Feel free to use it often, and keep in mind that the more actions you can do in a turn, the more charge you’ll get toward using it again.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Try to have a rideable Digimon on your team at all times</b></h2> <p><span>Some Digimon can double as both a party member and a rideable mount. I rode my Growlmon for much of the game, but when he digivolved to WarGrowlmon, he couldn’t carry me on his shoulders anymore. Thankfully, WereGarurumon stepped up and put me on his shoulder, and later, when he became MetalGarurumon, I was able to ride on his back. Riding your Digimon gets you places faster than walking on foot, but as they transform into new, stronger versions of themselves, they might lose the ability to carry you around. Just be mindful of this as you move throughout the evolution tree.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Kingmakers</em> was due out in Early Access in just a few days but it’s apparently not ready yet. The medieval sandbox shooter has been indefinitely delayed as the team at Redemption Road works on getting everything working as intended. “We just need a bit more time on content polish before we feel good about charging money for it,” the studio wrote in an announcement on Friday.</p> <p>Odds are you’ve seen a <a href="https://kotaku.com/this-time-hopping-action-game-brings-a-grenade-launcher-1851274937">bit of <em>Kingmakers</em> here or there</a> over the years, even if you didn’t know it. The multiplayer game features sprawling maps and giant armies and is supposed to facilitate real-time destruction as you engage in everything from medieval combat to blowing up a bunch of armor-clad knights with tanks. The game’s impressive physics simulation helped it go viral on social media, land a big trailer at Summer Game Fest this year, and become the sixth most-wishlisted game on Steam. So it’s surprising to see it pulled from launch at the last minute.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/HhiDBLQrOS">pic.twitter.com/HhiDBLQrOS</a></p> <p>— Ian Fisch – Lead Coder on Kingmakers (wishlist!) (@Ian_Fisch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ian_Fisch/status/1974143748419563537?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“After much contemplation, we realize that the scheduled<em> Kingmakers</em> launch on October 8 will no longer be possible,” the team <a href="https://x.com/Ian_Fisch/status/1974143748419563537">announced today</a>. “We want to apologize to all of the fans who are eagerly anticipating this game. We are sorry for letting you down.”</p>

 <p>The rest of the message goes on to try to explain why the game is being indefinitely delayed. TL;DR:<em> Kingmakers</em> is ambitions and delivering on that is hard!</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">GTA6, but you're dropped in the 1400s.<br>No cops.

Nothing is faked. We have giant 6-story castles where every room can be entered and every wall, floor, and ceiling destroyed. When you build a lumbermill, it’s a real place that can be entered, or, in an enemy invasion, turned into a combat arena.”</p> <p>The studio doesn’t really go into much more detail than that but promises that a deep-dive overview will be livestreamed soon to update players on where things are at. That makes it sound like the delay won’t just be a couple of weeks or months. Will it still be out before the end of 2026? We’ll see. “We’re making sure everyone who buys the game is enthralled and feels like their money was well spent,” the developers wrote.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-life-showgirl-reaction-reviews-songs-wood-2000631553</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-internet-reacts-to-taylor-swift%E2%80%99s-new-album.1316077/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Every time Taylor Swift, the country star turned pop royalty, releases a new album, it’s a cultural event, whether you’re a Swiftie or not. This is because the algorithm will no doubt feed you reactions and commentary just because you are, at most, one degree removed from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-shakes-her-polys-in-band-hero-5329622"><i><span>Band Hero</span></i></a> <span>star’s fandom at all times. </span><i><span>The Life of a Showgirl </span></i><span>is Swift’s 12th album, and turns the dial back into radio/TikTok-ready pop after </span><i><span>The Tortured Poets Department </span></i><span>went for a more melancholic, folky sound. But is it any good? Well, Swifties are sorting through their feelings.</span></p> <p><span>Like most of Swift’s work, </span><i><span>The Life of a Showgirl</span></i><span> is pretty transparent in its references to her personal life. As that personal life has become so </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-life-of-a-showgirl-announcement-cover-date-2000617177"><span>well-known in and out of her music</span></a><span>, it’s usually pretty obvious who a song is about. So there’s some lore to unpack with a lot of these songs, but the ones that are getting the most attention right now are the ones that seem to reference her </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-travis-kelce-engaged-ring-reaction-2000620394"><span>fiancé Travis Kelce’s hog</span></a><span> and seem to escalate an apparent feud between her and pop star Charli XCX that, at least publicly, appears largely one-sided at the moment.</span></p> <p><span>Let’s start with the song that is all about how well-endowed the Kansas City football player is. “Wood” starts out with a funky riff and a catchy beat, and you can already hear the Sabrina Carpenter influence in the composition. Then you hear the lyrics and you can tell that Swift is trying to emulate the </span><i><span>Short n’ Sweet </span></i><span>singer’s trademark graphic, sexual punchlines. Here, let’s look at the lyrics of the second verse.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>Forgive me, it sounds cocky</span></p> <p><span>He ah-matized me and openеd my eyes</span></p> <p><span>Redwood tree, it ain’t hard to see</span></p> <p><span>His lovе was the key that opened my thighs</span></p> <p><span>Girls, I don’t need to catch the bouquet, mm</span></p> <p><span>To know a hard rock is on the way</span></p> <p><span>And baby, I’ll admit I’ve been a little superstitious</span></p> <p><span>The curse on me was broken by your magic wand</span></p> <p><span>Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck</span></p> <p><span>New Heights of manhood</span></p></blockquote>   <p><span>If the clear reference to Kelce’s </span><i><span>New Heights </span></i><span>podcast wasn’t enough to make it clear that this is about her man’s schlong, the reference to a “hard rock” like the one on her finger would make it pretty clear. There’s an episode of </span><i><span>How I Met Your Mother </span></i><span>in which Marshall (Jason Segal) realizes he can’t tell any sexy stories from his dating life to his friends without everyone knowing they’re about his long-time partner Lily (Alyson Hannigan) because she’s the only one he’s really been with. Part of what makes love songs such a popular genre of music is that there’s a universality to them that people can project onto their own relationships. Who among us wouldn’t love to sing about a man’s dick lifting a curse and solving all our problems? But Swift’s very public personal life and clear references to her husband-to-be mean that I can’t hear this song without knowing whose dick it’s about.</span></p>   <p><span>That being said, the song is pretty catchy. What Swift may lack in Carpenter’s clever jokes, she makes up for in a fun song about love and lust. And hey, Kelce seems cool with it?</span></p>   <p><span>One song I have a less charitable read on, however, is “Actually Romantic,” which takes the other side of “everyone knowing your business” and seems to be essentially a diss track against Charli XCX. For those who don’t know, Charli has a song called “Sympathy Is a Knife” on the album </span><i><span>Brat</span></i><span> that addresses her insecurities in the pop girl space, and seemingly references Swift specifically triggering those feelings of comparison in her. “Actually Romantic” is being called a diss track aimed at the “360” singer, and at first blush, some think Swift may have straight-up misunderstood the intent behind “Sympathy Is a Knife,” which is actually fairly complimentary to her.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>However, “Actually Romantic” does seem to gesture at further drama behind the scenes, even as Swift has been publicly supportive of Charli. Specifically, it references Swift’s past relationship with Matty Healy of the band 1975, which also includes Charli’s husband George Daniel, and things Charli has allegedly said about Swift in private.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>I heard you call me ‘Boring Barbie’ when the coke’s got you brave&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>High-fived my ex and then said you’re glad he ghosted me&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Wrote me a song saying it makes you sick to see my face</span></p> <p><span>Some people might be offended&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But it’s actually sweet&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>All the time you’ve spent on me.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>I guess I can buy that maybe there’s more happening than “Sympathy Is a Knife” lets on. It’s giving </span><i><span>Reputation</span></i><span> era, when Swift was very publicly calling out other public figures like Kanye West and Kim Kardashian, or </span><i><span>1989</span></i><span>’s “Bad Blood” which referenced her now-ended feud with pop star </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/katy-perry-womans-world-music-video-pokemon-pikachu-1851590464"><span>Katy Perry</span></a><span>. Again, it’s the effect of someone’s personal life being so public that these songs end up weaving a story that’s already playing out on social media and in gossip magazines. Though if this is all spun off from “Sympathy Is a Knife,” then it feels like punching down.</span></p> <p><span>The problem with </span><i><span>Life of a Showgirl</span></i><span> is that Swift’s status as a billionaire mega-celebrity clashes against the “relatable” persona she exhibits in her music here more than ever before. “Eldest Daughter” laments how mean everyone on the internet can be, when she’s enveloped in a massive cocoon of wealth and status. Like, girl, why are you even reading TikTok comments when you could be doing literally anything else with all that money?</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="und" dir="ltr">lol <a href="https://t.co/a78pUaSvCU">https://t.co/a78pUaSvCU</a> <a href="https://t.co/quyrERr07R">pic.twitter.com/quyrERr07R</a></p> <p>— grace spelman (@GraceSpelman) <a href="https://twitter.com/GraceSpelman/status/1973974944607580252?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Another song that really sticks out as an expression of Swift imagining threats to her status is “CANCELLED!” which I saw someone say is destined to become the new anthem of MAGA wine moms, and I can’t stop thinking about it. As the title suggests, the song is all about perceived judgments of her for who she chooses to associate with, with her singing that she likes her friends “cancelled” and cloaked in “scandal.” Broadly, this could be a song about cancel culture and how Swift is unwilling to drop people just because they run afoul of public scrutiny, but given that she has </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fauxmoi/comments/1n4fj0i/taylor_swift_celebrates_brittany_maga_mahomes/"><span>friends who are public Trump supporters</span></a><span>, that feels like underselling or minimizing people’s criticism as some kind of petty scandal, rather than a legitimate concern.</span></p>   <p><span>Ultimately, all of these reactions are born from the relationship with her fandom that Swift has cultivated over her decades-long career. When your personal life is the source of the characters and stories people listen for references to in each song, every album is like a new season of a television show for which millions of people tune in just to lap up every new lore drop. But is the music any good? In my first listen, I came away thinking that </span><i><span>Life of a Showgirl </span></i><span>is an obvious low point in Swift’s discography. I don’t think I’m alone in that assessment, but the album has been out for all of 12 hours at this point, and people will sort their feelings out over the next few weeks or months. Tonight, Swift is putting out a movie in theaters called </span><i><span>The Official Release Party of a Showgirl</span></i><span>, which will include commentary and context for the album from Swift. Maybe that will work in its favor. For now, the music is speaking for itself.

              <p>Spooky season is upon us, and that means the movie theater schedules are stacked with horror movies. This year, more than ever, bigger names are being drawn to the genre as it proves one of the most resilient ways of getting butts in seats. With Guillermo del Toro’s <em>Frankenstein</em> leading the pack, we’ve also got Ethan Hawke returning for&nbsp;<em>Black Phone 2</em>, Keira Knightley in&nbsp;<em>The Woman in Cabin 10</em>, and both Justin Long and Kate Bosworth appearing in&nbsp;<em>Coyotes</em>. And so many more besides. So, to be helpful, we’ve rounded up the trailers for all of October’s scariest upcoming horror movies.</p> <p>Horror is big business right now, with studios having finally noticed that if you put more than no money into a scary film, you can still make them super-cheap and see some stellar returns. As such, we’re seeing some bigger names wanting to get involved, alongside the gloriously kitsch and classically gory. Below, in order of U.S. release date across October, are our picks for flicks to scare you out of you knicks.</p> <h2><em>Good Boy</em></h2>  <p>Out today (<strong>October 3</strong>) and getting rave reviews (including <a href="https://kotaku.com/good-boy-does-the-dog-die-horror-movie-indy-showtimes-2000631497">this praise from <em>Kotaku</em>‘s own Kenneth Shepard</a>),&nbsp;<em>Good Boy</em> is a horror movie from the perspective of a dog. Indy the doggo is determined to protect his human buddy Todd from evil forces in a surprisingly short film—just 72 minutes. It’s written and directed by Ben Leonberg, his first feature-length movie, and stars his own pet dog Indy—a Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever—in the lead role. The human cast are relative unknowns (although perhaps not for long) Arielle Friedman and Shane Jensen, alongside Hollywood stalwart portrayer of homeless gentlemen, Stuart Rudin.</p> <h2><em>Bone Lake</em></h2>  <p>Has there been a more on-the-nose name for a horror movie since 1999’s ridiculous&nbsp;<em>Cherry Falls</em>?&nbsp;<em>Bone Lake</em> is a sexy horror flick from director Mercedes Bryce Morgan, previously best known for, er,&nbsp;<em>Stargate Origins: Catherine</em>. The Bleecker Street release is clearly attempting to evoke a little bit of&nbsp;<em>Saltburn</em>, but in a story about two couples accidentally booking the same AirBnB for the same weekend. Except, for some reason, everyone keeps taking their clothes off and/or being chopped up by axes and chainsaws. I mean, it sounds like all the elements for a stone-cold B-movie classic. The first handful of reviews have been middling, but then this was never a movie to win over the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>. It too is out today, <strong>October 3</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Coyotes</em></h2>  <p>Yet another <strong>October 3</strong> release is comedy horror film <em>Coyotes</em>. Real-life couple Kate Bosworth <em>(Superman</em> <em>Returns</em>, <em>Before I Wake</em>) and Justin Long (<em>Weapons</em>,&nbsp;<em>Galaxy Quest</em>) reunite after appearing together in 2022’s&nbsp;<em>Barbarian</em>, as parents trapped in their home by a savage pack of…you guessed right, coyotes. It looks tremendously silly, incredibly violent, and contains the line, “GET THE FUCK OFF MY HUSBAND.” That’s all I need. It’s directed by Colin Minihan (<em>What Keeps You Alive</em>,&nbsp;<em>Grave Encounters</em>) and looks like some very schlocky fun.</p> <h2><em>V/H/S Halloween</em></h2>  <p>The infinite arms of the&nbsp;<em>V/H/S</em> franchise reach out yet again, this time with a collection of seven Halloween-themed shorts, one of which comes from director Casper Kelly, the man behind Adult Swim’s&nbsp;<em>Your Pretty Face Is Going to Hell</em>,&nbsp;<em>Stroker &amp; Hoop</em>, and the infamous <em>Infomercials</em> episode,&nbsp;<em>Too Many Cooks</em>. It’s on Shudder from today, <strong>October 3</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Scared Shitless</em></h2>  <p>The final <strong>October 3</strong> release (you could watch new horror movies all night tonight!) is&nbsp;<em>Scared Shitless</em>, which looks like it should be hilarious, but the trailer doesn’t have me convinced. It looks like it’s trying a bit too hard with its glove puppet toilet monster and overly wacky goofs. If you recognize the older lead guy, that’s because he’s Steven Ogg, Trevor Phillips from <em>GTA V</em>! His son is played by Daniel Doheny (<em>Brand New Cherry Flavor</em>) wearing what looks like his first beard, starring alongside the mighty Julian Richings and Mark McKinney. It’s the first theatrically released movie from Canadian comedy director Vivieno Caldinelli, who is more usually shooting skits for sketch shows.</p> <h2><em>Vicious</em></h2>  <p>Paramount Plus gets in on the spooky action <strong>October 10</strong> with Dakota Fanning in&nbsp;<em>Vicious</em>. It seems to set itself up as a film about a woman who is cursed to find three objects, one she loves, one she hates, and one she can’t live without, and put them all in a box before midnight. Should she fail, she’ll die. That’s a great premise, given how hard it would be to look inside yourself and answer those three questions truthfully, but the trailer suggests things are going in about seventy-three other directions too. Clearly Dakota Fanning is a big win for Paramount’s streamer, in a movie written and directed by Bryan “<em>The Strangers”</em> Bertino.</p> <h2><em>The Woman in Cabin 10</em></h2>  <p>On the same day, <strong>October 10</strong>, rival streamer Netflix has its own big-name horror release with <em>The Woman in Cabin 10</em>. Kiera Knightley leads, with Guy Pearce (<em>Memento</em>,&nbsp;<em>L.A. Confidential</em>) pulling off a very convincing British accent. It’s all about a reporter on a luxury yacht who thinks she sees a death, and is then hounded and gaslit by the super-posh people on board. Part scary thriller, part whodunnit mystery, it’s directed by Simon Stone, the Swiss director behind 2021’s well-respected&nbsp;<em>The Dig</em>.</p> <h2><em>Black Phone 2</em></h2>  <p>2021’s&nbsp;<em>The Black Phone</em> was an interesting choice for star Ethan Hawke. More usually mumbling through indie roles directed by Richard Linklater, here he jumped into the post-<em>Saw</em> trend for terrifying iconic horror villains: a serial child-killer known as the Grabber. Four years later, Hawke returns to the Blumhouse production for a classic-style sequel, with a should-be-dead enemy returning for revenge against the older cast of the original. Director Scott Derrickson is hit or miss, with a dreadful remake of <em>The Day the Earth Stood Still</em> and some middling horrors like&nbsp;<em>Sinister</em> and&nbsp;<em>The Gorge</em>, but he also gave us the solid <em>Doctor Strange.&nbsp;</em>The trailer looks fantastic, seeming to repeat the Wes Craven meets Stephen King ’70s vibes of the original. It’s out <strong>October 17</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Frankenstein</em></h2>  <p>Netflix has funded Guillermo del Toro’s version of&nbsp;<em>Frankenstein</em>, with a short theatrical release on <strong>October 17</strong> before it arrives on Netflix November 7. (Clearly the streamer thinks there could be trophies in this one.) It’s sticking to the gothic horror of Shelley’s novel, looking like a relatively faithful interpretation, albeit through del Toro’s extraordinary imagination, with Oscar Isaac (<em>Ex Machina</em>, <em>Moon Knight</em>) <em>as</em> Dr. Frankenstein and Jacob Elordi (<em>Euphoria</em>) as his creation, alongside Mia Goth (<em>Pearl</em>, <em>Infinity Pool</em>) as Elizabeth. Del Toro doesn’t miss, so there’s every reason to be very excited for this one.</p> <h2><em>R.L. Stine’s Pumpkinhead</em></h2>  <p>I could pretend it wasn’t this trailer that made me want to write this entire article, but I’m not ashamed. 81-year-old Robert Lawrence Stine, the author of the&nbsp;<em>Goosebumps</em> novels, has his name glued to the title of this&nbsp;<em>Pumpkinhead</em> remake (the original starring Lance Henriksen came out in 1988), but he is neither writer nor director. Both those roles fall to Jem Garrard, the director behind last year’s Tubi queer vampire flick <em>Slay</em>. They are back with Tubi for this movie too, a kid-friendly (although not&nbsp;<em>that</em> friendly) film that reimagines the very adult original as something a touch more tame. It’s on Tubi <strong>October 17</strong>.</p> <h2><em>The Hand That Rocks the Cradle</em></h2>  <p>Yup, it’s back. Curtis Hanson’s 1992 classic, starring Annabella Sciorra, Rebecca De Mornay and Matt McCoy, as well as Ernie Hudson, Julianne Moore and Madeline Zima, had one of the darkest plots of all time. A sexual predator is caught and kills himself, which causes his widowed wife to miscarry, and in turn drives her to seek revenge on one of his accusers by becoming her nanny and destroying her life. This time, however, the film is less thriller, more horror, given it’s directed by Mexican horror pro Michelle Garza Cervera. And it doesn’t seem to be following the original film’s motives for its characters, either, with nanny Polly Murphy (Maika Monroe of <em>Longlegs </em>and&nbsp;<em>It Follows</em>) hired by upper-class mom Caitlin Morales (Mary Elizabeth Winstead of <em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em>), who then begins infiltrating her life and marriage. But also, there’s some other weird darkness going on here, something more overtly creepy. It comes to Hulu and Disney+ <strong>October 22</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Shelby Oaks</em></h2>  <p>Arriving on big screens <strong>October 24</strong>,&nbsp;<em>Shelby Oaks</em> looks fucking terrifying. It has the big boost of Mike Flanagan as an executive producer, and is directed by former YouTube movie critic Chris Stuckmann (<em>Chris Stuckmann Movie Reviews</em>). There are some real mixed media vibes to the trailer, in a film about a woman trying to find her missing sister, and beginning to suspect that a demon they imagined in their childhoods might be a bit too real. Camille Sullivan (<em>She Talks to Strangers</em>) is the lead,&nbsp;<em>Mayor of Kingstown</em>‘s Michael Beach is here as a detective, and I’m delighted to say it also stars the always-wonderful Keith David.</p> <h2><em>In Our Blood</em></h2>  <p>“Indie horror” too often means rubbery monsters shot on iPhone, but that’s not the case here.&nbsp;<em>In Our Blood</em> has the vibes of an indie that scoops all the awards at a film festival, but harnessed here to deliver a super-weird and disturbing lo-fi movie about filmmakers making a documentary about reuniting with an estranged mother. However, she’s disappeared, and the reasons why are dark and terrible. It’s directed by Pedro Kos, who has been Oscar nominated for his documentaries, but now turns his hand to narrative. The lead is Brittany O’Grady, one of the stars of the first series of <em>The White Lotus</em>, without any other major names to take away the faux-realism of the flick. It’s in theaters <strong>October 24</strong>.</p> <h2><em>Queens of the</em> <em>Dead</em></h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/george-a-romeros-daughter-zombie-drag-queen-movie-queens-trailer-2000626904">Tina Romero’s <em>Queens of the Dead</em></a> is an attempt to make her own mark following the legacy of her father’s movies. George A. Romero’s&nbsp;<em>Night of the Living Dead</em> and its sequels are certainly memorable, but none of them followed the adventures of a group of drag queens and club kids attempting to survive the zombie apocalypse. Sillier than her dad’s films, <a href="https://www.thecurb.com.au/suff-interview-tina-romero-queens-of-the-dead/">she says</a>,&nbsp;<em>Queens of the Dead</em> is a celebration of queer culture and aims to be uplifting in its politics during a very dark time in real life. Starring Jaquel Spivey (<em>Mean Girls 2024</em>), Katy O’Brian (<em>The Mandolorian</em>,&nbsp;<em>Love Lies Bleeding</em>) and Margaret Cho, it’s getting fantastic early buzz, and will be on big screens <strong>October 24</strong>.</p>
