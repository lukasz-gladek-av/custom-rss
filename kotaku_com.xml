A “challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates” was what Sony pinned the blame on for the price hike. </p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Europe - PS5 Digital Edition – Now: €500 | Launch: €400</li><li>UK - PS5 Digital Edition – Now:  £430 | Launch: £360</li><li>Australia - PS5 Digital Edition – Now: $750 | Launch: $600</li><li>New Zealand - PS5 Digital Edition – Now: $860 | Launch: $650</li></ul><p>In Australia and New Zealand, Sony is also raising the price of the standard PS5 that comes with a UHD Blu-ray drive.

Usually, thanks to various factors, consoles get cheaper over time.

He describes frustration with his own lack of upward momentum, as he was passed over for the role of <em>Dragon Age</em>’s creative director in favor of Mike Laidlaw. He says he was eventually won over by Laidlaw’s leadership and that the fantasy series benefited from it, but after he left the series to work on something else, things started to change.</p><p>Gaider asked to move on to something else within BioWare after <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>’s launch in 2014, and it was between either <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em> or “Dylan,” the game that would become <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-biowares-anthem-went-wrong-1833731964"><em>Anthem</em></a></span>, the studio’s ill-fated loot shooter. Opting to work on the latter, he says the experience illuminated tensions between the different BioWare teams and that he felt the <em>Anthem </em>team didn’t want him there.</p><p>“You see, the thing you need to know about BioWare is that for a long time it was basically two teams under one roof: the <em>Dragon Age</em> team and the <em>Mass Effect</em> team,” Gaider wrote. “Run differently, very different cultures, may as well have been two separate studios. And they didn’t get along. The company was aware of the friction and attempts to fix it had been ongoing for years, mainly by shuffling staff between the teams more often. Yet this didn’t really solve things, and I had no idea until I got to the Dylan team. The team didn’t want me there. At all.”</p><p>Gaider says that some of his conflict with the<em> Anthem</em> team came from higher-up instructions to write something more “science fantasy,” similar to <em>Star Wars</em>, whereas the original concept had been more of a “beer &amp; cigarettes” sci-fi world similar to <em>Aliens</em>. According to Gaider, he was frequently given feedback that his ideas were “too <em>Dragon Age</em>.”</p><p>“I won’t go into detail about the problems except to say it became clear this was a team that didn’t want to make an RPG,” Gaider wrote. “Were very anti-RPG, in fact. Yet they wanted me to wave my magic writing wand and create a BioWare quality story without giving me any of the tools I’d need to actually do that.”</p><p>After it became clear that that the project wasn’t a good fit for him, Gaider told BioWare’s bosses that he’d stick with it if there was some kind of promotion on the other side, and when he was turned down, he quit and went on to co-found Summerfall Studios. The studio’s first game, <em>Stray Gods</em>, is a musical game following a modern version of the Greek god pantheon.
