              <p><span>This weekend, the 2025 </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-plush-scalper-reseller-world-championships-2000618087"><span>Pokémon World Championships</span></a><span> were held in Anaheim. Most of the event was dedicated to the franchise’s multiple competitive scenes across video games, the card game, and fans </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-world-championship-merchandise-scalper-reseller-2000617744"><span>fighting scalpers for exclusive merchandise</span></a><span>, but the tournament’s closing ceremony also included some new announcements you might’ve missed if you didn’t stay up late to catch the livestream. If you missed the mini-Pokémon Presents showcase, here’s everything The Pokémon Company announced:</span></p>  <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Eternatus Emerges | Pokémon GO" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4xN0zU-uMCs?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Kicking things off was a quick trailer for </span><i><span>Pokémon Go</span></i><span>. Eternatus, one of the legendary Pokémon from the Galar region, is the centerpiece of Pokémon Go Fest 2025’s Max Finale, taking place on August 23 and 24. Players at Worlds were able to get Eternatus early, as if those of us who couldn’t make it to Anaheim needed more reasons to feel FOMO.</span></p> <h2><b><i>Pokémon TCG Pocket</i></b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pokémon TCG Pocket | Mega Evolution is coming this fall!" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6vS2fnu49pw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p><span>Next up is </span><i><span>Pokémon TCG Pocket</span></i><span>, which is getting new Mega Evolution cards later this fall. Mega versions of Altaria, Gyarados, and Blaziken will all be featured in the set coming to the mobile app’s new season.</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Pokémon Unite</i></b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="New Pokémon are on the way! | Pokémon UNITE" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xEQXlI_Sfmo?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <p><span>Three new playable characters were announced for MOBA </span><i><span>Pokémon Unite</span></i><span>. First up, Sinnoh water starter Emploeon will join the roster on September 19, followed by Dhelmise, who has a grappler kit that lets it latch onto enemies and get in close. Vaporeon will come sometime after, bringing Unite’s Eeveelution count to six. All that’s left are Jolteon and Flareon, then all the current versions of Eevee’s evolution line will have joined the roster.</span></p> <h2><b><i>Pokémon Trading Card Game</i></b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pokémon Worlds | TCG | New Mega Evolution Pokémon ex Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9uj-A1J_rf0?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Outside of the mobile app, the regular </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> TCG is also featuring Mega Evolutions pretty heavily next year. TPC showed off new ex cards for Mega Charizard X, Mega Gaurdivoir, and Mega Lucario, each of which has a really eye-catching manga-inspired art style. Mega Dragonite is also getting its first card, though the one shown wasn’t a full-art one like the others.</span></p> <h2><b><i>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</i></b></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Enjoy Pokémon Battles Like Never Before in Pokémon Legends: Z-A!" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Y30vuKRtYPw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Fans were expecting a multiplayer mode in </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> after Nintendo </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-link-play-multiplayer-switch-2-1851787158"><span>let it slip that</span></a><span> the RPG would have some sort of “link play,” but the mode Game Freak announced at Worlds is a bit different from what people have been anticipating. The game will feature a four-player multiplayer mode in which players pit their parties against one another and earn points for each Pokémon they defeat within the three-minute time limit. According to </span><a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/news/battle-with-trainers"><span>the game’s official website</span></a><span>, these matches can be played casually with friends or in a ranked mode.</span></p>

The tournament is set to take place at the Chase Center in San Francisco next year, but The Pokémon Company is also setting up a new “fan experience” called Pokémon XP in the city during the same weekend, August 28 to 30. Tickets go on sale on September 17. The teaser trailer was light on details, but the official Pokémon website says XP will feature “panels, unique workshops, special guests, exclusive merchandise, and so much more.”</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>An August Nintendo Direct is indeed happening, though maybe not the one fans were expecting. The company announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-nintendo-direct-mario-donkey-kong-1851774194">a deep dive into <em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a> is coming on August 19, the same day that Gamescom kicks off in Germany. We basically know nothing about the upcoming racer except that Kirby creator and <em>Smash Bros.</em> director Masahiro Sakurai is in charge, and it’s scheduled to arrive before the end of 2025.</p> <p>“Tune in on Tuesday, August 19, for a livestreamed <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> Direct featuring about 45 minutes of information about the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game,” Nintendo posted in its Switch 2 news app today. Nearly an hour about <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>? In this economy?</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Kirby Air Riders – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oJVsNMp_nAU?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>The game was originally revealed during the Switch 2’s April Nintendo Direct, but with only a cinematic teaser and Sakurai’s name flashing across the screen. It’s a sequel to the 2003 GameCube fan-favorite, which included, among other things, the novel mechanic of players not needing to hold a button to accelerate. But it was also largely overshadowed on a console that already had <em>F-Zero GX</em> and <em>Mario Kart: Double Dash</em>.</p>

 <p>The new <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> falls into a similar position with the Switch 2, coming so soon after <em>Mario Kart World</em>, <em>F-Zero</em> via the Switch Online retro library, and the great indie launch racer<em> Fast Fusion</em>. Expectations are also markedly higher for exclusives featuring first-party characters in the Switch 2 era, though <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> is a joint venture between Sakurai’s studio and Bandai Namco.</p> <p>The upcoming game is supposed to round out Nintendo’s holiday release lineup, though we’re still waiting on the release date for <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, a game that was originally teased back during the first years of the Switch 1’s life cycle. A <em>Kirby</em> Direct probably wasn’t on most fans’ bingo cards for August, but hopefully a big Nintendo Direct that helps define the longer-term roadmap for the Switch 2 will still be coming soon.</p>
