              <p><span>Western RPG fans are finally becoming </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>-curious thanks to Square Enix’s recent spate of re-releases and remakes. The past couple of years alone have given us </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake </span></i><span>on top of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</span></i><span>, updated versions of the three games that form the bedrock of the </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>series. These releases have also been a touch confusing, as the remake of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest III</span></i><span> was released before </span><i><span>Dragon Quest I &amp; 2</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Square has decided to muddy things up further by giving us </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> before the expected </span><i><span>Dragon Quest IV</span></i> <i><span>HD-2D Remake. </span></i><span>What’s more, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> utilizes bright, cartoony 3D character models instead of the HD-2D pixel art style of the earlier remakes. Thankfully, the models animate well, and they look particularly cool in battle. </span></p>

 <p><span>But </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span>‘s makeover also comes with quality-of-life tweaks that make for a much more streamlined gameplay experience than the Nintendo 3DS version of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII, </span></i><span>which itself had already streamlined the original PSX version of the game. Some of the tweaks even make the game a good starting point for </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> newcomers who are worried the games might be too difficult for them. But </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span> is always going to be </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span> at the end of the day. It’s always going to be an imperfect RPG that has problems with pacing and a strange cast that I’ll never warm up to. (Barring Ruff, obviously.)&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Nonetheless, playing </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> is still fun as heck and it’s great to see </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>gain some momentum over here. As a long-suffering </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> fan who’s watched the series’ popularity gradually tick upwards in recent years, it gives me great pleasure to say this: Square Enix’s </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> is a great entry in a series that finally—</span><i><span>finally</span></i><span>!—has us western </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> fans spoiled for choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Ooooh, let me say that again: </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> fans are “spoiled for choice these days.” Shiver</span><i><span>.</span></i></p> <p><span>But</span><i><span> Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> might give pause to series’ newcomers and veterans alike, since </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span> is generally not named amongst beloved entries like</span><i><span> Dragon Quest III, V</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>XI</span></i><span>. 2000’s </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span> for the PSX has a notoriously slow start that noodles away hours before you’re allowed your first taste of combat. It’s also not much of a looker, which is a shallow thing to say, but we were deep in PS2-mania by the time it came west. In any case, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span> was ignored when it came to North America.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000665145" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665145"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665145">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Square Enix has never given up on trying to get westerners to like </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>—not for more than a handful of years at one time, anyway—and we received </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII’</span></i><span>s full Nintendo 3DS make-over (subtitled “Fragments of the Forgotten Past”) in 2016. This iteration of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span> fared better here: For one thing, westerners had stopped trying to hurt themselves by denying </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> as their lord and saviour by this point, and for another,</span><i><span> Fragments of the Forgotten Past </span></i><span>did a lot of trimming and slimming on the PSX game. The long introduction was nerfed, random encounters were done away with in favor of on-screen enemies, and other changes made it much easier to recommend the </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> series’ blackest of black sheep to newcomers.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Reimagine Dragons</b></h2> <p><span>Well, move on over Nintendo 3DS, because the award for “Most Digestible Version of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span>” now goes to </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> for consoles and PC. Additional streamlining makes for a much snappier experience compared to previous releases, and the storybook-style environments and animations look wonderful. All that’s left is to evaluate </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> alongside other games in the series. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span> is a rather linear game by design, with a story that tasks you and your pals with saving the world. It doesn’t feel as open and free as </span><i><span>Dragon Quest XI</span></i><span>, or even older titles like </span><i><span>VIII</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>III</span></i><span>. It’s still not a short game: You’re looking at around 60 hours. But if you like focused quests served to you with as few distractions as possible, expect some good eating here.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>While </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> is the best version of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span> still isn’t my favorite </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> game. (At least I still like it more than </span><i><span>VI</span></i><span>.) That doesn’t mean much in the context of the series. Like pizza, a </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> game is never actually </span><i><span>bad</span></i><span>. It just doesn’t have your preferred toppings. Exploration is one of the things I love most about </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, but </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined </span></i><span>has you hopping from one small island to the next, and most of them don’t offer a lot of opportunities to get sidetracked on your journey. You’re usually there just long enough to beat up whatever dark force is plaguing the area. Then you zip back to the future and admire your holy handiwork as a new “rediscovered” island resurfaces on your map.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>       <div>                                         <figure>                            </figure>                           <div>                      <p>             Dragon Quest VII Reimagined           </p>                                       </div>       </div>               <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Dragon Quest VII, only it's better than the last time they made it better."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>developer:</p>                 <p>Square Enix</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>type of game:</p>                 <p>RPG</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Wonderful environment and creature designs, double-fisting jobs is fun, even more bloat has been cut from the 3DS version of DQ7.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>disliked:</p>                 <p>Linear progression, so-so character roster.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>platforms:</p>                 <p>Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2 (played on), PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, PC</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>release date:</p>                 <p>February 5, 2026</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>played:</p>                 <p>Rolled credits at about 60 hours, but haven't done post-game stuff.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>           </div>  <p><span>Yes, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> is technically about time travel. You, as the Chosen One, quickly learn there’s more to life than the single island your family lives on, and you must dip back in time to solve the problems that keep each individual island shrouded in the dark. The further you progress, the more you learn about the apocalyptic war that cut the humans off from each other and allowed monsters to roam the world. But what can be done can also be undone. You know what you must do™.</span></p> <h2><b>Get a Job (Heck, get two!)</b></h2> <p><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> also saddles me with the </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span> cast again, and they’re just not my favorite group. The hero is the typical wordless Toriyama-designed </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> homunculus the player drives through the game. Maribel is abrasive, though she does soften up as the quest goes on. And there’s something wrong with Kiefer’s face. Every time I look at it, my brain screams what I can only describe as an ancestral warning not to turn my back on him lest he might shank me.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>It might be that </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined’</span></i><span>s art style is just better suited for environments and monsters than humanoid characters. Unlike Kiefer, Ruff the wolf boy looks like he’s in his element. Something about his goofy perpetual grin meshes perfectly with the world and creatures around him. Speaking of creatures, the late, great Akira Toriyama whipped up a whole bunch of new critters for </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span>, and they all translate brilliantly into </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span>‘s 3D space. Not only are the monster designs peak (as per usual with </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>), they animate fluidly too. Fur, scales, and metal are all textured and look fantastic.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000665147" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665147"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665147">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I do miss having costumes for each job like with </span><i><span>Fragments of the Forgotten Past </span></i><span>(Ruff and his wolf pal just belong in sheep costumes), but it’s the trade-off for one of </span><i><span>Reimagined</span></i><span>‘s better examples of streamlining: The dual job system, which lets you learn more than one job at a time. Yes, </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span> has a job system, but you’re going to be disappointed if you expect the kind of character fine-tuning that </span><i><span>Final Fantasy V</span></i><span> allows. </span></p>

 <p><span>You only have access to a job’s skills for as long as you’re wielding that job. The idea is to open up as many jobs as possible by mastering other jobs, until you finally unlock the high-tier jobs you’re going to want to keep for the rest of the game. “Learning” jobs feels more like speedrunning them in </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span>, but the job mixing and matching means you can make some pretty sick combinations of skills and spells that compliment each other. By the end of the game each fight starts to resemble a miniature episode of </span><i><span>Dragon Ball Z</span></i><span> as you and your foes trade blows of fire, ice, lighting, and steel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Do a Little Island-Hopping</b></h2> <p><span>The dual job system helps make </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> one of the friendlier </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> games for beginners. It’s not exactly easy, and bosses will still whup your under-prepared ass on a bad day. But it also lets you pull from a common pool of items in a fight (not something </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>games typically let you do), and HP/MP restoration points are plentiful. The random battles are still gone here, same as they’re gone on the 3DS, but </span><i><span>Reimagined</span></i><span> does you one better by letting you attack and kill weaker enemies on the overfield. You’re not awarded as much experience for these fights, but the rewards still add up and you build levels very quickly compared to other </span><i><span>Dragon Quest </span></i><span>games.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000665148" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665148"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665148">©Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This is the point where I infuriate people who ask me, “But is </span><i><span>this</span></i><span> the </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> game I should start with if I’m new to the series?” </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> is not a bad place to start thanks to its lower difficulty and simple-to-grok job system. But I personally wouldn’t recommend it, especially if you prefer games that let you wander far and wide. </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> is a wonderful remake of </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII</span></i><span> 2000, but as I said earlier, all </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII </span></i><span>can be is itself with its small islands, portals, and a lot of walking back and forth to fix specific problems like appeasing an active volcano or helping a kingdom fight against rampaging robots. I’d more easily recommend </span><i><span>Dragon Quest XI, </span></i><span>which is a great entry point for anyone curious about 3D </span><i><span>Dragon Quest.</span></i><span> And of course, there’s the trio of HD-2D games that lay out the origin of everything </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> is about. There’s nothing wrong with choosing </span><i><span>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</span></i><span> as your first </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span>, but remember what I said before? We </span><i><span>Dragon Quest</span></i><span> fans are spoiled for choice now. And with that last thought, celebrate and revel in our good fortune.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Roku Goes Big for the Super Bowl With Nearly 50% Off Its 2025 Streaming Stick HD]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/roku-goes-big-for-the-super-bowl-with-nearly-50-off-its-2025-streaming-stick-hd-2000665111</link>
            <guid>1423741</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>How old is the television sitting in your living room? Does it lack smart features and built-in streaming apps altogether? Or maybe it is a smart TV, but you’re simply not a fan of the manufacturer’s interface (yes, LG, this means your wannabe Wiimote-style motion controls). The good news is that you don’t have to stay stuck with whatever functionality your TV shipped with on day one. Grab a Roku streaming stick for next to nothing, and suddenly you’ve got a clean, dependable way to stream your favorite content and move through apps with ease. Under normal circumstances, the 2025 Roku Streaming Stick HD sells for around $30. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4493/">Right now, though, Amazon is offering a limited-time discount that drops the price by almost half, bringing it down to just $16.</a></p>
<p>This is the bare bones Roku streaming stick. This one doesn’t support 4K or HDR, but that’s not such a bad thing. The TV you’re putting it on might not support those either, so why pay extra for support you can’t actually take advantage of? Plus, so much content is only available in up to 1080p anyway so you’re really not missing out much.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4493/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Roku streaming stick is super low profile. It’s compact design allows it to just plug into an HDMI port on the back of your TV. It’s small enough that it won’t rudely block the other HDMI slots so you can still use them all for consoles or cable boxes or whatnot. The TV is also it’s source of power, so it won’t be taking up a valuable outlet along your power strip either.</p>
<h2>One Remote for Everything</h2>
<p>With the Roku streaming stick setup, you can use it’s remote to replace your TV remote for most daily use. It has volume controls and power controls, so unless you’re trying to adjust some specific setting on your TV (like turning off motion smoothing which you should be doing), the Roku remote will be the only remote you need to have out on your coffee table.</p>



<p>The remote even has a built-in voice function. This can be super useful when trying to pull up a specific movie or show. It’s far, far easier to just speak the words, “Jay &amp; Silent Bob Strike Back,” then it is to type all that out on a digital keyboard with arrow keys.</p>
<h2>Watch It All</h2>
<p>Not only does a Roku streaming device allow for you to access all the great streaming apps like HBO Max, Netflix, Hulu, and Apple TV, but Roku even comes with a number of free TV channels&nbsp; with live news, weather, sports coverage, and more. That number is over 500, actually.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Logitech Clears Out G29 Driving Force Racing Wheel and Floor Pedals at Its Cheapest Price, Perfect for PlayStation and PC Gaming]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/logitech-clears-out-g29-driving-force-racing-wheel-and-floor-pedals-at-its-cheapest-price-perfect-for-playstation-and-pc-gaming-2000665156</link>
            <guid>1423708</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Growing up playing Need for Speed, I always wondered what using real racing gear for the game would feel like. The Logitech G29 driving force racing wheel and floor pedals bring that idea to life, and right now, you can get your hands on it without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5725/">This wheel kit is now going for $270 at Amazon, which is a solid 18% discount on its usual $330 price tag.</a> While it’s not an all-time low, it’s still the best price we have seen in the last 30 days. The retailer is also offering free delivery with your purchase, which brings the total cost down even further. But as you’d expect, this offer is a limited-time one. It likely expires soon, so it’s best to get your orders in without wasting much time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5725/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Immersive, Responsive Gaming</h2>
<p>The wheel kit comes with a racing wheel and floor pedals. It’s optimized for PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC gaming titles, letting you enjoy the feeling of driving a real car with precision steering and pressure-sensitive pedals in the game.</p>
<p>There’s plenty to appreciate here. First, the wheel flaunts hand-stitched leather for a realistic feel. Then there’s dual-motor force feedback, which simulates the feel of tires on a turn, drifting, and oversteering, plus helical gearing to deliver smoother and quieter power transmission. The local-to-lock 900-degree rotation makes it incredibly easy to turn the wheel around two and a half times, hand over hand on wide turns – just like they do it in the movies.</p>



<p>You’ll also enjoy durable stainless steel paddle shifters right at your fingertips for quicker access. These help maintain consistency lap after lap, and especially come in handy during situations where every millisecond counts. Add in the high-strength mounting clamps, and you’re looking at supreme stability that keeps your car in place, even during intense sessions.</p>
<p>The floor pedals are just as impressive. This adjustable, pressure-sensitive nonlinear unit features an automotive-grade rolled steel throttle, pressure-sensitive brake, and clutch; all of which help with responsive braking and better control. You customize the pedal faces for finer control, too. Basically, this kit offers an immersive, hyper-realistic racing experience from the comfort of your home. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5725/">It normally sits at $330, but you can currently grab it for $270, after a solid 18% discount.</a></p>
<p>For an even better experience, you can consider pairing the G29 Racing Wheel with Logitech’s Driving Force Shifter and A10 Gaming Headset. The former offers a solid steel gear shaft and built-in clamps, while the latter delivers immersive, deep sound that brings your favorite titles to life. Just note that the current discount won’t be around forever. If you’ve been looking to upgrade the way you game, now is the time to make the move.</p>
