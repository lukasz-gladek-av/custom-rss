              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/dune-popcorn-bucket-barbie-ghostbusters-best-worst-1851336690"><span>Novelty popcorn buckets</span></a><span> are a real hit-or-miss trend, with many being so clumsily aggressive as pure marketing for whatever film they’re themed around that the actual utility for holding the salty, buttery goodness of your favorite theater’s popcorn falls by the wayside. But now and then, something interesting pops up and you see why movie studios are investing in these buckets of popcorn. </span><i><span>Now You See Me: Now You Don’t </span></i><span>is heading to theaters this weekend, and the magic-based crime drama has one of the better popcorn buckets I’ve seen lately, both because it’s actually practical as a popcorn bucket, and because it manages to capture the spirit of the movie without just being a replica of a character or item in the film.</span></p>

 <p><span>At a glance, the bucket looks like a pretty standard box with the </span><i><span>Now You Don’t </span></i><span>poster on the sides. However, it also uses an optical illusion to make it look as if the popcorn disappears, like it would in a magic trick. There’s a hidden compartment that helps sell the trick, and if you’re looking at it from the right angle, it does truly look like the kind of illusion you’d see in a magician’s stage show.</span></p>   <p><span>Like most optical illusions, if you know the secret, your eyes will probably adapt and see the truth, but it is still a pretty cool popcorn bucket that doesn’t just feel like an elaborate collectible statue with a popcorn-shaped hole on the side. The next question is: Is it worth going to see </span><i><span>Now You See Me: Now You Don’t</span></i><span> to get it? Eh. Despite the series’ stacked cast and neat premise of magic-based heists, they’ve never really gotten much critical acclaim. </span><i><span>Now You Don’t </span></i><span>is sitting at a series high on review aggregate site </span><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/now_you_see_me_now_you_dont_2025"><i><span>Rotten Tomatoes</span></i></a><span> with a 60 percent approval rating. So I guess they’re getting better? </span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><em>Arc Raiders</em> is a great game</a> with a complicated legacy thanks to its use of generative AI to voice NPCs. It’s the same strategy Embark Studios used with The Finals, and the CEO of publisher Nexon now says fans should get used to it.</p> <p>“First of all, I think it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI,” Junghun Lee told Japanese outlet <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/10/159294.html"><em>Game*Spark</em></a>, according to a <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/its-important-to-assume-every-game-company-is-now-using-ai-nexon-ceo-comments-on-role-of-human-creativity-as-ai-tools-become-the-norm/">translation by Automaton</a>. “But if everyone is working with the same or similar technologies, the real question becomes: how do you survive? I believe it’s important to choose a strategy that increases your competitiveness.”</p>

 <p>He believes generative AI will increase the capabilities of game studios across the board, thus increasing the “average” quality. ” AI has definitely improved efficiency in both game production and live service operations,” Lee said.</p>

 <p>His comments come after fellow South Korea game publisher Krafton revealed an “<a href="https://www.krafton.com/news/press/%ed%81%ac%eb%9e%98%ed%94%84%ed%86%a4-ai-first-%ea%b8%b0%ec%97%85-%ec%a0%84%ed%99%98-%ec%84%a0%ec%96%b8-1000%ec%96%b5-%ec%9b%90-%ec%9d%b4%ec%83%81-%ed%88%ac%ec%9e%90/">AI first</a>” plan to invest roughly $70 million in GPU clusters and related resources to build out an infrastructure for deploying agentic AI across the company. Krafton happens to own the makers of <em>PUBG</em>, <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, and <em>Subnautica 2</em>.</p>

 <p>But the deployment of AI in games remains controversial and confusing, as proved by Nexon’s own <em>Arc Raiders</em>.</p> <h2>No one agrees on what counts as generative AI</h2> <p>“<em>Arc Raiders</em>&nbsp;in no way uses generative AI whatsoever,” design director Virgil Watkins claimed during a new interview&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/generative-ai-use">with&nbsp;<em>PCGamesN</em></a>. But in addition to using machine learning during the development process, the hit Steam extraction shooter also uses text-to-speech models to voice all of the NPC barks for every random item and situation.</p>

 <p>“[Text-to-speech] allows us to increase the scope of the game in some areas where we think it’s needed, or where there’s tedious repetition, in situations where the voice actors may not see it as valuable work,” Embark Studios CCO Stefan Strandberg told Eurogamer last month. “So it’s a wide umbrella, but the experience of the game doesn’t use any generative AI.”</p>

 <p>Others disagree, including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review"><em>Eurogamer</em>‘s own review</a> which became a flash point on social media this week after it critiqued Arc Raiders use of AI voices. “[Machine learning] is an interesting technology, and the effects it produces during matches are undeniably convincing,” wrote Rick Lane. “The same cannot be said about Embark’s generated voice lines, which are aggressively mediocre and a stain on the experience.”</p> <p>There are also those who take issue with Nexon’s CEO’s assumption everyone must be racing to embrace generative AI more generally. “Hello, not only do we not use AI we would rather cut off our own arms than do so,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/necrosoftgames.com/post/3m5fpw7lp7s2d">wrote</a> indie team <a href="https://aftermath.site/podcasts/aftermath-hours-podcast-demonschool-delay-silksong/">Necrosoft Games</a>. “<em>Demonschool</em> is 100% human made.”</p>

              <p>The LEGO Star Wars line has been the crown jewel of the brick builder’s empire for decades and good discounts on these sets are rare. That’s what makes this current deal so good: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">has cut the price of the LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon 25th Anniversary Edition down from $84 to $67</a>&nbsp;which is an all-time low for a set that boasts an impressive<strong> 4.9 out of 5-star rating</strong> from over 1,900 reviews.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Stunning LEGO Set</h2>
<p>This is not your typical LEGO build that gets assembled once and then tossed into a closet: The <strong>921-piece recreation of the Millennium Falcon</strong> captures the ship as it appeared in <em>Star Wars: A New Hope</em>, complete with authentic details that will make any fan smile. The cockpit sits exactly where it should, the iconic satellite dish perches on top-the round one, naturally and the quad laser cannons are positioned to defend against Imperial TIE fighters.</p>
<p>The base also includes a <strong>nameplate and a special 25th Anniversary commemorative brick</strong>, and celebrates a quarter-century of LEGO Star Wars collaboration. Angled dynamically, the stand sets the ship in motion even when it’s just sitting on your shelf or desk. This thoughtful design transforms the model from a simple toy into legitimate home décor that sparks conversations. Measuring <strong>5 inches high, 9.5 inches long, and 7.5 inches wide,</strong> the completed build claims enough presence to anchor a bookshelf or entertainment center without overwhelming the space.</p>



<p>The building experience itself has that meditative quality LEGO has nailed with its adult-oriented sets. <strong>Each of the 921 pieces</strong> clicks into place with satisfying precision, while the instruction manual walks you through a logical construction sequence that builds excitement as the recognizable shape emerges. You’ll spend several hours immersed in this project, which is exactly the point for those seeking a creative outlet after a long day.</p>
<p>Timing makes this discount appealing as a gift option: For yourself or someone who considers Star Wars a lifestyle rather than a movie franchise, this set delivers on real value at this price point.&nbsp;At this historic low price, the barrier to entry for owning a piece of LEGO Star Wars history has never been lower.</p>
