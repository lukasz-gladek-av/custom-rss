One solution to this problem is to use Hall Effect thumbsticks that are basically resistant to drifting as they use <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor#Human_interface_devices&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor#Human_interface_devices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">magnetic fields</a></span> and are less susceptible to parts wearing down and failing over time. Unfortunately, Nintendo isn’t using Hall Effect sticks for the Switch 2 Joy-Cons and that has a lot of fans nervous. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/its-official-switch-2-joy-con-will-not-feature-hall-effect-sticks&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/its-official-switch-2-joy-con-will-not-feature-hall-effect-sticks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a recent interview with <em>Nintendo Life</em></a></span>, Nate Bihldorff, senior vice president of product development &amp; publishing at Nintendo of America, confirmed that the Switch 2 doesn’t use Hall Effect sticks. </p><p>“Well, the Joy-Con 2's controllers have been designed from the ground up. They’re not Hall Effect sticks, but they feel really good,” said Bihldorff. </p><p>Bihldorff further explained that the sticks on the Pro Contoller are very quiet and feel great, but didn’t specify if they are Hall Effect thumbsticks or not. Based on the fact that Bihldorff’s media training kicked in when asked about stick drift (a negative topic) and he pivoted to something related, but positive, I’m guessing the Pro Controller also doesn’t have Hall Effect sticks. </p><p>The VP did reiterate something Nintendo previously confirmed, which is that the Joy-Con 2 controllers have been completely redesigned from the ground up. </p><p> “As you may have witnessed and felt, the new Joy-Con 2 controllers for the Nintendo Switch 2 have been really designed from the ground up from scratch, and they have been designed to have bigger movement and smoother movement,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-stick-drift-joy-con-eshop-fix-better-nintendo-1851774614&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-stick-drift-joy-con-eshop-fix-better-nintendo-1851774614">said Switch 2 hardware design lead Tetsuya Sasaki last week during a press event.</a></span> </p><p>That’s nice and all, but if you look at the replies to<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/nintendolife/status/1909230951323877448&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/nintendolife/status/1909230951323877448" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <em>Nintendo Life</em>’s tweet about the lack of Hall Effect sticks</a></span>, you can see a lot of people who are worried that the Switch 2 will be plagued with stick drift issues. This news, coupled with high prices, delayed pre-orders, and questions about what is included in a Switch 2 physical game case, have really overshadowed what was likely supposed to be a big, fun reveal for Nintendo. It will be interesting to see how the company navigates the current storm. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As Jack Black’s Steve introduces the newly arrived humans to his village, young teenager Henry sees a pig walk past wearing a crown. He asks, “Is he some kind of king?” And for those in the know, the blubbing begins.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>If you’re a follower of <em>Minecraft</em> on YouTube, or the parent of one, you’ll inevitably have heard of Technoblade. The YouTuber, whose real name was Alexander, tragically died from cancer in 2022, aged only 22. A member of Dream SMP, which featured many of the biggest names in the field, Technoblade became known for his incredible skill at the game, and for a YouTube channel with 11 million subscribers.</p><p>Since his untimely death, Technoblade has been canonized by his contemporaries and followers, his name spoken with a lovely reverence. My own kid, only really getting into <em>Minecraft </em>YouTube since Technoblade’s passing, has learned this reverential tone and almost whispers his name. The point is, he was a great YouTuber, respected by his peers, and someone who actively fought against fame for the protection of his family. (His first name only became known after he died, and his last name is still unknown.) One of the many lines of text that can appear when you launch <em>Minecraft </em>reads “Technoblade never dies!”</p><p>So back to that scene in <em>A Minecraft Movie</em>. The bejeweled pig that Henry spots is a reference to Technoblade, whose in-game avatar was a bipedal pig wearing a crown (as seen in the image at the top of this article). The character asks, “Is he some kind of king?”</p><p>“No,” says Jack Black, before a long pause. Then with gravitas adds, “He’s a <em>legend</em>.”</p><p>You can see the moment in somewhat dubiously sourced footage in the following video:</p><p>Before the line had been delivered, just when the pig appeared on screen, all around me in the movie theater I heard kids going, “Technoblade!” with absolute delight in their voices. My son leant over to me and whispered with wide eyes, “That was Technoblade! That pig was Technoblade!” When he explained the reference to my wife in the parking lot as we left, and then solemnly delivered the “No, he’s a legend” line, she cried. She’d never even heard of him before, but the sincerity and touching nature of the tribute—it’s making me well up a bit as I type.</p><p>It turns out it’s only in the movie thanks to the kid playing Henry. According to an interview with director Jared Hess <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://collider.com/a-minecraft-movie-easter-eggs-technoblade-director-jared-hess-torfi-frans-olafsson/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://collider.com/a-minecraft-movie-easter-eggs-technoblade-director-jared-hess-torfi-frans-olafsson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by <em>Collider</em></a></span>, Sebastian Hansen approached him during the film’s prep and said, “Look, there’s this amazing <em>Minecraft</em> player named Technoblade who passed away, and I would love to be able to honor him somehow in the film.” Hess says he spoke with the design team, and they worked it all out.</p><p>It’s fun to note there were many other easter eggs hidden in there for <em>Minecraft</em> diehards, like a Totem of Undying in Steve’s collection that would make the characters’ journey so much easier if only they knew what it was. And there was another theaterful of excited murmuring when Mojang’s Jens Bergensten appears as a silent waiter in a blink-or-miss-it moment. But of all the film’s fleeting nods to this or that, the tribute to Technoblade is the most special, and no doubt the one that will cause the most lips to quiver with emotion.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can even break off chunks of the world and use that to destroy stuff.

If you go off and explore a corner of the map for 30 minutes, when you return to where you started you’ll see all the damage you previously wrought. And all of this devastation is recreated in real-time in <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>’s in-game map!</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="13259bcdea622ef8eb5dc8214a78c7b7" data-recommend-id="image://13259bcdea622ef8eb5dc8214a78c7b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="13259bcdea622ef8eb5dc8214a78c7b7" data-recommend-id="image://13259bcdea622ef8eb5dc8214a78c7b7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Not only can you punch and destroy nearly every square inch of the levels in <em>Bananza</em>, but all this material behaves differently depending on what it is. </p><p>For example, a chunk of soft mud can’t break hard rock or metal, but you can toss it at enemies or walls and it will stick. On the flip side, harder materials can be ripped out of the ground and used as temporary hammers to increase Donkey Kong’s destructive power. It’s the kind of feature that’s hard to sell in a trailer but will likely help the game feel more next gen.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8ce4ce715c87f91fe81ca8726dde1241" data-recommend-id="image://8ce4ce715c87f91fe81ca8726dde1241" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8ce4ce715c87f91fe81ca8726dde1241" data-recommend-id="image://8ce4ce715c87f91fe81ca8726dde1241" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In <em>Bananza </em>you don’t simply have a punch button. Instead, you have three punch buttons letting you punch up, down, and forward. You can also slap the ground to reveal hidden items buried beneath rock and dirt. Or just slap the ground to break stuff in a different way. Whatever you feel like.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b67fa713ecda720cc17e1cae692eec36" data-recommend-id="image://b67fa713ecda720cc17e1cae692eec36" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b67fa713ecda720cc17e1cae692eec36" data-recommend-id="image://b67fa713ecda720cc17e1cae692eec36" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Why is Donkey Kong destroying everything? What is his motivation? Well, he’s trying to collect a new material that has appeared call Banandium. This is a valuable mineral that can be found hidden around the map and which act like Mario’s stars. However, Donkey Kong eats Banandium when he finds it. Seems dangerous, but what do I know?</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c42f43285190ba62b4369eb42ba6665c" data-recommend-id="image://c42f43285190ba62b4369eb42ba6665c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c42f43285190ba62b4369eb42ba6665c" data-recommend-id="image://c42f43285190ba62b4369eb42ba6665c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>is very different than past <em>DK</em> games, Nintendo isn’t ditching the past completely.
