We later find out that her son, Constantine (Josh Heuston), didn’t send a message to her requesting her presence as she believed, but instead it was Valya who surreptitiously summoned her without informing her that a fellow <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-prophecy-desmond-hart-pruwet-richese-1851700621&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-prophecy-desmond-hart-pruwet-richese-1851700621">Bene Gesserit</a></span>—Kasha (Jihae)—had been killed. After Valya catches her up on the Sisterhood losing its hold on the royal palace with Emperor Corrino refusing to have a Truthsayers, Francesca returns to sway Emperor Corrino in favor of appointing Constantine as the leader of his new fleet, without him knowing he was being manipulated to do so.</p><p>However, Valya doesn’t simply order Francesca to do so with the Voice or with threats, but rather by appealing to Francesca’s love of her son. Francesca is the trump card she’s playing now that her previous attempts to remind Emperor Corrino of the order’s influence on him have backfired. Remember, Valya’s ultimate plan is to have Emperor Corrino’s daughter Ynez (Sarah-Sofie Boussnina) study to become a Bene Gesserit so that the Sisterhood can have one of their own sitting on the throne of the Imperium to protect them from any impending trouble. For an unspecified (but clearly lengthy) period of time, Francesca wasn’t able to be around Constantine. Speaking with <em>Kotaku</em>, Tabu says she thinks that is what underscores the character’s hidden power.  </p><p> “I think she was purposely kept away from the son because for Valya, it could have been dangerous if Francesca was lurking around in the palace. Francesca has a very powerful position if she wants to utilize it. She can play her take-the-son card anytime she wants because  he is the natural heir to the to the throne.”</p><figure id="" data-id="6db9dae3cdc3cadfad3aa9c97bd4176d" data-recommend-id="image://6db9dae3cdc3cadfad3aa9c97bd4176d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="960" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sister Francesca looking at Valya" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sister Francesca looking at Valya" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Attila Szvacsek/HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6db9dae3cdc3cadfad3aa9c97bd4176d" data-recommend-id="image://6db9dae3cdc3cadfad3aa9c97bd4176d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="960" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sister Francesca looking at Valya" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>She reasons that Francesca was kept away so “she does not become powerful, put her son on the throne, and turn against Valya.” Judging by the way Emperor Corrino nearly leapt on her in a moment of passion the minute he saw her, Francesca has a strong hold on his heart, which means she can control him. Her mere suggestion that the Emperor give his son more responsibility was enough to lead him to appoint Constantine the leader of his new fleet. If she’d been around during her son’s upbringing, who’s to say Francesca couldn’t have swayed Javicco to let Constantine be the next leader of the Imperium?</p><p>That question becomes harder to answer when you factor in how she refuses the Emperor’s romantic advances in the beginning of the episode, before submitting to them near the end. This could easily be looked at as typical Bene Gesserit sexual manipulation. However, the woman who plays Sister Francesca doesn’t think it’s so easy to determine. “She says she does not want to come between him and his wife, but she has very strong feelings for the emperor. She also wants to secure a place for her son,” she explains. “I don’t think she was just playing him for the sake of the Bene Gesserit.”</p><p>No Bene Gesserit is more closely tied to the throne than Francesca, which makes her one of the most powerful members of the sisterhood on the show in terms of influence. We’ll have to wait until the final episode to see if that influence helps or hurts Valya in the end. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The free-to-play third-person hero shooter has quickly become one of the biggest games of the year, with hundreds of thousands of players logging in every day, just on Steam alone.

Meanwhile, as someone who loves Jeff and plays with him a lot, I’m very excited about this new mode and Jeff’s adorable ski outfit. </p><p>Interestingly, this new limited-time holiday mode looks to basically be a knock-off version of Nintendo’s <em>Splatoon</em>. Four Jeffs take on four other Jeffs to spray snow across the map and try to cover as much of it as they can before the time runs out. So it looks like NetEase is willing to pull from other games beyond <em>Overwatch </em>for “inspiration.” </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Mun who ends up stranded on a planet called Sempiria. Communication with the planet has been dark for over 600 years, and no one has left its orbit in all that time. Jordan goes to Sempiria in search of members of the Five Aces crime syndicate, apparently because she’s in desperate need of the bounty. They seemingly have history, as in Jordan’s ship, we see a photo of her and what appears to be other members of the group, though the specifics of her relationship with them are unconfirmed. Once she reaches the planet’s surface, she’s faced by hostile robots and likely other dangers.</p><p>That’s the gist of what we know of the main plot, but as far as the larger world of <em>Intergalactic</em>, director Neil Druckmann explained to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/arts/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-druckmann.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/12/arts/intergalactic-heretic-prophet-naughty-dog-druckmann.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The New York Times</em></a></span><em> </em>that Jordan’s story will also include some kind of fictional religion at the center and explore “what happens when you put your faith in different institutions.” Druckmann also said that <em>Intergalactic </em>takes place in an alternate future in which space travel had become pretty advanced by the 1980s. That’s why you’ll notice several retrofuturistic elements in Jordan’s space ship, including a CD player on which she spins “It’s a Sin” by the Pet Shop Boys and a CRT television on which she watches anime.</p><p><em>Intergalactic</em>’s reveal trailer definitely feels like it’s cut from the same cloth as <em>Uncharted </em>and <em>The Last of Us</em> in terms of being a “prestige” cinematic story-driven game, and Druckmann says much of the team’s inspiration came from anime like <em>Akira </em>and <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>. Fans have even noted that some details in the trailer appear to be homages to <em>Akira</em>, from Jordan’s red jacket to the CD player in her ship.</p><h2 id="h1583"><a id=""></a><strong>Who’s involved?</strong></h2><p>While we only know the broad strokes of the game’s story and haven’t seen any actual gameplay yet, we do know a fair number of the key personnel attached to <em>Intergalactic</em>. Druckmann is the creative director after leading both <em>The Last of Us </em>games and <em>Uncharted 4</em>, with Naughty Dog veterans Matthew Gallant and Kurt Margenau both acting as game directors.</p><p>Jordan is played by actor Tati Gabrielle, who Naughty Dog fans may recognize from her role in the <em>Uncharted </em>movie as mercenary leader Jo Braddock, a character who kinda felt like a stand-in for <em>Uncharted 4</em> and <em>Lost Legacy</em>’s antagonist-turned-ally Nadine Ross. By the time <em>Intergalactic </em>is out, fans will likely be even more acquainted with her, as she plays Nora in <em>The Last of Us</em>’ upcoming second season.</p><p>Outside of Gabrielle, we know a few other actors who will make an appearance in <em>Intergalactic</em>. Halley Gross, the co-writer and narrative lead on <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>, will play AJ, Jordan’s agent, as seen in the announcement trailer. <em>The Big Sick </em>and <em>Eternals </em>actor Kumail Nanjiani will appear as Colin Graves, one of the Five Aces Jordan is hunting. <em>Better Call Saul </em>actor Tony Dalton is also playing a member of the Five Aces, but the character’s name is unknown right now. Troy Baker, who plays Joel in <em>The Last of Us </em>games and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-ep-8-david-scott-shepherd-nolan-north-1850181044&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-last-of-us-ep-8-david-scott-shepherd-nolan-north-1850181044">James in the HBO series</a></span>, is also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/troy-baker-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-indiana-jones-1851707293&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/troy-baker-neil-druckmann-naughty-dog-indiana-jones-1851707293">confirmed to play a character in <em>Intergalactic</em></a></span>.</p><p>Lastly, the duo of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross are composing music for the game. The two have written countless scores for films over the years, with some recent standouts including <em>Challengers </em>and <em>Queer</em>. This marks their first time working on a video game score together.</p><h2 id="h1584"><a id=""></a><strong>What’s the plan for the future?</strong></h2><p>Druckmann told <em>The New York Times</em> that Naughty Dog had been restructured as “an IP powerhouse” following <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547">layoffs</a></span> over the past year, and the studio is aiming for <em>Intergalactic </em>to become a big new franchise for PlayStation. Whether or not that comes to pass will depend on how the first game does, but given Sony’s propensity to milk games for spin-offs and external media, I wouldn’t doubt that Sony wants <em>Intergalactic </em>to spawn sequels and maybe some TV or movie adaptations. Naughty Dog is already <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/intergalactic_the_heretic_prophet_announcement&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/intergalactic_the_heretic_prophet_announcement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">presenting the game as a “franchise”</a></span> in its official announcement, so it sounds like expectations for this one are pretty high. We’ll see how it all pans out at some point in the coming months or years, as right now we don’t know when <em>Intergalactic </em>will actually make its way to our PlayStation 5s.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
