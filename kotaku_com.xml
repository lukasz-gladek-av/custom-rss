However, instead he was physically assaulted by the person he’d arranged to meet, who then stole the card and drove away.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.police.nsw.gov.au/news/news_article?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGZWJpenByZC5wb2xpY2UubnN3Lmdvdi5hdSUyRm1lZGlhJTJGMTE4MTUzLmh0bWwmYWxsPTE%3D&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.police.nsw.gov.au/news/news_article?sq_content_src=%2BdXJsPWh0dHBzJTNBJTJGJTJGZWJpenByZC5wb2xpY2UubnN3Lmdvdi5hdSUyRm1lZGlhJTJGMTE4MTUzLmh0bWwmYWxsPTE%3D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to a police report</a></span> issued by the New South Wales police department, the incident took place on March 28, but the police are only now appealing for help with identifying a car that was photographed leaving the scene, a red Ford Mustang. The incredibly blurry image was posted to the force’s X page, with what seems like a wildly inappropriate comment given the violence involved.</p><p>“Turns out Team Rocket’s not the only one causing trouble...” the post begins. After detailing the crime, it continues, “[we] believe the driver may have info that could help us catch ‘em all (or at least the one responsible).” The post then adds, “don’t just sit there like a Snorlax - contact Crime Stoppers.” Er, great everyone. Good stuff.</p><p>It’s unclear where the 8,000 AUD valuation comes from. <em>ABC</em> reports that the cops said the card was a Base Set Unlimited holo Charizard, graded 9, but non-1st edition Base Set Charizards tend to only sell for around 1,500 USD (2,300 AUD). You need a PSA 10 to see the big values, where it shoots up to almost $9k.</p><p>My guess would be that this was a far more rare “shadowless” version of the card, a printing of the set that saw the shadow effect to the right of the window art forgotten. At a grade 9, those are currently valued at just under 5,000 USD, or 8,000 AUD. (A 1st Edition PSA 9 Charizard, meanwhile, goes for an eye-watering $23,000, while PSA 10 fetches over a quarter of a million dollars.)</p><p><em>Pokémon TCG</em> card robberies are becoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-cards-robbery-crime-japan-valuable-thieves-70k-1851647292&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-cards-robbery-crime-japan-valuable-thieves-70k-1851647292">concerningly</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-cards-paldean-fates-tofu-trading-break-in-1851208974&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-cards-paldean-fates-tofu-trading-break-in-1851208974">commonplace</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-tcg-fusion-strike-full-art-bad-pulls-theft-1850343930&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-tcg-fusion-strike-full-art-bad-pulls-theft-1850343930">at this point</a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-14/pokemon-card-store-melbourne-burglaries/104933558&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-14/pokemon-card-store-melbourne-burglaries/104933558" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>ABC </em>in Australia reports</a></span> that Melbourne has seen a “string of <em>Pokémon</em> card burglaries,” with a million dollars’ worth of cards stolen across six months.</p><p>Earlier this month, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://capcity.news/crime/2025/04/04/3300-pokemon-card-stolen-cheyenne-man-arrested/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://capcity.news/crime/2025/04/04/3300-pokemon-card-stolen-cheyenne-man-arrested/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a similar parking lot robbery</a></span> took place in Cheyenne, Wyoming, with the ironically named Justice Earl Geho arrested for taking the $3,300 card without paying.
