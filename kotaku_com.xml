Luckily, not every Switch 2 from Target was delayed by multiple days. But if your console was, you can likely grab a free $50 eShop gift card from the retail giant. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Wario64/status/1938309454581088412&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1938309454581088412" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As shared by deals guru Wario64 on social media</a></span>, Target has started sending out email messages to customers who pre-ordered a Switch 2 console but received it later than expected.</p><p>“We know you were hoping to receive your [Switch 2] sooner,” wrote Target. “Unfortunately, we didn’t make that happen. This isn’t the experience we intended, and we’re sincerely sorry. As a thank you for your patience and understanding, we’re including a complimentary code for one $50 Nintendo eShop Gift Card.”</p><p>To redeem the gift card, you’ll need to add a $50 eShop card to your Target cart and check out while logged into the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.target.com/l/target-circle/-/N-pzno9&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.target.com/l/target-circle/-/N-pzno9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Target Circle account</a></span> that you used when ordering the Switch 2. If done correctly, assuming your Switch 2 was late, the $50 card will be discounted to $0. </p><p>There is a catch, because of course there is. There’s always a catch. In this case, Target seems to only be offering the $50 eShop card to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Wario64/status/1938317840601518267&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1938317840601518267" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people who pre-ordered a Switch 2 and received it on or after June 7</a></span>. However, some people have contacted support and claim to have still been able to get a $15 Target gift card if the console was only a day late. </p><p>Either way, if Target screwed you over while trying to buy a Switch 2, you owe it to yourself and your wallet to log into your account and see if you can get a free gift card for your trouble. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/target-switch-2-late-delivery-gift-card-eshop-nintendo-1851785182]]></content:encoded>
