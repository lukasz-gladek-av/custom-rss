            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon blew away Black Friday price expectations by lowering the price of the <strong>Fitbit Charge 6 to an all-time low</strong>, and this made high-end fitness tracking suddenly affordable for everyone. The big store decided to match that big discount for Cyber Monday and shows that it really wants to take over the fitness tracker market this holiday season.</p>
<p>The Charge 6 is a slim wristband that doesn’t look like a fitness tracker like bigger smartwatches and it has accurate heart rate monitoring, built-in GPS, Google app integration, and full health tracking. Right now, Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5344/"> has this fitness powerhouse on sale for $99, down from its usual price of $159</a> (which is a new record low).</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5344/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Heart Rate Monitoring</h2>
<p>The Charge 6 has the <strong>best heart rate monitoring of any Fitbit ever made</strong>, and it has better optical sensors and smarter algorithms that get rid of motion artifacts. That level of accuracy is important because the tracker can now send your heart rate directly to gym equipment that works with it via Bluetooth. This means you don’t have to wear chest straps like many cardio machines do for heart rate training programs. The <strong>built-in GPS keeps track of your outdoor runs, walks, and bike rides</strong> with the same level of accuracy as dedicated running watches.</p>
<p>The <strong>Fitbit Charge 6’s touchscreen</strong> interface lets you control YouTube Music, navigate Google Maps and make payments with Google Wallet right from your wrist. That ecosystem connection makes the tracker a useful everyday device instead of just a workout buddy. You can switch songs while you run, get turn-by-turn directions to new places, or pay for coffee without taking out your wallet.</p>



<p>Comprehensive health tracking goes beyond just counting steps as it also keeps an eye on heart rate variability, blood oxygen levels while you sleep, changes in skin temperature, and stress management through guided breathing exercises. <em>Zone of Activity Minutes</em> count how long you spend in high heart rate zones during workouts, so you get credit for intensity as well as duration.</p>
<p>With normal use, <strong>like 24/7 heart rate monitoring, daily GPS workouts, and notification sync</strong>, the battery lasts about seven days. This means you don’t have to charge it every night like most smartwatches do. You can track your sleep every night without worrying about the battery dying because it lasts for a week. You only need to remember to charge it once a week. The slim design fits comfortably under shirt cuffs and doesn’t get caught on clothes or make pressure points when worn all day.</p>



<p>Smart notifications keep you connected by <strong>showing calls, texts, and app alerts on the color touchscreen</strong> of the tracker. However, the only way to respond on Android devices is with quick replies. In addition to fitness features, calendar alerts, weather updates, and timer functions make the device useful every day. The Fitbit app lets you sync the <strong>device wirelessly with both iOS and Android phones</strong> and it also has detailed analytics, trend tracking, and social features that let you compete with friends through challenges.</p>
<p>When you think about how much similar fitness trackers cost (between $150 and $200 without Google integration or heart rate broadcasting from gym equipment) getting the Fitbit Charge 6 for $99 is a great deal. For less than $100, you can get a tracker that will help you train smarter, learn more about your body, and stay in touch all day long.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-clears-out-airpods-pro-3-for-cyber-monday-liquidates-black-friday-leftovers-at-record-low-price-2000648949</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple just came out with the AirPods Pro 3 a few months ago, and as usual, the company won’t directly discount its newest high-end earbuds. Amazon really stepped up on Black Friday with a big price drop on these great wireless earbuds and the good news is that the store decided to keep the discount going and even make it bigger for Cyber Monday. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">Amazon has them marked down to $219 right now, reduced from Apple’s standard $249 price</a>, creating the best deal we’ve seen on these earbuds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Double Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>The <strong>AirPods Pro 3 block out twice as much unwanted noise as the already great AirPods Pro 2</strong>, and they create isolation that is as good as that of over-ear headphones, but in a small in-ear package. That better noise cancellation works by using microphones that pick up sounds from the outside world and computer-generated audio that creates exact anti-noise in real time.</p>
<p>When<strong> you turn on transparency mode</strong>, the earbuds let outside sounds in so you can hear conversations and environmental cues without taking them off. Apple improved this mode by adding active hearing protection that automatically lowers loud sounds from the environment like construction noise or subway screeches, while still letting normal sounds through.</p>



<p>The new acoustic architecture changes the sound quality by <strong>giving the bass more depth, making the voices sound</strong> incredibly clear across the frequency range, and making the vocals sound incredibly present. <strong>Dynamic head tracking and spatial audio</strong> make three-dimensional soundscapes that put sound sources around you in space. This makes movies and supported music feel more immersive than traditional stereo can.</p>
<p>Heart rate sensing is a real game-changer for earbuds because they have built-in sensors that track your pulse while you work out without needing chest straps or wrist-based monitors. The earbuds keep track of heart rate and calories burned <strong>during more than 50 different types of workouts</strong>, and they then automatically sync this data to Apple Health for full fitness tracking. When you connect your iPhone, you can use the activity rings, step counting, and the new Workout Buddy feature powered by Apple Intelligence that gives you personalized training suggestions.</p>



<p><strong>Apple Intelligence’s live translation</strong> feature makes it possible to talk to people who speak different languages by providing real-time translation. The feature works by processing speech on your iPhone and translating between supported languages, and the translation plays through your earbuds while the other person hears their native language through your phone’s speaker. This conversational translation works well enough for travel, business meetings, or casual conversations where language differences would normally make it hard to communicate.</p>
<p>When you turn on active noise cancellation, the battery lasts for eight hours. When you use transparency mode with the hearing aid feature on, the battery lasts for up to ten hours. That runtime lasts through full workdays, long flights, or long listening sessions without needing to charge the case. The USB-C charging case lets you charge your device multiple times, <strong>and gives you more than 30 hours of total listening time</strong> before you need to plug it in. <strong>Five different ear tip sizes</strong> make sure that everyone can find a secure, comfortable fit that creates the right acoustic seal for the best noise cancellation and bass response.</p>
<p>When you think about how these just came out a few months ago and Apple never directly discounts new products, getting the AirPods Pro 3 for $219 is a good deal. These earbuds are on sale for Cyber Monday for $30 less than their regular price, and they have features that other products won’t have for years.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Roborock Q7 Max+ With 9 Weeks Self-Empty Crashes to Record Low, Cyber Monday Goes Zero Profit for Final Clearance]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-q7-max-with-9-weeks-self-empty-crashes-to-record-low-cyber-monday-goes-zero-profit-for-final-clearance-2000648933</link>
            <guid>1368784</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock makes a lot more than just the high-end flagship $1000+ models that get a lot of attention in tech reviews and forums for fans. The brand makes cheaper models that still have important features like self-emptying docks and these are some of the best value options on the robot vacuum market.</p>
<p>For instance, the Q7 M5+ has 10,000Pa of suction, two brushes that don’t tangle, LiDAR navigation and a base that empties itself and holds up to seven weeks of debris – and it costs a lot less than some flagship models. The good news is that Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/">has just cut the price of this combo to $219 for Cyber Monday, down from its usual price of $359</a> and this is the lowest price ever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easy to empty yourself without the high price tag</h2>
<p>The<strong> RockDock Plus base station automatically empties the robot’s dustbin</strong> into a sealed bag <strong>that holds about seven to nine weeks’ worth of dirt, pet hair</strong>&nbsp;and other debris, depending on how big your home is and how messy it is. Because of that extra space, you can basically forget about taking care of your vacuum for almost two months.</p>
<p>Instead of emptying dustbins after every cleaning session, you can just check in every so often to change bags. The sealed bag system keeps allergens and fine dust particles from getting into the air when you empty it by hand and it makes it perfect for homes with allergies or sensitivities. When the bag is full, you can quickly lift it up and put it back down again without making dust clouds or having to touch the dirt that has built up.</p>
<p>The<strong> 10,000Pa HyperForce suction picks up everything from fine dust on hardwood floors to pet hair</strong> that has been stuck in carpets without needing to go over the same area more than once: That level of suction is comparable to models that cost twice as much, and it works well on all types of floors. Roborock made the dual anti-tangle system with JawScrapers’ main brush technology which stops hair from getting stuck in the roller and it also has a side brush that won’t get tangled even when cleaning up long human hair or shedding from double-coated dogs.</p>



<p>PreciSense LiDAR navigation makes precise floor plans of your home and shows where rooms and furniture are so that you can clean them more quickly. Unlike older models,<strong> this vacuum doesn’t bump around your space at random</strong> and instead, it follows planned paths that make sure it covers everything without going over the same area more than once. You can also use the Roborock app to set no-go zones so that the vacuum doesn’t go near pet food bowls, delicate rugs, or places with cables. Virtual walls make boundaries without needing to put up physical barriers.</p>
<p>This <strong>combination vacuum and mop can pick up both dry and sticky messes</strong> in one pass: It automatically switches between modes based on the type of floor and your preferences. With three adjustable water flow settings, you can choose how much water to use when mopping. For example, you can use light moisture on sealed hardwood or heavier flow on tile and laminate that can handle more water.</p>



<p>The vacuum works just as well on carpets as it does on hard floors because it automatically adjusts the suction power when it detects rugs or carpets and lowers it on hard surfaces to save battery life. The edge cleaning works well because the side brush can get into corners and along baseboards where dirt builds up. The <strong>design is small enough to fit under furniture and around chair legs</strong>&nbsp;which lets it get to places that upright vacuums can’t.</p>
<p>For $219, you can get the Roborock Q7 M5+ with its self-emptying dock and it is a great deal because similar systems from iRobot or Shark usually cost between $400 and $600. Here you can get a robot vacuum system that makes it easy to keep your floors clean every day.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/macbooks-survived-black-friday-and-apple-went-even-lower-new-record-low-for-cyber-monday-2000648940</link>

              <p>Apple avoids running direct promotions on its products but Amazon has taken matters into its own hands with aggressive discounting throughout this shopping season. The online giant crushed MacBook Air M4 sales during Black Friday after slashing prices significantly, but Cyber Monday brings an even deeper cut that pushes the deal into record territory.</p>
<p>Right now, the 2025 MacBook Air with the M4 chip, 16GB unified memory, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/">256GB storage is going for $738, down from Apple’s standard $999 price</a> and undercuts even the Black Friday deal by roughly $10<strong> to hit an all-time low for Cyber Monday</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>M4 Chip Performance</h2>
<p>The M4 chip has desktop-level performance that can handle tough tasks like editing 4K video, doing complicated spreadsheet calculations, or running multiple virtual machines without breaking a sweat. Apple’s second-generation 3-nanometer architecture packs more transistors into less space while using less power which means that it can process data faster and use less power than the already impressive M3 generation.</p>
<p>The 16GB of unified memory is a big step up from the 8GB base model that Apple used to ship and makes it easy to multitask across dozens of browser tabs, creative apps, and background processes. That <strong>memory architecture lets the CPU and GPU share resources</strong> without the slowdowns that happen on regular laptops when the graphics and processor have to fight for separate memory pools.</p>
<p>The<strong> battery lasts about 18 hours of normal</strong> use so you can get through a whole day of meetings, document editing, and web browsing without having to look for outlets. That level of performance stays the same whether you’re running on battery or plugged in, which is a problem with many Windows laptops when they’re unplugged. The MacBook Air is completely silent when it’s running because it doesn’t have a fan.</p>



<p>The <strong>13.6-inch Liquid Retina display can show one billion colors and is 500 nits bright</strong> so photos and videos look great with bright colors and deep contrast. Text looks sharp at the native resolution, which is easier on the eyes than lower-resolution displays when reading or coding for long periods of time. That screen space gives you enough room to work on multiple things at once while keeping the laptop small enough to fit in most bags without taking up too much space.</p>
<p><strong>Apple Intelligence integration adds AI features</strong> directly to macOS without needing cloud processing or paying for basic features. The system helps with writing, making content, and productivity workflows, and it does all of this on the device to protect your privacy. Your data never leaves your machine because it is processed locally. This solves privacy issues that come up with cloud-based AI services. Two Thunderbolt 4 ports let you transfer data at lightning speed and drive up to two external displays at the same time.</p>



<p>The <strong>MacBook Air runs macOS without any problems</strong> and all of your important apps, like Microsoft 365 Copilot, Adobe Creative Cloud, and Google Workspace, work perfectly thanks to Apple Silicon optimization. iPhone integration works great with features like iPhone Mirroring, which lets you control your phone from your Mac, Universal Clipboard, which lets you copy content between devices, and Continuity Camera, which turns your iPhone into a wireless webcam.</p>
<p>When you think about how much Apple charges for this exact configuration directly, $999, getting the MacBook Air M4 for $738 is a great deal. This Cyber Monday price is $261 less than retail and gets you professional-level performance and a high-quality build. It’s the perfect time to upgrade from old Intel MacBooks or cheap Windows laptops.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/chatplayground-packs-25-ai-tools-into-one-at-nearly-90-off-chatgpt-gemini-claude-perplexity-and-more-included-2000648823</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>AI tools aren’t exactly the demons most people make them out to be; if you know how to use them right. At this point, there are more than a dozen options out there, each offering a whole bunch of beneficial features that you can use to excel in studies, research, and even in your professional life. If you want to compare them all in one place and choose what works best for you, we’ve got good news.</p>
<p>ChatPlayground AI is a platform that lets you explore and compare outputs from 25+ top AI tools side by side, in a single place. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6109/">A one-month subscription usually costs $29, but Stacksocial is offering<strong> lifetime access</strong> to the platform for just $80, after a whopping 87% discount.</a> It’s a leftover Black Friday deal, but it’s selling out fast. At the time of writing, over 500 subscriptions have already been sold, so you don’t have a lot of time left to save. Jump in on it while it’s still live.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6109/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>All Your Favorite AI Tools In One Place</h2>
<p>Starting with what the subscription gets you; it offers unlimited prompts across all the AI platforms, whether it’s GPT, Gemini, or DeepSeek. There is no lengthy requirement sheet with this one. Your system just needs to have the latest version of Chrome, Edge, or Firefox to get started. Once your purchase is successful, Stacksocial will send the relevant links and code to your email, which you need to redeem within 30 days of your purchase.</p>
<p>The platform gets you access to over 25 popular AI giants like GPT-4o, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemini 1.5 Flash, DeepSeek V3, and more. Entering a single prompt delivers instant results from various AI models simultaneously, letting you compare their responses and pick the best according to your needs. You can use it to create images using text, refine text, edit documents, generate summaries for research papers that would normally take hours to read, and get quick answers to all your questions. Importing your own files is supported just as well.</p>



<p>There’s a built-in web search feature for up-to-date responses, and you can even refer back to previous conversations you had with the AI tools whenever you want. The Chrome extension integrates the platform into your everyday life, making it easy to get the help you want within seconds, without even launching the program manually. Those struggling to get efficient responses can head over to the prompt library that includes a wide range of ready-to-use prompts for optimal results. Best of all, the models can understand and respond in over 100 languages, so you can use what you’re most comfortable with.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6109/">On a normal day, you’d pay around $619 to enjoy lifetime access to all these features, but this deal takes a massive $539 off that not-so-friendly price tag</a>. But as you’d expect, it expires soon, so it’s best to grab it while it’s still live. If you want to explore more, other plans are also discounted. For instance, a lifetime subscription to the Pro plan is going for $50 after an 85% discount, while the Basic plan can be yours for $35, down from $204. That said, there are plenty of other lingering Black Friday deals on Stacksocial that are still going strong, even after the main event has wrapped up. It’s a great time to treat yourself to a service that feels slightly out of reach the rest of the year, and even gift it to a loved one!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-out-of-time-with-thousands-of-galaxy-tab-a9-goes-zero-profit-for-cyber-monday-clearance-2000648929</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been waiting for Cyber Monday to get a cheap Samsung tablet, your wait is over – and we’re not talking about the Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra which costs almost $1,000 with premium specs. Instead, we’re talking about a budget-friendly Galaxy Tab A9+ model that can handle everyday tasks without breaking the bank. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/">has cut the price of this 64GB/WiFi version from $219 to $139</a>, which makes it a great deal for an 11-inch tablet that can do a lot of things.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3880/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>11-Inch Screen</h2>
<p>The <strong>Tab A9+ has an 11-inch TFT LCD panel with a resolution of 1920×1200</strong> which makes text sharp enough to read and colors bright enough to stream video. The <strong>90Hz refresh rate</strong> makes scrolling through social media and web pages feel much smoother than standard 60Hz displays, and it adds a little bit of fluidity that makes the whole experience better.</p>



<p><strong>Dolby Atmos processing powers</strong> the quad speakers on all four edges which give surprisingly strong sound and it <strong>creates spatial sound</strong> that makes movies, games, and music sound better than most tablets in this price range. The speakers make dialogue clear without muddiness and are loud enough to fill a small room. This audio setup turns the tablet into a portable entertainment device that doesn’t need external speakers or headphones to enjoy content fully.</p>
<p>The Qualcomm Snapdragon 695 chipset and 4GB of RAM <strong>work together to handle everyday tasks</strong> like web browsing, email, social media, and streaming services without any annoying lag or stuttering. The 64GB of internal storage fills up quickly with apps, photos, and content that can be accessed offline. The good news is that there’s also a <strong>microSD card slot can hold cards up to 1TB</strong> which is a cheap way to add more storage.</p>



<p>With multi-window display, <strong>you can run more than one app on the same screen</strong> at the same time. For example, you can split the screen between a web browser and a note-taking app or watch YouTube while checking your email. This feature turns the tablet from a simple device for consuming content into a modest productivity tool that can handle basic work tasks or multitasking situations. <strong>Samsung’s One UI interface makes Android 13</strong> work better on larger screens by using gestures that are easy to understand and tablet-specific layouts that make better use of the space than phones that are blown up to tablet size.</p>
<p>With<em> Quick Share</em>, you can <strong>move files between Samsung devices and even iOS devices with just a few taps</strong>. This means you don’t have to email attachments or upload files to the cloud when you want to share photos or documents. You can charge the tablet with a USB-C cable and it usually lasts 8 to 10 hours of mixed use, like streaming, browsing, and light gaming, before you need to plug it in.</p>
<p>You can save $80 on a tablet that has really useful features at a low price by getting the Galaxy Tab A9+ for $139 instead of $219. For less than what many 8-inch tablets with worse specs cost, you get an 11-inch 90Hz display, quad speakers with Dolby Atmos, decent performance for everyday tasks, and Samsung’s polished software experience.</p>

              <p>You don’t have to grab an entirely new screen for a better streaming experience. If you’re after convenience and unlimited streaming options, a tiny streaming stick is all that you need. Most of these retail for around $25-$30, which is already quite affordable but thanks to Black Friday and Cyber Monday, you can grab a solid option for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4493/">Amazon has slashed the price of the latest HD Roku Streaming Stick by 50%, currently offering it for just $15.</a> That’s basically pocket change for what you’re getting. The deal is available to both Prime and non-Prime members, but it’s selling out like crazy already. There’s not a lot of time left to save, so if you’ve been wanting to pick one up, now is the time to act.</p>

<h2>Multiple Streaming Platforms In One Place</h2>
<p>This tiny stick isn’t just convenient to carry around; it’s easy to install, doesn’t block neighboring HDMI ports when plugged in, and stays out of sight. It doesn’t require a wall outlet or extra cords, either. Just plug it into your TV’s USB port, select an input, and pair the included remote with it. Then, follow the on-screen instructions to get started.</p>
<p>The streaming stick brings all your favorite streaming apps in one place, from Netflix to Prime Video, Hulu, Disney, HBO Max, Peacock, Apple TV, and more. There is also going to be something for everyone, so kids can watch cartoons, teens can catch up on the latest releases, and adults can go with their all-time favorite classics. Binge the latest series of Stranger Things on Netflix, and end the night with a comedy show on Prime. Or maybe watch Harry Potter during the holiday on HBO Max, and then a Christmas movie later on; the choices are endless!</p>
<p>These platforms require subscriptions, though. Not a fan of those? No problem. The stick also gets you access to over 500 free TV channels with live news and weather, sports coverage, and more. You can start your day by checking in on what’s happening around the world, see how your favorite teams are doing, and stay updated on the weather situation; all without paying anything extra. It’s going to feel like you’re using cable, just without the monthly fee and hassle. HD support means content is pushed in a stunning, detailed resolution that makes it come to life.</p>



<p>The home screen is easy to navigate, and the included remote makes it quicker to find what you’re looking for. Spot something you like but don’t have the time to watch it immediately? Add it to your save list. Categories let you browse through genres within seconds, while the Recommended list makes it easy to find new content that’s relevant to your taste. Not in the mood to press some buttons? Hit the microphone option on the remote and use your voice to find your way around. Pairing it with a smart assistant makes it even more convenient. You can say something like “Alexa, show me the latest Leonardo DiCaprio movies”, or “Alexa, show me the latest Crime Thrillers with unexpected endings”, and your command will be answered.</p>
<p>There’s even a Bluetooth headphone mode that lets you connect your earbuds or headphones to the TV for a private listening experience. There are plenty of useful features packed in, and we recommend this latest Roku Streaming Stick even at its full $30 price. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4493/">This 50% deal makes the upgrade much more affordable, so now is a great time to treat yourself to one.</a></p>
