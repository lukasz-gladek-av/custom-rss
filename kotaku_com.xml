            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-steam-record-login-queue-multiplayer-download-issue-2000634042">Battlefield 6</a>‘</em>s first season launches soon across consoles and PC, and it promises new maps, modes, vehicles, and weapons. I was recently invited to check out some of this new content ahead of next week’s release. If you’ve been wanting a new, giant map, this season will give you that. Eventually.</p> <p>Season one of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> launches on October 28 and brings with it a lot of new and completely free content. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-two-new-maps-modes-roadmap-free-updates-dlc-2025-ea-2000630301">As outlined in EA’s previously released roadmap</a>, <em>BF6</em>‘s first season (and all future seasons) will be split into multiple phases with different themes and battle passes. Season one’s first phase is titled “Rogue Ops” and will add three new weapons, a new armored APC, a new mode, and, perhaps most excitingly for fans, a new map.</p>

 <p>Earlier this week, EA and Battlefield Studios held an hour-long preview session for <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/22/battlefield-6-season-1-first-details-and-hands-on-report/"><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s upcoming first season</a>. In this preview, we were able to go hands-on with the content being added in Rogue Ops, as well as some of the content coming in phase two of season one. I played a few matches of <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reverts-conquest-ticket-change-48-hours-angry-backlash-2000636658">Conquest</a> on the first new map coming this season, Blackwell Fields, and came away unsure of it, but then played Eastwood, which will be added later, and had a fantastic time.</p>

  <h2><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s first new map is just fine</h2> <p>The new map, which is located in an oil field in California, doesn’t feel very big. It’s also a very empty and sparse map, with rolling hills often being the only cover you can hope for when crossing the map to reach a new area. Snipers and aircraft were extremely deadly on this map, and I often found myself frustrated by how much the infantry was at a disadvantage. The map just feels too barren and small to support a mode like Conquest. Perhaps with more time, I’ll learn to love Blackwell Fields, but for now, I’m lukewarm on the map. At the very least, it’s a very pretty map as the sun is setting during your fight, leading to some gorgeous colors and shadows.</p>

 <p>While checking out the new map, I played around with the new armored APC, the Traverser Mk. 2. This vehicle came in handy on Blackwell Fields as it provides a safe way for soldiers to get around the battlefield quickly, is packed with mounted weapons, and can even support an integrated med bay to heal allies who hop in. The new APC is such a perfect fit for <em>BF6</em>, offering something more powerful than a jeep, but less bulky than a tank, that I’m a bit shocked it didn’t ship with the game earlier this month.</p>

 <p>I also checked out the new weapons. The new Glock pistol is fine, but who really cares about a pistol in <em>Battlefield 6</em>? That’s just the gun you pull out when you are desperate or need to complete a daily challenge. The other two new weapons are the SOR-300C carbine and the Mini Fix sniper rifle.</p>

 <p>I played a lot of the preview with the carbine, and I’m still not sure if it will dethrone the M4, but I did enjoy it. Its slower rate of fire and heavier-hitting bullets make it feel more like an assault rifle than a carbine, and it can hold its own in midrange fights. However, in close-quarters combat, I felt like SMGs and faster-firing carbines often beat me in one-on-one fights. Meanwhile, the Mini Fix sniper rifle seems like it might become the rifle of choice for recon players as it hits hard, fires fast, and is extremely accurate. In the hands of a skilled sniper, this might be too powerful. I could see EA nerfing it a tad in a future update. We’ll have to wait and see how things shake out.</p>

 <p>The other bit of Rogue Ops I played during the preview was Strikepoint, a 4v4 mode king-of-the-hill-like mode with limited respawning. It’s…certainly a new game mode. I just don’t understand why<a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-reveal-la-event-behind-the-scenes-brie-larson-ea-2000614190"> EA and Battlefield Studios</a> continue to spend so much time and energy on these tiny, tactical modes. <em>Battlefield</em> is all about big moments, chaotic warfare, and silly moments involving tanks, choppers, bombs, and more.</p> <h2>Eastwood is a new map that people are going to love</h2> <p>The best part of the preview was when I got to play the other new map, Eastwood. This map is set in a rich Southern California suburb, complete with McMansions, pools, and even a golf course nearby with drivable golf carts. This map felt very big, is filled with vehicles, and has plenty of houses and buildings for infantry to duck into during more explosive or dangerous moments. After playing it for just an hour or so, I quickly fell in love with it and can’t wait to play more. Sadly, this map won’t be added to the game until phase two of the first season, which launches on November 18.</p> <p>I personally would have led with Eastwood as the first new map added to <em>BF6</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bigger-maps-leak-datamine-eastwood-mirak-ea-bf-labs-2000618202">as it seems to offer the giant, vehicle-filled chaos that some fans believe the new entry lacks.</a> It’s also just a visually distinct, super memorable, and fantastic map with lots of places to fight and wild moments to get involved in. At one point during the preview, some folks from both teams orchestrated a golf cart race. Well, they tried. A helicopter pilot flew by and wiped out some of the racers. Another great moment involved a tank crashing through the large mansion I was hiding in and then getting trapped in the backyard pool, letting me destroy it with some rockets. No idea why EA isn’t shipping this map first, but at least we all have something to look forward to next month.</p> <p>After playing a lot of season one’s new content, I came away excited for<em> Battlefield 6</em>‘s future, even if some of the new content<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->like the new tiny modes and boring pistol<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->don’t do much for me. I’m just happy to see that so soon after launch, EA has big plans and new stuff for its popular online shooter. And if future maps can be as great as Eastwood, I think the next year for <em>Battlefield 6</em> will be a good one. And who knows, maybe I’ll end up liking Blackwell Fields eventually.<em>&nbsp;Battlefield 6</em> is out now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. Season one launches on October 28 on all platforms.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-nms-breach-corvette-update-2000638257</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-man%E2%80%99s-sky-goes-full-space-pirate-in-latest-free-update.1331899/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s free update time for <i>No Man’s Sky</i> again. Keep your wallet in your back pocket or purse, because Hello Games just shipped “Breach” which, among other things, allows you to harvest materials from stranded shipwrecks out there in the infinity of simulated space.</p> <p>Announced via a <a href="https://youtu.be/eNaY10DQkJw">brisk 51-second trailer on YouTube</a>, “<a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2025/10/expedition-twenty-breach/">Breach</a>” is the latest free <i>NMS</i> update from developer Hello Games. The update boasts a new expedition as well as the introduction of drifting space wrecks from which you can salvage new ship parts. It feels like a subtle update in some ways, but one that builds well on the foundations laid in <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-6-0-star-trek-mass-effect-2000620674">the previous update, Voyagers,</a> which included epic <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-corvette-ship-build-voyagers-update-star-wars-2000630689">custom ship build options</a> and the ability to spacewalk.</p>

  <p>As always, the new update’s release followed a trail of cryptic tweets from managing director Sean Murray, this time with a series of closed-door emoji. It naturally sent the community into a frenzy of speculation.</p>

   <p>Unfortunately for those on the r/LightNoFireHelloGames subreddit, which is dedicated to the studio’s upcoming <a href="https://youtu.be/jKQem4Z6ioQ">full-scale planet sim</a>, the doors had nothing to with <i>Light No Fire</i>. Some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LightNoFireHelloGames/comments/1o9grvf/guys_guys_this_is_it/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">folks had speculated that the door</a> was a reference to the band The Doors who have a song called “Light My Fire.” Things are desperate over there, ya’ll.</p>

   <p>Sorry, guys. That wasn’t it.</p> <h2>Also, check out these awesome user-made ships</h2> <p>Look, I’m probably not gonna get away with writing a “15 Awesome Ship Builds” showcase every week, much as I would like to. But I see so much cool shit coming out of the <i>NMS</i> community that I just have to share this stuff with you.</p>

 <p>Here’s the complete Death Star build I <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-death-star-star-wars-2000635367">told ya’ll about last week</a>. Too sick:</p>   <p>This “Venator Class Star Destroyer” looks clean and awesome:</p>   <p>This mod-free build is a whole damn natural wildlife habitat just cruising through space like it’s no big deal.</p>

   <p>Fancy a solid X-Wing build?</p>   <p>Or how about an original build inspired by <i>Star Wars</i>’ weathered space junk aesthetic?</p>   <p>A’right, that’s enough outta me. If you spot something cool in this game, please don’t hesitate to shoot me an email at cjackson [at] kotaku [dot] com. Safe travels out there!</p>

              <p><span>Netflix is still playing catch-up after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381"><span>the runaway success</span></a><span> of its animated musical </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>, and that means a lot of the merchandising and collaboration deals that should probably have been in the works a long time ago are still trickling in. We’ve gotten </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-fortnite-rei-ami-stream-zoey-rumi-2000632536"><span>a </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>crossover</span></a><span>, cast </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-tonight-show-golden-performance-ejae-2000633180"><span>appearances on late-night</span></a><span>, and a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-box-office-showtimes-songs-2000620026"><span>limited theatrical run</span></a><span> for people to sing along to all the movie’s bangers. But now, some of the bigger toy manufacturers want in on that Huntr/x hysteria, including Hasbro. Yeah, that probably means dolls, but it also very likely means </span><i><span>Magic: The Gathering </span></i><span>is about to get another Secret Lair drop in the coming months.</span></p> <p><span>Hasbro and Netflix </span><a href="https://newsroom.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/fans-netflix-goes-golden-forging-unprecedented-kpop-demon"><span>announced their new partnership</span></a><span> yesterday, October 21, and say they plan to release “toys, collectibles, games, role-play products and more” featuring Rumi, Mira, and Zoey. The announcement goes on to say that Hasbro is working on “dolls, action figures, accessories, collectibles, playsets, [and] collaborations with co-brands.” That last one is interesting, considering Hasbro also notes a few of its brands, and says it will be “leveraging the strength of its iconic portfolio” for more </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>products. That portfolio includes Hasbro Games (which is making a </span><i><span>Monopoly</span></i><span> board game featuring the characters and iconography from the film), Wizards of the Coast, Nerf, and…Furby. Pushing the image of a Rumi-themed Furby from my mind with the strength of the Honmoon, the brand that is the most interesting in that line-up is Wizards of the Coast, the company behind </span><i><span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Magic: The Gathering</span></i><span>. The trading card game has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313"><span>essentially become </span><i><span>Fortnite: The Card Game</span></i></a> <span>with its myriad crossovers and collaborations bringing characters and artwork from properties like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-magic-gathering-secret-lair-card-pre-order-drop-1851786245"><i><span>Sonic</span></i></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-playstation-last-of-us-god-of-war-ellie-2000629350"><span>PlayStation Studios’ portfolio</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-mtg-magic-gathering-vivi-stock-1851786817"><i><span>Final Fantasy</span></i></a><span> to its booster packs.</span></p> <p><span>While the actual </span><i><span>Magic: The Gathering </span></i><span>community is pretty split on WOTC’s focus on crossovers, people who don’t play the game, like myself, are more likely to get in a digital queue for a Secret Lair drop if it has characters we know. I have the Shadow the Hedgehog card sitting on my shelf right now. Would I throw down some cash for cards of my demon-slaying queens? Yeah, fucking probably. I played </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>for the first time so I could skydive to “How It’s Done” and headshot some fools. You think I won’t pay money for a high-quality card? I’m a mark. I can complain about the crossover slop all day, but I’m just as bad as anyone. I’ll clap and cheer for cards with bespoke holographic patterns made to look like the Honmoon. You think you’re better than me? I can’t hear you over the sound of me ordering tickets to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-theater-return-halloween-2000635744"><span>my third sing-along showing next week</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-preview-beat-em-up-tribute-games-1851784757"><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em></a> has revealed its final two characters and its long-awaited release date. The comic book brawler arrives December 1 with Iron Man (Tony Stark) and Phoenix (Jean Grey) rounding out its roster of gorgeously pixel-art-animated superheroes.</p> <p>Dotemu released one last trailer to celebrate the impending launch which includes brief looks at the newly revealed additions and the gang fighting in front of a giant Master Mold Sentinel like the ’90s <em>X-Men</em> cartoon was turned into a <em>Mega Man X</em> spin-off.</p>

  <p>The full roster, for anyone who hasn’t been keeping track at home, includes the 15 following fighters:</p> <ul> <li>Beta Ray Bill</li> <li>Black Panther</li> <li>Captain America</li> <li>Cosmic Ghost Rider</li> <li>Nova</li> <li>Phyla-Vell</li> <li>Rocket Raccoon</li> <li>She-Hulk</li> <li>Spider-Man</li> <li>Storm</li> <li>Silver Surfer</li> <li>Venom</li> <li>Wolverine</li> <li>Iron Man</li> <li>Phoenix</li> </ul> <p>There’s a nice range of household names and Marvel back-benchers sporting a variety of different attack styles and abilities. That’s the one thing that the demo, <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-steam-demo-pc-console-2025-coolest-looking-game-2000630663">still free to try on Steam</a>, really drives home. Each of these characters plays surprisingly distinctly for a beat ’em up, especially when you account <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-hands-on-preview-mvc-impressions-2000614681">for mid-battle character switching and team-up attacks</a>.</p> <p><em>Marvel Cosmic</em> <em>Invasion</em> is coming to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Switch 2, Switch 1, and PC. Is December 1 enough time for me to go back and Platinum the excellent<em> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge</em>? We’ll see.</p>
