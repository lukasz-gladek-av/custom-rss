Before I moved to New York City, I lived in a small Georgia town where I could reliably get a console if I pre-ordered it at my local GameStop. Despite this, I do have vivid memories from 2005, of waiting too long to try to get an Xbox 360 and being pushed into the later shipments that my store would receive. Although the system was released in November, my family didn’t get to experience the next generation of video games until January. That wait was so excruciating that I swore I’d never get put on a waiting list again. When the PS4, Vita, and PS5 came out, I had those things on lock as soon as pre-orders went live, because there weren’t enough hardcore nerds in my small town that the store would run out of supply if I made sure to get in there early.</p><p>I had been conditioned to expect this approach not to work now that I live in a big city. I still don’t have a go-to game store in NYC, having mostly swapped to digital downloads given I have usable download speeds in my apartment. With millions of people living in the city and me being stuck at my desk until work hours were over each day, I figured that if I wanted a chance in hell of even getting a launch window Switch 2, I would need to try online. Either that, or I would end up waiting in long lines on launch night, hoping that some store had extra systems, before going home empty-handed and broken-hearted. At least, that was what living in a small town had conditioned me to think. Instead, I’m now hearing from all the people who secured systems in stores last night, and wishing I had toughed out a midnight release instead of waiting for Target to get around to shipping.</p><p>In the grand scheme of things, waiting a week for a system I probably wouldn’t have had much time to play on anyway isn’t<em> that</em> big of a deal. But damn, how many times can I see people posting clips doing sick tricks as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-moo-moo-meadows-cow-meme-switch-2-1851774370&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-moo-moo-meadows-cow-meme-switch-2-1851774370">the cow in <em>Mario Kart World</em></a></span>&nbsp;before I fall to my knees, wishing I could be where the people are? Yeah, I’ll have a hectic work week in front of me, covering the rest of the video game industry, so I will have distractions. But what if I were also smooching Kerry Eurodyne in tabletop mode on my flight right now?

I hear you. I’m holding space for you. May we see each other on the <em>Mario Kart </em>track in the coming days.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Then race, battle with custom rules or take a road trip to see the sights together.”<br></p><p>While that’s not confirmation of local splitscreen, it did <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1l3mf8v/no_split_screen_freeroam_unless_in_empty_wireless/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1l3mf8v/no_split_screen_freeroam_unless_in_empty_wireless/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">give some the impression</a></span> that free roam would be a multiplayer-friendly mode. But it turns out that’s not really the case. There are essentially two versions of Free Roam. One is single-player and includes all of the challenges and collectibles. The other is a glorified online lobby where you drive around in-between matches but there’s not really anything to do. And neither lets you play with another person sitting next to you.</p><p>Now, F<em>orza Horizon 5 </em>doesn’t support local co-op either. Rendering an open world is very resource intensive, and duplicating that for a second player in a second screen on the same system even more so. There are probably very valid technical and logistical hurdles that explain why Free Roam doesn’t have local splitscreen co-op. Is it still a bummer? Definitely. </p><p>As <em>Remap</em> co-host Patrick Klepek alluded to on X, the limitation will be especially galling for families who want to play together, or for parents with kids who struggle with taking turns. My own children, at least, love undirected play in video games. <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> are the games they spent the most time with for that exact reason. Free Roam was by far the thing that they were most intrigued with when it came to <em>Mario Kart World</em>. They like racing but they’ve done it before (and have trouble with losing). </p><p>Free Roam, with its undirected and uncompetitive gameplay, looked poised to answer both of those needs, making <em>Mario Kart World </em>something they’d love messing around in just for fun. Unfortunately, when it comes to multiplayer at least, the meat of the $80 sequel is still very much in traditional racing modes, just with some new open-world twists. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
