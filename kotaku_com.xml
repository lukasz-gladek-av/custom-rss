Well, bad news for those fans wanting <em>Rebirth</em> DLC. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-wont-34152228&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-wont-34152228" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a new interview with<em> Daily Star</em></a></span>, Hamaguchi was asked if the developers had heard from fans about wanting DLC. <em>Rebirth</em>’s director confirmed that Square Enix “definitely” does hear this “desire from fans,” but suggested what people really want is the next game and not a downloadable episode.</p><p>“I understand it completely, but I think, from my perspective, what the fans really want to see the most is not necessarily DLC. They want to see the third part of the series as quickly as possible,” said Hamaguchi.</p><p>The director further explained, “We really are putting all our efforts into getting the third game out as quickly as we can. So for the moment, that’s where we’re focusing our time.”</p><p>Beyond the third chapter of the remake trilogy, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-34152009&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.dailystar.co.uk/tech/gaming/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-34152009" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hamaguchi told the outlet</a></span> he might be open to doing more spin-offs of other games focused on different characters seen in the <em>FF7. </em></p><p>“I want it [<em>Remake </em>Chapter 3] to come out as quickly as possible and then move on maybe to look at some other stories, dig a bit deeper,” said Hamaguchi.</p><p>“There’s definitely a call out there to see other spotlights on other parts of the world and the universe, different characters, so I’d like to maybe switch to looking at them in a different way after we’ve got the third game out.”</p><p>For now, though, the focus is entirely on making the third and final game in the <em>FF7</em> remake trilogy as quickly as possible. So place your bets on when we’ll get our hands on the RPG. I’m thinking 2027. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
