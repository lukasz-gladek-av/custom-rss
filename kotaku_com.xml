            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There is still some good left in this world. We’re getting a new, still officially untitled, <a href="https://kotaku.com/goat-trailer-fart-joke-jackass-sony-zootopia-funny-teaser-2000656133"><em>Jackass</em></a>, and we don’t have to wait a decade like last time. The new comedy is set to arrive in June.</p> <p>On January 8, <em>Jackass</em> ringleader Johnny Knoxville <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTPFikrEXfX/?img_index=1">posted the iconic skull and crutches logo</a> for the franchise on Instagram, with the date June 26 below it. In the text for the post, he confirmed that, yes, a new <em>Jackass</em> movie is a go. Expect lots of wild stunts, gross moments, and of course, some injuries.</p>   <p>“Well, a wang dang and hot damn doodle, we are starting the year off with a bang,” said Knoxville on Instagram. “We wanted to let you know that this summer, Jackass is back!! We will see you in theatres June 26th. More to come, but wanted you to hear it from us first!”</p> <p>That’s all the official information we have at the moment. We don’t know who is returning or which guest stars will be making an appearance in the upcoming comedy flick. In the last movie, 2022’s<em> Jackass Forever</em>, most of the original <em>Jackass</em> crew from the 2000s era TV show on MTV returned, with the notable exceptions of Bam Margera and Ryan Dunn. Margera has struggled with substance abuse issues for years, and while sober now, has had a rocky relationship with the <em>Jackass</em> crew and is likely not returning in the next film. Dunn sadly died in 2011. His last <em>Jackass</em> movie was 2010’s <em>Jackass 3. </em>For <em>Jackass Forever, </em>the crew also added some younger talent to help out. No word if they will be returning this time around.</p>

 <p>The <em>Jackass</em> franchise is a big success for Paramount, with the four main films, and the <em>Bad Grandpa</em> spin-off, bringing in over $560 million worldwide at the box office on relatively tiny budgets. <a href="https://kotaku.com/jackass-forever-the-game-ps2-review-psp-mtv-knoxville-1848487592">There was even a <em>Jackass</em> video game released in 2007. It was bad. Don’t play it.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ugreens-usb-c-hub-drops-below-10-this-5-in-1-adapter-is-selling-out-fast-on-amazon-2000657275</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Do you find yourself routinely trying to improve your computer setup, but you have too many cables to make it feasible? You might want to think about getting a multiport. They’re affordable, and thanks to the deal we’ve located, you can get one even cheaper than usual. Plus, you can set up your workstation using just a single USB-C port.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6707/">Get the UGREEN USB C Hub 5 in 1 Multiport at Amazon for only $9.99 (from $15.99), which is a $6 discount and approximately 38% in savings</a>. For this price, you can buy a few and change up all your computer stations just for the sake of keeping things consistent.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6707/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An affordable way to improve your compact PC setup</h2>
<p>Here’s how it works. This multi-port adapter instantly adds additional ports to your existing device’s USB-C port when plugged in. When connected via USB-C you can add peripherals like a keyboard, a mouse, a flash drive or external hard drive to your central device, all without needing to swap cables every few minutes. It can essential help turn thin laptops and tablets into more powerful desktop setups when needed. For example, it’s useful whether you’re moving between a home office, a classroom or coffee shop.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can connect your device to a monitor, television or projector for a better viewing experience on a larger screen. This is beneficial for watching movies on a larger screen, displaying slides in a professional environment or extending your display to keep multiple windows open simultaneously.</p>



<p>As compact as they are, most hubs are designed to direct cable flow away from your hands to maintain a clean and organized workspace. The small and lightweight design of the UGREEN USB C Hub 5 in 1 Multiport makes it easy to fit into a laptop case or backpack pocket and allows you to take it wherever you go without giving it a second thought. Most importantly, this is the type of accessory you’ll likely forget about until you truly need a USB port or an external display, and then you’ll be happy it is available.</p>
<p>We’ve lined out the reasons why, so it’s probably obvious by now, but this USB-C hub can make for a super useful gift or addition to anyone’s PC setup. It’s a practical and affordable upgrade that gives you plenty of space to work with when it comes to compact setups. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6707/">And perhaps most importantly, it’s just $9.99</a>. That’s super affordable, and well worth picking up whether you shop for yourself or others as a gift. Anyone can appreciate the gift of efficiency, especially in a world where complex computing can be the norm.</p>

Speaking of video calls, the built-in 5MP camera paired with Poly Studio tuned speakers with AI Noise Reduction makes those a breeze. You will look your best, plus be heard properly as well. What’s more, 400 nits of brightness, paired with the anti-glare coating, ensure visibility in all lighting conditions, whether you’re streaming a movie at night or working on a school assignment while soaking up some sun. Additionally, low blue light emission makes it easy to use the screen for extended periods without compromising your eye health.</p>



<p>Port selection is wide. We’re talking one HDMI port, one stereo headphone/microphone combo jack, one RJ-45, 1 security lock slot, two USB Type-A 5Gbps signaling rate (powered), two Thunderbolt 4 with USB Type-C 40Gbps signaling rate (USB Power Delivery 3.0, DisplayPort 2.1, HP Sleep and Charge).

It comes packed with a wide range of features that make it perfect for students, work professionals, and even casual users. Just be sure to grab yours before the price shoots back up to $2,600.</p>

            <guid>1400593</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>A subset of </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fans </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><span>unsatisfied with the horror series’ finale</span></a><span> have spent the last week </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663"><span>dunking on the creators and actors</span></a><span> and also peddling a conspiracy theory that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704"><span>Netflix was holding a secret finale episode</span></a><span> that would explain away things these fans didn’t like about the existing conclusion. According to the “Conformity Gate” theory, the ninth episode of </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ fifth season was supposed to go live on the streaming service last night, January 7, at 8 p.m. ET. The theory had become so widespread that fans claim Netflix </span><a href="https://ftw.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/pop-culture/2026/01/07/stranger-things-conformity-gate-crashed-netflix/88073821007/"><span>crashed around this time</span></a><span> as fans flocked to the streaming service and overloaded the servers. When they finally managed to get the app to boot up, they found that no such ninth episode had been published.</span></p>   <p><span>While the Conformity Gate theory was an interesting thought experiment, and I’ll admit I watched enough videos about it that I wasn’t quite convinced but was at least willing to see it all play out, this turn of events was hardly surprising, especially after </span><a href="https://variety.com/2026/tv/news/stranger-things-conformity-gate-final-episode-doesnt-exist-1236625074/"><i><span>Variety</span></i></a><span> published a story hours ahead of the supposed launch debunking the theory.</span></p>

 <p><span>What is surprising, however, is just how far reaching Conformity Gate had become before it was inevitably disproven. Some corporate accounts, like the one belonging to the Empire State Building of all things, were posting about </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> fans’ collective psychosis, whether in genuine support of the theory or just to take advantage of a trending topic for social media engagement. The Slim Jim account </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@matcrackz/video/7592796861153414413"><span>is in everyone’s comments</span></a><span> like Joyce Byers telling everyone the Conformity Gate theory is canon, to them.</span></p>

   <p><span>Perhaps the interest of brands is understandable, though, in light of what a phenomenon </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>was right up through its final episode.. The fifth season has already cracked </span><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/most-popular/tv"><span>Netflix’s top 10 all-time most-streamed series</span></a><span>, and even if some fans online are so unsatisfied with how it all ended that they’re imagining another episode that might fix it all, the series still has enough cultural cache that every social media manager is probably looking at Conformity Gate as a chance to ride the coattails of a trend. Now, however, even people who are actually part of the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>brand are starting to post about it, and sorry to those holding out hope, but the few times that people like actor Brett Gelman have acknowledged the conspiracy, it hasn’t been to confirm it. Here he is addressing Conformity Gate by name while lipsyncing a cover of Prince’s “When Doves Cry,” specifically the line “Maybe you’re just like my mother, she’s never satisfied.”</span></p>

   <p><span>The </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i> <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@strangerthings"><span>social media accounts</span></a><span> also now have “ALL EPISODES OF STRANGER THINGS ARE NOW PLAYING” </span><a href="https://x.com/Stranger_Things"><span>in their bios</span></a><span>, and it doesn’t get much clearer than that. The X account allegedly responsible for starting the conspiracy, @67gate, has set their profile to private. Now that the dream seems to be truly dead, fans are reacting in a lot of ways. Some are grieving, finally realizing the ending they didn’t like is, in fact, the finale of </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>, while others are saying that the theory provided a fun ride for a week, and helped cushion the blow of the finale.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Unfortunately, if you scroll through the comments on videos about there being no ninth episode, you’ll also find people moving the goalpost and saying that a secret finale could still be coming, whether that be after the upcoming </span><i><span>One Last Adventure </span></i><span>documentary about the making of the final season, or at some other date they made up. Maybe they will return to reality in the coming days as more people disperse from the discussion.</span></p>

That about sums it up, but if you’re tuned into enough fandoms, you’ve probably seen people clowning like this. I lived through the spread of the </span><i><span>Mass Effect 3 </span></i><span>Indoctrination Theory years ago, and I’m sure, despite this idea of a “secret finale which will reveal that the bad ending was just a nightmare we’re all going to wake up from” having never actually proven true, we’ll live through a Conformity Gate moment again in a few years.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Taylor Swift fans are also notorious for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/taylor-swift-life-of-a-showgirl-announcement-cover-date-2000617177"><span>looking for clues where there are none</span></a><span>, such as when they speculated for months that a re-recorded “Taylor’s Version” of the artist’s </span><i><span>Reputation </span></i><span>album was imminent based on small hints, only for Swift to reveal months later that she’d </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250531031134/https://www.taylorswift.com/"><span>barely recorded any of the tracks</span></a><span> for a re-release. Theorycrafting is fun, but when you stake this level of an emotional claim in it, you’re dooming yourself to devastating disappointment. </span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If upgrading your audio gear is on your New Year’s checklist, this deal is hard to beat. The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds are widely praised for their exceptional noise cancellation, immersive sound quality, and all-day comfort, making them a great choice in the premium earbuds category. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6592/">Right now, Amazon is offering them at a $49 discount, dropping the price from their usual $299 down to just $250 for a limited time</a>. Whether you’re tuning out distractions during your daily commute, staying focused while working, traveling, or simply enjoying your favorite playlists at home without the whine of your toddler crying in the other room (they just never stop, don’t they?), these earbuds deliver a noticeably superior listening experience. If you’ve been waiting for the right moment to invest in high-quality audio, this limited-time offer makes now an excellent opportunity to do so for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6592/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>World-Class Noise Cancellation</h2>
<p>When paying for a premium audio accessory, you expect solid noise cancellation—and it’s the real deal here. Our sister-site <a href="https://gizmodo.com/bose-quietcomfort-ultra-2-review-the-only-earbuds-you-want-on-an-airplane-2000646784">Gizmodo</a> put it through the ringer, testing the second-gen Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds in busy subways and crowded, chatty coffee shops. The results were it could block out&nbsp;<em>everything</em>.</p>
<p>In addition to Quiet Mode, the Bose QuietComfort Ultra earbuds make use of two other modes. Aware Mode is the transparency option where you can pass through the sounds of your surroundings. Wearing in-ear earbuds do a little bit of noise cancelling physically just because of how they’re design. You plug your ear with them after all. This mode will actually play the sounds from your environment that it’s picking up on its and play them through the earbuds. This is good for a range of use cases, particularly if you’re a runner training on the roads while listening to music. Best to be able to hear traffic to avoid any accidents.</p>



<p>The earbuds are also equipped with Immersion Mode which blends together noise-cancelling with 3D audio. This is able to track your head movements so it feels like you are surrounded on all sides by music that you can physically move throughout, even though it’s all just simulated in your ear.</p>
<p>You can choose between five super sleek colorways, though not all have been treated equally by the Amazon discount gods. The humble black model is right now the cheapest, so if you don’t want a pair of earbuds that are too loud (except in the traditional sense, you’re in luck. Offering slightly more pizazz is the desert gold option. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6592/">These are mostly black, but with a gold accent. They’re also priced at the lowest value of $250</a>. Just above that at $268 is a really striking midnight violet model. Then at full price still ($299,) is the white and deep plum versions.</p>
