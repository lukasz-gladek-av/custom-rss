Team Asobi says you’ll need to have completed the main game to access the holiday-themed level. </p><p>The team isn’t revealing much about the upcoming winter level because it want it to “remain a little surprise,” but the studio does say we can expect a “fun-filled” level with “brand-new special bots” to collect, as well as a “good dose” of jingle bells. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-free-dlc-new-bots-levels-helldivers-1851656690&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-free-dlc-new-bots-levels-helldivers-1851656690">And no, this isn’t a new speedrun level</a></span>. This is meant to be something everyone can play. </p><p>“This [<em>Astro Bot</em>] winter update was made with every user in mind, meaning it is a celebration enjoyable for children and adults alike,” said Team Asobi studio director Nicolas Doucet. “So, no hair-pulling challenge this time! :) We had a lot of fun making this special present for you all, and we hope you enjoy it very much, too.”</p><p>Since its release in September, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-sony-parappa-1851653602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-sony-parappa-1851653602"><em>Astro Bot</em></a></span> has received numerous positive reviews and has been named the Game of the Year by many outlets and creators. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-free-dlc-release-date-ps5-ff7-1851673689&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-free-dlc-release-date-ps5-ff7-1851673689">In October, Team Asobi began adding free speedruning levels</a></span> to the cute platformer. Those were also well received, and I expect this new winter level will be really good, too. But it also might be the last bit of <em>Astro Bot</em> DLC we get. </p><p>At the end of the blog post, Doucet added: “For now, it’s goodbye from Astro and the bots. We’ll see you around.” That sounds like an indication that Team Asobi will be moving on to a new project. Hopefully, it’s as wonderful as <em>Astro Bot. </em></p><p><em> .</em><br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Fieldwork missions can be broadly generalized as other, unrelated archaeological investigations; Discoveries involve collectibles and short-term activities, like an underground boxing circuit; and Mysteries are shorter and typically based around a single puzzle.</p><p>Due to the way that <em>The Great Circle </em>is structured, many of these missions tend to be interconnected. It’s easy to follow one mission only to end up pursuing another as you go about finding collectibles and quest items.<em><strong>gc-sm02.jpg]</strong></em></p><p>There’s nothing wrong with letting that spontaneous objective structure play out for you. In fact, you’ll end up benefiting if you stray from the main path from time to time. The two primary rewards for successful missions in <em>The Great Circle </em>are Books and Adventure Points. While Books are rarely an actual mission reward, it’s very common for access to a Book to be locked behind progress in a particular side mission.</p><p>Books are used to unlock passive bonuses to Indy’s skills, such as faster stamina recharge or more blocks of health, while Adventure Points are spent to gain those bonuses. Picking up any collectible, such as a note, photo, or artifact, is usually worth 15-50 AP, while side missions can earn you up to 300 at once.</p><figure id="" data-id="284f8101032df313479e56c721b9e4a7" data-recommend-id="image://284f8101032df313479e56c721b9e4a7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Indiana Jones looks through a camera viewfinder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Indiana Jones looks through a camera viewfinder." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->MachineGames / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="284f8101032df313479e56c721b9e4a7" data-recommend-id="image://284f8101032df313479e56c721b9e4a7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Indiana Jones looks through a camera viewfinder." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><br>If you’re looking to prepare for the later challenges in <em>The Great Circle</em>, especially when playing on a higher difficulty, it’s worth taking the time to knock out at least a few side missions in order to improve Indy’s stats. It’s particularly useful to pick up the Moxie books from “A Remedy for All,” which extend Indy’s health meter, and to acquire the Blackshirt disguise in Vatican City so you can take the “Brawler II” Book from inside the fascists’ campsite.</p><p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle </em>is available on PS5, Xbox Series X?S, and Windows via Steam. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
