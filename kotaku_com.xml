              <p><span>God, Nintendo can be an annoying company. Not 24 hours ago, I was writing about how it made </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-update-1-4-0-patch-notes-track-volume-2000650066"><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span>’s music volume options a toggle</span></a><span> that only let you choose between “normal” and “louder,” and now </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</span></i></a> <span>is out today and has its own obnoxious music options for players to contend with. At least </span><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span>’s nonsense came at no additional cost to you. </span><i><span>Metroid</span></i><span> has paywalled basic options and features behind $30 amiibo figures.</span></p> <p><span>One of the big additions to </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>is an open-world hub space that Samus travels through on a super cool motorcycle. Unfortunately, this area is pretty lifeless, and you only really have the rattle and hum of Samus’ bike to accompany its desolate, isolating vibes.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s some ambient music in the background, but it’s certainly not doing much to make these sections exciting. Some open-world games, like </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span>, let you turn on a radio station while traveling to make driving segments more stimulating, but </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>has no such option…unless you buy the </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4 </span></i><span>Samus amiibo.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let me get this straight: If you pay $29.99 for the collectible Samus amiibo in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MetroidPrime4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MetroidPrime4</a>  you get to play/select music while driving the Vi-O-La bike in the otherwise quiet desert… In other words: They locked MUSIC while riding through a desert behind a $30 paywall… Am… <a href="https://t.co/qmFRbvdNhR">https://t.co/qmFRbvdNhR</a></p> <p>— Luke Stephens (@LukeStephens) <a href="https://twitter.com/LukeStephens/status/1996340617497227440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The figure allows you to change the music while riding your motorcycle, and paywalling such a basic feature would be maddening if it weren’t also one of the most Nintendo-ass decisions the company could have made. I think I’m more impressed by the new ways it finds to be obtuse than anything.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Amiibo figures, small figurines of characters that unlock things when you tap them on a Nintendo game system were first introduced in 2014 for the Wii U and 3DS, and have always come with bonus in-game rewards that were, often items or cosmetics. Gating features that would be standard in most games is so weirdly hostile that I’m surprised Nintendo gets away with it.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000650512" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650512"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650512">© Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>For whatever it’s worth, the Samus amiibo looks great, but do keep in mind it’s not to be confused with the </span><i><span>other</span></i><span> Samus figure that includes her bike. That one won’t let you change the music; instead, it will let you change the motorcycle’s color and see how much you’ve traveled on your chopper. Good thing these things look pretty on a shelf. I’m trying to imagine what would happen if any other company charged $30 for baseline functionality. It probably wouldn’t go well!</span></p>

              <p>As we soar right toward the end of the year, all our Instagram and Twitter feeds are now expectedly inundated with Spotify Wrapped. The music streaming platform’s end-of-year personal summaries always make for a fun time of defending you’re quirky top 5s or lying that, “I only really use Spotify when my kids are in the car. I&nbsp;<em>definitely</em> didn’t listen to 5,247 minutes of ‘This Is What It Sounds Like’ from&nbsp;<em>K-Pop Demon Hunters&nbsp;</em>on my own!” It’s okay. Me too, buddy.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-watch-se-3-gets-cleared-out-at-all-time-low-practically-renewed-level-pricing-for-its-latest-smartwatch-2000650254</link>
            <guid>1372798</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Even Black Friday and Cyber Week deals tend to give the greatest discounts to the one-gen-behind tech devices while keeping the markdowns on the newest releases far more modest. And when a brand-new device does get a big splashy deal, it’s almost always shortlived.</p>
<p>Yet here we are nearly a week after Black Friday, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5576/">one of Apple’s newest smartwatches is still sitting under $200 at Amazon</a>. That’s the 40mm Apple Watch SE 3, which is still $50 below its usual price despite being barely three months old. There’s no catch, no hidden “refurbished” language, or anything else that would give you pause before cashing in and upgrading your exercise tracking, sleep monitoring, and overall smartwatch game for under $200.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5576/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Upgrade or Starter</h2>
<p>At $200 and with the sturdy construction that Apple puts into all of its smartwatches, the Apple Watch SE 3 is in a unique position where it can be either an upgraded watch for someone with an older model, or an ideal first smartwatch for a younger user. The Apple Watch For Your Kids feature is easily set up on the SE 3, and it lets the wearer call, text, and share their location even if they don’t have an iPhone. They’ll benefit from the all-day 18-hour battery life and rapid recharging just as much as adult wearers, if not more.</p>
<p>As an upgrade on an older smartwatch, the SE 3 brings a wide array of advanced features, most notably in the health and sleep monitoring and tracking departments. The SE 3 monitors the quality and duration of your sleep and gives you an overall sleep score so you can work to maintain or improve it. The smartwatch also gives you alerts if it detects possible sleep apnea, which could give you early detection of a potentially life-threatening condition and allow you to seek treatment.</p>
<p>All of the workout tracking, activity rings, seamless sync of data with an iPhone, and other advanced features that have established the Apple Watch as one of the preeminent health-oriented smartwatches on the market, are present in the SE 3, and in their most recent and advanced forms.</p>



<h2>Easy to See</h2>
<p>The many great features and visuals of the Apple Watch SE 3 are always at the ready, thanks to the 1,000 nits of brightness that come from the OLED Retina display. It also now features Always-On display mode, so you can look down at any time during your workout or run and see your running pace or heart rate, or your text messages and incoming calls.</p>
<p>The 40mm GPS model of the Apple Watch SE 3 continues to defy convention during the holiday shopping season, first by getting a fat $50 price break, and now by keeping it well past Black Friday. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5576/">This 20% off deal at Amazon is still going strong, but who knows for how long?</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Logitech Failed to Clear Racing Wheel at Black Friday, Now Liquidating Stock at Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/logitech-failed-to-clear-racing-wheel-at-black-friday-now-liquidating-stock-at-record-low-2000650485</link>
            <guid>1372783</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cyber Monday ended three days ago, and Black Friday seems like a long time ago but Amazon still has this bundle at its lowest price ever: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6208/">Logitech G923 racing wheel with pedals and the separate shifter usually costs $459, but right now it’s only $333</a>.</p>
<p>This is a g<strong>reat gift for people who love racing games</strong> or who are tired of playing Gran Turismo and Forza with a regular controller that doesn’t feel like real driving. The <em>TrueForce</em> force feedback system connects directly to game audio engines to make vibrations and resistance that match what’s happening on screen and it fixes the problem of not being able to feel what you’re seeing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6208/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How TrueForce Makes Sim Racing More Fun</h2>
<p>The<strong> G923’s force feedback technology processes game sound up to 4000 times per second</strong> to make the wheel vibrate: You can feel the texture of different road surfaces, the rumble of engine vibrations, and the effect of hitting curbs or going off-track through steering resistance that changes all the time. This is different from older force feedback systems that only reacted to directional forces like crashes or understeer as they missed the small things that make driving feel like you’re in control of the car. The dual-motor system has enough torque to make it feel like you’re steering a heavy load when you’re going fast around a corner, but it still lets you turn smoothly when you’re going slowly.</p>



<p>The <strong>wheel can turn 900 degrees</strong> which is the same amount that real car steering does which means that you are turning the wheel the same amount that you would in a real car, not making big movements. The rim is wrapped in real leather for grip and durability that lasts through long marathon races and the hand-stitching gives it a high-end look that cheap rubber or synthetic materials can’t match. Steel paddle shifters behind the wheel make a satisfying click when you change gears. They are also in a place where your fingers naturally rest while racing. The steel shaft that runs through the center of the wheel hides the force feedback motors which makes a strong connection that sends feedback exactly without any dead zones or flex.</p>
<p>The <strong>pedal set has a progressive brake spring</strong> that makes it harder to push down on the brake pedal, just like real hydraulic brakes that need more pressure to stop faster. This progressive resistance makes it easier to control how hard you brake, which is very important when you want to brake as late as possible without locking the wheels. The throttle and clutch pedals have lighter springs to make them easier to use, and all three pedals have rubber faces with texture that keep your feet from slipping when you drive aggressively.</p>



<p>The <strong>separate shifter makes the experience go from good to great</strong> by giving you a real H-pattern with six speeds and reverse: You can put the shifter exactly where it feels right for you in relation to your wheel and seat because it mounts separately with a desk clamp or screws. The metal shaft and gear mechanism make mechanical clicks and resistance that feel good to use. The whole thing is strong enough to handle rough shifting during competitive racing.</p>
<p>You can <strong>use this with PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PC, and Mac</strong> so you don’t have to stick with one platform if you upgrade your hardware or switch between systems. The wheel connects to your computer or console through USB and gets its power from them and you don’t need any extra power supplies or complicated setup beyond putting it on your desk.</p>
<p>This $126 off the bundle is a big savings compared to buying the wheel and shifter separately, where you’d usually pay full price for each part. For less than the cost of the wheel alone at regular price, you get professional-grade sim racing hardware that real racers use in competitive leagues.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Samsung 2025 B-Series Soundbar Is Now Cheaper Than Budget Earbuds as It Still Holds Its Black Friday Low Price]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-b-series-soundbar-2025-black-friday-low-cheaper-than-budget-earbuds-2000650185</link>
            <guid>1372777</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If your TV’s internal speakers don’t offer an immersive sound experience and you’re done rewinding content just to hear what was said, it’s high time you invest in a solid soundbar. The best options out there push audio that surrounds you, plus offer multiple listening modes for different needs, and now is a great time to nab one without shelling out big bucks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6200/">The latest Samsung B-Series soundbar, which comes with a built-in subwoofer, is currently down to just $100 at Amazon, after a nice 29% discount.</a> You’re saving a nice $40 on it, and it’s also the lowest we have seen it drop to in a long while. Pick yours up fast, because such discounts don’t last forever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6200/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Room-Filling Sound</h2>
<p>This compact soundbar sits nicely on the console of your TV and is minimal enough to blend into any entertainment setup. Those who prefer a cleaner setup can mount it on the wall just as well. It connects to your display (or other devices) using Bluetooth, so there are no cables or complicated steps to worry about. Once connected, it pushes bold, room-filling sound that surrounds you. It won’t feel like the audio is just being blasted from the speaker, but instead, coming from all corners and every direction. The included subwoofer takes care of the bass, bringing action-packed scenes and even your favorite tunes to life. Watching a classic action movie? You’ll feel like the fights are happening right there in your living room. Planning a horror show night? Be ready for footsteps creeping up from behind, and don’t blame us if the entire thing feels a lot more spookier!</p>
<p>Dialogues get a boost, too. It does a good job of picking up on everything that’s being said, from screams in the Real Housewives to subtle whispers in the Stranger Things. You won’t have to rewind a scene repeatedly anymore. Moreover, sound doesn’t distort at higher levels, which is great for when you’re using the soundbar to vibe to your favorite songs. There’s also a Do Not Disturb mode built right in, which automatically reduces the volume. This is one ideal for those late-night streaming sessions where you don’t want to wake the entire house up.</p>



<p>Setting things up is straightforward, and managing everything is even simpler. The soundbar can be used with your Samsung TV remote, letting you adjust power, volume, and sound effects easily. To get started, put the soundbar in the pairing mode using the input button on it. Then, turn your TV on and head to Settings &gt; Sound &gt; Sound Output &gt; Bluetooth Speaker List. Look for your soundbar in the list, and press Pair and Connect. It should be ready to use within a few minutes! All in all, if you’ve been wanting to grab a solid Bluetooth soundbar to enjoy better sound during your favorite movies and series but couldn’t pick one up during Black Friday, now is a good time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6200/">This option would normally run you around $140, but you can grab it for just $100 today</a>. You’ll also enjoy free delivery with your purchase. Just note that it’s selling out fast, so the discount, as well as the stock, won’t be around for long. Snap it up quick, because once the deal is gone, it might not come back anytime soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Three Days After Cyber Monday, Govee Permanent Outdoor Lights (200ft, 120 LEDs) Still at Record Low]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/three-days-after-cyber-monday-govee-permanent-outdoor-lights-200ft-120-leds-still-at-record-low-2000650481</link>
            <guid>1372735</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In December, holiday lights look great but being able to use them all year long gives you a lot more options for your outdoor space. If you don’t want to spend a lot of money on Philips Hue’s outdoor system, Govee has a cheaper option that works just as well and has the same features. For instance, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/">the<em> Permanent Outdoor Lights Pro</em> kit is now $459 instead of the usual $759 which is still the lowest price ever</a>, even three days after the Black Friday/Cyber Monday sales were supposed to end.</p>
<p>This 200-foot system with <strong>120 individually addressable LED lights</strong> solves the problem of having to put up and take down seasonal decorations all the time. It also gives you <strong>professional-looking accent lighting</strong> every day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why These Lights Are Good for More Than Just Holidays</h2>
<p>The new lens design makes a t<strong>riangular lighting effect that spreads out the glow i</strong>nstead of making harsh point sources whcih means that your house looks lit up instead of just having bright spots. Each LED can produce up to 50 lumens and works with <strong>color temperatures from 2700K warm white to 6500K cool white</strong> which means you can use them for everyday outdoor lighting, not just for special occasions. With <strong>the RGBWWIC feature, you can control red, green, blue, white, warm white, and separate chips</strong> and it lets you make color gradients and animations that go all the way across the installation.</p>



<p>You can change the layout to fit your roofline or other architectural features because the design can be cut and extended, and you don’t have to stick with set lengths. You can cut the strand at certain points and <strong>reconnect sections with waterproof joints every 16.4 feet</strong>: This lets you go around corners, dormers, and other things. The<strong> whole system can handle up to 200 feet of lights</strong> so you can light up a big house or put together lights on different sides of your building.</p>
<p>Using the included VHB adhesive and mounting clips that attach to your eaves or fascia, it takes about eight seconds to install each light. The lights are 2 to 4 inches away from the wall which gives them that professional floating look instead of sitting flush against the building. The <strong>IP67</strong> rating on both the lights and the adapter means that rain, snow, and sprinkler systems won’t hurt the electronics, and the IP65 control box can be mounted outside without needing extra weatherproofing. These<strong> lights can work in temperatures ranging from -4°F to 140°F</strong>&nbsp;so they can handle everything from harsh winter weather to hot summer weather without losing any performance.</p>



<p><strong>Matter, Alexa, and Google Assistant</strong> all work with smart home integration, so you can control the whole system with your voice without having to take out your phone. You can control each LED separately with the Govee Home app which means you can make your own patterns that draw attention to certain architectural features or move in ways that fit your design vision. There are <strong>75 pre-set scene modes in the app for holidays, seasons, and general ambiance</strong> so you can switch from patriotic red, white, and blue to spooky Halloween orange and purple without having to program anything yourself. The l<strong>ights will last for about 17 years of daily use</strong> at three hours per day, which means they will probably last longer than you do in the house.</p>
<p>This $300 off makes permanent outdoor lighting competitive with buying good temporary Christmas lights every few years. For less than the cost of high-end single-color strip lighting, you get individual LED control, weather resistance, and the ability to connect to a smart home. If you’ve been thinking about getting permanent outdoor lighting but couldn’t justify the cost of Philips Hue, the Govee system is on sale for the lowest price ever and has similar features for about 40% of the price.</p>
