            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I feel like I can’t even keep track of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-teaser-leak-thor-doom-trailer-avatar-2000654848"><span>all the </span><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday </span></i><span>teasers</span></a><span> anymore. Wasn’t one of these supposed to focus on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/robert-downey-jr-rdj-doctor-doom-avengers-marvel-sdcc-1851607689"><span>Robert Downey Jr. as Doctor Doom</span></a><span>? We’re now at the fourth out of the supposed four theater-exclusive trailers declaring that “so-and-so will return in </span><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday</span></i><span>,” and there’s no sign of the evil doctor yet. This fourth teaser, which is leaking online and also being taken down by Marvel almost immediately after, stars Shuri, the Black Panther, as she prepares the people of Wakanda for what’s to come, and they also meet a hero from another Earth: The Thing.</span></p> <p><span>Though the trailer is getting wiped off social media shortly after it’s been posted, we were able to see it before it got nuked. It opens with Shuri lamenting how she lost her family after the events of </span><i><span>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</span></i><span>, and we also see Namor and members of the underwater Talokan kingdom looking broodily in the distance at…something. But the real highlight is when Shuri and M’Baku greet none other than the Thing himself, Ben Grimm.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The Thing and the rest of the Fantastic Four were shown arriving on the MCU’s version of Earth after the events of </span><i><span>Thunderbolts*</span></i><span>, and in </span><i><span>Fantastic Four: First Steps</span></i><span>’ post-credits scene, we saw Doctor Doom taking an interest in Mr. Fantastic and Invisible Woman’s god baby, Franklin. We’re not sure yet how that results in the group hopping multiverses, but it is cool to see even the first glimpse of the First Family teaming up with the rest of the MCU.</span></p>

 <p><span>The first three teasers featured </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-chris-evans-steve-rogers-captain-america-2000653491"><span>Steve Rogers</span></a><span>, the ex-Captain America who “retired” at the end of </span><i><span>Avengers: Endgame</span></i><span> and is now being dragged back into the scrap for probably deeply cynical, nostalgia-baiting reasons; Thor, who prays to his father that he will be able to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1clWprLC5Ak"><span>return to his daughter Love</span></a><span>; and the X-Men, who are also </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-trailer-xmen-cyclops-charles-magneto-2000655923"><span>getting pulled into all this</span></a><span>. Again, no sign of Doctor Doom yet. Maybe there will be more teasers than initially believed? Or maybe we still have a while to wait for our first glimpse of RDJ as the ruler of Latveria.</span></p> <p><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday </span></i><span>is coming to theaters on December 18.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-magsafe-charger-restocks-at-its-lowest-price-3-in-1-charging-station-for-apple-devices-2000656779</link>
            <guid>1398268</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-start="68" data-end="557">I have far too many devices that need charging at night. Between my iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch, the mess of cables around my nightstand is starting to look like some kind of cyberpunk bird nest. It’s really my fault, though—I could easily fix this by getting a charging stand, like this Anker MagSafe charger, which would eliminate the chaos entirely.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6036/"> Normally priced at $230, it’s now available for just $161 due to a limited-time 30% discount</a>. That’s a savings of $69 during the sale.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6036/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="559" data-end="588"><strong data-start="559" data-end="588">Perfect for Apple Devices</strong></h2>
<p data-start="590" data-end="882">This Anker MagSafe charging stand is designed specifically for modern Apple products. It’s made to work with newer iPhones, AirPods, and Apple Watches that support wireless charging. The stand has three built-in wireless chargers, each designed for either your phone, watch, or AirPods case.</p>
<p data-start="884" data-end="1112">Before purchasing, make sure your devices are compatible with wireless charging. iPhones from the iPhone 12 onwards are all set, as are newer AirPods models. Older devices won’t work with this stand’s wireless charging features.</p>
<p data-start="1114" data-end="1587">What’s really impressive about this wireless charger is its speed. The stand can charge an iPhone 17 Pro to 50% in just 22 minutes, which is pretty fast for wireless charging. It provides 25W charging—better than most other wireless chargers in its class. You can leave your devices on the stand overnight, and they’ll be fully charged by morning. Alternatively, you can keep the stand at your desk while you work.</p>


<p data-start="1589" data-end="1817">The stand also features a display that shows the charging status of your devices and even a clock, making it a great addition to your nightstand. This allows you to easily check the time without lifting your head off the pillow.</p>
<p data-start="1819" data-end="2069">As with all Anker products, safety is a top priority. The MagSafe charging stand uses ActiveShield technology, which monitors temperatures over three million times per day to ensure your devices don’t overheat while charging, keeping everything safe.</p>
<p data-start="2071" data-end="2223">With the Anker MagSafe charging stand, you can clean up your nightstand and keep your devices charged without the mess of cables, all for a great price. There are two color options available. Choose either white or phantom gray. Do note that while both are on sale currently, the better deal is on the white version. It is exactly $0.01 cheaper. But then again, pennies are no longer a thing anymore so I guess they are exactly the same. Get it now for $160.99 or $160.98 for a limited time. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6036/">That’s down from a starting price of $230, meaning you end up saving $69—equivalent to 30% off.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-ipad-11-a16-chip-holds-its-holiday-clearance-price-with-extended-new-year-deals-2000657109</link>

              <p>We love tablets for the convenience they bring. You can enjoy your favorite shows on a spacious screen, catch up with work on the go, and even keep kids entertained (for a while, at least) with cartoons or games without handing over your phone. There’s no shortage of options on the market, and if you’re after an iPad, we just found a way to pick one up without paying the full price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">The 11-inch iPad with the A16 chip is currently sitting at $300 at Amazon, after a sweet $49 discount.</a> We know, it’s not the biggest price drop out there, but considering Apple products rarely go on sale, grabbing a top-rated iPad for less still feels like a win. The discount applies to blue, silver, and pink models, so there are options to choose from. Maybe go for the classic silver version if you like your gadgets minimal, or choose the stunning pink if you’re after something with a bit more personality.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast and Efficient</h2>
<p>This iPad flaunts a gorgeous, 11-inch Liquid Retina display. It’s both spacious and bright, plus it features True Tone technology that can automatically adjust according to the color temperature of the room for a comfortable viewing experience. Walk into a dim room, and it will reduce the brightness to reduce eye strain, and similarly, push it back up when you’re using the tablet outdoors. Right above the screen is a 12MP Center Stage front camera, which makes taking selfies and hopping on video calls a breeze. It keeps your center of focus while delivering impressive picture quality that helps you look your best. The front camera is paired with a 12MP Wide back camera with True Tone flash that is just as great for capturing moments, and even taking 4K videos or scanning documents.</p>
<p>The superfast A16 chip keeps things running smoothly, whether you’re trying to work on a creative project or take notes. iPadOS takes the experience even further by letting you navigate with ease. It even comes packed with essential apps like Safari, Messages, and Keynote to help you get started with work or play right away. This version gets you 128GB of storage, which is more than enough to house a ton of photos, all your important programs, and even a few movies, without feeling limited. However, if 128GB feels insufficient, there are 256GB and 512GB versions of the iPad available, too, for $399 and $590, respectively.</p>



<p>If you’re planning to use this iPad for work or creative projects, we highly recommend pairing it with the Apple Pencil (USB-C) and the Magic Keyboard Folio. The former lets you draw, sketch, and take notes with ease. The latter, on the other hand, features a two-piece design with a detachable keyboard and a protective back panel. Both of these attach magnetically to the screen, converting your iPad into a mini laptop. As for connectivity, this version supports Wi-Fi 6 to access the internet.</p>
<p>The battery is designed to last an entire workday on a single charge. You won’t have to worry about plugging it in in the middle of something important.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">The current 14% discount brings the price down to $300.</a> It’s still a bit of an investment, but if you’re after something that can support all your work and entertainment needs on the go, it’s going to be worth it. Snap it up before the deal expires or the stock runs out!</p>

              <p>Losing power can be both inconvenient and frustrating. If you’re looking to have a backup solution at home during outages, or want a reliable source to take with you on your off-road trips, now is a great time to invest in a portable power station.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6670/">Anker makes some of our favorite options around right now, and you can grab its Solix F1500 power station for just $499 at Amazon</a>. That’s after the retailer slashed its retail price of $1,399 by a whopping 64%. This is one of the lowest prices we’ve seen the power station drop to in a long while. Grab it quickly, though, as discounts this massive don’t stick around for long.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6670/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Ports for Different Devices</h2>
<p>This portable power station features an impact-resistant, flame-retardant, and anti-UV build that’s designed to handle everyday wear and tear well. You’re getting a total of 13 ports to juice all your important devices – from smartphones to kitchen appliances, entertainment gadgets, and even laptops – at the same time. These include one car outlet (120W max), two USB-C ports (100W PD max), four USB-A ports (12W each), and 6 AC outlets (1800W total output). It’s powerful enough to keep your desk lamp running for more than 35 hours, an 18 cu. ft. fridge for over seven, a coffee maker for three, and a toaster oven for just under an hour. You can also fully power a standard 58.2Wh laptop for more than 24 times, and your smartphone for over 97! Basically, this station can keep all your important stuff up and running for days and even weeks. Whether you’re craving a hot cup of joe on a camping trip or need to hit some work deadlines at home during an outage, F1500 has you covered in every situation.</p>
<p>When it comes to recharging the power station itself, you’ve got multiple options, including AC, car, and solar. Using a 600W solar panel, for instance, can push it from 0 to 80% in just under 1.5 hours. The LifeP04 battery is designed to last up to 10 years, meaning the power station will support all your energy needs for years to come. You can also extend the standby time and minimize battery damage using the power-saving mode on the station.</p>



<p>The Anker app makes it easy to manage power and check the power bank’s battery using your phone. There’s also an informative display at the top of the power bank, which shows recharging time, active ports, and other stats. Another handy feature that deserves a mention is the built-in LED. This light makes it easy to find emergency supplies and other essentials in cases of a blackout.</p>
<p>Even better, the Solix F1500 monitors temperature 100 times per second and notifies you if things get a bit too tense, ensuring smooth, safe power delivery. Included in the box are the Anker SOLIX F1500 itself, a 5-year warranty, an AC charging cable, a car charging cable, a solar charging cable, and a user manual.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6670/">Normally, you’d pay over $1,300 to enjoy the peace of mind this power station brings, but you can pick it up for just $499 today.</a> Grab it quickly, as it’s a limited-time offer. We don’t expect the deal to last more than a day.</p>
