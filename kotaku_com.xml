              <p>Peter Molyneux is a veteran game designer who’s been pushing the boundaries of what players expect from the medium for over 30 years. Peter Molydeux is a Twitter account created back in 2009 to parody the <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-man-who-promised-too-much-1537352493">famous developer’s often absurd-sounding promises</a>. With the real Molyneux’s seemingly final game, <em>Masters of Albion</em>, releasing later this year, the creator of Molydeux says it’s time to hang up the fake persona.</p> <p dir="auto">“Games evolved to the point where the ideas I was parodying were no longer outside the box,” wrote the account’s author, 3D environment artist Adam Capone, in a retirement announcement <a href="https://telegra.ph/The-last-message-01-13">posted on January 13</a>. “I never thought I’d cut ties with this account. But after reading Peter Molyneux recently saying his upcoming game would be his last, it does feel like the right moment. It’s still surreal to remember being invited to a photoshoot with the very person I was spoofing.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">You play a hole, you must move around an environment making certain elements fall into correct targets at the right time.</p> <p>— petermolydeux (@PeterMolydeux) <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterMolydeux/status/154802887241908224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2012</a></p></blockquote>  <p dir="auto">In the early 2010s, back when Twitter still felt (mostly) new and fun and wasn’t a factory for <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-grok-ai-deepfakes-undressed-images-2000658486">AI-powered bots removing women’s clothing</a>, Peter Molydeux was one of the many spoof accounts cropping up in the gaming space, among other well-known ones included <a href="https://x.com/kazhiraiceo">CEO Kaz Hirai</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/porygonnews">Porygon News</a>. The Molydeux account would tweet outrageous video game concepts like, “Online side scrolling co-op 8 player game where each person controls a leg of an octopus. Each leg can attach guns which the player can fire.”</p>

 <p dir="auto">They were funny because of how they played off of Molyneux’s own penchant for expressing grandiose ideas that never quite come together, but they were also very clever in their own right. Each concept had the kernel of something that did actually sound very cool in it, just like the Lionhead Studios cofounder’s ideas. Here’s a great 2012<em> Wired</em> article about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130208085301/https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/10/ff-peter-molyneux/all/">symbiotic relationship between the two</a>.</p>

  <p dir="auto">For anyone unfamiliar with the <em>Fable</em> designer’s reputation for ambitious overpromises, <i>Project Milo</i><em>&nbsp;</em>is a good example. It was supposed to be a Kinect game for Xbox 360 in which players interacted with a child. Molyneux demonstrated the game at a 2010 TEDGlobal talk where he boasted that his team had managed to “create a real, living being in a computer.” Microsoft, more than a decade away from going all in on AI, was unimpressed and canceled the game. In some ways, <i>Project Milo</i> became the platonic ideal of a Molyneux game: one that lived in the imagination of what might be rather than the disappointment of what actually shipped.</p>

 <p dir="auto">Now back to the fake Twitter account:</p> <blockquote> <p dir="auto">I remember pulling up in a taxi to see him casually smoking outside the studio. He welcomed me in, excitedly showing <em>Curiosity</em> but also sharing excitement about another random small indie game he was playing and giving me his ipad to play it. Then later in a pub he was hinting at his ambition for Curiosity. That enthusiasm for the player experience, regardless if they land or not is at the heart of this industry.</p> <p dir="auto">I think the industry lost something when Molyneux vowed never to speak on stage again. Over time, that kind of unfiltered excitement has been replaced by carefully rehearsed pitches and bullet points. Fewer people go off-cue. Fewer let passion drive the conversation rather than marketing.</p> <p dir="auto">I hope every generation creates its own Molyneuxs. Joseph Fares at Hazelight reminds me [of] an early Molyneux, i.e developers who get carried away talking about their “baby” instead of selling a product. I’ll always be grateful for Molyneux and what he gave to the industry.</p> <p dir="auto">I promise this is 100% not actually Peter Molyneux writing this.</p> </blockquote> <p dir="auto">Capone, who was just laid off as part of Ubisoft’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-halifax-shutdown-unionized-rainbow-six-mobile-2000657752">shuttering of its recently unionized Halifax studio</a>, used Molydeux’s final sign-off to call for game developers to prioritize creative risk-taking over chasing metrics. “As the industry inevitably rebuilds, I’m convinced it’ll be the small, weird games from over-excited enthusiastic designers in control of their games as they continue creating new experiences and nudging us forward, step by (baby?) step,” he wrote.</p>

 <h2 dir="auto"><em>Masters of Albion</em> offers a last shot at redemption</h2> <p dir="auto">Will one of those be Molyneux’s own <em>Masters of Albion</em>? The pitch is an open-world “god game” that borrows elements from across his past work, which includes the early, influential god game <em>Populous</em>. A new trailer for <em>MoA </em>dropped this week and a release date of April 22 was revealed. “<em>Masters of Albion</em> is the culmination of my life’s work, a game that owes so much to titles like <em>Dungeon Keeper</em>, <em>Black &amp; White</em>, and<em> Fable</em>,” the veteran director said in a statement. “It’s a totally unique game that we hope will delight players, a game that brings God Games into the modern gaming landscape and puts the genre firmly back on the map.”</p>

 <p dir="auto">While some take inspiration from Molyneux’s romanticism, others have called him out for what sometimes seem essentially like lies. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peter-molyneux-interview-godus-reputation-kickstarter">In 2015 he rejected those accusations</a>. Last year he told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/its-about-redemption-peter-molyneux-says-masters-of-albion-will-make-up-for-decades-of-overpromising-on-things/"><em>Edge</em> magazine</a>, “I admit now that I did overpromise on things, and said things that I shouldn’t have said about <em>Curiosity</em>. But I only ever did that because I thought it was the right thing to do at the time.”</p> <p dir="auto">He called <em>Masters of Albion</em> a” redemption title.” One thing helping give players more confidence in this one than they had in his last project, <a href="https://kotaku.com/peter-molyneuxs-next-game-is-a-blockchain-business-sim-1848201920">a blockchain business sim that went nowhere</a>, is who else is on board. <em>LittleBigPlanet</em> director Mark Healey, <em>Black &amp; White 2</em> designer Iain Wright, and other game development veterans are all involved, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/media-molecule-co-founder-and-bullfrog-veterans-on-board-for-peter-molyneuxs-final-god-game-masters-of-albion/">according to <em>VGC</em></a>. Hopefully it’s a good game, or at least a fitting send off for Peter Molydeux.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Bunch More Gameplay Just Leaked From That Canceled Nolanverse Batman Game]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In early 2009, shortly before the launch of <a href="https://kotaku.com/batman-arkham-gotham-knights-suicide-squad-assassins-cr-1848911270"><em>Batman: Arkham Asylum</em></a> and a year after Christopher Nolan’s <em>The Dark Knight,</em> developers at Monolith were working on a <em>Batman</em> game that would be connected to Nolan’s films. Gameplay footage of the game, titled Project Apollo, leaked in 2024. But now, even more footage has been uncovered showing off what could have been.</p> <p>On January 12, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mrtalida.bsky.social/post/3mcba4da5xk2x">retro game archivist MrTalida uploaded</a> once-deleted-but-now-recovered Project Apollo files that were found on an old hard drive. Included in the files, which were created between April 2009 and January 2010, are video clips of early gameplay and in-engine tests of Project Apollo, with many focused on how sound and music would work in the third-person <em>Batman</em> action game. It’s interesting to see how much progress the team at Monolith made on the game over those 10 months. <a href="https://archive.org/details/project-apollo-documents-and-videos">You can find all of them on the Internet Archive.</a></p>

 <p>Perhaps the biggest and coolest new information gleaned from these leaked files is gameplay footage of the Tumbler, aka Batman’s tank-like Batmobile from the <em>Dark Knight</em> trilogy. In the leaked footage, you can see the Tumbler driving through what appears to be a large train yard while escaping police and destroying various objects and explosive barrels. In other words, a pretty standard-looking 2010-era vehicle section, the kind that would often appear in single-player AAA games around that time.</p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:ozbdmak67oao253ndqc7qqlf/app.bsky.feed.post/3mcbatx32gk2v" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidyqklm2io4hbu6dko46a2ktvnrmmlkewy32vzgkfrg6ndcpx2yxa"> <p lang="en">Lastly, here's a series of videos showing the progress Monolith had made on the tumbler batmobile sections.  AFAIK, the previous leak didn't show any tumbler footage, so this may be our first peek.</p> <p>You can see how the feature progressed from Oct 2009, to Nov 2009, to Jan 2010.</p> <p>Enjoy the files!<br> 9/9</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ozbdmak67oao253ndqc7qqlf?ref_src=embed">MrTalida (@mrtalida.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:ozbdmak67oao253ndqc7qqlf/post/3mcbatx32gk2v?ref_src=embed">2026-01-13T00:02:07.387Z</a></p></blockquote></div>   <h2>Why the Nolan <em>Batman</em> game was canned</h2> <p>As mentioned, <a href="https://kotaku.com/canceled-nolan-batman-game-leak-1851387503">we saw footage from a later build of this canned <em>Batman</em> game in 2024,</a> showing off combat, traversal, and more. But even before that, in 2019, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e0lRkQd9skU&amp;list=PLO9mxFELVbbHM1dR6VumpP60zBENfQr0b">Liam Robertson extensively covered this canceled project</a>, reporting various details about the title, including the fact that the game had been in development for approximately 18 months before it was killed.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The open world of Gotham could be traversed by either gliding and utilizing the grappling hook (as established in the Arkham games) or by operating the Tumbler/Batmobile. <a href="https://t.co/VZKXJBFsgP">pic.twitter.com/VZKXJBFsgP</a></p> <p>— SpideyRanger 🇬🇭 (@Dageekydude) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dageekydude/status/1775572473330672034?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2024</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It was also planned to be an open-world game and would have featured a system by which randomly generated Gotham City thugs would appear to fight Batman and return, stronger and angrier, later. If this sounds familiar, it’s because Monolith would take this idea and build it into the famous Nemesis System found in 2014’s <em>Shadow of Mordor</em> and its 2017 sequel, <em>Shadow of War</em>.</p>

 <p>As for why it was canceled, Robertson reported that publisher WB Games made it clear to Monolith that the only way the project could move forward was if the studio could get Nolan to approve it. The game was to be set in his version of the <em>Batman</em> universe, after all, and the studio wanted to make sure he was involved. Sadly, Nolan seemed uninterested in the game, and Monolith eventually gave up and pivoted to making <em>Lord of the Rings</em> games. More recently, the studio was working on a <em>Wonder Woman</em> project that would have utilized the Nemesis System, <a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400">but sadly Monolith was shuttered by WB in February 2025.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Legend Major Nelson Is Unity’s Latest Layoff]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-major-nelson-unity-layoffs-2000659406</link>
            <guid>1404982</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Gaming executive Larry Hyrb, aka Major Nelson, has revealed this week that he’s out at the game engine maker Unity. The Xbox veteran joined as Director of Community and Advocacy only a couple of years ago.</span></p> <p><span>“After nearly three decades of making an impact at Microsoft, I joined Unity in 2024. During my time there, I rebuilt their Community and Advocacy Team with a deliberate strategy that created a clearer, more connected experience for creators, developers, and gamers,” Hyrb </span><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/hryb_ive-always-been-transparent-with-this-community-activity-7416864352840085504-MDJc?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAACLzsjMBiEcKGm66u9szH_XVpdQ1NU1SZcQ"><span>explained on LinkedIn</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Hyrb continued: “We brought energy back to channels that had gone quiet, restored trust, and showed up consistently where it mattered. I elevated Unity’s visibility at PAX and key industry events, strengthened relationships, and ensured Unity had a clear voice in the broader conversation.”</span></p>   <p><span>It’s not exactly clear when Hyrb was laid off or if the departure is part of a bigger wave of fresh cuts at the software company. “I’ve had invigorating conversations over the past weeks with companies in tech and non-tech spaces to discuss partnerships,” he said on </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hryb.me/post/3mccuyabbv22d"><span>BlueSky</span></a><span>. “I love what I do but I also believe change is necessary. I’ll let you know where I go from here.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Major Nelson was previously an important public figure within the Xbox community. He spent almost 23 years at Microsoft, fostering the Xbox Live community and promoting the Xbox 360’s user-facing features, including the Achievement system, cloud saves, in-game messaging, and party chat.</span></p>

  <p><span>He left </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-major-nelson-larry-hryb-official-podcast-microsoft-1850642324"><span>Microsoft back in 2023</span></a><span>, a move that preceded Xbox’s pivot to being multiplatform and a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ps5-exclusives-streaming-1851722886"><span>broader marketing strategy</span></a><span> that didn’t have a single piece of hardware at its center. The brand hasn’t been as public facing, let alone as community-first, since Hyrb’s departure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Unity has had a rough several years. In 2023, the company announced that it would install a new Runtime Fee, but was eventually </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-install-runtime-fees-canceled-ceo-blog-post-price-1851647405"><span>reversed due to immense backlash from developers</span></a><span>. A few months later, then CEO </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-john-riccitiello-ea-intall-fee-resign-fifa-madden-1850914295"><span>John Riccitiello stepped down</span></a><span>. In 2024, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/unity-layoffs-1800-people-jobs-25-percent-january-2024-1851150254"><span>Unity laid off a massive chunk of its workforce</span></a><span>, eliminating around 1,800, or 25%, of its employees. Last year, Unity then </span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-unity-continues-layoffs-with-abrupt-communications-and-5am-emails"><span>laid off its Behavior team</span></a><span>.</span></p>
