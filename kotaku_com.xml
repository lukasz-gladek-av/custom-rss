              <p><em>Final Fantasy VII</em>‘s Cloud Strife has two defining characteristics: he suffers from repressed emotional trauma and carries a giant sword. Square Enix almost toyed with ruining one of those when it was originally planning to develop the <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-the-kotaku-review-1842697312">current</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129">remake</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-rebirth-switch-2-xbox-port-part-3-2000629254">trilogy</a>.</p> <p>The Ex-Soldier’s iconic Buster Sword looks like a six-foot butcher’s knife. While fans love it, the RPG publisher was worried it might not look realistic enough for the real-world aesthetic its Unreal Engine homages to the classic PS1 game were chasing. Maybe what looked good with blocky polygons back in 1997 wouldn’t fly in a less cartoony overhaul.</p>

 <p>“While making <em>Remake</em>, there was this aspect of the weight and how Cloud swings [the sword] around with one hand that sort of felt like it would weaken the sense of realism, you know?” director Naoki Hamaguchi recently recalled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EKxyZ5DsgSs">in an interview</a> with YouTuber Julien Chièze, according to a translation by <a href="https://x.com/ShinraArch/status/1997787393253118017/photo/1">Shinra Archeology</a>.</p>

 <p>“So at the time, when we were making <em>Remake</em>, there was some discussion about whether we should give Cloud a more realistic version of the Buster Sword,” he continued. “But it was just too iconic, and if we’d made it just a regular old sword, players wouldn’t accept it…in the end we stayed faithful to the OG and a whole new generation of people fell in love with it, so I think it was the right call.”</p> <p>It’s hard to know just how serious Hamaguchi is being or just how real the concerns and doubts raised in those original meetings were. Take away his Buster Sword and Cloud is just a spikey-haired emo kid slowly having a psychological break with reality. Much harder for all the fans to cosplay as during conventions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Game Awards just keeps getting bigger and bigger. While viewers sometimes complain about the marathon runtime and nitpick every game announcement trailer they don’t care about, Geoff Keighley’s year-end showcase has become the closest thing we still have to an old-school E3 marketing extravaganza. In the face of <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-tgas-geoff-keighley-reviews-trailers-1851720812">annual criticism</a> about not putting the focus exclusively on the awards part of the ceremony, the host recently explained why his show is as much about recognizing art as it is about revealing big game announcements.</p> <p>“There are many different constituents that tune in,” Keighley told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/interview-geoff-keighley-on-the-impossible"><em>The Game Business</em></a> (a newsletter he cofounded with author Chris Dring) in a new interview. “And it is a balancing act. You correctly pointed out that there’s the awards aspect of the show, there’s the announcement aspect, and yes, there are some people that would like to see the show be all awards. Some would like to see all announcements.”</p>

 <p>He described a virtuous cycle in which more viewership means more attention for the games being celebrated, big and small, which can in turn lead to more sales for the companies or indie teams behind them.</p> <p>“My view always is that the announcements create a very wide audience that tunes into the show,” he said. “And because of that, when we do give out these awards, they’re seen by a lot of people. Lots of games get sold out of The Game Awards. <em>Balatro</em> had a huge boost. So hopefully it’s a good thing for developers. But that careful balance is a hard thing to strike and we don’t always get it right.”</p>

 <p><em>Balatro</em> was already a big sensation in the gaming world by the time The Game Awards 2024 aired, but its prizes that night <a href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-goty-game-awards-app-store-steam-sale-1851709617">helped catapult it to even bigger success</a> in the months that followed, aided in part by a popular mobile port. All of a sudden games that were big among a hardcore group are exposed to a much wider audience.</p>

 <p>Even just getting nominated can help raise visibility in that way. Alinea Analytics’ Rhys Elliott <a href="https://substack.com/@superhys/p-181156422">recently shared</a> the estimated sales boosts that the Game Awards’ Game of the Year contenders have received over the past few weeks. While the effect was biggest for frontrunner <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, the most nominated game in TGAs history, nominees like <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em> were also projected to have sold an additional 100,000 copies during the period.</p> <p>Elliott says holiday sales are also a big factor in that. That’s probably why any Game Awards winners cut their price directly after the event to take advantage of the brief spotlight.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>King of Meat</em> developer Glowmade will layoff “around a dozen people” early next year, according to a new report <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/king-of-meat-glowmade-layoffs/">from <em>Insider Gaming</em></a>. These “voluntary redundancies” come just two months after the multiplayer party game hit Steam and after it reportedly failed to hit an ambitious 100,000 concurrent player target. <em>King of Meat</em> peaked at just 320 people on PC instead.</p> <p>Over the past few days, several Glowmade developers posted to LinkedIn that they’re looking for work. The U.K.-based studio published <em>King of Meat</em> in October, backed by Amazon Game Studio. <em>Insider Gaming</em> reported that discussions around the layoffs began earlier in December, and that leadership previously told staff the studio “had the runway to keep going.”</p>

 <p>Amazon Game Studios announced in 2021 that it was <a href="https://www.amazongamestudios.com/en-us/news/articles/amazon-games-publishing-original-game-from-glowmade">expanding its publishing efforts</a> with Glowmade, which was working on an “exciting new IP.”&nbsp;Glowmade had 25 staffers, according to a news release at the time.</p> <p>The studio’s leadership was reportedly hoping <em>King of Meat</em> would reach “a concurrent player count of at least 100,000,” but instead failed to maintain 1,000 players across platforms. On Steam, <em>King of Meat</em> had a recent 24-hour peak of 23 players; its top concurrent player number there is 320 players, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1926980/charts/#max">according to SteamDB</a>.</p>

 <p>Most people probably only remember it as the game with the flashy trailer at Gamescom 2024 which featured an animated version of Opening Night Live host Geoff Keighley. That memorable moment could have cost <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-trailers-steam-1851629266">close to half a million dollars</a>, but apparently didn’t do much to keep <em>King of Meat</em> bubbling around in the popular consciousness.</p> <p><em>King of Meat</em>‘s October release didn’t go well despite a huge marketing push, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRr0i2akDlk">including a big-budget MrBeast video</a>. The video, which included a whole dang set, more than a dozen content creators, and a $250,000 prize, is essentially a mini-<em>King of Meat</em> esports event. It was published just after <em>King of Meat</em>‘s release date and racked up 6.8 million views.</p> <p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to Glowmade and Amazon Game Studios for comment.</p>

              <p>The news that <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-deal-batman-hbo-max-2000650875">Netflix is trying to buy Warner Bros.</a> didn’t ever look like it would be <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-wb-batman-arkham-hogwarts-legacy-mortal-kombat-2000650918">good for game players</a>, but a recent investor call by the streamer suggests things are a whole lot worse than we previously imagined. Netflix co-CEO Gregory Peters told investors that when it came to Warner’s gaming division, it didn’t even factor it into the $83 billion dollar deal. It was apparently considered to add nothing to the company’s overall value, because “they’re relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things.”</p> <p>Warner Bros. Games hasn’t exactly shone of late, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/monolith-productions-wonder-woman-multiversus-cancel-wb-1851766400">multiple closures</a> of <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-panther-ea-cliffhanger-monolith-productions-1851782787">extremely talented teams</a>, and the <a href="https://kotaku.com/multiversus-season-5-aquaman-offline-update-refund-1851752453">recent flops of <em>MultiVersus</em></a> and <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-arkham-1851522893">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a></em>, but it’s still hardly minor. For one, <em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>was the best-selling game of 2023 in the U.S., more popular that <em>Call of Duty</em>, selling 34 million copies in its first year. That’s&nbsp;<em>billions</em> of dollars in revenue.&nbsp;Then you’ve got the <em>Arkham</em> franchise, <em>Mortal Kombat</em>, plus the infinite money machine that is every single&nbsp;<em>Lego</em> game from&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> to&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter</em> to&nbsp;<em>Batman</em>. Yes, it’s suffered as much as every other arm of the company under David Zaslav, but it’s not something you’d immediately write off as worthless. However, that’s the price Netflix put on Warner Bros. Games when bidding for the whole company.</p>

 <p>“While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space,” said Gregory Peters on the <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4851311-netflix-inc-nflx-presents-at-ubs-global-media-and-communications-conference-2025-transcript">December 8 call</a> (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/netflix-didnt-attribute-any-value-to-warner-bros-games-business-in-83bn-mega-deal/"><em>Pocket Gamer</em></a>), “we actually didn’t attribute any value to that from the get-go because they’re relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things.”</p>

 <h2>Netflix already failed hard with games</h2> <p>It’s important to put this perspective into context. Netflix has spent <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-squid-game-unleashed-app-subscription-team-blue-1851755122"><em>years</em> trying to work out how to make money through video games</a>, and only <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-gaming-hades-monument-vally-golden-idol-braid-1851785038">failed</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-team-blue-bungie-blizzard-sony-closed-1851678075">failed again</a>, stripping back expensive forays into the worlds of PC and console gaming and now sticking exclusively to mobile games with a casual emphasis. That makes sense: Netflix is a TV and movie streaming service, and it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-google-stadia-cloud-streaming-xbox-ps5-geforce-1849676394">with hubris that it launched its video gaming ambitions</a> into a market that Google had just so spectacularly crashed out of. Big companies look at the sorts of numbers publishers make from a <em>Call of Duty</em> or&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em> and think, “We’d like some of that please,” and assume it just happens. It doesn’t, millions gets wasted, and people lose jobs.</p>

 <p>It’s in the aftermath of this that Netflix is attempting its purchase of Warner Bros., so on some level you can understand why a company so disillusioned with gaming might be so <i lang="fr">laissez faire</i> with this aspect of the prize. However, it also speaks of some quite spectacular shortsightedness, given the lucrative nature of so many of WBG’s licenses.</p>

 <p>This all suggests bad times are ahead for those surviving developers under Warner’s roof. Peters further comments initially suggest there might be some internal insight, as he says, “Now we’re super excited because some of those properties that they’ve built<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment --><em>Hogwarts</em> is a great example of that<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->have done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we’re offering.” However, “what we’re offering” is the key phrase, given how clear Netflix has recently made its focus on mobile only. “They’ve got great studios and great folks working there,” adds Peters, “so we think that there’s definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven’t built that into our deal model.”</p> <p>It certainly makes sense to see the IPs Netflix is getting in the deal as opportunities when it comes to its casual gaming development. The&nbsp;<em>Lego</em> games are already mobile-friendly and have a broad family audience, while licenses like <em>Harry Potter</em> and <em>Batman</em> can be milked in an endless stream of mediocre cellphone games. But hopes for further entries in Rocksteady’s <em>Arkham</em> franchise seem unlikely to be met, let alone the new owners reviving what Warner Bros. once did best, with game series like <em>Shadow of Mordor</em>, <em>FEAR</em>, and other cruelly abandoned Monolith properties.</p>
