            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Look, I know people are mad about the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-fire-red-leaf-green-switch-pokemon-direct-price-2000671938"><i><span>Pokémon FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen </span></i><span>Switch ports costing $20</span></a><span>, but I feel like this anger needs a redirect. We should actually be more mad that this sick physical edition of the ports isn’t coming anywhere outside of Japan.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.pokemoncenter-online.com/9900000007430.html"><span>Japanese Pokémon Center</span></a><span> is selling a roughly $130 special edition of </span><i><span>FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen </span></i><span>for Switch that includes replicas of the original Game Boy Advance packaging, as well as a set of glass Poké Balls for each of the original starter Pokémon: Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle. Look at them! They light up and everything! It’s such a pretty package, and if you’re not in Japan, I’m sorry that I showed you something you can’t have.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pokémon FireRed and LeafGreen special physical bundle will be available in Japan on the Pokémon Center Online!</p> <p>– Glass Poké Ball set<br>– GBA replica packaging set<br>– One game download card<br>– Specially designed case<br>– Price is 19,800yen ($127)<a href="https://t.co/k6YZZk4Cjn">https://t.co/k6YZZk4Cjn</a> <a href="https://t.co/dzqrO4rOlf">pic.twitter.com/dzqrO4rOlf</a></p> <p>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/2024771449656131802?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Granted, like most exclusive </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>merchandise in this package, this will no doubt end up on resale sites for a grossly overinflated price thanks to scalpers. So it’s not impossible for you to get one if you don’t live in Japan, it’s just probably going to be much more expensive. Go with Arceus, friends.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pokémon FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i><span> Switch ports are launching digitally next week on February 27 after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-where-when-to-watch-generation-10-switch-2000671968"><span>the Pokémon Day Presents showcase</span></a><span> as part of the series’ 30th anniversary celebration. The games are remakes of the original </span><i><span>Pokémon Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Green </span></i><span>games that started it all back in 1996, and were originally released in 2004.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Folks are feeling pretty sore about the $20 price tag on these twenty-year-old games, but </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/joemerrick.bsky.social/post/3mfbjadx6sk2w"><span>some speculate</span></a><span> that the games skipped the Nintendo Switch Online subscription in favor of a downloadable version because the service’s rewind features would make it easier to save scum a series that has, historically, gone out of its way to ensure that is harder to do. Either way, it’s cheaper than buying them secondhand for your GBA, I suppose.</span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-9-requiem-preview-leon-gameplay-grace-2000662270"><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i></a> <span>is just a week away from its February 27 launch, but it has also leaked ahead of time thanks to some retailers and fans getting early physical copies. As such, Capcom has released a statement asking fans not to spread any of the spoilers and footage circulating online.</span></p> <p><span>In a statement posted <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/2024835538251923590?s=20">on the series’ social channels</a>, Capcom says it is issuing takedowns on early leaked footage, and wants fans to be respectful of those who are looking for a spoiler-free experience next week by not sharing any videos or details on social media.</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><span>Please don’t post or share pre-release leaks and spoilers for </span><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>We really want everyone to enjoy the game’s story and experience as much as possible. Our legal department will continue to issue takedowns and deletion notices for leaks in order to preserve your day-one experience.</span></p> <p><span>It’s not long now until the game is out, so we look forward to seeing all your reactions after release!</span></p></blockquote> <p><i><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></i><span> has suffered a handful of leaks since it was announced last year, including the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/leon-kennedy-resident-evil-requiem-9-playable-leak-2000651669"><span>accidental reveal of Leon Kennedy as a returning playable character</span></a><span> days before it was officially announced. Nothing compares to footage of the game’s finale circulating around the internet, though. Stay safe out there and mute any key terms on social media to minimize the risk of finding out how Grace and Leon’s story ends. Or, better yet, just stop looking at social media altogether. You’ll save yourself from spoilers and also avoid seeing all the brainrotting nonsense the internet beams directly into your eyeballs.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/most-playstation-5-owners-have-been-playing-the-same-games-since-2022-2000672009</link>
            <guid>1441981</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Retail tracking firm Circana shared the top five most-played PlayStation games in the U.S. in 2026. The list is the same as it was last year, with <em>Fortnite</em> at the top. And looking back at 2023 and 2022, you’ll notice that the most popular titles haven’t changed much at all since then, either. That’s bad news for developers trying to release new multiplayer games, and for fans hoping for more innovation.</p> <p>On Thursday, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mfb74qkg3s2p">Circana senior director Mat Piscatella shared</a> the top PlayStation games ranked by total U.S. players. <em>Fortnite</em> topping the list doesn’t tell the whole story. In actuality, 56 percent of all active PS5 players hopped into Epic’s battle royale shooter at least once during the year. Yeah, more than half of the people who own a PS5 have played or are still playing <em>Fortnite</em>. And more wild than that is the fact that 2025’s version of this list matches up perfectly with 2024’s.</p>

 <p><strong>2025 – Most played PlayStation games</strong></p> <ol> <li><em>Fortnite</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty</em></li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em></li> <li><em>Roblox</em></li> <li><em>Minecraft</em></li> </ol> <p><strong>2024 – Most played PlayStation games</strong></p> <ol> <li><em>Fortnite</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty</em></li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em></li> <li><em>Roblox</em></li> <li><em>Minecraft</em></li> </ol> <p>I pinged Piscatella for the 2023 and 2022 lists of most-played PlayStation games, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mfcfpfc77s2k">he quickly replied</a>. You’ll notice that almost all of the games on this list, with the exception of <em>Apex Legends</em> in 2022, are the same games seen on the most recent list. (<em>Call of Duty</em> is an odd duck as its launcher on console and PC contains <em>Warzone</em> and other past entries.)</p> <p><strong>2023 – Most played PlayStation games</strong></p> <ol> <li><em>Fortnite</em></li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty HQ</em></li> <li><em>Minecraft</em></li> </ol> <p><strong>2022 – Most played PlayStation games</strong></p> <ol> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em></li> <li><em>Fortnite </em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Warzone</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</em></li> <li><em>Apex Legends</em></li> </ol> <p>In a follow-up post, Piscatella explained that only two new games broke through to make the extended list of the 10 most-played games in 2025: <em>Battlefield 6 </em>and <em>Skate.&nbsp;</em>One of those was the best-selling game for the whole year. The other is free-to-play.</p>

 <p>“The behemoths are locked in and have black hole levels of gravity,” wrote Piscatella. “Competing with these games is critical. Competing with these games is beyond challenging, even for platform holders.”</p> <p>In 2026, we’ve already seen one high-profile multiplayer game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192"><em>Highguard</em>,</a> struggle to break through and find an audience. <a href="https://kotaku.com/old-games-2023-playtime-data-fortnite-roblox-minecraft-1851382474">This data (and past data)</a> shows that a big part of the problem is that a large chunk of the video game audience just isn’t budging from the games they already like. And in the case of <em>Fortnite, Roblox, and Warzone,</em> players don’t even have to spend a single penny to enjoy these games if they don’t want to.</p>

 <p>Why would the average person plunk down $70 or more on a new game when all of their friends are playing one of these five games that they already own or that are free to play? So far, the gaming industry is struggling to produce a compelling answer to that question.</p>

              <p>Will The Pokémon Company ever get a handle on insatiable demand for new cards? We’re almost certainly getting <em>Nioh 4</em> now. And Ubisoft just can’t catch a break. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. It’s back after a brief two-day hiatus. It’s been a busy week! We’re still <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/xeecee.bsky.social/post/3mfb5tqvm7k2e">trying to find Tuvok’s lungs</a>.</p> <p>We used to have honest-to-god commercials in this country. Including live-action ones for video games. Which company will be brave enough <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sharkabytes.bsky.social/post/3mf6alilycc2c">to bring them back</a>?</p> <h2>Ubisoft studio evacuated over potential bomb threat</h2> <p>500 staff at Ubisoft’s Montpellier had to leave the office on February 19 after a bomb threat was sent to the local police station, <a href="https://www.midilibre.fr/2026/02/19/alerte-a-la-bombe-a-ubisoft-montpellier-pres-de-800-salaries-du-secteur-evacues-par-mesure-de-precaution-13234922.php"><em>Midi Libre</em> reports</a>. The email claimed there was an explosive device at the studio where developers have been working on<a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-remains-a-priority-for-us-ubisoft-says-2000662321"><em> Beyond Good and Evil 2</em></a> and a <a href="https://kotaku.com/rayman-legends-remake-ubisoft-prince-persia-lost-crown-1851679621">new <em>Rayman</em> game</a>. Dozens of police responded, created a perimeter around the building, and searched for anything suspicious-looking but ultimately couldn’t find anything. Was it just a random hoax or an unfortunate “prank” by a disgruntled employee or gamer?</p>

 <p>“After investigation, authorities have confirmed there is no credible threat to our Montpellier studio,” a spokesperson for the company told Kotaku in an emailed statement. “As a precaution, we evacuated the building and worked with local authorities in accordance with our safety protocols. All employees are safe, and operations are resuming.”</p> <p>Ubisoft has been dealing with <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-strike-assassins-creed-delay-cancel-rto-layoffs-2000667820">frustrations from staff</a> over the company’s ongoing cuts and a new return-to-office policy as well as perennially being the target of unhinged rants by some people online, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-woke-stop-killing-games-1851786587">including individual shareholders</a>, over culture war grievances.</p>

 <h2>Pokémon buys a new U.S. card distributor</h2> <p>“This reflects our long-term commitment to supporting the Pokémon community and the broader trading card ecosystem,” Pokémon Company president Kenji Okubo said in a <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/The-Pokemon-Company-International-to-Acquire-Excell-Brands">press release this week</a>. “Excell Brands has built a strong reputation as a trusted distributor and category management partner for their customers with deep insight into the needs of Pokémon fans.”&nbsp;&nbsp;Does that mean I’ll finally be able to buy booster packs without having to stake out restock days?</p>

 <h2><em>Bioshock 4</em> and the <em>Bioshock </em>movie are in a staring contest to see who can take the longest to come out</h2> <p>Director Francis Lawrence is attached to the cinematic adaptation of <em>Bioshock</em>, but work on other projects has kept him from getting to it. “We would have gotten it made a few years back, but then other movies got in the way, with one being <em>The Long Walk</em> and the other being the <em>Hunger Games</em> prequel, which comes out this December,” producer Roy Lee <a href="https://collider.com/bioshock-movie-production-update-netflix-roy-lee-francis-lawrence/">told <em>Collider</em></a>. “We’re just waiting for him to finish post-production, because he’s going to be working on it through at least September, and then jump back into it. I know that Netflix and Take-Two are very anxious to see the movie come out because they want to have the release coincide with some of the potential new incarnations of the game.”</p> <h2><em>Nioh 3</em> is great and it’s selling very well</h2> <p>The latest sequel is already the fastest-selling entry in the masocore action-RPG series, hitting over 1 million copies sold in its first month. The franchise as a whole is now at 10 million, Koei Tecmo <a href="https://teamninja-studio.com/nioh3/us/news/20260220.html">announced this week</a>.</p>

 <h2>The biggest fighting game tournament is now fully owned by Saudi Arabia</h2> <p>NODWIN Gaming <a href="https://evo.gg/news/2026-business-update">has exited its co-ownership stake in Evo,</a> leaving&nbsp;<span lang="EN">Qiddiya</span> City-owned RTS, which is ultimately a subsidiary controlled by Saudi Arabia, in full control.

            <title><![CDATA[Night In The Woods Publisher Confronts TikTok Over Racist AI Ads]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/finji-tiktok-racist-genai-ads-usual-june-report-support-2000672007</link>
            <guid>1441975</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Finji, the company responsible for publishing games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/night-in-the-woods-the-kotaku-review-1792726026"><i><span>Night in the Woods</span></i></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/tunic-xbox-game-pass-zelda-dark-souls-fez-indie-impress-1848668747"><i><span>Tunic</span></i></a><span>, and the upcoming </span><i><span>Usual June</span></i><span>, has been locked in a bizarre battle against TikTok, which the company says has been creating and posting AI-generated ads using its characters without its permission.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tunic-night-in-the-woods-publisher-says-tiktok-is-creating-and-running-racist-genai-ads-for-its-games-without-permission"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span> has an extensive report on the situation, which started gaining attention earlier this month when Finji CEO and co-founder Rebekah Saltsman posted on </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bexsaltsman.bsky.social/post/3me4ybayhf226"><span>Bluesky</span></a><span> asking anyone who saw Finji ads on social media that that were “UN-Finji-like” to reach out with screenshots of the offending ads. As </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>’s story lays out, Finji had been using TikTok to promote its games, including the upcoming paranormal adventure game </span><i><span>Usual June</span></i><span>, and had turned off all the app’s supposedly optional genAI permissions.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>However, after a flood of social media comments from concerned viewers, the company was clued into what appear to be AI-generated ads on TikTok that look as if they came directly from Finji. According to </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span> which viewed screenshots of the ads in question, one included an altered image of June, the protagonist of </span><i><span>Usual June</span></i><span>, “with a bikini bottom, impossibly large hips and thighs, and boots that rise up over her knees,” which is a far cry from the character’s actual appearance and, given that she is a Black woman, plays into racist stereotypes. Finji says it had no option to view or edit these AI ads.</span></p> <p><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>’s story documents the back and forth between Finji and TikTok, but the gist of what happened here is that the short form video app’s customer support has given the company the runaround, at one point even claiming it saw no indication of AI-generated assets in the offending ads and asserting that Finji must have uploaded the image of June itself.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>After Finji escalated the issue, TikTok backed down and said that it was no longer disputing the publisher’s claim that it was making unauthorized alterations to Finji’s ads with the use of AI. Instead, TikTok said the company’s campaign had included an ad that used a “catalog ads format designed to demonstrate the performance benefits of combining carousel and video assets in Sales campaigns,” for which an opt-out was not guaranteed. The response in no way addressed Finji’s larger concerns about the racist and sexualized changes made to the company’s imagery. When Finji pushed to escalate the issue, TikTok said it would “re-escalate the issue internally,” but Finji has not heard back from the company since. TikTok declined to comment on the record when </span><i><span>IGN </span></i><span>reached out.</span></p>

 <p><span>“This is just simply embarrassing but not for me as an individual,” Saltsman told </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span>. “For me—I am just super pissed off. This is my work, my team’s work and mine and my company’s reputation—which I have spent over a decade building. My expectation was a proper apology, systemic changes in how they use this technology for paying clients and a hard look at why their technology is so obviously racist and sexist. I am obviously not holding my breath for any of the above.”</span></p> <p><span>What a shitshow. But given that genAI evangelists are </span><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/ai/microsoft-ceo-warns-that-we-must-do-something-useful-with-ai-or-theyll-lose-social-permission-to-burn-electricity-on-it/"><span>scrambling to invent an actual use case for the technology</span></a><span> to stop the slop accusations, it’s not too surprising that companies are shoving it into places without permission. It’s not like any company worth a damn is going to use this tech to “enhance” its ads when they’d rather those ads reflect what they’re actually selling.</span></p>
