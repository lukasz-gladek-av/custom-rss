              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a> <span>has always been a chaotic, competitive game of sensory overload. Developer NetEase is deciding to lean further into that by giving the hero shooter a mode that triples the number of players on screen at once. Happy first anniversary, heroes.</span></p> <p><span>The 18v18 Annihilation mode is exactly what it sounds like. The 36-player mode pits two teams that are three times the size of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-dog-healer-twitch-streamer-2000647271"><span>your usual </span><i><span>Rivals </span></i><span>stack</span></a><span> against one another and crosses its fingers that your PC and console can handle it. I’m thinking of all the technically demanding attacks and effects in this game, and wondering what happens if you have 36 players using them at the same time. Will your PS5 crash if 36 Doctor Strange players open portals up on one map? We’ll find out tomorrow when the mode goes live.</span></p>

  <p><span>Funnily enough, you could have an 18v18 match made up entirely of different heroes with the game’s expansive roster, though the trailer shows some match-ups of multiple of the same character, like a fight of mostly players waddling around as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-ultimate-ability-1851716962"><span>Jeff the Land Shark</span></a><span>. With this many heroes on the field at once, any characters with big, game-changing area-of-effect moves are going to thrive, I will say, seeing Star-Lord auto-aiming with his ultimate as a crowd of helpless enemies’ health bars ticked down did scratch an itch in my brain.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Will this be what gets me back into </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>? Probably not. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-overwatch-2-vendetta-magik-rip-off-react-2000646220"><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>and I worked out our differences</span></a><span>, and I’ve got a battle pass to complete. I doubt this mode is going to become the go-to competitive play style for </span><i><span>Rivals </span></i><span>players, but it will probably give them something fun to do for a few weeks before everyone inevitably goes back to playing the standard 6v6 format. I look forward to seeing the crazy clips of shenanigans players pull off.</span></p> <p><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>just entered its fifth season, which added Gambit to the roster. Rogue will join the fray during the mid-season update next month.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Longtime English studio <a href="https://kotaku.com/transformers-reactivate-canceled-splash-damage-layoffs-1851735308">Splash Damage</a> is facing an uncertain future as it begins a consultation process that will affect all staff and likely lead to layoffs.</p> <p>On November 26, Splash Damage publicly announced online that the studio was entering a “studio-wide consultation process” that would involve all employees across all roles and disciplines. This follows the London-based studio being acquired in September by a private equity investor after being sold by its previous owner, Chinese conglomerate Tencent.</p> <p>“This was a difficult step for us to take,” said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/splash-damage_an-update-from-splash-damage-activity-7399486098588196864-pz0I/">Splash Damage via a message shared on LinkedIn</a>. “But we believe it is necessary so Splash Damage can remain agile and adaptable in what has been a very challenging market. We know this kind of change is emotionally tough, and we will do what we can to guide our people through this process with honesty and care. We’re committed to exploring every option to retain talent and making sure those affected have meaningful support throughout.”</p>

 <p>Splash Damage already suffered layoffs earlier this year after the <a href="https://kotaku.com/transformers-reactivate-leak-footage-gameplay-canceled-1851736122"><em>Transformers</em> game it was working on was canceled</a>. The last game the studio shipped was 2020’s <em>Outcasters</em> for Google’s now-defunct Stadia game streaming service. Before that, the studio, which was formed in 2001, had developed various popular multiplayer games, including <em>Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory, Brink,</em> and helped Xbox as a support studio on <em>Halo </em>and <em>Gears of War</em> titles. It also developed <em>Gears of War Tactics.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>It is the latest round of bad news for the video game industry as developers <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/layoffs">continue to be laid off and studios closed as publishers tighten their belts</a> and begin<a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-ai-fps-temmates-genai-nfts-gameplay-snowdrop-reveal-2000646251"> investing more into AI generation tools</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dark Souls + Morrowind + The Doom Engine = One Of 2025’s Coolest Shooters]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-morrowind-doom-engine-mohtra-review-pc-steam-fps-boomer-shooter-2000647667</link>
            <guid>1365829</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In first-person shooters, <a href="https://kotaku.com/wrath-is-a-retro-shooter-done-right-1841067258">especially older games or retro-inspired boomer shooters</a>, the first gun you get tells you a lot about the game. And in <em>Mohrta</em>, your first weapon is a powerful, accurate, hard-hitting revolver that makes the<a href="https://youtu.be/jRrommJ5V9w"> famous M1-Garand “ping” noise</a> every time you reload it. This is just one of the many reasons why I adore <em>Mohrta,</em> which is out now on Steam.</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881610/Mohrta/"><em>Mohrta</em>, which launched last month</a>, is a non-linear first-person shooter built in GZDoom that has big <em>Morrowind</em> and <em>Dark Souls</em> vibes. And yes, I know mentioning<em> Dark Souls</em> in a blog or article about video games risks mockery,&nbsp; but the way this game’s save shrines work and the pacing of each of the worlds you visit, plus its challenging boss fights, create <em>very </em>similar vibes to a FromSoftware RPG. Except you have a shotgun. <a href="https://youtu.be/e_HT14h35eg">Wait, actually, FromSoftware did that, actually</a>. Huh…anyway, I mentioned <em>Morrowind</em> because <em>Mohtra’s</em> strange dark fantasy universe has similar aesthetics to Bethesda’s popular RPG, too. But again, with more guns.</p>

  <p>In <em>Mohrtra</em>, you play as an undead knight-like machine-man who is determined to clean up all the nasty, strange creatures and oddities infesting the land while tracking down someone important. To save the lands and find this person, you’ll need to explore various worlds that ramp up in difficulty, but which can be completed in any order you desire. You start with a powerful sword and badass revolver and grow your arsenal with a shotgun, a bizarre grenade launcher, an SMG that fires bones, and some other really odd weapons I won’t spoil here. All of the weapons feel great, and because the game is built in GZDoom, <a href="https://kotaku.com/doom-gzdoom-source-port-graf-zahl-ai-chatgpt-2000636055">a modern source port of id’s classic ’90s FPS</a>, gameplay feels snappy, fast, and punchy.</p>

 <p>You also have a small talking doll that can heal you and a vulture on your shoulder that provides light when exploring dark caverns or ruins. <em>Mohtra</em> is weird if you haven’t got that yet. But I love it. Returning from levels to the large market hub world is always a treat. The strange denizens of this world are always willing to chat and trade with you, letting you upgrade your gear and guns, making future missions in new worlds easier.</p>

 <p>All of this is drenched in gorgeous retro-inspired textures and effects. Forests are foggy and gloomy. Lava-filled caves are dark and foreboding. Ancient ruins look deserted and lonely. Immaculate vibes going in this one. <a href="https://kotaku.com/selaco-gzdoom-engine-fps-steam-review-early-access-1851513067">Who needs 4K raytracing when you got the <em>Doom</em> engine?</a></p> <p>If you are craving a five-to-seven-hour oddball boomer shooter that isn’t just about running through corridors and killing soldiers or zombies,<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2881610/Mohrta/"> I’d hop over to Steam and check out <em>Mohtra</em></a>, one of the best FPS games released this year. And tell me how you think <em>Mohtra</em> is pronounced.&nbsp; I’ve been saying “mow-CH-ru.” But I heard someone say “MAHT-ra.” I don’t know, I’m too busy shooting creepy skeleton men with my bone gun to worry about that kind of stuff.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ecoflow-decided-profit-doesnt-matter-1800w-power-station-hits-new-all-time-low-for-winter-backup-2000647635</link>
            <guid>1365715</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Winter power outages strike more frequently than most people realize with ice storms, heavy snow and equipment failures leaving homes without electricity for hours or days at critical moments. Having backup power transforms these emergencies from stressful crises into manageable inconveniences by keeping essential appliances running.</p>
<p>EcoFlow specializes in portable power stations that bridge the gap between small battery banks and expensive whole-home generators and delivers practical backup capacity without professional installation. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5693/">At $349, down from $699, the Delta 2 has hit a record-low price</a> on Amazon for Black Friday while <strong>being EcoFlow’s bestselling model across several years</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5693/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The 1800W Output Powers Real Appliances</h2>
<p>The<strong> constant 1800W AC power with an accompanying surge power of 2700W</strong> enables the operation of genuine household electronics such as full-sized refrigerators, microwave ovens, space heaters, and medical electronics, beyond the capability of smaller power stations. The power offered here almost competes with the power offered by conventional gas-generators whose use has long been hamstrung by the need for gas tanks, the resultant air pollution, and the lack of quiet operation.</p>



<p>In the event of power outage during the cold seasons, the Delta 2 can power a furnace blower motor, light a refrigerator in order to save the food, and recharge mobile and laptop collections all at the same time. The <strong>use of all the available 15 outlets, ranging from the AC, USB-A, USB-C, and DC ports</strong>&nbsp;enables the operation of all the needed electronics.</p>



<p>The <strong>Delta 2 takes only 50 minutes to charge from empty to 80%</strong> and this has changed the way you now prepare in advance when there are forecasts of storms and unexpected power outages. Conventional portable power stations need 6-8 hours to fully recharge, and this means you could be left in the dark when there are forecasts of storm power outages and when the brief periods offered when the power may be restored are not sufficient for recharging.</p>
<p>The lithium-ion battery chemistry, LiFePO4, has an extraordinary lifespan<strong>, boasting 3000+ charge cycles and retention levels over 80% capacity</strong>, estimated at about 10 years. Another advantage the LiFePO4 battery chemistry boasts over other lithium-ion batteries is increased safety. The battery management system constantly monitors voltage, current, and temperatures in all the cells and <strong>protects against overcharge, over-discharge, overcurrent, and short-circuit conditions.</strong></p>
<p>While the EcoFlow Delta 2 normally costs $349, you can get this power solution with 1800W, 50-minute fast charging and long-lasting LiFePO4 battery technology at an unbelievable price this Black Friday.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Roborock Q7 M5+ Falls 40% Off, Self-Empty for 7 Weeks While You Forget It Even Exists]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/roborock-q7-m5-falls-40-off-self-empty-for-7-weeks-while-you-forget-it-even-exists-2000647624</link>
            <guid>1365712</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Roborock has a spot in the robot vacuum space much like <em>Dyson</em> in the conventional vacuum space, in terms of innovative technology and advancements beyond others’ capability and reach. The latest models now come with high price tags ranging from $1,000 to $2,000 and reflects their innovative and advanced technology but this goes beyond the means of average family budgets. Now available<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/"> on Amazon at an all-time lowest price cut from $359 to $219, the Roborock Q7 M5+</a> provides all the functionality you need in a vacuum and mop, and the technology provided by the innovative company, Roborock, in their self-emptying dock.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5418/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>10,000 Pa Suction That Tackles Real Messes</h2>
<p>The<strong> HyperForce suction power measures 10,000 Pascals</strong> which makes it comparable with high-end models of full-size upright vacuums that cost much more. The suction power dislodges deeply embedded fur from carpet fibers, extracts dirt from tile grout, and extracts fine particles from hardwood flooring in a single cleaning pass. The suction power, too, performs another critical role on carpet surfaces, where competing robotic models make several passes before obtaining adequate cleaning, rather than mere surface cleaning, and still leave traces of dirt in the room even after the supposed cleaning process. Pet owners experience a noticeable reduction in the amount of fur on the floor and furniture when compared to vacuuming manually.</p>
<p>The ability to <strong>self-empty in seven weeks using the 2.7-liter</strong> closed dust bag gets rid of the need to manually empty the bin, like in basic models, making the product seem like a set-and-forget appliance compared to other models. The <em>RockDock Plus</em> has the ability to empty the bin at the end of each clean, compacting the trash into the large bag, needing a change after every two months. The long lifespan between changes means the product goes from needing changes weekly to a full set-and-forget appliance.</p>
<p>The <strong>all-in-one vacuum and mop operation</strong> takes care of the entire process related to floor cleaning: The operation includes an integrated water tank and cleaning cloth that proceeds automatically after the vacuum cleaning process. The process first involves the removal of dirt on the floor using the vacuum, and the components are designed to clean sticky spillages, liquid residue, and dirt resulting from drying in addition to eliminating all dirt on the floor using the vacuum.</p>
<p>There are three settings when using water flow and they include lower settings when using hardwood and higher settings when using tile and/or vinyl. Kitchen floors would particularly work well with the all-in-one cleaning process, where the process eliminates crumbs and spillages on the floor. The Dual Anti-Tangle system provides a remedy to the problem that has plagued users of competing robots, in that the hair tends to tangle on the brush and has, in the past, needed manual cutting and untangling on a rather frequent basis.</p>
<p>PreciSense LiDAR navigation <strong>charts your home with the precision of a laser</strong>, and ensures efficient cleaning routes rather than the bump-and-go approach offered through camera and even gyroscope technology. The LiDAR technology provides accurate range detection, allowing the Roomba to clean room by room, ensuring that all areas are hit thoroughly throughout the floor space. <strong>Multi-floor mapping</strong> enables the Roomba to remember the space on different floors, allowing it to switch maps when the Roomba is transferred from one floor to the other.</p>
<p>With a $219 price, the Roborock Q7 M5+ comes with 10,000 Pa suction power, the ability to empty on its own for up to seven weeks, the functionality to clean and wet-mop, and anti-tangle technology and LiDAR navigation all at 39% off the retail price during the Black Friday sales.</p>
