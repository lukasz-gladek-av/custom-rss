But a lot of work is still needed, something the studio acknowledged in a community update announcing the delayed <em>Hitman</em> mission and future patches. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1m8ykoy/july_update_from_the_studio/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1m8ykoy/july_update_from_the_studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On July 25</a></span>, an official representative of Build A Rocket Boy posted an update on Reddit about <em>MindsEye’s </em>future. The bad news is that a planned crossover mission featuring Agent 47, which was teased before <em>MindsEye</em>’s launch, has now been delayed. </p><p>“We apologise that the release of the <em>Hitman </em>x<em> MindsEye</em> Mission, originally scheduled for July, has been postponed to a later date,” said the Build A Rocket Boy spokesperson. “We look forward to delivering this exciting crossover when the time is right and will provide further updates as soon as we’re able.”</p><p>The whole reason Agent 47 was going to show up in <em>MindsEye </em>is that the game was published by <em>Hitman </em>studio IO Interactive, so it was a bit of brand synergy. But now, it seems the team behind <em>MindsEye </em>is more focused on getting the game fixed up and improved before adding any new content. </p><p>Build A Rocket Boy laid out two updates, one coming in August and one arriving in September, that will bring “additional performance improvements, bug fixes,” and community-requested features. This includes the option to skip cutscenes, as well as user-published missions being “instantly accessible” on PC. </p><p>The studio did warn that moving forward, future updates might be less frequent, but the plan is to make them bigger and more substantial and to include more fixes. While this plan makes sense and it’s reasonable for the devs to focus on improving the game instead of adding a fun crossover mission, I can’t imagine anyone involved with <em>MindsEye </em>was hoping to be in this terrible situation post-launch. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mindseye-worst-game-2025-update-hitman-crossover-delay-1851787011]]></content:encoded>

Days later, VShojo announced it was shutting down. </p><p>It was one particular part of CEO Justin “Gunrun” Ignacio’s apology that’s been galling fans the most, however. “I acknowledge that some of the money spent by the company was raised in connection with talent activity, which I later learned was intended for a charitable initiative,” he wrote in a statement posted on X. No long after, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/i/birdwatch/n/1948540194770084045&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/i/birdwatch/n/1948540194770084045" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a community note</a></span> proving that wasn’t true was attached to the post, which continues to go viral on the platform. </p><p>“Justin claims to not know the purpose of the funds, but he personally congratulated Ironmouse on the completion of her charity fundraising event and reposted Ludwig directly mentioning that half the funds would go to charity,” it reads. There were links to the past tweets in question, which include Ignacio writing, “YOU DID IT MOUSE!!” A tweet from VShojo’s Japanese X account <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MyrdinTV/status/1948452975451820315&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MyrdinTV/status/1948452975451820315" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">also acknowledged the fundraiser</a></span>. <br></p><p>Another Vtuber, Veibae, who left VShojo back in 2023, responded to Ignacio’s claims by mentioning her own past problems with the company. “I only found out I didn’t get paid for any of my sponsors after I had already signed the NDA,” she <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Veibae/status/1948509619543822703&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Veibae/status/1948509619543822703" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted on X yesterday</a></span>. “After 2 years, I have still not been paid back fully. To add insult to injury, they also demanded I had to pay them back 10k for some of the anniversary assets which when they sent me back months later, were half finished.” She also accused VShojo of allegedly trying to lowball revenue splits and sabotage her departure with rumors seeded on 4chan. </p><p>According to Ignacio, the agency “prioritized creators and community over short-term profits,” but not many Vtubers seem to feel that’s true. Ironmouse has yet to respond to the claims directly. “My brain is running on empty at the moment,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/ironmouse/status/1948794001253171664&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/ironmouse/status/1948794001253171664" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">she wrote on Friday</a></span>.

Public visibility brings more scrutiny, and you can’t find an actor in Hollywood more visible than Pascal these days. That means not only is the actor getting a lot of work and exposure, but also that the internet has gotten really weird about him in a very short amount of time.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Overexposure is usually enough to make the general public turn against anyone.

Pascal has been a successful actor for a while, but he’s definitely become a staple of franchise entertainment in recent years. He was in <em>Game of Thrones</em>, is in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-mandalorian-season-3-baby-yoda-games-books-tv-1840299667&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-mandalorian-season-3-baby-yoda-games-books-tv-1840299667"><em>Star Wars </em>show</a></span><em>, </em>and is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-mandalorian-grogu-baby-yoda-new-movie-2024-1851152136&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-mandalorian-grogu-baby-yoda-new-movie-2024-1851152136">getting his own movie next year</a></span>. Add on his role in <em>The Last of Us </em>and now the MCU, and Pascal is everywhere toxic fandoms exist. But also, right now you can go to a movie theater and see him in three different films: <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>, <em>Eddington</em>, and <em>Materialists</em>. Oh, right, he was just in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gladiator-2-paul-mescal-pedro-pascal-trailer-date-1851570038&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gladiator-2-paul-mescal-pedro-pascal-trailer-date-1851570038"><em>Gladiator II</em></a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/robot-movies-kids-children-ranked-walle-the-wild-robot-1851658849&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/robot-movies-kids-children-ranked-walle-the-wild-robot-1851658849"><em>The Wild Robot</em></a></span>, too. The man’s getting his bag, but you can be a good actor starring in quality stuff and still get backlash for people never hearing the end of you. It’s an “I can’t miss you if you won’t leave” sort of deal.</p><p>Unlike some celebrities who get this brand of weird fatigue-based backlash, Pascal has the distinction of being pretty likable, and has gone viral plenty of times for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU7-KMGZ4bc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oU7-KMGZ4bc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being personable and funny in interviews</a></span>. So if he’s not on your TV screen, he’s probably on your glowing slab giving a sound bite. But those interviews and public appearances are now precisely the place where the actor is getting the most backlash. Pascal is currently promoting <em>Fantastic Four </em>alongside his co-star Vanessa Kirby, who plays his character’s wife. The two have been notably touchy-feely on the road, and this has led to many presumptuous accusations about the two’s relationship and Pascal’s treatment of his female co-stars. This all goes back to a viral clip from San Diego Comic-Con in 2024, in which the two held hands on stage while promoting the film. Kirby herself has gone on the record in an interview with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/pedro-pascal-cover-story?&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/pedro-pascal-cover-story?" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Vanity Fair</em></a></span> saying that both the actors were nervous to be on stage talking about the film, and that it was a grounding moment for both of them.</p><p>“What happened is we were both incredibly nervous going out in front of thousands of people who love this comic,” Kirby told <em>Vanity Fair</em>. “He wanted me to know that we were in this together, and I found it a lovely gesture and was very glad to squeeze his hand back.”</p><p>But that’s not the only footage of Pascal and Kirby getting close, and now a subset of the internet is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/JohnEkdahl/status/1948159649527513282&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/JohnEkdahl/status/1948159649527513282" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turning on him</a></span>, accusing him of inappropriate behavior in these interactions despite it being very obvious that Kirby <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/sakotrak/status/1947672425275314287&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/sakotrak/status/1947672425275314287" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is initiating plenty of the contact</a></span>, the existence of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pedro-pascal-oscar-isaac-cuddle-new-photo-response-online_n_67cf2cbde4b04dd3a4e5a2bd&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/pedro-pascal-oscar-isaac-cuddle-new-photo-response-online_n_67cf2cbde4b04dd3a4e5a2bd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">footage of him also being touchy with male co-stars</a></span>, and explanations about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a65488380/pedro-pascal-anxiety/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a65488380/pedro-pascal-anxiety/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the actor’s struggles with anxiety</a></span> as a contributing factor for his asking for person-to-person contact.</p><p>One important piece of context is that Pascal has become especially vocal in his support for trans people in a time when the grifters of the culture war will wield anything they can to try and take down people they perceive as enemies. The actor attended the <em>Thunderbolts* </em>premiere <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/style/pedro-pascals-trans-women-tee-intl-scli&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/style/pedro-pascals-trans-women-tee-intl-scli" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wearing a shirt in support of the transgender community</a></span>, has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2025/06/30/the-feud-between-jk-rowling-and-pedro-pascal-explained/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2025/06/30/the-feud-between-jk-rowling-and-pedro-pascal-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called out <em>Harry Potter </em>author J.K. Rowling</a></span> for her anti-trans efforts, and been a vocal supporter of his trans sister, actor and activist Lux Pascal. Yes, Pascal is having a moment, and some people online are probably tired of seeing him in big movies, but there’s an unmistakable bigoted corner of the internet that is looking to tear down someone they see as a powerful, influential enemy in a smear campaign. </p><p>Ultimately, whatever genuine concerns people may have about Pascal’s behavior are rooted in a parasocial assumption that we’re all experts in reading people we’ve never met. The internet treats real celebrities like they’re characters whose goals and motivations are all up for interpretation. Every viral video or tweet is treated like a lore drop to be dissected for your favorite or most-hated character in the multimedia franchise of life. Innocent until proven guilty only applies to the public figures you like, I suppose? Unless someone actually comes forward, this entire controversy feels manufactured, but reality has never stopped nonsense from persisting.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby-anxiety-touch-controversy-1851787007]]></content:encoded>
