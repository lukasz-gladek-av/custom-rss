Our plan is to offer you something distinct and special.”</p><p>The premium collaboration comes at a premium price, however. Buying everything in the set costs 1,975 Super Credits, an in-game currency players can slowly earn while playing or pay roughly $20 per 2,100 for. That makes the <em>Killzone</em> set the most expensive gear you can currently purchase in the <em>Starship Troopers</em>-inspired alien shooter, a game regularly priced at $40 with battle passes called Warbonds that include many more unlockables for just $10 each. </p><figure id="" data-id="eba5b8802d4b9a464ab45e29884a1965" data-recommend-id="image://eba5b8802d4b9a464ab45e29884a1965" data-format="png" data-width="1894" data-height="1062" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu shows new items for purchase in Helldivers 2.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After several years of skin-flation across popular live-service games like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, and <em>Overwatch 2</em>, $15-$20 has become the new norm for crossover skins that bring in popular outside characters and styles. But unlike those games, <em>Helldivers 2</em> is not free-to-play and has already set a certain precedent for its in-game pricing system. Within that existing framework, the Helghast tributes look great but feel way overpriced. They’re also only in the shop for five days, meaning players can’t even take their time trying to grind for Super Credits across hundreds of missions. </p><p>“No set should costs over 1000sc,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgywpl/the_new_superstore_update_is_bad/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgywpl/the_new_superstore_update_is_bad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reads one thread</a></span> currently shooting up to the top of the<em> Helldivers 2</em> subreddit. “Even if we forget the armor set, a new AR?? They seriously add a new gun and lock it behind a 600sc paywall!?” Another player responded that the<em> Killzone</em> set should have been its own Warbond instead, with more content and a lower price point at the cost of having to unlock each piece individually. </p><p>Others have pointed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgyj28/new_gear_just_dropped/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hgyj28/new_gear_just_dropped/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to a slippery slope</a></span> where red lines for <em>Helldivers 2</em>'s in-game shop have gradually been crossed. At first it was only cosmetic armor, later stratagems, the cool arsenal of war machinery that fuels the gameplay, were added to a paid Warbond, and recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hekecs/dont_sell_weapons_in_the_shop/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1hekecs/dont_sell_weapons_in_the_shop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">weapons have made it into the shop’s FOMO rotation</a></span>. Players who have purchased every Warbond since the game launched without using free credits would have spent $90 by this point.</p><p>Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Shams Jorjani took to the game’s Discord to try and diffuse the situation. “Hey - quick comment on the Helghast stuff,” he wrote on Wednesday. “Firstly - this is our first collaboration so we’ll be figuring it out as we go along. Let us know what you’d like to see in the future. Secondly it’s optional - the more of this we sell - the more illuminate type stuff we can keep dropping for free.”</p><p>The suggestion that players need to swallow higher prices in order to keep getting free updates didn’t go over to well. “You cannot be serious,” wrote one player in response. “These prices are fucking egregious. Your game is NOT FREE. We have already paid, you don’t get to hide behind a 20 dollar skin as if that makes the difference.” Jorjani simply wrote back, “noted!”</p><p>One of the biggest games of 2024, <em>Helldivers 2</em> has previously butted heads with its community a couple of times this year. The first was over a controversial PSN login requirement on Steam that saw the game’s rating review-bombed to smithereens until it reversed course. The second was a series of patches nerfing some of players’ favorite gear and loadouts, including things they’d purchased from paid Warbonds, which eventually lead the studio <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-charger-framerate-1851622269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-charger-framerate-1851622269">to commit to an apology tour</a></span> of buffing things instead and focusing on addressing performance, stability, and other issues in the meantime. </p><p>That recent revival was capped off with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-illuminate-omens-tyranny-free-update-1851720355&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-illuminate-omens-tyranny-free-update-1851720355">the free Omens of Tyranny update this month</a></span>, that added the game’s third Illuminate faction and new urban warfare maps. It’s a great new chapter in the game’s ongoing Galactic War whose fanfare might be cut short by the bungled <em>Killzone </em>skin rollout, even if the studio was banking on those to help pay for it. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So it is that tomorrow’s teaser trailer for the upcoming James Gunn-led relaunch of the DC cinematic universe, <em>Superman</em>, has just received its own teaser trailer.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Given the premise—a piece of marketing material designed to have you intrigued to watch a forthcoming piece of marketing material that’s designed to have you intrigued to watch a film—the resulting diminishing returns are a collection of shots that tell us almost nothing whatsoever about the film it’s all intended to promote. We see reaction shots of people’s astonishment at seeing—presumably—a man who can fly, stop bullets, and leap tall buildings in a single bound. We also see less than a second of the super man himself.</p><p>Well shit, it worked, didn’t it? We posted it.</p><p>Let’s insist we’re doing it as a cultural observation of the sheer audacity of hype, of the fever pitch Warner Bros. and DC Studios are informing us we’ve reached, over finally seeing a tangible glimpse of this movie. They likely wanted that, too.</p><p>What strikes me as most interesting about what <em>is</em> shown here is how defiantly generic it is when it comes to Superman-based media. Forgetting the shots of crowds looking agog that makes up the bulk of the footage, we’ve got a glimpse of a generic Daily Planet office (including Rachel Brosnahan’s Lois Lane and Skyler Gisondo’s Jimmy Olsen), a split-picosecond moment of Superman flying through the ice inevitably surrounding his Fortress of Solitude, and a tiny dot of Superman disappearing up into the clouds. Each could be lifted from just about any adaptation of the character, from the early ‘90s <em>Lois &amp; Clark</em> to the grey slop of 2006’s <em>Superman Returns</em>—hell, we only know it’s not from 1948's <em>Superman </em>serial or 2013's <em>Man of Steel </em>because it’s in color.</p><figure id="" data-id="1765d9a09d7112c38b6b1b83e14e9dca" data-recommend-id="image://1765d9a09d7112c38b6b1b83e14e9dca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1237" data-height="661" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="One of the split-second glimpses of Superman, here flying through an icy ravine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="One of the split-second glimpses of Superman, here flying through an icy ravine." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rotten Tomatoes Trailers / DC Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1765d9a09d7112c38b6b1b83e14e9dca" data-recommend-id="image://1765d9a09d7112c38b6b1b83e14e9dca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1237" data-height="661" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="One of the split-second glimpses of Superman, here flying through an icy ravine." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, it’s also arguable that all of this is an act of boldness, a real statement from Gunn (although who knows how involved he is in the marketing), and that’s  backed up by two other factors: the title and the score.</p><p>Calling your movie <em>Superman</em>, with no subtitle, is a statement. There already was a <em>Superman</em>, in 1978, and Richard Donner’s version has never been improved upon in any of the six films across three relaunches since (let alone the character’s repeated flogging in Snyder’s DCU). It was originally to be called <em>Superman: Legacy</em>, and dropping the suffix is ballsy. Gunn invites direct comparison with the Christopher Reeve classic—a beautifully shot movie that holds up almost 50 years later.</p><p>Then there’s the theme. It’s right there, subtle at first, then—amid the obligatory bassy “thommmm”s that all superhero movie trailers must feature by law—out emerges a faint rendition of John Williams’ classic tune. Again, it’s an unflinching declaration that this film is operating at the same level and evoking the same tonal reverence as the classic that, arguably, both ushered in the era of the modern superhero film, and defined it.</p><p>Gunn’s a fun movie maker, and has had well-deserved success via funny, schlocky films like <em>Slither</em> and <em>Super</em>, followed by the cartoon-like jubilance and hilarity of the <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> trilogy and <em>The Suicide Squad</em>. I’m genuinely excited that he’s trying to make something un-terrible from DC properties, ending the era of Snyder’s well-intentioned but grimly dreary attempts, and he’s an obvious fit for the sillier, more subversive side of the comic franchise. But playing <em>Superman</em> this straight, this on-the-nose? I’m fascinated to see what comes of it. Even if I doubt tomorrow’s “teaser” will tell us anything useful.</p><p>My desperate hope is that this could be, finally, <em>finally</em>, the moment someone writes a <em>Superman </em>script that doesn’t depend on unSupermanning him in order to introduce any peril or plot. My “time to Kryptonite” stopwatch will be running, and god, I hope it never has to stop. It’s the great flaw of the great American hero, that the only way anyone can find for an invincible, all-powerful god-like to be interesting on film is to incessantly make him incapable and all-vulnerable, and rely on enemy hubris to save the day.</p><p>(Massive shout-out to CW’s recently finished <em>Superman &amp; Lois</em>, which despite featuring some hoary old cliches and a miserable over-reliance on all shades of Kryptonite, managed to make Clark Kent vulnerable in <em>far </em>more interesting ways, not least in its extraordinary third-season arc following Lois’s cancer story.)</p><p>So, are you hyped for the teaser trailer to hype the six months of trailer-trailers, to hype the movie, ahead of its July 11, 2025 release date? I really hope we’re not exhausted by its simple existence by then.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
