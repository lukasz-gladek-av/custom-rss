He further explained that he expects “every  [tech company] to remove content as soon as they possibly can after being made aware of it. That’s what the [Online Safety Act] requires, it is what I require as a secretary of state, and it is certainly how we expect platforms who operate and have the privilege of access to British society, and British economy, to do.”</p><p><em>No Mercy </em>is labeled as “Adults Only” and could only be bought using a credit card.

In the statement the studio confirmed it was removing<em> No Mercy </em>from Steam but nonetheless defended the game, stating that real incest is “disgusting” but that things like that, rape, and male domination are nonetheless popular “kinks” for many. </p><p>“I fully understand that for many people such things may be disgusting, but during sex, people should really do what they want, as long as they don’t harm anyone,” said Zerat Games.</p><p>“If after reading [our statement] you still believe that such a game should not have been created, then we sincerely apologize to you. At the same time, we would like you to be a bit more open to human fetishes that don’t harm anyone, even though they may seem disgusting to you. This is still just a game, and although many people are trying to make it into something more, it remains and will continue to be a game.”</p><p>As of 4:30 PM EST on Thursday, <em>No Mercy</em> is still available to purchase on Steam. Players who bought the game will be able to continue to download, install, and play <em>No Mercy</em> after it’s removed. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

No, he wasn’t paid to change his opinion (as far as we know), but he harped on the financial burden incurred when crafting elaborate VFX-heavy films like his <em>Avatar</em> series and Denis Villeneuve’s <em>Dune </em>movies<em>. </em>According to him, if we want to keep making such films, production costs have to come down, and AI might be the way to do that.</p><p>“If we want to continue to see the kinds of movies that I’ve always loved and that I like to make and that I will go to see—<em>Dune</em>, <em>Dune: Part Two</em>, or one of my films or big effects-heavy, CG-heavy films—we’ve got to figure out how to cut the cost of that in half.” </p><p>He made sure to clarify that in his view, AI shouldn’t replace humans’ jobs, but accelerate them. AI should be “doubling their speed to completion on a given shot, so your cadence is faster and your throughput cycle is faster, and artists get to move on and do other cool things and then other cool things.” It appears he views AI in movies as akin to the computer replacing the typewriter, rather than sentient killing machines replacing the human species.<br></p><p>As practical as that may be, it still sounds like it came from bizzarro world when you remember that Cameron gave an ominous warning about AI <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2023/07/terminator-director-james-cameron-on-rise-of-ai-1235441905/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2023/07/terminator-director-james-cameron-on-rise-of-ai-1235441905/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back in 2023</a></span> when he told CTV News, “I warned you guys in 1984, and you didn’t listen.” Finding AI so horrifying that he references his 1984 film <em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Terminator</em>, whose plot is set in motion by an AI that seeks to wipe out humanity, when warning about its dangers doesn’t sound like a stance one can just pivot from in less than two years. <br></p><p>Still, he’s spent time since then studying the workings of AI, which may have contributed to the shift in his views. On the <em>Boz to the Future</em> podcast he discussed taking time to learn the nuances of the AI space in order to find a way to leverage its redeemable aspects to push filmmaking further. “The goal was to understand the space, to understand what’s on the minds of the developers,” he explained. “What are they targeting? What’s their development cycle? How much resources you have to throw at it to create a new model that does a purpose-built thing, and my goal was to try to integrate it into a VFX workflow.”<br></p><p>To his credit, he never said AI should be writing movies, having said in 2023, “ “I just don’t personally believe that a disembodied mind that’s just regurgitating what other embodied minds have said—about the life that they’ve had, about love, about lying, about fear, about mortality—and just put it all together into a word salad and then regurgitate it...I don’t believe that have something that’s going to move an audience.” So he’s not fully on the AI bandwagon. But he did join the Stability AI <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/09/james-cameron-joins-stability-ai-board-of-directors-1236097835/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/09/james-cameron-joins-stability-ai-board-of-directors-1236097835/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Board of Directors</a></span> last September to help bring AI capabilities to future filmmakers. With Cameron on board, it could only be a matter of time before Hollywood begins finding ways to incorporate AI without killing us all.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
