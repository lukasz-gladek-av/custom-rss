It’s the name of the game. So, why not get paid along the way? Bounties are one of the most lucrative and entertaining options for making quick cash in the game. You’ll find a bounty board in most settlements, and each one offers a variety of extra work in the form of hunting and slaying creatures, monsters, and bands of…bandits.</p><p>If you’d rather not fight continuously, the game’s side quests offer some reprieve. They pull you into the story and world-building Obsidian Entertainment designed explicitly for lore-hungry players. Some quests prove meaningless, simple fetch quests and hunter-killer jobs. Others, however, truly impress with little nuances and twists.</p><h2 id="h4631"><a id=""></a><strong>Track down caches and chests</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="2d011eeea4a6cc31af69f10a93c46cd6" data-recommend-id="image://2d011eeea4a6cc31af69f10a93c46cd6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hidden, locked cache in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hidden, locked cache in Avowed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2d011eeea4a6cc31af69f10a93c46cd6" data-recommend-id="image://2d011eeea4a6cc31af69f10a93c46cd6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hidden, locked cache in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Do you hear that? As you explore the world of <em>Avowed</em>, you’ll incredibly frequently notice a mystical twinkling sound emanating from…somewhere. If you follow the noise, you’re rewarded with a cache or treasure chest. Now, some of these have locks preventing prying eyes and sticky fingers, but a lockpick will do wonders to loosen up the mechanism.</p><p>Once you’re inside the cache, chest, backpack—whatever it is you discover at the end of the magical twinkling sound—it’s yours to keep. Most often, it’s a handful of crafting reagents and upgrade materials. Occasionally, you’ll receive weapons or armor to sell; sometimes, there’s even gold!</p><h2 id="h4632"><a id=""></a><strong>Sell unwanted uniques, gems, and extra equipment</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="77e924352184edb00277effcfae74d14" data-recommend-id="image://77e924352184edb00277effcfae74d14" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pair of unique gloves in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A pair of unique gloves in Avowed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="77e924352184edb00277effcfae74d14" data-recommend-id="image://77e924352184edb00277effcfae74d14" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pair of unique gloves in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Throughout the course of your adventure, you’ll uncover or be rewarded with unwanted unique items.

The gold nameplate doesn’t mean anything if its unique buff doesn’t mesh well with your class or playstyle.</p><p>What then? Your best bet is to sell said unwanted unique to a merchant for a tidy sum of gold. It’s better and more lucrative than breaking down the item for spare parts. As for gems, what else will you use those hunks of rock for?

The movie is set to hit theaters on August 8. </p><p><em>Freakier Friday </em>is set many years after the first film, where Curtis and Lohan swapped bodies as mother and daughter and learned a lot about each other in the process. This time around, Lohan has a daughter and step daughter of her own and they swap bodies with the older duo who have been through this whole thing before. </p><p>Here’s the official synopsis from Disney: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The story picks up years after Tess (Curtis) and Anna (Lohan) endured an identity crisis. Anna now has a daughter of her own and a soon-to-be stepdaughter. As they navigate the myriad challenges that come when two families merge, Tess and Anna discover that lightning might indeed strike twice.</p></blockquote><p>I had to watch this new trailer twice to actually figure out who swapped with who, which seems like the one thing you’d want to make very obvious in your trailer about a movie where people swap bodies temporarily. </p><p>I do appreciate that <em>Freakier Friday </em>isn’t trying to be like, “Oh these two characters just moved on and assumed that all the body swappin’ was a dream or something.” No, they remember it and directly reference it multiple times during the trailer, which appears to be filled with all kinds of hijinks and shenanigans involving young girls in the bodies of older women and vice versa. For example, did you know that old people have wrinkly faces?!? Hilarious. </p><p><em>Freakier Friday</em> arrives August 8 in a theater near you. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So Sony was negging Rogen himself. </p><p>“I was like, ‘It’s based on me. That’s very insulting.’ But we accommodated them, ultimately,” said Rogen as he laughed. </p><p><em>Superbad </em>would end up being a huge box office hit when it landed in theaters in 2007. The movie cost around $20 million to produce, but earned $170 million at the box office. It also spawned some memes and jokes that nearly 20 years later are still floating around via t-shirts sold at mall kiosks and Hot Topics. And yes, <em>Superbad </em>is nearly 20 years old. Sorry. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The time savings over an entire playthrough still probably wouldn’t amount to even an entire frame.</p><p>If the APU rates keep going up, however, it could eventually amount to a more tangible difference, especially for tool-assisted speedrun bots that fans use to decipher optimal routes for beating old games and to see what’s possible within games when the limitations of a human player are removed.

No, you’re lying, of course you haven’t, which is the secret sauce that makes <em>Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii</em> such a unique, wild ride. The argument between whether ninjas or pirates were cooler is over when you can get you a game that basically does both. God, remember back in the day when the internet was full of fun arguments over who’d win between ninjas and pirates and not, “Is this AI video of the president sucking Elon Musk’s toes like he’s trying to drink from the right grail proper resistance praxis?” We used to be a society, I swear.</p><p>Anyway, point is, thanks to the good folks at Ryu Ga Gotoku, we don’t have to choose which of our wild, lawless fantasies to live out. Although, because it’s a <em>Like A Dragon</em> game, it does mean there’s all sorts of little quirks to account for that you probably wouldn’t think you’d have to deal with turning to a life of piracy. Thankfully, we’ve got you very much covered with a few starter tips to help you hoist the colors high.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3b1abfaf9d5593386c195fcc80a89e9f" data-recommend-id="image://3b1abfaf9d5593386c195fcc80a89e9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Combat in the game, with our character glowing purple." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Combat in the game, with our character glowing purple." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3b1abfaf9d5593386c195fcc80a89e9f" data-recommend-id="image://3b1abfaf9d5593386c195fcc80a89e9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Combat in the game, with our character glowing purple." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As per usual with <em>Yakuza/Like A Dragon </em>games, the opening minutes are quite generous when it comes to showing you the ropes of the combat, but even though <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>shows you how to do Majima’s air juggle combos, they don’t quite emphasize just how much of a boon it is to your entire moveset. For the first two chapters or so, use it because it’s cool. Later chapters, though—especially on those Devil King islands where there’s 100 dudes attempting to shove a cutlass up where dead men tell no tales—<strong>getting an enemy up in the air is the linchpin of your fights when it comes to creating some distance.</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="811be4fb0ffe7450bb73bf836cf8ed0f" data-recommend-id="image://811be4fb0ffe7450bb73bf836cf8ed0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Upgrade Ability screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Upgrade Ability screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="811be4fb0ffe7450bb73bf836cf8ed0f" data-recommend-id="image://811be4fb0ffe7450bb73bf836cf8ed0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Upgrade Ability screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Compared to a bunch of the other titles in the series,<em> Pirate Yakuza</em> is pretty generous early on when it comes to giving you enough money and Reputation to enhance yourself. Obviously, boosting Majima’s attacks and health are no-brainer purchases you’ll never regret, but the lure of the awesome-looking Heat attacks isn’t easy to ignore. We’re not saying don’t buy any of those, but firstly, many of the other enhancements are far more crucial (and cheaper) early on, and secondly, Heat actions are bound by highly specific situations here. A fair few are only really applicable when you’re raiding an enemy ship, in fact. If there’s a very specific combat situation/button press you find yourself in, go for it. But shop smart.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cf0b220b2a51c9447250f356bfedf124" data-recommend-id="image://cf0b220b2a51c9447250f356bfedf124" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Crew Formation screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Crew Formation screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cf0b220b2a51c9447250f356bfedf124" data-recommend-id="image://cf0b220b2a51c9447250f356bfedf124" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Crew Formation screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Once you get some shore leave in Honolulu, you’re basically going to be awash in recruits for your ship within about an hour. There’s no downside to letting everybody aboard, but when it comes to who you should squad up with, you’re gonna need to plan for the future.</p><p>Early on, Jason Rich and Masaru are gonna be permanent fixtures in your crew. You’ll get them the earliest, but their stats stay relatively strong through the entire game. More importantly, though, is that they’re the first characters who can be boosted up to level 40. The problem with a lot of the randos you find out in the world is that even the ones with high stats might cap off at level 20. Those are crewmates who you want in there for a good time, not a long time. Have a backup character you can evolve. If you can be patient, and grind a bit before continuing the main story (the Coliseum in Madlantis is perfect for this) <strong>I recommend having a crew of all lvl 40-capables before getting into the weeds of Chapter 3</strong>, where the difficulty spikes.

Most of it’s a direct copy-paste from<em> Infinite Wealth</em>, but in terms of sheer money-making potential, <strong>the bounties are the best and most reliable money maker in the game</strong>. You’ll see the pink handcuffs dotted around the map, but right off the bat, after you take down your first one and leave the bar, there’ll be a guy worth $16,000 right down the block. You’d think with that high a price tag, you’re about to face Malenia, Blade of Miquella, but in reality, the price tags tend to correspond with the amount of health they have rather than difficulty. Hell, there are bounties worth $4k that are more of a pain in the ass due to the sheer numbers of enemies. Point being, don’t be afraid to go on safari for these guys when you’re low on cash, and don’t be afraid to take on big fish.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c93bc972d3a6258148408f14ae9cdbda" data-recommend-id="image://c93bc972d3a6258148408f14ae9cdbda" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A mighty ship battle with a lot of fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A mighty ship battle with a lot of fire." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c93bc972d3a6258148408f14ae9cdbda" data-recommend-id="image://c93bc972d3a6258148408f14ae9cdbda" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A mighty ship battle with a lot of fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Of course, it wouldn’t be a proper pirate game without some great ship-to-ship combat on the high seas, and sure, you could just position your flank and fire away like a loser, but this is <em>Like A Dragon</em>, things can get so much wilder than that. For starters, yes, anyone who played <em>Assassin’s Creed Black Flag</em> will have no problem picking up on the fact that you can ram straight into other ships for massive damage, only here they’re actually boosted by fuel tanks that can t-bone other boats to pieces in a heartbeat.</p><p>The real fun begins when you start messing with weapon loadouts, where the typical pirate ship cannons can get upgraded, and in terms of bang for buck, <strong>the flamethrowers are ridiculously overpowered in the early chapters</strong>, able to melt down most enemy ships in seconds.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fa483da7085491d97a72ceebebb51ee2" data-recommend-id="image://fa483da7085491d97a72ceebebb51ee2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A map screen from the game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A map screen from the game." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa483da7085491d97a72ceebebb51ee2" data-recommend-id="image://fa483da7085491d97a72ceebebb51ee2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A map screen from the game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>About halfway through the game, you’re introduced to one of the other major threats roaming the waters around Hawaii: The Devil Kings. Once you beat their initial quest, all of their hideouts open up to be raided. It’s gonna be tempting, especially after the first too-easy ones to just take whatever’s available, and sweet baby Jesus you need to slow your roll, because the difference in difficulty from the early hideouts vs the four-skull ones is vast, without leveling up way above normal. If you’re gonna pump some time into that quest line, do yourself a favor and tackle them in order of difficulty, and don’t get too ambitious.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fb6bc49bf51e53526a004dc3f8d68da0" data-recommend-id="image://fb6bc49bf51e53526a004dc3f8d68da0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1637" data-height="921" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aiming a rocket launcher at another boat on the sea." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aiming a rocket launcher at another boat on the sea." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fb6bc49bf51e53526a004dc3f8d68da0" data-recommend-id="image://fb6bc49bf51e53526a004dc3f8d68da0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1637" data-height="921" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aiming a rocket launcher at another boat on the sea." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s never really emphasized after the brief bit of tutorial in which it’s introduced, but <strong>the rocket launcher is one of the most underrated pieces of gear in your arsenal</strong>. Yes, it requires Majima leaving the captain’s wheel to fire, but given just how much range it has, using the rockets as a bespoke sniper rifle has more utility than you think, especially later on when you start seeing ships with depth charges, and distance is much more at a premium. By that point, as well, you should have Majima’s grappling hook, which gives you a grapple point on your ship up to the crow’s nest, where you can get an even better view.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="90f4470712c33e22defb091729fbbcf7" data-recommend-id="image://90f4470712c33e22defb091729fbbcf7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The whole gang gathered together on board the pirate ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The whole gang gathered together on board the pirate ship." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="90f4470712c33e22defb091729fbbcf7" data-recommend-id="image://90f4470712c33e22defb091729fbbcf7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The whole gang gathered together on board the pirate ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The critical path of <em>Pirate Yakuza</em> will endear you plenty to your main ride-or-die characters like Jason, Noah, and Masaru, but as mentioned before, these are also the characters you’re gonna carry with you the entire game. As such, giving them priority attention above everyone else pays dividends like crazy. That’s not just because they have the best-written storylines, but they start out with such high stats that prioritizing them early generally means you can stick them in one position right from jump, and they’ll evolve faster the rest. For most of them, it means keeping them happy and fed while on the ship, and bringing them on raids. For Noah, that means taking in the optional conversations dotted around Honolulu early and often. For Noah’s tiger cat, Goro, though, that means visiting Nele Island just as early and often with the fancy pet food.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
