We see less than two minutes of the upcoming vehicular carnage, but we learn a bit more about what to expect from the new season and how closely it may connect to the video game franchise.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197580" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="GameStop Doubles Down On Crypto With Massive Bitcoin Purchase As Stores Close" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="88" data-playlist="197580,197576,197567" data-current="197580"><div><p>GameStop Doubles Down On Crypto With Massive Bitcoin Purchase As Stores Close</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197580/197580_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Even in the short clip, we get some (literal) blasts from <em>Twisted Metal</em> past. Roach Coach’s exterminator van from <em>Twisted Metal 4</em> is seen firing bullets from under a giant roach atop its roof. After last season’s finale showed a tournament photo of Mr. Grimm, one of the longest-running characters in <em>Twisted Metal</em> history, we finally get to see the soul-stealing biker in action, weaving around missiles being launched at him by a sadistically euphoric Sweet Tooth (brought to life with the physicality of Joe Seanoa, aka Samoa Joe, and the voice of Will Arnett). But, for me, none of those appearances elicit more nostalgia than seeing just quick glimpses of the half-man, half-murder vehicle, Axel, appearing in War Wheel form. There are no close-ups of the fan-favorite killing machine, but we do see him navigating those gigantic wheels around in ways we haven’t seen since <em>Twisted Metal</em>’s heyday.</p><p>According to the video’s description, John (Anthony Mackie) will reunite with his long-lost sister, Dollface (Tiana Okoye), who, in the first season, we learn is the leader of a group of female vigilantes known as “The Dolls.” Unfortunately, the reunion isn’t featured in this short clip of the new season, so we’ll have to wait for that show-shifting meeting when the second season of <em>Twisted Metal</em> premieres July 31.</p><p>Until then, rewatch the clip and rejoice in the fact that this is probably not even a fraction of the action we’ll likely be blessed with in less than a month.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Being able to play games together while voice chatting is really neat, but the inclusion of video chat was an unexpected yet pleasant addition to the console’s new suite of features.. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Luckily, Nintendo isn’t placing a massive barrier to entry to video chat, either. As a matter of fact, <strong>you can use any USB-C camera on the Nintendo Switch 2</strong>, which means that you may already have a perfectly viable webcam lying around your house! But if you’ve been looking around the net, you’ve probably noticed two very popular Nintendo Switch 2 cameras have been getting a lot of attention: The official Nintendo Switch 2 Camera and the HORI Piranha Plant camera.</p><h2 id="h227210"><a id=""></a>Official Nintendo Switch 2 Camera</h2><p>It’s not all that surprising that one of the best camera options for the Nintendo Switch 2 comes directly from Nintendo itself. The aptly-titled Nintendo Switch 2 Camera is a feature-filled choice at a fairly reasonable price of $55, and it’s probably the overall smartest choice of camera for the console for most folks.</p><p>The Official Nintendo Switch 2 Camera offers a sleek form factor, a wide viewing range that can accommodate multiple people in one room, and an all-black aesthetic that helps it blend into an entertainment space. There’s even a privacy shutter for safety when the camera is not in use. </p><p>Toss in a moderately crisp 1080p resolution, and you’ve got yourself a somewhat modern-feeling camera to use during GameChat sessions. While a modern high-end webcam is undeniably going to offer better video quality, this little guy is likely cheaper while still being more than enough for casual chats and Mario Party fun!</p><h2 id="h227211"><a id=""></a>HORI Piranha Plant Camera</h2><p>The HORI Piranha Plant Camera is actually licensed by Nintendo, which explains why it’s rocking such a cool piranha plant aesthetic. Unlike the more low-key, professional vibe of the official camera, this awesome-looking piece of tech plays into the universal love of Nintendo.</p><p>The HORI Piranha Plant Camera kind of manages to make itself fun to use. For instance, it’s genuinely cool that you can bend the piranha plant’s neck to get the right angle you need, blending functionality and cuteness into a single feature. Oh, and its privacy shutter is achieved by literally closing the mouth. Quirky!</p><p><strong>Unfortunately, while the intriguing visual design and versatility of this device are excellent, its 480p resolution is shockingly poor for a camera in 2025</strong>. As such, <strong>it’s honestly best suited for kids or non-enthusiasts who don’t care as much about picture quality</strong>. It’s kind of a bummer, too, because it sure is a cool little device.</p><h2 id="h227212"><a id=""></a>Which should you buy?</h2><p>As you can see, each of these two popular Nintendo Switch 2 cameras offers its own pros and cons. The one you should buy depends on what you need for GameChat. If you’re an older enthusiast who plans to spend a lot of time in GameChat sessions with friends and wants a camera with solid video quality and a slim, sleek form factor, the Official Nintendo Switch 2 Camera is your best bet. If you’re a younger gamer, or video quality is secondary to you, the fun and silly nature of the HORI Piranha Plant Camera is undeniably appealing. </p><p>Whichever one you pick, remember to use the privacy shutter when you pick your nose. Or don’t. I don’t really care what you do. How you deal with your rhinotillexomania is your business.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Oh, and most of the WBD’s debt, which is nearing $40 billion, will be dumped on the Widenfels TV company, perhaps revealing the actual reason this is happening.</p><p>“By operating as two distinct and optimized companies in the future, we are empowering these iconic brands with the sharper focus and strategic flexibility they need to compete most effectively in today’s evolving media landscape,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/warner-bros-discovery-debt-billions-to-tv-networks-company-1236259848/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/warner-bros-discovery-debt-billions-to-tv-networks-company-1236259848/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zaslav said in a statement</a></span> that sounds like he was trying to win a bet to include as many empty buzzwords as possible. </p><p>Personally, I think one company is more optimized than two companies, but I’m not a genius business guru like Zaslav, a man who gets so uncomfortable watching sex scenes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/david-zaslav-is-angling-to-become-americas-king-of-content&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/david-zaslav-is-angling-to-become-americas-king-of-content" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he makes people in the room stare forward and not look at one another until they’re over</a></span>.</p><p>Global Networks and Streaming &amp; Studios are the current names of the newly formed companies.
