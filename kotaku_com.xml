However, one of its first hidden areas can be found during the tutorial segment—a hidden room that grants you an achievement just for finding it. Even better, it contains a lockbox with a nice set of bracers you may want to equip, to give yourself an early advantage in the game. Here’s where to find the hidden room in Fort Northreach.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195579" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="178" data-playlist="195579,196411,195891" data-current="195579"><div><p>This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21074.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h106766"><a id=""></a><strong>How to find the hidden room in Fort Northreach</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="e3781af7544816e70c41a12f4a3f6807" data-recommend-id="image://e3781af7544816e70c41a12f4a3f6807" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The location of the switch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The location of the switch." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e3781af7544816e70c41a12f4a3f6807" data-recommend-id="image://e3781af7544816e70c41a12f4a3f6807" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The location of the switch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll spend the very beginning of the game getting used to the controls and following some tutorials as you work your way across a small island. Eventually, you’ll come to a ladder leading up some scaffolding, and you’ll subsequently drop into some castle ruins. This is Fort Northreach.</p><p>Walk through this first room and exit out the destroyed wall on the left. Immediately upon entering this larger room with the giant crystal ahead, take a right. You’ll spot another wall that has been destroyed (with a much larger entryway this time).</p><figure id="" data-id="435bf676c826d836d234a5dd21cb0f2b" data-recommend-id="image://435bf676c826d836d234a5dd21cb0f2b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1083" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The switch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The switch." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="435bf676c826d836d234a5dd21cb0f2b" data-recommend-id="image://435bf676c826d836d234a5dd21cb0f2b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1083" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The switch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Walk inside this room and look along the right wall to spot a switch. Hitting this switch will open the hidden room. Inside, you’ll be attacked by a low-health enemy that fires some poison at you, so dispatch them quickly.</p><p>That done (and grog cures poison!) you will find a lockbox in the back of the room that holds some Vambraces, which you can equip to increase Stun by 15 percent. This can be a big help against the foes you’ll encounter ahead, as filling an enemy’s stun meter allows you to wallop them with a big hit. Before you leave, also grab the Kith Meat on the ground. Eating this will temporarily improve how much damage you do to Kith (any humanoid enemies), making it a good food to chomp down on before facing the boss of this tutorial area.</p><hr><p>For finding the hidden room, you’ll also earn the “Hawkeye” achievement. If this is your first journey through The Living Lands, it’s likely to be your first achievement. Rest assured, though, that there are plenty more achievements and secrets ahead of you in <em>Avowed</em>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But ultimately, Goliath lost.”  </p><p>Evans listed three initiatives Amazon pursued to try and steal PC gaming market share away from Steam. The first was acquiring a small PC game store called Reflexive Entertainment and trying to scale it. The second was building out its own PC game store and using Twitch’s popularity to drive players toward it. Finally, there was Luna, Amazon’s game streaming service. </p><p>None of these made a dent, and efforts by EA, Ubisoft, Bethesda and other publishers to build stores by locking their respective PC games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/desktop-launcher-pc-review-ea-battle-net-ubisoft-app-1850489703&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/desktop-launcher-pc-review-ea-battle-net-ubisoft-app-1850489703">behind annoying proprietary launchers</a></span> eventually failed as well. Even the Epic Games Store, launched back in 2017, is still a <em>Fortnite</em> launcher first and a Steam rival second. Despite giving away tons of free games every year to people just for logging on, Epic’s storefront feels like its stalled out (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/epic-store-free-games-stats-steam-mobile-fortnite-1851764053&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/epic-store-free-games-stats-steam-mobile-fortnite-1851764053">though lots of new features are on the way in 2025</a></span>). <br></p><p>“The mistake was that we underestimated what made consumers use Steam,” Evans wrote. “It was a store, a social network, a library, and a trophy case all in one. And it worked well. At Amazon, we assumed that size and visibility would be enough to attract customers, but we underestimated the power of existing user habits. We never validated our core assumptions before investing heavily in solutions. The truth is that gamers already had the solution to their problems, and they weren’t going to switch platforms just because a new one was available.”</p><p>What the retired executive is essentially saying is that Amazon thought people would show up simply because it was Amazon, when if it really wanted to take Steam on, it needed to actually give players a reason to switch. “We needed to build something dramatically better, but we failed to do so,” he wrote. “And we needed to validate our assumptions about our customers before starting to build. But we never really did that either. Just because you are big enough to build something doesn’t mean people will use it.” It’s a testament to Valve as much as it’s an indictment of C-suite brain rot. </p><p>For all of the valid criticism of Steam—the lack of moderation, terrible discovery tools, Nazi-ridden forums, and aging infrastructure—it still works pretty damn well. Then you have all of the ecosystem lock-in, from the social network aspect to new Steam sales adding more cheap games to players’ libraries every season. Plus it’s now basically the de facto launching ground for the biggest unexpected hits of any given year, from<em> Balatro</em> to <em>Palworld</em>. In addition to everything else, Steam is one of the main drivers of the attention economy around gaming, which is why a cool timed exclusive might hit the Epic Games Store and you never hear a peep about it. </p><p>It doesn’t feel great that one company controls so much about one of the largest and fastest-growing ways people play games, but then again it also sucked when companies tried to compete by making everyone maintain five different windows for booting up PC games. Maybe instead of competing for market share and platform dominance, more companies could follow <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">GOG in creating a DRM-free</a></span> future for PC gaming. Unlikely, but no more so than unseating Steam at this point. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
