              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-movie-remake-theater-release-january-2026-1851784778"><em>Return to Silent Hill,</em></a> a live-action film adaptation of Konami’s beloved <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, hits theaters later this week. Early reviews for the horror flick are as scary as any monster from the games.</p> <p>First announced in 2022, <a href="https://kotaku.com/return-to-silent-hill-pyramid-head-first-look-1851482793"><em>Return to Silent Hill</em></a> releases on January 23. It isn’t connected to the past two <em>Silent Hill</em> movies, even though it was directed by the first film’s Christophe Gans, and is instead a loose adaptation of the PS2-era survival horror classic<em> Silent Hill 2.</em> Marketing for this film has been minimal to say the least, partially because it seems the executives involved realized it wasn’t great back when it wrapped filming in 2023, and the movie is only seeing the light of day after that recent <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake did so well. But after the delay and the lack of marketing, perhaps this is a very good horror film? Nope. Doesn’t seem like it.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000661969" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661969"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661969">©Rotten Tomatoes / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/return_to_silent_hill">As of January 21, there are 15 reviews for <em>Return to Silent Hill</em></a> on critic aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. And the new movie has an abysmal seven percent Tomatometer score. For those not familiar with Rotten Tomatoes, that ain’t a great score. In fact, if this seven percent score holds, <a href="https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/worst-movies-of-all-time/"><em>Return to Silent Hill</em> will go down as one of the worst-reviewed movies ever</a>. Yikes.</p>

 <p>The general consensus from critics is that while parts of <em>Return to Silent Hill</em> look great, the film is a boring, sloppy, confusing, and (perhaps worst of all for the genre) not-very-scary movie about a main character that is hard to relate to and who seems more confused than terrified.</p>  <p>“This powerful survival horror story has been turned into an ugly, laughable adaptation that proves that maybe we should’ve never gone back to Silent Hill,” said Ross Bonaime over at <em>Collider</em>.</p>

 <p>“Christophe Gans’s film does away with all the psychosexual nuance of <em>Silent Hill 2</em>,” claims Justin Clark at <em>Slant Magazine.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>“I found the experience difficult to sit through and nonsensical from moment to moment, with its confounding story and shoddy CGI matched only by its lack of entertainment value,” said critic Brian Eggert.</p>

 <p>At the moment, there is only one non-rotten score, from Dominic Baez at the <em>Seattle Times</em>, and it doesn’t read like a loving endorsement of the movie. Instead, it seems like Baez found most of the movie bad, but enjoyed the ending. The end credits are apparently very “stylish.” When critics are praising your credits and not much else, that’s a bad sign.</p>

              <p>Christopher Judge comments <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-casting-kratos-ryan-hurst-amazon-tv-series-2000660584">on his fellow Kratos</a>. A new Kickstarter will transform your Switch 2 dock into an old-school GameCube. And two people who worked on <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> argue about what’s to blame for modern VFX looking dull and lifeless. It’s a very late edition of Morning Checkpoint,<em> Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture.</p> <p>Who’s ready for more bad news for PC gaming? Samsung and SK Hynix are <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/109799/ssd-prices-may-follow-ram-pricing-after-samsung-and-sk-hynix-reportedly-cut-nand-production/index.html">reportedly</a> dropping NAND production to focus on DRAM. That could mean even more expensive SSDs. Bad timing for me to replace the PC I built back in 2015 with an NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960.</p>

Great actor and a gamer who actually played God of War since its inception. So Kudos, you’ve got a great live-action Kratos" <a href="https://t.co/XFvPaMftH3">pic.twitter.com/XFvPaMftH3</a></p> <p>— Culture Crave 🍿 (@CultureCrave) <a href="https://twitter.com/CultureCrave/status/2014074404477571375?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“It’s a magnificent choice,” the in-game performer for the titular character said this week. “Great actor and a gamer who actually played<em> God of War</em> since its inception. So kudos, you’ve got a great live-action Kratos.” The TV series <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/max-parker-cast-god-of-war-heimdall-1236691740/">also revealed</a> that Max Parker will play the Watchman of Asgard, Heimdall.</p> <h2>Chris Pratt promises the <em>Mario Galaxy</em> movie still has more characters to reveal</h2> <p>“I’m not allowed to say what they are, but yes, there are some really incredible…Well, I think some of them have been released in the trailer–Rosalina, Bowser Jr.–and then there’s even a couple more that are not in the trailer that people should be excited to see,” the star of <em>Mercy</em> <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/animation-movies/after-rosalina-and-bowser-jr-s-appearances-in-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-chris-pratt-hints-at-a-couple-more-character-surprises-people-should-be-excited/">told</a> <em>Gamesradar</em>.

 <h2>The maker of <em>Payday 3</em> is laying off developers</h2> <p>Multiple staffers at Starbreeze Studios have been let go, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/layoffs-hit-payday-3-developer-starbreeze/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> reports</a>. “Today, many of us at Starbreeze, Stockholm, got sad news and I’m now seeking a new role and would appreciate your support,” wrote one of them on LinkedIn. “After over 7 years, the longest I’ve ever been at any company in any industry, my time has (more than likely) come.”</p>

 <h2>No online multiplayer for <em>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em></h2> <p>Following in the footsteps of all the previous Lego games, the new<em> Lego Batman</em> won’t have online co-op. “Fans of all generations will be able to enjoy the game solo or team up with a friend or family member through two-player local couch cooperative gameplay only,” <a href="https://legobatmangame.com/faq/">reads the FAQ</a> (via <a href="https://primagames.com/featured/lego-batmans-new-game-once-again-skips-online-co-op">Prima Games</a>).</p> <h2>Turn your Switch 2 into a GameCube</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Battle Dock coming soon! <a href="https://t.co/hRdu7zI6IV">pic.twitter.com/hRdu7zI6IV</a></p> <p>— Retro Fighters (@retrofightersco) <a href="https://twitter.com/retrofightersco/status/2013382477923111083?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>A new dock <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1247448559/battledock-for-switch-2">on Kickstarter</a> promises to do exactly that. It’s going for $40 with a January ship date and attaches directly to your existing Switch 2 dock. It comes in various old-school GameCube colors like silver, indigo, and orange, and has connectors for up to four of the retro console’s controllers. Perfect for when Switch Online adds <em>Mario Kart Double Dash</em> and <em>Smash Bros. Melee, </em>if ever.</p>

 <h2><em>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</em> gets a free demo</h2> <p>It’s out today on PC and console, including Switch 2, and lets players experience a bit of the Ryukyu district in Okinawa as Kiryu and the series’ familiar Kamurocho setting in Tokyo as Mine. The full remaster and all-new side story releases on all platforms on February 12.</p> <h2>Dueling <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> VFX takes</h2> <p>Director Gore Verbinksi talked to <a href="https://butwhytho.net/2025/11/gore-verbinski-good-luck-have-fun-dont-die/"><em>But Why Tho</em></a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/greatest-slip-backwards-pirates-of-the-caribbean-director-says-unreal-engine-makes-films-look-too-much-like-games/"><em>VGC</em></a>) about the state of VFX. “So it used to be a divide, with Unreal Engine being very good at video games, but then people started thinking maybe movies can also use Unreal for finished visual effects,” he said. “So you have this sort of gaming aesthetic entering the world of cinema.” He added, “I think that Unreal Engine coming in and replacing Maya as a sort of fundamental is the greatest slip backwards.”</p> <p>Epic Games VFX supervisor Pat Tubach, who said he also worked on the <em>Pirates</em> movies, fired back. “It’s inaccurate for anyone in the industry to claim that one tool is to blame for some erroneously perceived issues with the state of VFX and CGI,” Tubach said in a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/epic-games-vfx-head-says-pirates-of-the-caribbean-artists-would-have-loved-using-ue-and-i-should-know-i-was-one-of-them/">statement to <em>VGC</em></a>. “Unreal Engine is primarily used for pre-visualization, virtual production, and in some cases final pixels. I can guarantee that the artists working on big blockbuster VFX films like <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em> 10-15 years ago could only dream about having a tool as powerful as Unreal Engine on their desks to help them get the job done. And I should know–I was one of them.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-backlog-pulse-music-ps5-xbox-2000661365">Stop doomscrolling and go play <em>Forza Horizon 5</em></a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-tariff-ai-ram-stock-price-2000661382">One analysis firm predicts the Switch 2 is about to go up in price</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-reunion-chloe-announcement-release-date-2000661323">The new <em>Life Is Strange</em> is coming sooner than expected with some unexpected story choices</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>
