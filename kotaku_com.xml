A seasonal storytelling structure setting up events that would seemingly see the Justice League eventually brought back into the picture has brought us the Joker,  Mrs. Freeze (a gender-swap of the icy villain), and Deadshot’s daughter Lawless.

But there are some things the game doesn’t tell you, and a few lessons I’ve learned from playing it. So here are some adventuring tips to help you succeed in Indy’s latest adventure.</p><h2 id="h10879"><a id=""></a><strong>Follow the main quest</strong></h2><p>You’ll unlock important features, outfits, and more that will help you explore the large maps more thoroughly. And don’t worry, you can return to maps and finish up exploring once the credits roll. </p><h2 id="h10880"><a id=""></a>Turn down the music and turn up the voices</h2><p>The default audio mix in <em>Great Circle</em> is very music-heavy and while I enjoy the game’s soundtrack, I had trouble hearing Troy Baker’s Indy when playing. So I dropped the in-game music down about 10 points and upped the voice acting level by around 10. </p><h2 id="h10881"><a id=""></a><strong>Always be eating!</strong></h2><p>Food is very important in <em>Great Circle</em>. Bread can give you extra health, letting you take more hits in a fight. Fruit, meanwhile, gives you extra stamina, helping you throw more punches or climb for longer, so always eat a ton of it. The game will let you know when you’re maxed out. </p><h2 id="h10882"><a id=""></a><strong>Grab lots of food, too</strong></h2><p>Don’t just eat food, grab it! Indy can carry a few fruits and bread items with him at all times. When you’ve maxed out how much you can eat, max out how much you can carry. It will help you later.</p><figure id="" data-id="942e1cb39709b77314255f95f77c58e8" data-recommend-id="image://942e1cb39709b77314255f95f77c58e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox / Bethesda</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="942e1cb39709b77314255f95f77c58e8" data-recommend-id="image://942e1cb39709b77314255f95f77c58e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h10883"><a id=""></a><strong>Crack that whip!</strong></h2><p>Your whip isn’t just useful for swinging around places or pulling stuff down, it’s also very handy in a fight. You can whip enemies to stun them or even remove their weapons. If you get surprised by an enemy, whip them, steal their dropped weapon, and then beat them with it. </p><h2 id="h10884"><a id=""></a><strong>Also, crack that whip to scare dogs</strong></h2><p>You don’t have to kill dogs in<em> Great Circle. </em>Instead, just crack the whip near them and they’ll run away scared. </p><h2 id="h10885"><a id=""></a>Thoroughly look at all items when solving puzzles</h2><p>There are a lot of puzzles to solve in <em>Great Circle, </em>and a few times I found myself stumped. In these instances I found the answer, or a clue at least, by checking out the notes and items associated with the puzzle a bit more thoroughly. Indy can examine these things and even spin them around. Do that! </p><p>I’ve found notes, markings, and other clues on the backs of many objects, and that helped me solve hard puzzles. </p><h2 id="h10886"><a id=""></a><strong>Don’t go alone, always bring a weapon</strong></h2><p>Whenever possible, try to carry a weapon. These are very useful as you can knock out enemies with one hit if you sneak up behind them, but you can also use them in fistfights to gain an advantage. </p><figure id="" data-id="149d94f6788c9bd068da9be9f7dc1dc7" data-recommend-id="image://149d94f6788c9bd068da9be9f7dc1dc7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox / Bethesda</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="149d94f6788c9bd068da9be9f7dc1dc7" data-recommend-id="image://149d94f6788c9bd068da9be9f7dc1dc7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h10887"><a id=""></a>Sneak around, don’t fight</h2><p>While you might want to punch and shoot your way through the game, you’re better off sneaking around. Enemies aren’t super smart and have bad peripheral vision. </p><p>Also, if you use a weapon to knock someone out with one hit nobody will hear it, even if you do it with a really loud item like a guitar. </p><h2 id="h10888"><a id=""></a>When spotted, run away for a bit</h2><p>Stealth is a big part of<em> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>. Sometimes you’ll make a mistake and everyone will come running to kick your ass. Don’t fight them off; instead just run away and find a bush or room to hide in. Within a few moments, they’ll give up and you can walk back out and continue adventuring. </p><h2 id="h10889"><a id=""></a><strong>Use fast-travel signs</strong></h2><p>While it’s a lot of fun to explore the big maps in the game, don’t be afraid to use fast travel when hunting around for the last few secrets or side quests. To use fast travel, look for signposts found in  the map (they sparkle a little) and click where you want to go. Keep in mind you need to have been to a spot at least once to fast-travel there.</p><h2 id="h10890"><a id=""></a><strong>Walk around with your journal out</strong></h2><p>Indy’s journal  is very useful, as when you have it open in map mode the game will put objective markers in the world. This will help you get to where you need to go. </p><h2 id="h10891"><a id=""></a>Don’t forget to actually buy those upgrades you collect</h2><p><em>Great Circle</em> lets you find books that will help improve Indy’s abilities and stats. However, remember that just picking up and collecting a book isn’t enough. You still need to open your journal, flip over to upgrades, and use Adventure Points to buy and unlock the collected upgrade. It’s a bit odd, but worth remembering. </p><h2 id="h10892"><a id=""></a>Also, use your camera to get extra Adventure Points</h2><p>While you earn upgrade points by completing missions and quests, you also score some from taking photos of important people, places, or events. Keep an eye out for the camera icon in the top left of the screen and pull yours out whenever it pops up. Then look around for whatever special thing can be photographed and snap a pic for points.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We saw how a rebellion erupted in a separate Silo—Silo 17—resulting in people defiantly venturing to the outside world only to be killed by the noxious air. Since then, we’ve seen Juliette Nichols (Rebecca Ferguson) walk through what could be the future for Silo 18, the Silo she left: dead bodies strewn outside, “Lies” scrawled across the monitor the Silo people use to see the outside world, and darkness. </p><p>Ever since the people of Silo 18 watched Juliette become the first person to successfully walk outside and survive at the end of the first season, the Silo’s mayor, Bernard Holland (Tim Robbins), has been using every manipulative tactic at his disposal to prevent an uprising among people who have been told their entire lives that life outside the Silo isn’t safe. He’s arrested individuals for painting Juliette’s initials on the walls as a sign of reverence, lied about her using new tape his team developed to block the poisonous air from entering her suit, hired actors to publicly challenge him so he can dismiss their opinions as ramblings compared to his deceitful proclamations of hope, and coerced Judge Mary Meadows (Tanya Moodie) into supporting his lies to pacify the people with false promises of this new tape ushering in a new day. </p><p>What he did in episode four might be both his most dastardly deception and his most effective one. </p><h3 id="h181336"><a id=""></a>What happened to Judge Mary Meadows?</h3><figure id="" data-id="d1fa2a75cc32f69ba886fe790532d79b" data-recommend-id="image://d1fa2a75cc32f69ba886fe790532d79b" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="1606" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tanya Moodie waiting for her suit" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tanya Moodie waiting for her suit" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Apple</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d1fa2a75cc32f69ba886fe790532d79b" data-recommend-id="image://d1fa2a75cc32f69ba886fe790532d79b" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="1606" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tanya Moodie waiting for her suit" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After Bernard’s brooding enforcer Robert Sims (Common) questions Judge Meadows’ fidelity to the lie, he attempts to remove her from her place of influence with Bernard by having people call for her impeachment. While he simply wanted her sidelined, Bernard saw a more vile opportunity to both silence her and distract people from looking for the truth about the Silo.</p><p>Meadows only went along with Bernard’s plan in exchange for a suit designed to keep her safe when she exits the Silo, a promise he dangled in front of her until the end. Under the guise of a friendly dinner before handing her over her suit, Bernard poisoned the food she ate in an effort to “unite the Silo.” How her death would help accomplish that wasn’t clear until he offered Knox (Shane McRae) and Shirley (Remmie Milner), the two people leading the silent rebellion against Bernard, the chance to come see Judge Meadows. When they arrive in her office to see her dead with a knife in her chest, they quickly realize they’ve been set up to be pinned as the murderers of the Silo’s judge. </p><p>Soon after, Sims incited a manhunt for the accused killers, telling an angry mob that the two had killed Meadows for refusing to open the Silo’s air lock, and proclaiming it the duty of every Silo member to find them. That’s one way to bring people together.</p><p>With Juliette trying to assemble a suit so she can get back to Silo 18 and stop a rebellion that would lead to the deaths of its residents, the embers of fiery hatred have already been stoked, and there might not be much time left to prevent the inevitable.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But there were some bad ones, too.</p><p>Light and dark. Left and right. Pepsi and Coke. One needs the other to exist. The best games are only great if we can compare them to mediocre or awful games.

Numbered scores come with all sorts of asterisks and caveats, which is part of the reason we don’t use them here. And Metacritic’s aggregate isn’t perfect by any stretch. If you see a game on this list that you happen to love, it just means you have a different taste than a bunch of other critics or players. That’s fine!

Meanwhile, in the same 12 months, Konami also released <em>Silent Hill: The Short Message</em>, a first-person horror game that wasn’t very good and which most people likely forgot about within weeks of playing it.

This co-op sports game plays poorly, has only four sports to choose from, and looks like it fell out of 2015. Avoid and watch some clips of Bugs and Daffy on YouTube instead. Oh hey, look, this game was also published by Game Mill. Hmmm.</p></div><div><p>If you Google<em> Jujutsu Kaisen: Cursed Clash, </em>you’ll find a lot of people calling it the worst anime game released in years and bragging about how they refunded it quickly. Others are warning people to not buy it. I’ll quote one negative Steam review: “<em>Roblox JJK</em> games are more worthy of your time.” </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
