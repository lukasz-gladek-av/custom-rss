            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Whatever your feelings about <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-bungie-marathon-destiny-2-acquisition-fiscal-2000642935">Bungie, the state of<em> Destiny 2</em>, or the promise of <em>Marathon</em></a>, the cinematic short created to reveal the studio’s upcoming extraction shooter earlier this year was one of the coolest introductions to a video game world I’ve ever seen. It also looked like the complete antithesis of cheaply and amorphously generated slop, so I didn’t expect to see its director, Alberto Mielgo, recently try to defend it against accusations of being made with AI.</p> <p>“I can’t believe we’ve reached a point where I have to clarify this, but here it goes: this is not AI,” the <i>Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse</i> art director <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DRKzO0XDsow/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=NTc4MTIwNjQ2YQ%3D%3D&amp;img_index=11">wrote</a> on Instagram on November 17. “HELLO. Everything you see in this film: paintings, animations, 2D and 3D work, compositing, and renders done with huge team — 155 incredible people and hell of hours, days, months…Yes, our Achilles’ heel: time.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-gameplay-trailer-release-date-price-season-ps5-1851775940">The cinematic short</a> combines CGI, live-action footage, and <em>Marathon</em>‘s broader design language to convey a sci-fi short story about mercenary runners pillaging an alien planet who slowly lose themselves, their memories, and their humanity as they are cloned over and over again to serve their megacorp sponsors. It prompted some fans to dream of a version of <em>Marathon</em> that married that worldbuilding to a completely single-player, story-driven campaign.</p>   <p>“I truly love this little film,” Mielgo wrote on Instagram. “Many of you ask me what my opinion on AI is… Honestly, I have no idea. But one thing is certain: AI will never take away my (your) urge or joy for making art and painting. That part will never be replaced. (This text was kindly edited with ChatGPT).”</p>

 <p>It’s not entirely clear where the allegations of the short being made with AI first sprang from. Were they serious critiques or simply online passersby assuming that it could only look so good and otherworldly with the help of AI, because increasingly that’s what the rest of the internet’s algorithms are teaching them?</p>

 <p>Mielgo also weighed in on <em>Marathon</em>‘s brief plagiarism controversy earlier this year in which <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-art-alpha-gameplay-posters-antireal-1851780911">graphics lifted from another artist</a> online made it into marketing footage and playable builds of the game. Bungie apologized and promised a thorough review of what went wrong in its pipeline, but it left some wondering where the theft ended and <em>Marathon</em>‘s exciting aesthetic began, though it was also clear at the time that part of the backlash was coming from bad-faith critics looking for something else to pile on Bungie about.</p>

 <h2>The <em>Marathon</em> plagiarism controversy was ‘blown out of proportion’</h2> <p>“But you know what I hate the most?” Mielgo wrote in what now appear to be deleted comments, according <a href="https://thegamepost.com/alberto-mielgo-marathon-cinematic-ai-bungie-plagiarized-material/">to<em> The Game Post</em></a>. “Working our asses off for years to create something cool, only for it to get eclipsed by sphincter smelly press and headline readers.”</p>

 <p>He continued, hitting back at people who didn’t believe him in the comments, “It&nbsp;was genuinely a mistake, blown out of proportion by people like you and hungry sphincter press. Regardless, to your pseudowistle, none of the text/fonts ever reached our team. The Bungie team is fantastic, and the work they did before us was f****ng outstanding. I loved working with them.”</p> <p><em>Marathon</em> was supposed to already be out but got delayed following negative feedback during an alpha test earlier this year. The team’s been making lots of changes to the game in the interim, including the highly requested addition of proximity chat. Sony says the game will release before April 2026. Hopefully, people take whatever gets released on its own terms rather than letting it be overshadowed by all of the other baggage swirling around its development.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/capture-lifes-precious-moments-with-this-dedicated-vlogging-camera-from-dji-down-to-its-lowest-price-yet-2000645281</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-osmo-pocket-3-just-hit-all-time-low-after-multiple-drops-as-amazon-quietly-offloads-the-top-vlogging-camera.1358020/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="504">If you’re into vlogging, having the right gear can really clean up your content and make your workflow smoother in one go. Allow me to introduce the DJI Osmo Pocket 3. It’s a dedicated vlogging camera that lets you leave your phone in your pocket and focus on capturing great footage. Whether you’re into YouTube, TikTok, or Instagram Reels, this camera is designed with you in mind.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4900/"> And right now, you can grab it for 34% off on Amazon. Normally priced at $799, it’s now going for just $524 — saving you a solid $276.</a> This deal is coming in over a week before Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales, so you can even get some holiday shopping wrapped up ahead of schedule.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4900/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p data-start="506" data-end="1025">So, why go for the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 instead of using your phone? Sure, phones like the iPhone 16 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S25 have impressive cameras, but there’s one thing they can’t offer — unlimited storage. While the Osmo Pocket 3 doesn’t have endless storage either, it uses a MicroSD card, so you can expand your storage as much as you need. Plus, you can keep your vlogs and personal stuff separate. It’s a lifesaver for people like me who are always scrambling to delete old videos just to take a quick selfie with my iPhone.</p>

<h2 data-start="506" data-end="1025">Impressive Videography</h2>
<p data-start="1027" data-end="1453">Now, let’s talk about the footage. This little camera packs a punch with 4K resolution at up to 120 fps, which means you can create smooth, cinematic slow-motion shots in your edits. The lens also swivels and auto-focuses to track your subject, so you’ll get steady, dynamic shots as you move around. Thanks to its three-axis mechanical stabilization, the camera removes a lot of annoying shaky cam that can ruin your videos.</p>


<p data-start="1455" data-end="1804">You can use the Osmo Pocket 3 in two ways — either facing forward to film whatever’s going on in front of you, or flipped around to capture yourself. The built-in mini display is one inch across, touch-sensitive, and rotates both vertically and horizontally, so you can switch things up depending on how you want to frame your shots or where you plan on posting the finished product to later.</p>
<p data-start="1806" data-end="2041">The camera has advanced color-grading tech that shoots in 10-bit color depth, meaning you’re capturing up to one billion colors for richer, more vibrant visuals. It’s also capturing professional-grade audio in stereo sound right on the camera itself. For even better audio, connect it directly and easily to up to two DJI Mic 2 or Mic Mini transmitters, sold separately.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/garmin-rolls-out-major-black-friday-deal-on-fenix-8-now-priced-like-a-used-previous-gen-model-2000645396</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Serious athletes need watches that can survive extreme conditions and track every metric that matters for performance optimization. Budget fitness trackers cannot keep up with ultramarathons, technical climbs or dive expeditions. The <strong>Garmin Fenix 8 is the brand’s first push beyond the $1,000 threshold</strong> in their flagship multisport line, and packs features that justify its position as the ultimate tool for dedicated athletes.</p>
<p>The good news is that Amazon has just dropped <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5696/">the 51mm Solar Sapphire model to $849 for Black Friday, down from its regular $1,199 price</a>. That makes it <strong>an all-time low</strong> that brings the grail of sports watches within the grasp of those committed athletes who previously shy away from four-figure pricing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5696/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Survives Toughest Challenges</h2>
<p>The scratch-resistant sapphire lens on this <strong>1.4-inch display</strong> holds up to impacts from rock scrambles, trail running branches, and the many accidental door frame collisions that destroy cheaper watches. <strong>Solar charging extends battery life to 48 days</strong> in smartwatch mode if you spend three hours daily in 50,000 lux sunlight-representative for outdoor athletes training regularly.<strong> GPS mode is functional for 149 continuous hours</strong> with solar assistance, accommodating multi-day ultra races or extended backcountry expeditions with no external chargers needed. The<strong> always-on display</strong> is readable in direct sunlight and automatically adjusts brightness based on ambient light to save battery while keeping it visible during activities.</p>
<p><strong>Carbon gray DLC titanium construction</strong> balances strength with wearability, keeping weight manageable for all-day comfort while maintaining structural integrity during hard use. DLC coating resists scratches better than standard titanium finishes and preserves the watch’s appearance through years of abuse. The 51mm case size accommodates larger wrists comfortably and houses the sensors and battery capacity that smaller models sacrifice for compactness.</p>



<p><strong>Multi-band GPS with SatIQ technology</strong> simultaneously accesses signals from multiple satellite constellations and calculates your position with a degree of precision unreachable for single-band receivers under the most difficult conditions. The system will automatically switch between single and multi-band modes depending on environment difficulty, saving battery during open-sky running while engaging full accuracy under tree cover or canyon walls. Various<strong> inbuilt sensors like a three-axis compass, gyroscope, and barometric altimeter</strong> independently generate navigation data from GPS which becomes vital when satellite signals are blocked or you need to economize on battery life over longer trips.</p>



<p>Training readiness scoring analyzes sleep quality, recovery metrics, training load, and heart rate variability to calculate whether you should push hard or scale back intensity. The<strong> watch tracks HRV overnight through wrist-based sensors</strong> that detect autonomic nervous system balance, which indicates recovery status. Real-time stamina tracking during activities shows how much energy remains before exhaustion so you can pace your efforts appropriately during long races or intense training blocks.</p>
<p>The<strong> 40-meter dive rating with leakproof metal buttons</strong> allows for scuba and apnea diving activities, monitoring depth, time, and decompression requirements during underwater exploration. Metal buttons maintain seal integrity far better than capacitive surfaces that leak under pressure, ensuring the operation of the watch under the most adverse conditions.</p>
<p>The built-in speaker and microphone <strong>enable phone calls directly from your wrist</strong> when it is paired with your smartphone. This makes calls possible during runs or rides, with no need to stop and dig through pockets. Voice assistant integration lets you respond to messages hands-free and stay focused on the activity. Also, ECG monitoring records heart rhythm while screening for signs of atrial fibrillation and enables health insights beyond standard fitness tracking.</p>
<p>You’re paying what used Fenix models sell for on secondary markets at $849 for titanium construction, sapphire crystal protection, solar charging, and dive-rated durability with professional-grade training analytics. This $350 discount transforms Garmin’s flagship from an aspirational purchase to an achievable upgrade for serious athletes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A’s</span></i></a> <i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC is just a few weeks away, and it’s bringing a handful of new <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolutions-best-worst-designs-legends-z-a-2000625459">Mega Evolutions</a>, a <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-level-cap-100-2000641765">roguelike mode</a>, and additional story to the Nintendo Switch RPG. Today, Game Freak announced that Zeraora, one of the rare mythical Pokémon from Generation VI, is getting its own Mega Evolution in the DLC with a new trailer, and it sure does sound like the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-evolutions-2000641670">datamined list of new Megas is completely legit</a>.</span></p> <p><span>The trailer is brief, but shows the </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>protagonist running around and fighting hostile Pokémon in a weird bizarro version of Lumiose City with Zeraora by their side. Just as the pair seems about to be overwhelmed, Zeraora mega evolves and manages to win the fight:</span></p>

  <p><em>Legends: Z-A</em>‘s Mega Evolutions have been so lopsided in terms of the goofy/cool ratio that it’s kind of refreshing to see that Mega Zeraora is a super edgy, overdesigned electric cat boy. It’s straightforward and has that “middle schooler’s notebook doodle” design philosophy that is pretty prominent in a lot of the original Mega Evolution designs from <em>Pokémon X </em>and&nbsp;<em>Y</em>. I like the silly designs like Mega Victreebell and Slowbro, but we need some cool cats in the mix, too.</p>

 <p>Zeraora is one of several leaked Mega Evolutions dataminers found in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>‘s code, and thus far, every new form Game Freak has revealed for <em>Mega Dimension&nbsp;</em>has been on that list. We knew Raichu was getting two forms, then Baxcalibur and Chimecho were <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-raichu-2000641644">revealed in the DLC’s first gameplay trailer</a>, so we’re just waiting for the rest of the list at this point.</p> <p>The new Mega Evolutions will apparently include new forms for Pokémon who have already received Megas in the past, including Lucario, Absol, and Garchomp. At the moment, it’s unclear if those forms will have the same “X” or “Y” naming convention of other Pokémon who have gotten multiple Mega forms, including Raichu, Charizard, and Mewtwo, so fans have taken to calling them “Z” forms. Until we see those, I guess we’re stuck with Game Freak’s latest attempt to force Zeraora on the <em>Pokémon </em>community despite it never really feeling like it has that big of a fanbase. The Pokémon Company is determined to make fetch happen, so we’ll see if this Mega Evolution changes hearts and minds.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[If You Own an iPhone, Amazon Gives You 2 Free AirTags for Black Friday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/if-you-own-an-iphone-amazon-gives-you-2-free-airtags-for-black-friday-2000645425</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/if-you-own-an-iphone-amazon-gives-you-2-free-airtags-for-black-friday.1357972/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Losing keys and wallets is a source of stress that tracking devices solve by locating the exact position through your phone. Individual (Apple) AirTags sell for $29 apiece which puts two units at around $60 before you add in Apple’s usual premium.</p>
<p>Amazon’s deal for Black Friday flips this math on its<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/"> head by offering a four-pack for $64, down from the regular $99 price</a>. You’re basically<strong> paying for two AirTags at full price and getting two additional units as bonus freebies</strong>. This all-time low pricing makes stocking up on trackers for every item you frequently misplace finally affordable, and for iPhone users, it means access to Apple’s <em>Find My</em> network.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Precision Tracking via Apple’s Vast Network</h2>
<p>AirTags use the<strong> more-than-a-billion-strong Find My network of Apple devices worldwide</strong>, crowdsourcing locations even when items move beyond your Bluetooth range. Any passing iPhone, iPad, or Mac picks up your AirTag’s encrypted signal and relays its location anonymously back to your account without the intermediary device owner ever knowing. This network effect works great in cities where Apple devices are everywhere and provides near real-time updates as your lost item moves through populated spaces.</p>
<p>Precision Finding allows the iPhone 11 and newer to display directional arrows and distance measurements and leads you directly to where lost items are located. Ultra-wideband technology calculates the precise spatial positioning to show you which direction to walk and how many feet remain. The capability turns vague searches like “somewhere in this room” into guided treasure hunts leading you to the couch cushion holding your keys.</p>



<p>The built-in speaker plays sounds when you activate the Find My app which can help you find items buried under papers on your desk or tucked in jacket pockets you might have forgotten to check. The speaker volume gets loud enough to be heard from adjacent rooms, though thick materials like couch cushions muffle it significantly. You can also trigger the speaker when an AirTag separates from your iPhone beyond a certain distance and warns you that you’ve left something behind before you drive away or hop on a train.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life is around a year on the user-replaceable CR2032 coin cell battery</strong> which is a standard size available for a few bucks at grocery stores and gas stations. That replaceable design means you’re not tossing the entire tracker when power runs out, unlike sealed competitors that’ll become e-waste when their batteries eventually die.</p>



<p><strong>Water and dust resistance rated at IP67 lets AirTags survive splashes, rain, and brief submersion</strong> up to one meter for 30 minutes. The sealed construction protects internal components from pocket lint, dirt, and the general abuse that small accessories endure.</p>
<p>With four AirTags costing just $64, when singles are $29 apiece, you’re essentially getting $116 worth of trackers for barely more than the price of buying two units separately. The $35 discount and underlying buy-two-get-two-free math makes this four-pack the only sensible purchase option for iPhone users needing to track multiple items.</p>
