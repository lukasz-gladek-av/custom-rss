This time around, however, he’ll be doing it without studio cofounder Chris Olsen, who was the director on <em>Somerville</em>, or the rest of its development team.</p><p>The group’s 2022 debut indie game channeled the cinematic puzzle adventure DNA of <em>Limbo</em> and<em> Inside</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/somerville-jumpship-playdead-limbo-inside-review-1849783516&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/somerville-jumpship-playdead-limbo-inside-review-1849783516">but without the refined gameplay</a></span>.

You can play the main character as a righteous hero or a complete asshole, and toil away on any number of side gigs along the way. <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>'s follow-through on its immersive fantasy is especially evident in an ending you can only get after a life of too much crime.</p><p>It was shared online shortly after the game’s launch <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NikTekOfficial/status/1887179860814274905&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NikTekOfficial/status/1887179860814274905" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by YouTuber NikTek</a></span> (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/think-twice-before-causing-too-much-trouble-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-because-henry-can-and-will-get-executed-and-theres-a-heartbreaking-cutscene-for-it/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/think-twice-before-causing-too-much-trouble-in-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-because-henry-can-and-will-get-executed-and-theres-a-heartbreaking-cutscene-for-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Gamesradar</em></a></span>). “If you commit multiple crimes in <em>Kingdom Come Deliverance II</em>, you will get a full execution cutscene,” they wrote. “This is impressive!” And to be clear, you have to commit A LOT of crimes; otherwise you’ll just get placed in the stockade for a bit or get the normal game over screen for “losing Lord von Bergow’s trust.”</p><p>Go on a full-blown rampage, though, and your only options will be to try and fight your way out or wait for your execution to be scheduled. The whole scene takes roughly two minutes and shows protagonist Henry being dramatically marched up to the middle of the town square and hanged. It’s an unusually cinematic scene for what most games would treat as just a “playing the game wrong” fail condition. </p><p>Not <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>. “Game over,” the last screen of the ending reads. “You have been executed for your crimes.” Of course, if <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em> was <em>really</em> not messing around, it would delete the player’s save file after that happened. Even games that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/video-games-delete-save-data/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/video-games-delete-save-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">make you delete data</a></span> as part of their true ending haven’t gone that far.
