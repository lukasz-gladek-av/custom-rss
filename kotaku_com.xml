            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning and welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of interesting news and other stuff you might care about. Don’t worry, I’m not mad that you didn’t call at all while you were away. I’m used to it, really. Anyway, let’s move on and talk about <em>Concord</em>, a new<em> Vampire Survivors</em> spin-off game, bad news for <em>PUBG</em> fans on PS5, and good news for <em>Battlefield 6</em> players craving a big new map to play on.</p> <p><strong><em>Battlefield 6</em> finally has a big Conquest, but EA didn’t make it</strong></p> <p>Since <em>Battlefield 6′</em>s beta earlier this year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-data-confirms-smallest-maps-franchise-ea-fps-bf1-2000640803">players have been begging the devs to make bigger maps</a>. And a few fans have grown tired of waiting and have used <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s own in-game content creation tools to turn the shooter’s recently added (and very big) battle royale map into a few different massive conquest levels. You can see some gameplay of this below via Jackfrags.</p>

  <p>Watching gameplay of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1on9ras/two_new_br_maps_with_three_conquest_gamemodes/">Golf Course conquest map created by Kurtinthegrind</a> and a few other players has me both excited for the future of Portal<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment --><em>BF6</em>‘s mode dedicated to user-created levels and modes<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->and sad that we don’t have a big map like this in the official game yet. Portal, while fun, has various restrictions, including smaller XP rewards and less populated matches and servers. And from what I can tell, this big new conquest map made by fans runs well on console and PC. So the engine seems capable of handling this kind of experience.</p>

 <p>Honestly, if I were running Battlefield Studios, I’d be porting at least the Golf Course map into the main game ASAP as a bonus extra new level for this season. Don’t even tease it. Just drop it and watch fans go wild.</p> <p><strong><em>Concord</em> directly mentioned during UK government debate over consumer laws</strong></p> <p>Remember <em>Concord</em>? It was that short-lived hero-based FPS from Sony that <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">shut down just two weeks after launch</a>. Well, <em>Concord</em> was brought up in the UK House of Commons during a debate about consumer rights and laws regarding live-service video games, an issue raised by the Stop Killing Games movement. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concords-sudden-shutdown-is-such-a-big-deal-its-been-brought-up-during-uk-government-debates-on-video-game-consumer-laws">According to <em>Eurogamer</em></a>, MP Ben Goldsborough led the debate on Monday.</p>

 <p>During the debate, another MP specifically named <em>Concord</em>, stating: “A recent example is <em>Concord</em>, a game released for PlayStation 5 and Windows in August 2024. Following a disappointing launch, Sony Interactive Entertainment made a commercial decision to shut it down. To their credit, they did refund all purchases, but this isn’t always the case.”</p>

 <p>Don’t expect any change to UK laws to come from this, as the government <a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2025-0195/">has already stated it has no plans to change consumer laws</a> in regards to live-service, online-only video games.</p> <p><strong><em>Vampire Survivors</em> and <em>Warhammer</em> collide in new official spin-off</strong></p>  <p>As announced on November 4, the folks behind<em> Vampire Survivors </em>are teaming up with the <em>Boltgun </em>devs to create a new spin-off game officially known as <em>Warhammer Survivors.</em> In a press release for the newly revealed game, <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/dmvj6ri9/tear-through-hordes-of-tyranids-and-skaven-in-upcoming-video-game-warhammer-survivors/">Games Workshop describes it</a>&nbsp;as a “brand new and completely standalone survivors-style game” that is set in the <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> and&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em> universes. <em>Warhammer Survivors</em> launches sometime in 2026.</p> <p><strong>You’ll have to re-earn all your <em>PUBG</em> trophies on PS5</strong></p> <p>The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 ports of <em>PUBG: Battlegrounds</em> will soon be dead and done, <a href="https://kotaku.com/well-bad-news-for-pubg-players-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-2000617500">as previously announced in August</a>. The devs are going to focus on the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S ports of the battle royale game instead. But a new wrinkle for PS4 players is that when you leap to PS5, you’ll have to re-earn all your trophies again. This was confirmed in a new blog post from the devs who say they “explored various options with Sony Interactive Entertainment to make trophy transfer possible,” but due to how much data was involved, it would be “technically difficult to implement.” So they aren’t going to do it. “We kindly ask for your understanding,” <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/9355">said the <em>PUBG</em> team.</a></p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-fan-made-courage-the-cowardly-dog-game-perfect-creepy-dreams-ps4-2000640924">New<em> Courage the Cowardly Dog</em> fan game looks good</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pillars-eternity-3-turn-based-mode-update-avowed-crpg-2000640875">RPG <em>Pillars of Eternit</em>y is getting a turn-based option a decade later</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-loot-hack-cheat-embark-studios-2000640831"><em>Arc Raiders</em> devs returning loot to people killed by cheaters</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Few characters in pop culture exemplify goodness like Paddington Bear. The Peruvian bear has captured the hearts of children and adults alike in his books, television series, and, most recently, his beloved live-action films starring Ben Whishaw. Now, the British icon has returned to the theater for the first time in 40 years with </span><i><span>Paddington: The Musical</span></i><span>, and I’m so obsessed with how the show brings the anthropomorphic bear onto the stage.&nbsp;</span></p>   <p><span>The London production began this weekend, with its first show debuting in the West End on November 1. You can recreate the sets, cast brilliant actors as the human characters, and have excellent songs to bring it all together, but the entire show would have fallen apart if they couldn’t bring Paddington himself convincingly to life on stage. Instead of merely using a puppet, </span><i><span>Paddington: The Musical </span></i><span>utilizes a combination of animatronics, an on-stage actor, and an off-stage voice to bring the character to the show, and the results are so impressive that it’s almost uncanny.</span></p>

   <p><span>The actor you’ll see in costume on stage is Arti Shah, a little person who dons the full-body Paddington suit. While she’s interacting with the other actors, James Hameed stands off-stage and recites Paddington’s spoken lines. The costume is also fitted with animatronics so the little guy can move his mouth, blink, and be expressive on stage, which Hameed controls to match his line delivery. It’s a multi-person job, but it’s hard to argue with the results. Fans who have seen the show live are smitten with Paddington, and those of us unlucky enough not to be in London are desperate for the show to come stateside. I’ve only seen a handful of Broadway shows since moving to NYC, but I will be there for </span><i><span>Paddington: The Musical </span></i><span>if it comes over.</span></p>   <p><span>For now, </span><i><span>Paddington: The Musical </span></i><span>is only in London, so if you’re looking for a dose of marmalade-flavored feel-good joy and don’t live there, you can still boot up the excellent live-action movies on your movie streaming service of choice.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The hack-and-slash <a href="https://kotaku.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-the-kotaku-review-1845702074"><em>Warriors</em> spin-offs</a> on Nintendo Switch have been easy to skip. The arcade action can be fun and the character interactions rewarding for fans of the given franchise, but for the most part they’ve done little to break out of the fan service bubble. <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> might be different. Early reviews suggest the <em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> spin-off isn’t just a must-play for hardcore fans but a decent action game that new Switch 2 owners should be paying attention to.</p> <p>Out November 6 as an exclusive for Nintendo’s new hardware, the Koei Tecmo-developed musou game is the first major next-gen-only release the Switch 2 has seen since <a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-destructible-environments-ocd-1851786630"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a> in July. It’s currently sporting a not altogether impressive Metacritic score of 78, which is exactly in line with how the previous games in the subseries, <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> and <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</em>, performed. Beneath some of the criticism of the repetitive combat and less-than-excellent mission design, however, early reviews are generally more positive than I was expecting.</p>

 <p>“I might hesitate to call<em>&nbsp;Age of Imprisonment</em> an ‘essential’ Switch 2 game, but it’s a crucial piece of giving the system a strongly varied first-year lineup,” writes Hayes Madsen <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review">for<em> Inverse</em></a>, who praised some of its<em> Star Fox</em>-like missions and said the story “genuinely enhances&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom.” </em>Chris Scullion, reviewing <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/">for <em>VGC</em>,</a> was even more upbeat, writing, <em>“Age of Imprisonment</em> may be the most serious of the <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> games to date, but it’s also the one with the most engaging and rewarding combat.”</p>

 <p>Not everyone was equally impressed. “Repetition is baked into the genre, but its zen-like nature is stripped away in the latter parts of <em>Age of Imprisonment</em>‘s campaign as you’re forced to replay the same sorts of missions over and over again,” wrote Richard Wakeling <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review-link-to-the-past/1900-6418434/">for <em>GameSpot</em></a>. “Many missions only take place in small slithers of battlefields, and even the ones in bigger areas shuffle you quite cleanly from point to point,” wrote Oscar Taylor-Kent <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review/">for<em> Gamesradar</em></a>. “There’s very little sense of scope to any of the environments, instead feeling just like corridors and rooms.”</p> <p>One thing to note: some big sites haven’t even published their <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> reviews yet because Nintendo’s embargo restrictions were too onerous. “Restrictions Nintendo sent alongside a review code were particularly strict this time around, preventing reviews that publish ahead of launch from discussing&nbsp;<em>any&nbsp;</em>non-public story details whatsoever,” <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review">reported<em> IGN</em></a>. <em>The Verge </em>also opted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/813136/review-imprisoned-for-now">to wait until launch</a> to share its review. <em>Polygon</em> isn’t <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/marioprime.bsky.social/post/3m4spqbnwwk2o">publishing its take yet either</a>. In the meantime, here’s what everyone else is saying.</p> <h2><em><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review-link-to-the-past/1900-6418434/">GameSpot</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>“Without any technical hiccups getting in the way, combat is still the star of <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em>. Unique Skills and Sync Strikes bring increased depth to its hack-and-slash histrionics, while elements of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> are smartly adapted to fit the musou genre. The story doesn’t feel essential enough to satisfy pure Zelda fans, but by ironing out its predecessor’s performance issues and introducing a varied roster of rewarding characters, <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> marks a high point for the spin-off series thus far.” — Richard Wakeling</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-switch-2-review-1235458481/">Rolling Stone</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>“As a <em>Zelda</em>&nbsp;title, it effectively continues the worldbuilding from the&nbsp;<em>Beath of the Wild</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>&nbsp;duology; it also provides a sense of real agency for the princess herself, who somehow hadn’t even starred in her own game until last year’s disappointing&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>. As a musou, it also manages to elevate the well-worn trappings of the subgenre by incorporating a shocking amount of actual&nbsp;<em>Zelda</em> mechanics.” — Christopher Cruz</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review">Inverse</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>“The core structure of<em>&nbsp;Age of Imprisonment&nbsp;</em>is entirely focused on taking over bases and fighting bosses. You don’t need to control the battlefield like in the <em>Fire Emblem</em> games, and allies largely can’t do damage to enemies — they’re only there to help support you. A good way to think of it is that this is a character action game (like <em>Devil May Cry</em>) grafted onto the bones of the <em>Warriors</em> structure — but it works.” — Hayes Madsen</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review/">Gamesradar</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>“<em>Age of Calamity</em> had a range of diverse and interestingly shaped maps, but<em> Age of Imprisonment</em>‘s feel bland in comparison – even when some maps are essentially the same as in the other game, the undemanding structure makes them worse in this outing. One specific wooded area is still a banger, though. Revisiting <em>Age of Calamity</em> alongside this new one, I had way more fun fighting back through even early encounters there, with sprawling battlefields and pockets of fighting.” — Oscar Taylor-Kent</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/review/18880-hyrule-warriors-age-imprisonment-review">RPG Site</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>For a certain type of player, <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> will be the single game you’ll end up sinking the most time into on your Switch 2. If it wasn’t for every other RPG I’ve yet to play this year, I might have ended up in those shoes. <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> isn’t just a great <em>Zelda</em> spinoff, but confidently stands among some of the singular best games in the entire <em>Zelda</em> series. I simply can’t recommend it enough for anyone who is a fan of the <em>Warriors</em>‘ genre. — James Galizio</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-impressions-review-story-gameplay">Eurogamer</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>Oh, and here’s a bonus: this is one of these games that&nbsp;<em>runs well</em>. I don’t associate <em>Warriors</em> with that, even on higher-end consoles. But this is great. I don’t know if it began life as a Switch 1 game and was then shifted to the successor machine or what, but whatever the reasoning I’m thrilled to note that this looks nice enough but also maintains a solid and high frame rate, even when hundreds of troops are bouncing around on screen. — Alex Donaldson</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment/">VGC</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>In terms of the actual gameplay itself, <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> is undoubtedly still a<em> Warriors</em> game – for the uninitiated, Koei Tecmo’s <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> series has had numerous licensed spin-offs for the likes of <em>One Piece</em>, <em>Dragon Quest</em>,<em> Fire Emblem</em>, <em>Persona</em> and these <em>Zelda</em>-themed <em>Hyrule Warriors</em> titles – but it also feels a bit like a game trying even more than its predecessors to appeal to those not interested in its hack-and-slash principles. — Chris Scullion</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.pcmag.com/reviews/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">PC Mag</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>I went into <em>Age of Imprisonment</em> thinking I knew what to expect, but I was surprised by what I found. The improved performance—especially in local multiplayer—as well as the tweaks to combat really made the game stand out among the many <em>Warriors</em> titles. <em>Zelda</em> fans looking for a traditional adventure should look elsewhere. But if you’re down for an <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-pc-action-games" target="_self" rel="noopener">action game</a> that’ll easily steal dozens of hours of your life, <em>Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</em> is a terrific time. — Zackery Cuevas</p></blockquote>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-beginner-telescope-now-costs-as-much-as-a-toy-yet-comes-with-two-real-eyepieces-2000641087</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’ve all looked up at the night sky and wondered what those lights really look like up close. Stars, planets, the craters on the moon – they’re all up there, waiting to be explored but telescopes have always seemed either too expensive or too complicated to bother with.</p>
<p>The <em>Hexeum</em> <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5327/">beginner telescope just dropped to $85 from $149 on Amazon</a>, and brings real astronomy within reach of anyone curious enough to point it at the sky. This isn’t a toy telescope that shows you blurry dots, it’s an<strong> 80mm aperture refractor with actual quality optics, two real eyepieces and a Barlow lens that magnifies the moon up to 180 times</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5327/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Optics That Show You Something Worth Seeing</h2>
<p>With an aperture of 80mm, it captures much more light compared to smaller and entry-level scopes which will directly translate into a view that is brighter and clearer of the night’s starry objects. The focal length of 600mm at f/6.7 gives a balance between the wide-field views for star clusters and closer views of planets and the moon. Fully multi-coated lenses mean reduced light loss and increased brightness and clarity in the image so instead of a washed-out blob, you’re actually seeing sharp detail.</p>
<p>Right out of the box, the two eyepieces give you flexibility: The <strong>25mm eyepiece gives 24x magnification,</strong> perfect for scanning the sky to find objects or viewing larger targets like the Andromeda Galaxy or the Pleiades star cluster. The <strong>10mm eyepiece bumps you up to 60x magnification</strong> for detailed views of the moon’s craters, Jupiter’s bands or Saturn’s rings. The 3<strong>x Barlow lens triples the magnifying power of each eyepiece</strong> and pushes you to 72x and 180x when you want to zoom in even closer.</p>



<p>The adjustable aluminum tripod holds the telescope steady during viewing which is more important than one might think. Any shimmy or wobble gets magnified along with the image and turns the planets into jittery blurs. Sturdy construction means you don’t have to fight vibrations every time you touch the scope, so smooth focusing isn’t a problem. <strong>A phone adapter lets you snap photos of what you see</strong> by mounting your smartphone onto the eyepiece and turns casual star-gazing into shareable moments.</p>
<p>For $85, you’re paying what some people spend on a nice dinner for a tool that opens up an entirely new hobby. The lifetime maintenance support means you’re covered if anything goes wrong, and the responsive customer service handles questions within 24 hours. This telescope gives you real views of real astronomical objects-the phases of Venus, the moons of Jupiter orbiting in real-time, the rings of Saturn and countless star clusters.</p>
