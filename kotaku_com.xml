The latest release from the <em>Dark Souls</em> team immediately sprang up the Steam charts to reach over 300,000 concurrent players. That made it the fourth-biggest game on Valve’s storefront and the second-biggest FromSoftware launch on PC behind <em>Elden Ring</em>. Its namesake and its $40 price point clearly did the experimental multiplayer spin-off some favors. </p><p>But it didn’t take players long to realize that <em>Nightreign</em> is very much not <em>Elden Ring</em>. Unlike its slow, plodding predecessor, the spin-off is a battle royale-influenced loot race in which sessions see an entire Soulsborne experience condensed into just 45 minutes. It takes some getting used to, and players are already coming to grips with <em>Nightreign</em>’s notable hostility to explaining itself, even for a FromSoftware game. And while it does allow for offline solo play, its steep difficulty curve—more of a right angle really—heavily rewards group play and coordination. </p><p>“If you don’t have 2 other friends to play with in voice chat, don’t waste your time,” wrote Steam user Hishamm. “Game is <em>Elden Ring</em>, but 3p, and the solo queue is abysmal.” “Gameplay itself seems fun but I can’t possible leave a positive review if a game released in 2025 has no way to communicate in a coop game (neither voice nor text chat),” wrote Lynni. “Impossible to make progress without voice chat,” wrote Vahit Horoz. “If you have 3 friends you can talk to and play regularly, you will have a great time, the connection is smooth, the map is full of events and the game loop is very interesting.”</p><p>The game currently has a Steam rating of 65 percent, making it the lowest-scored FromSoftware release on the platform outside of <em>Dark Souls III</em>’s <em>Ashes of Ariandel</em> DLC. The reviews are full of complaints about the lack of duos (you have to either play alone or with a three-stack) and how matchmaking with strangers often leads to people randomly running around the map without coordinating, a task made harder by the lack of communication tools outside of pings and emotes. I think that might even out in the days and weeks ahead as players learn the basics of the randomized<em> Nightreign</em> map and how much more efficient you are together than split up, but the lack of modern multiplayer features is a real issue. </p><figure id="" data-id="193e46e0697b78f994a60384db271918" data-recommend-id="image://193e46e0697b78f994a60384db271918" data-format="png" data-width="2256" data-height="888" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows negative Elden Ring Nightreign reviews.

Nightlord bosses are practically impossible at the moment for all but the most experienced and hardcore <em>Elden Ring</em> loners. A mysterious day-one patch alluded to balance changes and other improvements, but didn’t spell out exactly what those changes are. If FromSoftware does decide to dial things back a bit, it wouldn’t be the first time it’s made one of its games easier. The studio quickly made <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-erdtree-update-1-14-dlc-radahn-boss-nerf-1851645615&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-erdtree-update-1-14-dlc-radahn-boss-nerf-1851645615"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s final boss</a></span> much easier when it kicked everyone’s ass last summer. We’ll see if <em>Nightreign </em>eventually takes mercy on players without friends as well. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Maybe they’re just an Illuminate plant after all, ready to control Super Earth from within. The beauty of <em>Helldivers 2</em>'s fascist space satire is that nothing is ever quite out of the question. </p><p>May kicked off one of <em>Helldivers 2</em>'s biggest balance patches and content updates in some time, including a new Warbond battle pass with additional melee weapons and the ability to level up and customize most of the shooter’s guns. I wouldn’t bet on any other big updates anytime soon. That said, Summer Game Fest is just around the corner and Arrowhead used host Geoff Keighley’s last big gaming showcase to announce the addition of the Illuminate to the fray. Who knows what’s in store for the second half of <em>Helldivers 2</em>'s second year?</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
