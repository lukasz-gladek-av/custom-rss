<p>The Mini PC’s 24 GB of LPDDR5 RAM provides you with enough memory for background processes and multitasking, allowing you to switch between creative software programs, internet browsers, and instant messaging windows with ease.

              <p>LEGO sets are a great way to bring your favorite moments and characters to life at home, brick by brick. If you’re a Star Wars fan looking to build your very own collection of iconic pieces from a galaxy far, far away, the LEGO Star Wars The Dark Falcon set is worth considering.</p>
<p>It’s the evil version of the widely loved Millennium Falcon, and the set comes with six minifigures. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5792/">Amazon has slashed this buildable starship by 16%, offering it for $152 today, down from $180. Delivery is free, so there are no extra charges to pay.</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Attention to Detail</h2>
<p>This hyperrealistic toy vehicle set comes together with a total of 1579 pieces. It’s not exactly a small build, as it focuses on tiny details that matter. The set is great for Star Wars fans of all ages, whether it’s kids just getting started or adults who know every line of dialogue by heart.</p>
<p>Minifigures include Darth Jar Jar, Bounty Hunter C-3PO, Darth Dev, Darth Rey, Beach Luke, and Jedi Vader. The attention to detail here is seriously impressive. This ship features a removable cockpit for two LEGO minifigures, two spring-loaded shooters to target enemies, two rotating cannons, a gunner post for two LEGO minifigures, and a radar dish. The top panels flip open to reveal the detailed interior, where you can place Darth Jar Jar on his throne, or help Jedi Vader rescue Beach Luke from the jail cell. There’s even an entertainment area, a command center, a hyperdrive, and bunk beds, along with fun (yet important) accessories like lightsabers and a blue milk carton – all of which bring your favorite scenes from the movie to life.</p>



<p>Once made, the buildable Star Wars starship toy measures over 5 in. (12 cm) high, 17 in. (43 cm) long, and 12.5 in. (32 cm) wide. You can place it in your living room, children’s playroom, or even your office. It’s going to turn heads and leave the visitors impressed!</p>
<p>The set comes with a detailed booklet, which includes step-by-step building instructions with visuals. It’s quite easy to follow, but if you need more assistance, you can download the LEGO Builder app on your smartphone. This one offers 3D instructions and even lets you zoom in on the blocks to understand the build better.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5792/">To wrap it up, if you’re looking to bring a piece of the Star Wars universe home, the LEGO Star Wars The Dark Falcon set is an excellent option to consider</a>. It typically goes for $180, but you can now grab it for $152. You can also pair with another set from LEGO’s Rebuild the Galaxy collection for a fuller setup, such as 75388 Jedi Bob’s Starfighter and 75393 TIE Fighter &amp; X-Wing Mash-up sets. We’re spotting quite a few options going for less, and are covering the top deals worth your money. These can even make great Valentine’s Day gifts if your partner loves Star Wars!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/google-pixel-buds-pro-2-see-their-first-price-cut-in-weeks-no-need-to-wait-for-airpods-pro-to-drop-2000665817</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The last time we saw Google’s Pixel Buds Pro 2 at a price this low, it was during an Amazon post-holiday sale. So now that these AI-enhanced buds that earn high marks for comfort, overall sound, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7045/">especially Active Noise Cancellation are back down to just $179 at Amazon</a>, that would make this a post-post-holiday sale? The semantics don’t matter, just the bottom line, which in this case is $50 off a really solid pair of buds.</p>
<p>The Pixel Buds Pro 2 were one of the top audio tech drops of the second half of 2024, winning headlines by being the first earbuds to feature Google’s Tensor processor chip and by integrating AI into their Active Noise Cancellation, with amazing results. Stronger base, smoother treble, and a secure but comfy fit round out an exceptional package.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7045/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Comfort Is King</h2>
<p>Google must have known they were creating buds that would lend themselves to long-haul listening sessions, because they really leaned into the comfort aspect when they designed the Pixel Buds Pro 2. They’re light even for earbuds, and they have the innovative twist-to-adjust stabilizer feature that lets you turn them one way for the most secure fit, and then turn them back for longer wear. The more-secure fit is perfect for workouts, runs, or other active periods, and it doesn’t compromise overall comfort.</p>
<p>In either fit configuration, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 have truly outstanding ANC, with a helping hand from Google AI and Google’s Silent Seal 2.0 feature. The Silent Seal helps to lock out external noise, and the AI boost adjusts the noise cancellation up to three million times per&nbsp;<em>second</em>, resulting in twice the noise cancellation power of Google’s previous model. With the outside world blocked out so effectively, the improved bass and treble delivered by the Pixel Buds Pro 2’s 11mm drivers comes through crystal clear.</p>



<h2>Versatility Plus</h2>
<p>The Pixel Buds Pro 2 find ways to be useful virtually all day long. As workout companions the snug yet comfortable fit and noise cancellation are key, along with IPX4 water resistance. The redesign to create the Buds Pro 2 included beamforming mics and wind-blocking mesh covers to help with phone calls, and the Buds Pro 2 switch seamlessly between devices, especially if they’re all from the Google Pixel family. Automatic switching from ANC to Transparency mode is built in with the Conversation Detection mode that keeps you from having to pause your tunes or content when someone is speaking to you.</p>
<p>The original $230 price on the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 has mostly held firm since their September 2024 debut, with the occasional dip here and there. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7045/">The return to $179 happening now at Amazon is a holiday price during a non-holiday season, and a great opportunity to upgrade your earbuds to Google’s best model.</a></p>

            <guid>1426384</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Now, this isn’t the cheapest the Nintendo Switch has ever been. Heck, even as recent as last summer, it’s MSRP was lower than this rate. Nintendo raised the prices of its previous generation Nintendo Switch console following new tariffs implements by the United States imposed on hardware like this. The base model Nintendo Switch, which originally launched at $300, is now sold for $340 new. Though the Amazon deal brings it back down by $42.</p><div>
<article dir="auto" data-turn-id="request-WEB:a27e9b51-0223-42bc-9c27-f84763eca532-0" data-testid="conversation-turn-2" data-scroll-anchor="true" data-turn="assistant">
<div dir="auto" data-message-author-role="assistant" data-message-id="bf23df5a-d6d3-48e6-b257-2e2f68b0b0af" data-message-model-slug="gpt-5-2">
<p data-start="0" data-end="421">Diving into an eight-year-old gaming console might feel a little odd at first. This past summer brought the arrival of Nintendo’s next generation hardware with the Switch 2, and the industry’s attention has naturally shifted forward. Still, the original Nintendo Switch remains one of the strongest consoles the company has ever produced, and it offers an enormous backlog.</p>
<p data-start="423" data-end="897">The system’s first-party lineup alone is reason enough to jump in. <em data-start="490" data-end="521">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> became a cultural moment during the 2020 lockdown, providing calm routines and gentle creativity to players across the globe—and it even received a new update just last month.</p>


<p data-start="423" data-end="897"><em data-start="648" data-end="689">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> redefined open-world design, while <em data-start="725" data-end="747">Tears of the Kingdom</em> expanded that formula into something even more ambitious. Together, they deliver hundreds upon hundreds of hours of exploration, experimentation, and quiet wonder.</p>
<p data-start="899" data-end="1209">The Switch also shines as a home for independent developers. Titles like <em data-start="972" data-end="981">Celeste</em> and <em data-start="986" data-end="1000">Sea of Stars</em> draw inspiration from the Super Nintendo era, pairing nostalgic visuals with modern design sensibilities. These games feel handcrafted, challenging, deeply personal, and are perfect for portable play.</p>
<p data-start="1211" data-end="1569">Support for the console hasn’t slowed to a crawl either. Two of the most celebrated indie releases on the platform, Supergiant Games’ <em data-start="1345" data-end="1352">Hades</em> and Team Cherry’s <em data-start="1371" data-end="1386">Hollow Knight</em>, both received sequels the end of last year. <em data-start="1427" data-end="1437">Hades II</em> and <em data-start="1442" data-end="1467">Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> are fully playable on the original Switch so late adopters&nbsp; can still get fresh experiences alongside classics.</p>
<p data-start="1571" data-end="1695" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">For anyone who skipped this generation, the Nintendo Switch still offers a rich, rewarding library waiting to be discovered and with the current $42 discount, now’s a great time to hop in.</p>
