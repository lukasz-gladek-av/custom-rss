" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Mix Summer Showcase ran over 90 minutes and offered quick looks at dozens of upcoming games. Formerly known as Guerrilla Collective, the showcase is one of many indie events swirling around the orbit of Summer Game Fest, and unlike many of the bigger games getting shown off in the days ahead, some of these have playable demos right now while others are likely getting them in the weeks and months ahead. </p><p>We picked out nine that caught our eye. Some of them were being shown for the first time. Others were previously revealed but had gone under our radar since, or popped up with fresh trailers showing a deeper look at story, world-building, and gameplay. But there were a ton more games worth checking out and wishlisting in the full showcase. You can see all of them for yourself in the video below. </p></div></div><div><p>The most intriguing reveal was a tactical RPG from a small studio called Hypersect led by a former <em>Destiny</em> sandbox gameplay engineer, an <em>Octopath Traveler </em>monster artist, and the composer of <em>Enter the Gungeon</em>. <em>Never’s End</em>’s pitch? <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> collides with city management as you raise an army of possessed warriors to protect the last human settlement from a magical apocalypse. There’s no release date yet but it’s coming to PC and PlayStation. </p></div><div><p> <em>Airframe Ultra</em> looks like <em>Wipeout</em> meets <em>Twisted Metal</em>. It’s got a slick PS1 presentation and a gritty vibe that would fit right at home on a long-lost demo disc. It’s the newest project from<em> Rain World </em>maker Videocult so it will probably be uncompromising in every way. </p></div><div><p>Rig dice to beat evil billionaires at their own deranged games. That’s the basic premise of <em>Dead Finger Dice</em>, a point-and-click roguelike about gambling with ghouls and trying to escape the yacht they’ve imprisoned you on. It’s giving <em>Inscryption</em> meets<em> Cryptmaster</em> if they were made in MS-DOS. A survival horror spin on <em>Balatro</em>? Let’s go. </p></div><div><p>The gardenvania subgrene expands with Beauty Cult’s <em>Nectarmancer</em>, a gorgeous-looking action platformer that doubles as a farming sim. Grow crops and fight in tight 2D spaces as you try to take down The Throne, a mysterious cabal exploiting the world’s resources for its own gain. Here’s the line from the Steam page that sold me: “Use a network of plants and their latent nectarmancy to build up a planet-scale biological research computer to acquire even more nectar.” Yes. Yes I will. </p></div><div><p>At first glance I thought <em>Critterrupters</em> was an<em> Animal Crossing</em> clone but it’s actually more like<em> Pokémon</em>. Go from 3D exploration to 2D turn-based augmented reality battles with a focus on interrupting your opponent’s attack to gain an advantage. There’s over 100  Critter Chips to collect, train, and “puzzle out” with the goal of defeating gym leaders and meeting the creator of the virtual Tamagotchi-based warriors. </p></div><div><p>Motorslice is an atmospheric parkour adventure in which you wall-run and slash your way through a futuristic construction site with the vibe of <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> inside a mega city. Think indie, PS2-era <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> with a sword and heavy machinery boss fights. There’s a bit of a Tarkovskian undertone. <em>Prince of Persia</em> is also an influence according to the developers. Should I just keep name-dropping cool stuff?</p></div><div><p>A boomer shooter segment near the end of the showcase included a bunch of experimental first-person shooters, but <em>Moros Protocol</em> has been in production for five years and is the one that stuck out to me. The sci-fi roguelike combines <em>Doom </em>and <em>Dark Souls</em> for a low-poly fever dream that supports co-op. “And yes, you can kick your enemies,” the devs write. </p></div><div><p><em>Nocturne </em>is a story-focused JRPG that uses rhythm gameplay for its combat. <em>Rock Paper Shotgun</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/chrono-trigger-meets-guitar-hero-was-not-on-my-bingo-card-but-ill-take-it-regardless&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/chrono-trigger-meets-guitar-hero-was-not-on-my-bingo-card-but-ill-take-it-regardless" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">likened it to</a></span> “<em>Chrono Trigger</em> meets <em>Guitar Hero</em>.” It might not end up an all-time classic like those, but the pixel art and soundtrack are pretty neat. What’s it about? “Your consciousness was uploaded to a world where a sentient AI has taken control, twisted creatures roam the land, and a vast corruption spreads.” An increasingly relatable predicament!</p></div><div><p><em>Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road </em>mixes and matches elements from lots of popular genres, including city builders and arcade-y bullet hell grindfests. The neat thing here is that the city you grow travels around and turns into a weapon itself, unleashing hell in <em>Vampire Survivors</em>-style horde mode onslaughts. There’s a closed beta happening later this summer. <br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
