              <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> gets a seasonal delay just when fans have started souring on the game. The makers of Warhammer have tried gen AI and they’re “just not excited about it.” Eidos Montreal is making an AAAA blockbuster. Hopefully, <a href="https://kotaku.com/skull-bones-review-xbox-1851281255">it’s better than <em>Skull and Bones</em></a>.</p> <p>Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. It’s 2026 and all my kids want to do is play <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em>. And not even the 2025 remaster but the original 2009 game on Xbox (thank you backwards compatibility). They have not touched any of the games I bought them for Christmas. This is why the console gaming industry is struggling.</p>

 <h2><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s next update gets a one month delay</h2> <p>The best-selling new shooter has been slipping. Community sentiment has been less than great. REDSEC in particular has Some Problems. It sounds like EA wants to take some extra time to recalibrate things before launching season 2. “During our ongoing development, we’ve continued to review community feedback and, in order to keep our promise, determined that our best path forward is to extend Season 1 and give ourselves extra time to further polish and refine Season 2,” it wrote in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-and-redsec-season-1-january-update">a new blog post this week</a>.</p>

 <p>Season 2 will launch on February 17 instead of January 20. That will be four months with only two new maps. And if the new maps aren’t <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/ea-delays-battlefield-6s-next-season-a-month-to-further-polish-and-refine-season-2-and-the-only-words-i-want-to-hear-next-are-bigger-maps/">Big Maps</a>, then none of it will probably matter anyway. <em>Call of Duty</em> is no longer an annual release, it’s an ongoing platform. <em>Battlefield 6</em> is trying to do that on the fly at launch and it’s clearly being stretched thin. Instead of a one-month delay to make good on its current content promises, it probably needs to dig in and focus on servicing the one part of <em>Battlefield 6</em> that matters most. At least for now. And that’s probably Big Maps.</p>

 <h2>Eidos Montreal’s next game will be “AAAA” and made in Unreal Engine 5</h2> <p>That’s according to a recent developer resume discovered by <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/2011272772551614666" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Timur222</a>. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/edios-montreal-aaaa-game/"><em>Insider Gaming</em> reports</a> that this project has been in development as far back as 2019 and has cost the studio a lot of money. It’s definitely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-deus-ex-game-pitched-by-eidos-montreal/">not</a> a new <em>Deus Ex</em> game either, sadly. The Embracer-owned Canadian studio shipped<em> Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy</em> in 2021 and hasn’t launched a solo project since. It has done co-development on several Microsoft projects in the years since, including <em>Grounded 2</em> and<em> Fable</em>, while also facing multiple rounds of layoffs.</p>

 <h2>The makers of <em>Warhammer</em> promise absolutely no GenAI</h2> <p>Games Workshop CEO Kevin Rountree addressed the controversial tech in a recent earnings meeting following a very lucrative quarter. “We do have a few senior managers that are [experts on AI]: none are that excited about it yet,” he said, as reported <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-maker-games-workshop-bans-its-staff-from-using-ai-in-its-content-or-designs-says-none-of-its-senior-managers-are-currently-excited-about-the-tech">by<em> IGN</em></a>. “We have agreed an internal policy to guide us all, which is currently very cautious e.g. we do not allow AI-generated content or AI to be used in our design processes or its unauthorized use outside of GW including in any of our competitions. We also have to monitor and protect ourselves from a data compliance, security and governance perspective, the AI or machine learning engines seem to be automatically included on our phones or laptops whether we like it or not.”</p>

 <h2>Steam Machine verification will be easier than for Steam Decks</h2> <p>“One easy rule of thumb is that if your title is Verified on Steam Deck, it will be Verified on Steam Machine,” Valve designer Lawrence Yang told <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/steam-machine-verified-requirements-will-have-fewer-constraints-than-steam-deck-says-valve"><em>Game Developer</em></a>. He says creators hoping for a “Steam Machine Verified” badge can expect “fewer constraints” than on the current handhelds. Hopefully that means a smoother process but also badges that are actually <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-verified-valve-ff7r-avowed-ninja-gaiden-2000637741">more useful than some of the current Steam Deck ones</a>.</p>

 <h2>The <em>Blood of Dawnwalker</em> will let you sex vampires, probably</h2> <p>I missed this detail from the dark fantasy RPG’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pa0S8c_gp7M">New Game+</a> showcase interview (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-3s-former-lead-quest-designer-says-of-course-there-is-romance-in-upcoming-vampire-rpg-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-you-can-expect-to-build-relationships-with-characters/"><em>PC Gamer</em></a>), but romance will be a part of the upcoming game from <em>Witcher 3 </em>devs.</p> <p>. “There are romance options, yes,” director Mateusz Tomaskiewicz said. “We didn’t delve deep into with <em>whom</em> yet, and I’ll leave that for the future to talk about. However, yes, you can expect to build relationships with characters.” I think folks are sleeping on this one a bit. It’s one of my <a href="https://kotaku.com/2026-game-releases-most-anticipated-batman-gta-6-wolverine-2000656197">most anticipated releases of 2026</a>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-layoffs-division-3-massive-tencent-2000659368">Ubisoft devs who were politely asked to lay themselves off last year now forced to do it in latest round of cuts</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/meta-game-quest-vr-facebook-deadpool-sanzaru-twisted-pixel-layoffs-2000659376">The teams behind<em> Deadpool</em> and other VR games were laid off by Meta as it chases AI</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-final-hours-videos-clips-stream-2000659367"><em>Anthem</em> is dead and fans are still grieving what might have been</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <title><![CDATA[Ex-BioWare Dev Explains How Anthem Could Live On As A Single-Player Game]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/anthem-single-player-offline-mode-bioware-ea-mark-darrah-2000659773</link>
            <guid>1405711</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-final-hours-videos-clips-stream-2000659367"><span>been officially wiped off the face of the Earth</span></a><span> for two days now, and Mark Darrah, an ex-BioWare producer who worked on both the ill-fated looter shooter and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569"><span>the </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>series</span></a><span>, has released a nearly four-hour postmortem on the game and how it all went wrong. If you care at all about the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-bioware-dragon-age-mass-effect-1851786136"><span>RPG developer’s odd live-service detour</span></a><span>, it’s a pretty interesting watch, but there’s one thing of note we’re going to focus on: </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>could have had local servers that would have allowed it to live on even after EA had abandoned it.</span></p>  <p><span>At the end of Darrah’s video, he starts to give a soft pitch for how </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>could live on and maybe even see a bit of that fabled </span><i><span>No Man’s Sky </span></i><span>redemption arc that BioWare was hoping for when it announced it was revamping the game in 2019.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>He says that his idea would “conservatively” run EA about $10 million, and if that should sell more than 400,000 copies, it could actually work out for everyone involved. To start, he suggests moving </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> to current-gen consoles, rather than leaving it on PS4 and Xbox One, and using locally-hosted servers. Apparently, BioWare had local servers running in a development environment “up until a few months before launch,” and while he doesn’t know if they still work, the code is there and can be recovered.</span></p>

 <p><span>“The reason you do this, it pulls away the cost of maintaining this game,” Darrah says. “So rather than having dedicated servers that are required for the game to run, you let the server run on one of the machines that’s playing the game.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Hearing that BioWare, at some point in development, had the tools in place to save </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> from its fate actually gives me a mix of sadness and anger for the devs and fans who wanted the game to go on existing, even if it wasn’t going to be supported with future updates. BioWare’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-servers-still-up-shut-down-bioware-ea-1851785618"><span>reasoning for shutting the game down without an offline mode</span></a><span> was that it was “designed to be an online-only title,” but now we know that there were, at one time, tools in place to remove all the server costs from EA’s shoulders, and that it just chose not to use them. Killing the game off is certainly the more straightforward approach, but it’s also far more destructive.</span></p>

 <p><span>Darrah goes on to suggest that most of the hypothetical $10 million budget would go into making </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> a single-player game, which would require creating AI party members to accommodate the game’s combat encounters which are balanced for multiple players. He suggests either promoting some of the NPCs to companions, or just making three to five new characters that could go through the existing story alongside you with their own stories. He even says that if EA really wanted to do it for cheap, go with the bare minimum amount of new party members by capping it at three so they just fill out your four-player party.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“If you can do those two things and turn the local servers on and give them a little bit of their own storytelling, that what you have essentially reverse-engineered is a BioWare game without romances with a decent BioWare-style story with companions that can be played as a single-player game,” Darrah says. “And I think there are a significant number of people who enjoy BioWare stories who did not play </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> because they didn’t want to play a multiplayer looter shooter who would be interested enough in seeing that story to pick that game up and give it a try.”</span></p>

 <p><span>As nice as it sounds, Darrah says he has no faith that EA would do something like this, even if it were a relatively cheap lift compared to running the servers forever. It’s annoying to know that </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>could still have lived on in some form, but at least we know definitively that EA and BioWare pissed in our ears and told us it was raining.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/if-youre-prime-and-a-gamer-asus-rtx-5070-plunges-to-near-record-low-on-amazon-2000659476</link>
            <guid>1405675</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re preparing to put some of your holiday cash to work by building yourself a gaming PC, stop. Before you lock yourself into a mediocre graphics card that will mess up your whole rig, check out this Amazon deal on <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6203/">the ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5070 card, which is just $540 for a limited time</a> (down from $609). That goes double if your dream DIY rig is going to be on the smaller side — we’ll explain why.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6203/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Anyone who’s ever built a gaming rig from scratch or performed a massive overhaul to upgrade an older machine knows — or should know — the two things they absolutely cannot compromise on: the processor and the graphics card. The latter can be a real challenge if you’re looking to build a compact yet seriously potent rig, because graphics cards that are small in size also tend to be small in performance. But the ASUS RTX 5070 is a 2.5-slot model that’s small form factor-friendly, which means it can fit in a smaller chassis while packing enough power to blow away virtually all the other SFF-ready cards.</p>
<h2>Secret Weapon</h2>
<p>The RTX 5070 is basically a unicorn: powerful enough for modern gaming, cool and quiet enough for daily use, and trim enough to slide into smaller chassis without fuss. That’s a sweet spot for any DIY gamer, especially when you consider the&nbsp;12 GB of GDDR7 memory, you’re looking at a card that beats up mid/high-tier textures and takes their lunch money.</p>
<p>That extra memory isn’t just a numbers flex that looks good on a spec sheet — it actually matters when modern games start leaning hard into photoreal lighting and other next-gen features that lesser cards won’t be able to keep up with. Coupled with PCIe 5.0 support, you’re set up for a smooth ride across a wide swath of titles and workloads for years to come.</p>



<h2>Keep It Cool</h2>
<p data-start="4446" data-end="4979">A compact rig chassis runs the risk of heat issues — smaller container, less area for heat dissipation. Or smaller components running super-fast — and super-loud — cooling units. The RTX 5070 has ASUS’s Axial-tech cooling design, with a tighter fan hub and longer blades that push air more effectively while keeping noise in check — perfect for a living-room PC that doesn’t sound like a hurricane.</p>
<p data-start="4981" data-end="5403">Thermals and noise aside, performance is where this card quietly flexes. For 1440p and even 4K gaming with some settings toggled just right, the RTX 5070 handles itself admirably. Games look great with DLSS tricks up your sleeve, and the triple display outputs (DP 2.1 + HDMI 2.1b) mean you can drive multiple panels without the headache of wrestling with adapters and dongles.</p>
<p data-start="4981" data-end="5403">With ASUS packing the RTX5070 with advanced features and Amazon knocking the price down for a limited time to just $540, the SFF-ready ASUS PRIME GeForce RTX 5070 is the deal you can’t afford to ignore if you’re planning on building your own rig or upgrading an old one.</p>
