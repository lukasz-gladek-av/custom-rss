And boy have I been treated of late, with the incredible <em>Mr. Mercedes</em>, the pleasingly chilling <em>Castle Rock</em>, and HBO’s too-quickly-abandoned <em>The Outsider</em>. Now MGM+ has delivered the first two episodes of the latest adaptation, <em>The Institute</em>, and my feelings are much more subdued.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195928" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="190" data-playlist="195928,197589,197586" data-current="195928"><div><p>How Alan Wake 2 Builds Upon The 'Remedy-Verse'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195928/195928_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21446.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Of course, Stephen King TV series overall have a pretty poor hit rate. It’s hard to imagine a more dreadful mutilation of a wonderful story than all three laugh-out-loud terrible seasons of <em>Under The Dome. </em>Or the stupefying awfulness of 2017's small-screen version of <em>The Mist</em>, a show so bad you were always on the fog cloud’s side. And that’s before we even start thinking about all those 90s TV movies and miniseries—<em>The Stand</em>, anyone? But there’s always potential, as proven by the 2010-2015 run of Syfy’s <em>Haven</em>—a delightful and breezy mystery procedural barely based on novella <em>The Colorado Kid—</em>and 2021's <em>Chapelwaite</em>, in which Adrien Brody brooded his way through a melancholic horror based on <em>Jerusalem’s Lot</em>. And I’ll give any of them a fair chance, given all will be based on the deeply developed characters of King’s literary works.</p><p>Well, almost all. Because of all of King’s recent books, <em>The Institute—</em>the story of a hidden facility that kidnaps psychic kids and puts them through awful procedures—felt the most insubstantial. The author, now in his late 70s, is still capable of writing fresh, compelling, heart-capturing stories—as he keeps proving over and over with his recent muse, recurring character Holly Gibney. But <em>The Institute</em> was so slight, feeling like a compilation of Kingly tropes: the disillusioned cop, the magic child, the evil matriach. Part <em>Firestarter</em>, part <em>The Dead Zone</em>, it read to me <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/stephen-king-the-institute-mgm-tv-series-trailer-1851784311&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/stephen-king-the-institute-mgm-tv-series-trailer-1851784311">like the pilot episode of a TV series</a></span>. Whereas I normally come away from a Stephen King novel feeling a deep attachment to its cast, I finished that book without any great fondness for main characters Luke Ellis and Tim Jamieson.</p><figure id="" data-id="10bbabfddcdc95147edd78cec07282d4" data-recommend-id="image://10bbabfddcdc95147edd78cec07282d4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1828" data-height="1029" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tim chats to the cashier in a gas station." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tim chats to the cashier in a gas station." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->MGM+ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="10bbabfddcdc95147edd78cec07282d4" data-recommend-id="image://10bbabfddcdc95147edd78cec07282d4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1828" data-height="1029" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tim chats to the cashier in a gas station." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Which brings us to the new TV series. From MGM+ (previously Epix), the show has an eight-episode run, of which the first two are currently available to stream. MGM+ may not have even been on your radar as a subscription service worthy of your monthly tithe, unless you’ve already discovered <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/from-mgm-lost-tv-show-horror-mystery-1851659337&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/from-mgm-lost-tv-show-horror-mystery-1851659337">one of the best things on TV, <em>From</em></a></span>. But one show does not a streaming service make, and this year’s atrocious <em>Earth Abides</em> didn’t help. Clearly <em>The Institute </em>is partly an attempt to build on <em>From</em>’s foundations, given directorial duty has been given to Jack Bender, the <em>Lost</em> alumnus who has given that other horror series such a distinct and compelling aesthetic. Bender is one of the best directors in television, and his distinctive style is immediately present here.</p><p>And thank god, given it followed the most extraordinarily terrible opening credits. I realize this is a weird thing to get stuck on, but in this era of prestige TV where two-minute-long opening sequences contain some of the most extraordinary art and animation, <em>The Institute</em>’s look like they were made in the ‘90s, rendered even worse by the accompaniment of a plaintiff rendition of Tears For Fears’ “Shout,” whiningly sung by The Lumineers—clearly a desperate attempt to match <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg0QBuXU_TM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rg0QBuXU_TM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>From</em>’s opening number</a></span>, The Pixies’ incredible cover of “Que Sera Sera.” (The only acceptable whining version of “Shout” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV_7LoLbFzs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VV_7LoLbFzs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was on <em>Psych</em></a></span>.) The dissonance between <em>The Institute</em>’s amateurish opening sequence and the familiarly glossy Jack Bender zooming crane shot of a perfectly lit school gymnasium that immediately follows was jarring.</p><p>The program then follows the format of the novel, in which alternating chapters tell two completely disconnected stories for a surprisingly long time. We have the kidnapping of Luke Ellis (Joe Freeman), a teenage boy with burgeoning telekinetic powers, taken to the titular Institute where he meets the handful of other child captives and the mercenary adult staff. Then there’s Tim Jamieson (Ben Barnes), a middle-aged former cop who’s “retired” after he shot and killed an armed teenager while off-duty and not sober. Hitching a ride after giving up his seat on a plane to New York City, he finds himself in a small town, DuPray, South Carolina, where he takes on the anachronistic (and entirely fictional) role of a “night knocker,” a police-adjacent patrolman, walking the town at night to check for crime. It’s only by the second episode that we even learn they might be in the same vicinity.</p><figure id="" data-id="1586429cd260bfbc3aebd37512063d7b" data-recommend-id="image://1586429cd260bfbc3aebd37512063d7b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1874" data-height="1054" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Luke talks to Ms Sigsby in her dreary office." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luke talks to Ms Sigsby in her dreary office." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->MGM+ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1586429cd260bfbc3aebd37512063d7b" data-recommend-id="image://1586429cd260bfbc3aebd37512063d7b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1874" data-height="1054" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Luke talks to Ms Sigsby in her dreary office." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If anything, <em>The Institute</em>’s loyalty to the source material is its biggest weakness. The novel always felt strange given the sparsity of its population. The Institute itself has just four kids in its huge rooms and lengthy corridors, outnumbered by the still tiny staff. The kids who are already there when Luke arrives talk like veterans of the place, having gotten so used to their incarceration, separation from their parents, and the experiments being performed on them, that you imagine their stay must have been years—except it quickly becomes clear it’s only been a matter of a couple of weeks.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jamieson’s calm and unhurried arrival in DuPray is constantly undermined by these deeply awkward exposition dumps, just in time for something to happen to the relevant character. This grows to the point of farce in the second episode, in which a gas station employee we’ve never met before suddenly delivers an entirely unrequested history of his entire life (he’s a very well-educated immigrant who escaped from being tortured overseas, now working minimum wage in the U.S. but delighted by his freedom...), literally seconds before a gunman runs in and shoots him. It’s so hackneyed and rushed that it feels like a spoof, one of those “Don’t worry darling, I’ll be back from the war before our baby’s born and just in time to deliver the vital medicine to our daughter!” scenes.</p><p>This is all such a shame, because the cast and the direction is working so very hard. Joe Freeman delivers a subtly complex performance as a genius child who’s clearly on the spectrum, and Ben Barnes is...well, he’s outrageously rugged and charming, his eye twinkling alone deserving of all the Emmys. Julian Richings is always a reliably sinister actor, with his gaunt, skeletal face doing half the work of establishing his malevolent character, and Jason Diaz immediately captures the terrifying mood-flipping nature of Institute tough guy Tony. Best of all is Mary-Louise Parker (<em>Weeds</em>) as Ms. Sigsby, the apparent boss of the facility (although the power structure is immediately made unclear), her character constantly walking the line of sanity. (Fun fact: Mary-Louise Parker and Ally Sheedy are two entirely different people.)</p><p>It’s interesting to note that Jack Bender has clearly brought in a few favorites, too. Robert Joy plays the Institute’s main scientist, fresh from his role as Henry in <em>From </em>(although I cannot get over how much, with his pencil moustache, he looks like a Kevin McDonald character from <em>Kids in the Hall</em>), while <em>Lost</em>’s Frank Lapidus, Jeff Fahey, appears in a very mysterious role.</p><figure id="" data-id="3e476ab53f4faa2b59461561bce39026" data-recommend-id="image://3e476ab53f4faa2b59461561bce39026" data-format="jpg" data-width="1835" data-height="1032" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Luke wears probes on his head as he's experimented upon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luke wears probes on his head as he's experimented upon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->MGM+ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3e476ab53f4faa2b59461561bce39026" data-recommend-id="image://3e476ab53f4faa2b59461561bce39026" data-format="jpg" data-width="1835" data-height="1032" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Luke wears probes on his head as he's experimented upon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The problem is, there’s so little that actually matters. Not in that, “Oh god this show’s so slow” way that is a little too prevalent in streaming right now—things move along at a fair clip, Bender never one for long, brooding quietness—but rather that what everyone says and does feels so rote, so formulaic, and rarely progresses the story. You’ll never guess, but the kids with psychic powers want to escape the facility! So they’re going to discuss that. And that handsome ex-cop? Well, he just wants to be left to be lovely and perfect all the time, but there are all these people and incidents. A bunch of stuff happens, but none of it propels the plot. And, having read the novel, I’m all too aware how little propulsion is ever going to be on offer—not least because the book ends on what feels like should be the opening of a much more interesting tale.</p><p>I hope that what’s coming across is my frustration that <em>The Institute</em> isn’t <em>better</em>, rather than that it’s bad. A lot of extremely competent people have made this show, and that’s apparent throughout—but given the thinness of the book, it feels like this could have been an opportunity to develop those ideas, to let the novel actually be the pilot, and see this series progress things much further. More characters, more momentum, more <em>everything</em>.</p><p>On the other hand, weirdly, the show has entirely abandoned the core metaphor the book was allegedly about. It never <em>really</em> comes across from the page, but King said at the time (2019) that he was responding to America’s anti-immigration policies that saw kids locked in cages, separated from their families, treated inhumanely. If the novel ever resonated with this, it was in exploring how the adults in the Institute could ever be able to behave as they do, to treat children so callously, but certainly in the first two episodes of the adaptation this isn’t a factor at all. We see moments of Ms. Sigsby’s bizarre private life, and that will get deeper as things progress, but the rest of the adult cast just feel like cartoon villains. The kids are far more interesting, but horribly under-developed, reduced to “The One Who...” roles. </p><figure id="" data-id="d55769f98eef0abc842355539e7226d8" data-recommend-id="image://d55769f98eef0abc842355539e7226d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1632" data-height="918" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tim stares confused, in the dark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Tim stares confused, in the dark." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->MGM+ / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d55769f98eef0abc842355539e7226d8" data-recommend-id="image://d55769f98eef0abc842355539e7226d8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1632" data-height="918" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Tim stares confused, in the dark." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’m going to keep watching. But don’t take that as a reflection of the show’s quality; I watched every single episode of <em>Under the Dome</em>, after all. <em>The Institute</em> is a vastly better show than that, but it’s so far entirely without menace. Like the book it’s based on, it’s slight, undercooked, and fails to convey a real sense of threat. Also, given it’s attempts to ride <em>From</em>’s coattails, it’s also woefully lacking in mystery. Sure, they keep referencing “keyholes,” but they might as well be saying “Care Bears” for all the intrigue it’s establishing.</p><p>I really hope things can speed up in the next six episodes, that it can find some meat to chew on, but I think to do so it’s going to have to step away from the book it feels too beholden to—and that doesn’t seem particularly likely.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/the-institute-stephen-king-tv-series-mgm-from-lost-1851786460]]></content:encoded>

At the same time, we’ve also seen a <em>lot</em> of drab sets with pull-rates that ensure you’ll get <em>something</em>, while making the most desirable full-art cards near impossible to collect. Then, during fall 2024, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">everything got out of control</a></span>. The hobby saw a new surge of interest, driven by skyrocketing prices made vastly worse by scarcity caused by scalpers, and ever since it’s been close to impossible to buy a new pack of Pokémon cards from the store without waiting in line, or engaging in a fist fight. Multiple attempts to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771">thwart scalpers have failed</a></span>, and even pre-ordering a new set months in advance is now a lottery. Unless you want a pack of the entirely unloved Twilight Masquerade. Everywhere has that poor set.</p><p>It’s into this furore that the English-language’s first ever split set is launched. Black Bolt and White Flare are two overlapping sets of cards, each with their own unique Pokémon and cards, released as a so-called “special set” to finish off the <em>SV</em> generation. Except, “special set” actually means, “harder to buy for some reason,” where packs are only sold as part of collection boxes, or in Elite Trainer Boxes, with no single packs available (unless you go to a canny specialist store, that’ll strip the collection boxes down for their packs), and certainly no 36-pack booster boxes. Then, released as a split set, it’s twice as hard to collect all the cards you might want, given you not only need to be able to find any at all to buy, but you also need to be sure to get the right half of the collection. Yay?</p><h2 id="h695657"><a id=""></a>All 156 Pokémon from...Unova?</h2><p>Black Bolt and White Flare feature all 156 Pokémon from the Unova region, as featured in the 2010 <em>Pokémon Black</em> and <em>White</em> video games. Why? Gosh that’s a good question.</p><p>Obviously, if you’re a fan, you’ll know the set features fan-favorite Legendary Pokémon Zekrom and Reshiram. And then, um, oh dear. Look, if 2010 was your entry into the hobby, then I imagine the Pokémon within have a special place in your heart. But looking back across all the new monsters, it’s surely by far the worst. Filled with deeply unimaginative creatures, like three different evolutions based on flipping ice cream and a second pigeon-based pocket monster, I struggle to muster passion for such a derivative set. Oh, and it also forced Pansear, Pansage and Panpour on us, three creepy-faced monkey-things in a game that was already just fine with Aipom.

Pull rates are tricky to convey at this point, because  Black Bolt and White Flare are packed with so many twiddly extras that you’ll inevitably get <em>something</em> out of a couple of packs. Because, oh my, there are so many variants here.</p><p>There are new holo Energy cards that show up pretty frequently, and then the most egregious array of reverse holo versions of every card. So, for every Basic Pokémon (the ones with the small window art on the top half), there are <em>four</em> different versions. The regular, the standard reverse holo, then a Poké Ball holo pattern, and <em>then</em> a Master Ball holo pattern. This means to complete a master set, you’ll need to collect a ridiculous 800 cards, and also be a billionaire scalper who lives in a Pokémon card factory.</p><h2 id="h695658"><a id=""></a>What about pull rates?</h2><p>To give you an idea from my unscientifically small sample of 35 packs (very kindly supplied by The Pokémon Company, and roughly half Black and half White) I pulled a gratifying seven full-art cards (six Illustration Rares, one Ultra Rare full-art Trainer), four standard ex cards, eight holo Energies, 14 Poké Ball holos, and one Master Ball holo. And written down, that might sound like a really impressive haul. But given just how common Poké Ball variants clearly are, they immediately didn’t feel special, and the Energies are much the same, while ex cards have been bland throughout the last three years. So, it’s really only those seven full-arts and the Master Ball that felt like special pulls. Still, eight out 35 is vastly better than we’ve seen from other sets, and not to be sniffed at.</p><p>The other side, however, is that this meant I didn’t see a single Special Illustration Rare at all, from either Black Bolt or White Flare, meaning those 18 valuable cards must be incredibly tough to find. Obviously I could have just gotten unlucky, but if they’re really fewer than one in 30 or so, that’s going to be grim.</p><p>The collection sets themselves are pretty nice. The poster collection’s poster is just <em>enormous</em>, while the binder collections come with a top-quality 3x3 side-loading binder, featuring either Reshiram or Zekrom. ETBs have nine packs of either Black or White, depending on the box, while the two-pack mini tins have one of each. As ever with Pokémon, everything is super-good quality, none of the extras feeling like tat.</p><figure id="" data-id="d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-recommend-id="image://d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The black Zekrom card everyone will want." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The black Zekrom card everyone will want." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-recommend-id="image://d6cca7a72cc1d603d025be40d82cd6f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The black Zekrom card everyone will want." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But, you know, I’m left feeling a lot of anticlimax.

I do hope so. But if not, then Black Bolt and White Flare is a pretty naff way to end things. If you can find it, you’ll likely pull something glittery out of it, but given it’ll be a Unovan Pokémon, won’t add anything radical to the table-top game, and is extremely unlikely to be rare, it’s hard to get all that excited. The sets are available from Friday, July 18.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/black-bolt-white-flare-pokemon-tcg-scarlet-violet-1851786465]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The battlefield just got a whole lot bigger. <em>Off The Grid</em> officially launched on Steam today, meaning players of the cyberpunk battle royale game can now compete across devices to be the last avatar standing.</p><p>Set in a dystopian universe crafted by Hollywood filmmaker Neill Blomkamp—who directed <em>District 9</em>, <em>Elysium</em>, <em>Gran Turismo</em>, and more—<em>Off The Grid</em> was initially released for early access back in October of last year. The free-to-play title has steadily gained popularity since that time, thanks to its fluid third-person shooter gameplay, vast array of looting possibilities, and consistent, thoughtfully crafted updates that keep the in-game experience fresh. Players are especially drawn to <em>Off The Grid</em>’s unique mechanic of switchable cyberlimbs, which grant special abilities and make each session feel completely different from the last. These cyberlimbs can be looted from the map, stolen from other players, or purchased through the player-to-player marketplace, offering a wide range of distinctive abilities and customization options.</p><p>“Every major step forward has been shaped by player feedback,” stated Vlad Korolov, the CEO and Co-Founder of Gunzilla Games. “This launch is a celebration of that collaboration, and it’s only the beginning.”</p><p>Founded in 2020, Gunzilla Games is an independent AAA video game developer that has continued to emphasize innovation and a “gamer-first ecosystem” that “pushes the limits of the games” industry. With <em>Off The Grid, </em>their first and primary title, Gunzilla seeks to bend and reshape the battle royale genre in bold, unexpected ways.</p><p>Unlike traditional battle royales, <em>Off The Grid</em> leans deeply into narrative depth. Players complete PvE missions within a PvP environment, so they might find themselves competing with—or against—others while pursuing their own objectives. This adds unpredictability and strategy beyond what’s offered with the standard shrinking-map formula. The result is a living, breathing world where actions have consequences for other online players, and no two sessions feel quite the same.</p><p>Meanwhile, the community “strands” that constitute the game’s DNA are reflected in frequent enhancements centered around performance, expanded maps, new swappable cybernetic limbs and weapons, and all-new game modes. Deathmatch and Solo Mode, for example, are designed to challenge different playstyles and encourage experimentation and creativity.</p><p>On Steam, <em>Off The Grid</em> is now available to the platform’s more than 130 million active users from every corner of the gaming universe, as it enables seamless cross-play among PC, Xbox, and PS5 gamers.</p><p>“Bringing <em>Off The Grid</em> to Steam is a major milestone for us,” said Korolov. “Not just because of the platform’s reach, but because it allows us to welcome an entirely new wave of players into [the] game.”</p><p>Steam’s powerful community integration tools align with Gunzilla’s aims for <em>Off The Grid</em>. From digital forums and user-generated guides to live broadcasts and support functions, the platform fosters a deeper, more meaningful level of engagement between developers and players. It also allows Gunzilla to gather instant feedback, monitor technical issues, and deploy improvements quickly, helping the team respond to user needs faster and keep the game evolving smoothly. That kind of real-time connection will be invaluable.</p><p>An additional benefit of <em>Off The Grid</em>’s presence on Steam is that the platform’s auto-update capabilities ensure that players stay synced with the latest builds. In effect, there are no patches, software updates, or downloads to chase, creating a hassle-free experience.</p><p>The cyborgs are calling. Whether you’re a first-time player or a seasoned veteran, get plugged in and go <em>Off The Grid</em>. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/off-the-grid-steam-neill-blomkamp-game-1851786461]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Obsidian’s gorgeous fantasy RPG <em>Avowed</em> just got a new patch, promising the usual list of bug fixes and some new features. The game is also now “Verified” for Steam Deck. What’s it like in a portable form factor? Well, it certainly boots up. It’s certainly <em>playable</em>, hitting a semi-decent 30 FPS that doesn’t necessarily feel <em>that</em> terrible to play. How it looks on Valve’s handheld PC, however, is another story. Have a seat, let’s talk about it. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196447,196663" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Set in an imaginative world with all the trappings of lush forests and pretty, sparkly magical effects, <em>Avowed</em> may not be aiming to be the most graphically impressive title out there, but it sure is a looker.

Sure, the statue is impressively in focus and clear, but I think this overall image takes away from the game’s ability to immerse you visually. It’s not how I’d recommend one experience <em>Avowed</em> unless this was your only possible option.</p><p>Have another look at the game on the same Deck: </p><figure id="" data-id="deb5d5578fb28263938cdd26b44334ee" data-recommend-id="image://deb5d5578fb28263938cdd26b44334ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist throws a Frost bomb at an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist throws a Frost bomb at an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="deb5d5578fb28263938cdd26b44334ee" data-recommend-id="image://deb5d5578fb28263938cdd26b44334ee" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist throws a Frost bomb at an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And here’s how combat looks: </p><p>We can go into the details. Distant objects look really messy, splotchy, shimmery, and sometimes pixel-art adjacent—in fact, it sorta reminds me of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/bVw1Mpb0QFo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/bVw1Mpb0QFo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">playing that <em>Oblivion</em> quest</a></span> where you’re stuck in a painting. It hovers at a 30-40 FPS status, which isn’t too bad, but the odd visuals, I think, actually make me play worse (I’m also used to playing this game on mouse and keyboard, not the gamepad layout of the Steam Deck, to be clear).</p><p>Yes, it will sorta settle down at times when rendering and FSR3 catch up, but it’s still not great. And the second you move, distant options look all crunchy and shitty again.</p><h2 id="h699273"><a id=""></a>What about the new class options and other features?</h2><p>I’ve been playing on the hardest difficulty in <em>Avowed</em> with a ranger-ish build that primarily uses rifles. Surprisingly, it feels like playing a first-person shooter more than something like <em>Fallout 4</em> did. My brain is sorta in <em>Doom</em> mode when I’m playing. While the game put up a tough fight early on, I eventually reached a certain level of power where I was annihilating everything. I’m also doing every quest and finding everything on every map, so my character has a lot of experience invested in her stats.</p><p>The fighter and ranger got new active and passive abilities. And the update refunded everyone’s skill points, so you can already get to trying out new builds. From the looks of things, this is only going to make me more unstoppable than I already am. The “Sharpshooter” ranger passive looks like it will make my pretty sweet rifle even deadlier. That said, abilities like “Shadow Step,” a previously NPC-exclusive ability that lets you vanish and appear behind your target, feel a little redundant since I can already go invisible. </p><p>I’m going to need to mix and match these new abilities for a while to judge just how transformative they are for a game I didn’t find that challenging anyway. So maybe I’m not the best judge of how helpful the new build options are. I’ll get back to you if something really blows my mind. You can read all the nitty gritty details of the patch, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134877-patch-15-notes/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134877-patch-15-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">includes some new weapons and attire, here.</a></span></p><p>Anyway, <em>Avowed</em> rocks. It’s a serious contender for GOTY in my book—just don’t play it running natively on Steam Deck if you can help it.
