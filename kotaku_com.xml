It turned out that the 2022 agreement wasn’t binding, but the 2023 one was, and yet we’ve nearly run out of 2024 and still nothing’s started! We’ve now learned that the intervening time was spent agreeing to “creative guidelines,” which is actually more fun than it sounds—see below. I hope it was done over a game, GW playing Space Marines, Amazon playing Cultists, and Henry Cavill running around the room going “Squeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!”</p><p>Back in 2022, poor, lovely Henry Cavill announced he was leaving Netflix’s adaptation of <em>The Witcher</em> to reprise his role as  Superman, moments before <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/henry-cavill-warhammer-40k-witcher-superman-amazon-1849903568&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/henry-cavill-warhammer-40k-witcher-superman-amazon-1849903568"><em>Black Adam</em> bombed so hard</a></span> that it destroyed the entire DC cinematic universe. James Gunn took over the franchise and made clear Cavill wasn’t part of his vision, and the actor was left standing at the altar, droopy flowers in his hands, his former fiancée now hooked up with Liam Hemsworth.</p><p>But then in swooped <em>Warhammer 40K</em> to sweep him off his feet, although it’s been a very drawn-out engagement. While today’s announcement at least confirms that projects can finally go ahead, the GW statement concludes, “Production processes in respect of films and television series may take a number of years.”</p><p>Meanwhile, over on the less corporate face of the company, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/c2ngqfgb/major-update-on-amazon-studios-warhammer-stories/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/c2ngqfgb/major-update-on-amazon-studios-warhammer-stories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Warhammer Community</em></a></span>, there’s a story that better details what’s happening right now, and what the last year entailed. They explain,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Well, it means we now have synopsis and ordering for the stories we’re going to tell... yep, we said <em>stories</em>! It might have taken a year but it was a year well spent! And what fun - sifting through the enormity of the Warhammer 40,000 universe, debating characters, story arcs and the thematic grit that underpins it all.</p></blockquote><p>“Enormity” is probably not the right word, unless they <em>really</em> hate it, but what splendid news! It wasn’t all lawyers and eyebrows, but proper planning to get a whole bunch of different shows (and maybe movies?) out of the license. </p><p>Next up, the site says, is scripts. The average time spent in a writers’ room for a prestige streaming show at the moment is around eight months, before anyone touches a camera or a paintbrush, so it doesn’t seem likely that filming would begin before 2026. While Amazon’s speedy turnaround on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-amazon-prime-macaulay-culkin-1851693027&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-amazon-prime-macaulay-culkin-1851693027"><em>Fallout</em> season 2</a></span> offers some hope we won’t all be living on vast spaceships by the time it’s out, the post also says “It’ll be some years.” It adds,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Of course, as with all carefully crafted things, this all takes time... and trust us when we say, everyone involved is las-focused on getting it all <em>just right.</em></p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Henry Cavill posted on Instagram to say how thrilled he is. </p><p>“My incredible team and I,” the actor said, “alongside the brilliant minds at Games Workshop, have been working away in concept rooms, breaking down approaches to the enormity and magnificence of the Warhammer world.” Again, not what enormity means, but I can rise about this. “Together, we’ve been sifting through the plethora of incredible characters and poring over old tomes and texts. Our combined efforts have led us to a fantastic place to start our Universe, which has been agreed upon by those up on high at both Amazon and Games Workshop. That starting place shall, for now, remain a secret. Watch this space, though—more to come in time!”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Out June 20, 2025, the movie stars Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Jodie Comer, and a ripped Ralph Fiennes, among others.</p><p>The most effective part of the trailer is a recitation of Rudyard Kipling’s  poem “Boots,” about marching during the Second Boer War in South Africa. “Try—try—try—try—to think o’ something different—Oh—my—God—keep—me from goin’ lunatic!” the voice over goes. “(Boots—boots—boots—boots—movin’ up an’ down again!) There’s no discharge in the war!”</p><p>The biggest mystery about the movie might not be why the rage virus is back, but what Murphy’s role will be. The central protagonist of the first movie, he’s set to appear in the third film but it’s not exactly clear how. In a split-second near 1:47 in the trailer there’s an emaciated zombie body that looks like Murphy, rising out of a field of wild flowers. Maybe he’s infected. Maybe he’s found a way to overcome the virus.

He later appeared as Scarecrow in Christopher Nolan’s Batman movies and the hit series <em>Peaky Blinders</em>. Murphy returns to the zombie franchise after winning an Oscar for his performance last year in <em>Oppenheimer</em>. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-patch-notes-doctor-strange-portal-ult-1851717418<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Marvel Rivals </em>is just under a week old and has already got its first big patch. NetEase’s update doesn’t have any balance changes, instead being focused on bug fixes. However, there’s slight overlap, as one glitch the patch fixes effectively gives the Vanguard Doctor Strange a bit of a nerf. That’s because fans had discovered a way to immediately charge the Sorcerer Supreme’s ultimate ability to full with just one well-placed portal.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20241210/41548_1199072.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20241210/41548_1199072.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">full patch notes</a></span> run down all the bugs and fixes squashed in the update, several of which are mundane things like players getting caught in a map’s geometry or graphical hitches. But the big one is a change to Doctor Strange’s ultimate charge that specifically addresses any environmental kills the character pulls off. A common strategy for Doctor Strange players is to create a portal in front of an enemy spawn room and have it open up above a hole on the map so your foes fall to their deaths. Due to an apparent glitch, this would boost Doctor Strange’s ultimate charge to nearly 100 percent.</p><p>As a temporary fix, NetEase is disabling the portals’ terrain kill attribution, meaning that the game will not register these deaths as Doctor Strange’s kills. As such, a Strange player will not receive any of the passive benefits like ult charge or scoreboard kills for this strategy. NetEase says it will be reinstating those benefits in a future update, but only after it has been able to address the ultimate charge bug. It’s a slight bummer, but portals are still effective in getting an easy team kill.</p><p>The full patch notes read as follows:</p><h2 id="h89402"><a id=""></a><strong><em>General</em></strong></h2><p><em>· When playing highlights and recordings, crosshair deviation would be significant, and there was a possibility for lag. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· Changing where Highlights were saved would cause the game to crash. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· Players joining a Quick Match as a replacement may not be able to see heroes’ equipped costumes. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· Mission progress on the Season Event screen would not display correctly. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· Fixed some textual errors. More fixes will be coming in a future update.</em><br><em>· After a crash, the game had a chance to freeze for a long period of time before closing. This issue has been resolved, and now the game will close after crashing.</em><br><em>· Fixed some relatively common crash issues. </em></p><h3 id="h89403"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Maps &amp; Game Modes</em></strong></h3><p><em>· On certain maps (particularly Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven and Klyntar: Symbiotic Surface), special collisions on the edges would cause the player’s character to become stuck or clip through and enter strange areas. These issues have been largely resolved, but as this affects multiple maps and areas, this bug may be present elsewhere. We will work to continue fixing such issues and develop a solution to thoroughly prevent them.</em></p><p><em>· In the foggy areas of Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda: Hall of Djalia and Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda: Birnin T’Challa:</em><br><em> - Fog would disappear from Hela and Storm’s perspectives when they activated their Ultimates. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em> - After Jeff the Land Shark was revived while in the fog, his teammates and enemies would not be able to see the special effects of Joyful Splash. This issue has been resolved.</em></p><p><em>· In Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven - Frozen Airfield:</em><br><em> - In Competitive, if a player was KO’d while moving near a target area, it would cause the lightings to behave abnormally. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em> - During matches, disconnecting and reconnecting could cause desynchronization of some doors (i.e., a door looked to be closed, but the player could walk through; a door looked to be open, but the player couldn’t walk through). This issue has been resolved.</em></p><p><em>· Hydra Charteris Base: Hell’s Heaven - Eldritch Monument:</em><br><em> - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Adam Warlock used his Ultimate, his teammates would potentially revive and be stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em> - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Thor or Loki were revived by Hela’s team-up ability, they would potentially revive and be stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em> - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Jeff the Land Shark used his Ultimate to devour characters, they would potentially become stuck beneath the terrain if they were right on the target area platform. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em> - When the target area is ascending or descending, if Winter Soldier hit an enemy with his Ultimate and they landed right on the target area platform, damage may be lost. This issue has been resolved.</em></p><p><em>· When switching between rounds in Competitive, if the destination was not the last stage of a map, it would cause the vehicle’s effective range to not display when it approached the destination, impacting determination of the effective occupation range. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· Upon reaching the third round in Competitive Convoy or Convergence, heroes had a chance to carry over their Ultimate energy from the second round. This issue has been resolved, and heroes will no longer inherit their Ultimate energy. </em></p><h3 id="h89404"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Heroes</em></strong></h3><p><em>· When Wolverine had his Deadpool &amp; Wolverine costume equipped, no ability voice lines other than the Undying Animal ability’s line would play.

This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· When Iron Fist used pings, the corresponding voice lines would not be triggered. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· The description for ADS sensitivity in Black Widow’s settings was incorrect. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· In certain situations, Black Widow’s Ultimate would not recover energy as intended. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· In certain extreme situations, Captain America’s Ultimate wouldn’t end as intended. This issue has been resolved.</em><br><em>· When Doctor Strange’s portals triggered terrain KOs, they would mistakenly restore Doctor Strange’s Ultimate energy. For now, we have disabled the portals’ terrain KO attribution to temporarily fix this issue (i.e., terrain KOs will not count toward Doctor Strange’s own KOs). Rest assured, this bug will be resolved in a future update, at which time we will restore the portals’ KO attribution.</em></p><h2 id="h89405"><a id=""></a><strong><em>PC</em></strong></h2><p><em>· Using FSR 3 frame generation technology to modify the resolution could cause memory leaks, resulting in blurry models.

That’s because <strong>you can only get Broken Weapons by digging in one of the four areas of the Mythopia biome</strong>.</p><p>Unfortunately, digging is one of <em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em>’s most tedious jobs, so you’ll be spending a lot of time just holding down your interact button as you watch your character dig holes. And since Broken Weapons share drop rates with coins and other materials that can be found while digging, you could get drops back-to-back or not see a single Broken Weapon after digging 20 times. </p><p>Because of this frustrating drop rate, you’ll thank yourself later if you bring along a digging companion who can make sure you get an extra Broken Weapon each time you find one. This will literally double the speed of your grind.</p><figure id="" data-id="0f30e28a14039457f2d9bc36064a196a" data-recommend-id="image://0f30e28a14039457f2d9bc36064a196a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Disney Dreamlight Valley's menu system shows the character's present inventory." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Disney Dreamlight Valley's menu system shows the character's present inventory." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f30e28a14039457f2d9bc36064a196a" data-recommend-id="image://0f30e28a14039457f2d9bc36064a196a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Disney Dreamlight Valley's menu system shows the character's present inventory." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Additionally, you can pair this task with building up your collection of cooking ingredients. Snag around 50 of each type of seed in <em>The Storybook Vale</em> and then dig for as long as you need to to score the amount of Broken Weapons you’d like. Afterward, plant and water all of those seeds.</p><p>Two birds, one stone! Now you have plenty of Broken Weapons <em>and</em> a solid start on getting all of the dishes made in your meals collection.</p><p>You’ll definitely want to keep at it and find as many Broken Weapons as you can, as this crafting material serves as an important part of finishing your crafting collection in <em>The Storybook Vale</em> as well. Plus, some of the furniture you can make with the item is pretty cool, and you wouldn’t want to miss out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
