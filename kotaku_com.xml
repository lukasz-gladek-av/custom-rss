              <p>The Switch 2 <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-impressions-launch-games-comparison-1851785748">has been out in the wild for several months now</a>, but we still know very little about what Nintendo has planned for its future. Could that be about to change? The next Nintendo Direct is reportedly planned for mid-September and seems poised to offer way more than just a deep dive into the company’s holiday lineup.</p> <p>While there’s a big Nintendo Direct almost every September, the company’s post-Switch 2 launch marketing has been all over the place. <a href="https://x.com/TheSwitchForce/status/1959828809559249019">A new rumor from SwitchForce</a>, however, claims a Nintendo Direct is planned for September 12. That’s a Friday, which would be a bizarre time for a Nintendo showcase. Perhaps that’s the Japan date, which would put the showcase during the late afternoon on Thursday, a much more believable time for a livestream. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-planned-for-mid-september/"><em>VGC</em> corroborated the broader claim</a> that Nintendo is holding a mid-September Direct, but was unable to specify the date. It’s possible Nintendo’s plans could still change.</p> <p>It’s worth noting that the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> for the NES arrived on September 13, 1985, making next month the franchise’s 40th anniversary. That would make a Nintendo Direct the perfect time to announce a new Mario-themed Switch 2, Switch Online multiplayer spin-off, the return of <em>Super Mario 3D All-Star</em>s, or something more. I’m hoping for an HD remake of <em>Super Mario Galaxy 2</em>.</p>

 <h2>Where is the Switch 2’s new 3D <em>Mario</em>?</h2> <p>Fans are also still waiting on a release date for <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-red-samus-trailer-date-switch-2-1851772697"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a>, which Nintendo continues to affirm will come out in 2025. With <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-horror-trailer-creepy-2000619530"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> coming in October and <a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> in Novembe</a>r, December is looking like the only option at this point, unless the company can sneak out its new sci-fi shooter earlier than expected. There are still some Switch 1 games ripe for Switch 2 updates like <em><a href="https://x.com/MONOLITHSOFT/status/1959813021230149807">Xenoblade Chronicles 2</a></em>.</p> <p>As for what lies beyond this year, there are already some previously announced exclusives, like<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-duskbloods-elden-ring-hidetaka-miyazaki-switch-2-1851774753"><em> The Duskbloods</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-splatoon-3-raiders-upgrade-price-maps-1851784179"><em>Splatoon Raiders,</em></a> waiting in the wings. But Nintendo has yet to tease new arrivals in some of its biggest franchises, like <em>Animal Crossing</em>,<em> Super Smash Bros.,</em> and<em> The Legend of Zelda</em>. And then there’s Mario. Reports that the <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> team is a splinter group from the original <em>Mario Odyssey</em> team suggest the plumber’s next big platforming adventure could be just around the corner. Would Nintendo really let the Switch 2 go its whole inaugural year without a new <em>Mario</em> game?</p> <p>The company has seemingly spent the last few years of the Switch 1’s lifecycle saving up big releases for its new hardware. Maybe it’ll finally pull back the curtain on what some of them are next month.</p>
