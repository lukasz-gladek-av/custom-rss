              <p>LEGO makes a lot more than just toys for kids: This PAC-MAN arcade cabinet is an example of one of their adult-focused sets that are meant to be displayed rather than played with. This collectible, which is based on nostalgia, recreates <strong>the classic arcade experience from the 1980s with 2,651 pieces of real detail</strong> that both gamers and LEGO collectors will love.</p>
<p>During Black Friday,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6067/"> this set is only $188 on Amazon, down from $269</a> and it is a record-low 30% discount that beats all previous prices. Since it came out, the set has stubbornly kept its $269 launch price with only short sales bringing it down to around $230. This price of $188 is a huge change that will create a lot of value and cause buying frenzies as word spreads through LEGO and gaming communities.</p>

<h2>Bring 1980s Games to Life</h2>
<p>The <strong>functional 4-way joystick moves in a way that feels like real arcade controls</strong> with satisfying clicks as you change directions. The coin slot lights up when you press it, and the score display can be changed to show high scores that are special to you like personal gaming achievements or inside jokes. When you open the back panel, you can see the engineering magic that makes static bricks look like they’re moving.</p>



<p>The <strong>rotating display base has figures of PAC-MAN, Blinky, and Clyde</strong> that change direction and behavior when you press buttons which makes for dynamic presentations instead of static poses. As you move through the positions, watch characters switch from chase mode to fleeing mode, just like in the power pellet moment when the hunted becomes the hunter.</p>
<p>The <strong>1980s arcade scene with a gaming mini-figure gives the cabinet a sense of place</strong> in its cultural moment instead of showing it in isolation. The vignette captures the arcade atmosphere where kids fed quarters into machines for hours, bringing back memories for anyone who lived through that time. LEGO’s dedication to authenticity is shown in the way they style their mini-figures, choose their accessories, and add environmental elements.</p>



<p>The<strong> 12.5-inch height makes a big impression on a desk</strong> or shelf without taking over like huge sets with more than 5,000 pieces that are more than two feet tall. The size is perfect for office desks, where the cabinet shows that you like retro games without looking like a toy collection; bedroom shelves, where it goes well with other gaming memorabilia; or entertainment center displays, where it fits in with modern consoles.</p>
<p>The 2,651 pieces make for a satisfying level of building difficulty that<strong> takes experienced builders about 8 to 12 hours to complete</strong>, which makes it a good weekend project or evening building session that lasts for several days. This number of pieces strikes a balance between being fun and easy to get to.</p>
<p>The LEGO PAC-MAN Arcade is now 30% cheaper than the stubborn $269 price that has been in place since it came out, thanks to the record-low Black Friday price of $188. If you’ve wanted this set but didn’t want to pay the usual price, this Black Friday deal makes nostalgic LEGO engineering available before it sells out.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-doesnt-care-about-margins-on-echo-show-now-selling-15-smart-home-hub-at-pure-cost-2000648491</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Smart displays have come a long way since they were just voice assistants with small screens. Now, <strong>the Echo Show 15 is Amazon’s biggest effort to make a real home hub</strong>: This 15.6-inch Full HD display mounts on your wall like a digital bulletin board that actually earns its space, unlike the small 5-inch or 8-inch Echo Shows that work well on a nightstand.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6069/">you’re getting the newest model for $254 instead of $299, which is in line with Amazon’s Black Friday strategy of cutting its own hardware’s margins</a> to almost nothing. This is the lowest price ever for a device that lets you control your smart home, stream entertainment, organize your family and make video calls all in one place.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6069/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Kitchen Command Center That Works</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch Full HD display changes how you use information all day</strong> because it has enough space to show more than one widget at a time. You can quickly check your family calendar, the weather, your shopping lists, and your smart home controls without having to swipe between screens or ask Alexa to read everything out loud. The customizable widget system lets you put the most important information for your family front and center, so you can find it quickly. This<strong> setup is great for kitchens where you need to check the schedule</strong> while cooking or for mudrooms where everyone needs to see the day’s schedule before they leave.</p>
<p>This is a <strong>real streaming device because it has built-in Fire TV functionality</strong>: It doesn’t just play content through voice commands with limited controls. You can use the included Fire TV remote to navigate Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube, Apple TV, and thousands of other apps in the same way you would on a regular TV. The picture quality is surprisingly good for casual viewing, like when you’re cooking dinner or doing the dishes.</p>



<p>When you can see and tap controls on a big screen instead of remembering voice commands or getting your phone out, controlling your smart home becomes a lot easier. You can see all of your connected devices on the dashboard at once. With just a few taps, you can turn off several lights, change the temperature, or check the feeds from your security cameras. You can see your front door, backyard, or kids’ rooms clearly on live camera feeds without having to squint at a small screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>auto-framing camera with 3.3x zoom and a wide field of view that keeps you centered in frame</strong> as you move around makes video calling a lot better. You can really cook and talk to family members at the same time without making them look at your ceiling or cutting yourself out of the picture. The noise-canceling technology gets rid of the sounds of blenders, running water, and other kitchen chaos that usually makes calls hard to hear. What’s more, the <strong>built-in shutter gives you physical privacy</strong> when you want to turn off the camera completely.</p>
<p>You get here a device that can stream, control your smart home, organize your family, and make high-quality video calls for only $254. That’s less than what you would pay for many standalone tablets and this price is only possible because Amazon cut its margin on Black Friday.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-cuts-watch-se-3-price-beyond-original-plan-garmin-and-samsung-went-so-low-apple-had-to-react-2000648479</link>
            <guid>1367842</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This is the first year that Apple has put all of its Watch models on sale at the same time on Black Friday: This includes the rugged Watch Ultra model for extreme sports, the standard Series models, and the SE models that are focused on value. This all-encompassing sale strategy gives people access to Apple’s wearable ecosystem in ways that have never been possible before, since Apple usually keeps prices high except for short promotional periods (and mainly on Amazon).</p>
<p>Since this morning, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6066/">the price of the Apple Watch SE 3 with 44mm GPS (and sport band) on Amazon dropped from $279 to $229</a>. This is the lowest price ever with an 18% discount that makes it a good choice against affordable Samsung and Garmin watches at similar prices. Amazon went above and beyond the usual Black Friday discounts, making the Apple Watch SE 3 the <strong>best-selling smartwatch on the main Black Friday day</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6066/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Always-On Display</h2>
<p>The <strong>always-on Retina display is the SE 3’s biggest improvement</strong> over the SE 2: It gets rid of the need to raise your wrist which made previous models feel half-functional when you just wanted to check the time. It also means that you can check notifications during meetings without the obvious wrist flick that says you’re looking at your watch, or keep track of your workout metrics without waking up the screen by making big movements.</p>



<p>The <strong>temperature sensing lets you look back at ovulation estimates</strong> by taking nightly wrist temperature readings that show patterns that point to fertile windows. This makes natural family planning tools or fertility awareness that dedicated ovulation trackers offer at similar prices. The <em>Vitals</em> app combines temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and sleep data into unified health dashboards that show patterns that individual metrics don’t show. <strong>Daily sleep scores measure the quality of your sleep</strong> by looking at how long you sleep, how consistently you sleep, and how your body works.</p>
<p>The new <strong>battery lasts 18 hours on a single charge and has an always-on display</strong> so you can use it all day, from waking up to going to sleep, without having to charge it in the middle of the day, which makes sleep tracking impossible. Fast charging gives you 8 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes, so you can quickly charge it up while you shower or get ready in the morning. The battery lasts twice as long as the SE 2’s and the new charging architecture makes it charge twice as fast.</p>
<p>The <strong>Apple Intelligence-powered Workout Buddy looks at your past workouts to give you personalized coaching</strong>, changing goals, and real-time support that keeps you motivated during tough sessions. The feature learns how well you usually do and changes its suggestions based on that, so you don’t get the unrealistic goals that generic fitness apps give you without knowing what you can really do.</p>



<p>The <strong>crash and fall detection features use data from the accelerometer and gyroscope</strong> to look for serious impacts or dangerous falls. If you don’t respond after an incident, they will automatically call emergency services. The safety features are especially useful for people who do things alone, like running on remote trails, biking on busy streets, or older people who are more likely to fall.</p>
<p>The record-low Black Friday pricing at $229 makes Apple’s latest Watch SE 3 model cost similarly to Samsung and Garmin alternatives but they offer better ecosystem integration, safety features and seamless iPhone connectivity that Android watches cannot match. The combination of always-on display, temperature sensing, 18-hour battery and Apple Intelligence features at 18% below retail creates exceptional value.</p>
