              <p>Ultra-wide is an understatement when describing this monitor. <strong>The Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 measures in at 49 inches</strong>. That very well might be the full length of your desk.

<h2>Lose Yourself in Super Wide Worlds</h2>
<p>This ultra-wide 49-inch display is essentially two monitors glued together side by side. It’s maximum display resolution clocks in at 5120 by 1440 pixels. The screen is curved at 1800R which better reflects our vision of the world around us. The super fast refresh rate of 240Hz will help you achieve fast framerates speeds. And with an input timing of 0.03ms, any lag between controller buttons presses and the action happening on screen will be pretty much imperceptible.

You won’t see any light bleed and be able to experience the color and depths of your games at their fullest potential.</p>



<p>You have a variety of choices when it comes to how you connect to the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9. It features ports for HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort, and USB Hub. You can be hooked up to all three with a custom gaming PC, a work laptop, and a tablet, then swap between inputs on the fly. It can detect when you’ve plugged in a new source or turned on a connected device, automatically switching inputs over to it so you can get into things right away. Heck, you can even choose to display video from two different sources side-by-side. Two different PCS can each take up half the screen with picture-in-picture.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3899/">For a limited time, Amazon has this absolute behemoth of a gaming monitor on sale for nearly half off.</a> The Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 49-inch display normally goes for $1,600. Right now, that’s down to just $900, saving your a whole $700.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Despite all of the hype, little is known about what’s actually in <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. Developer Team Cherry has been confidently tight-lipped about all of the secrets hiding inside it’s latest Metroidvania Soulslike. But a list of achievements and trophies for the sequel hints at just how much bigger than the original game it might be. The short answer: a lot.</p> <p>Before even playing the game you can look at a list of <em>Silksong</em>‘s achievements (or trophies on PlayStation 5). One in particular provides an interesting clue about the larger scope. As <em>Game File</em>‘s Stephen Totilo <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:fs2pfwz4ohuc7nhlshklw55d/post/3lxzeygtav22i?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fkotaku.com%252Fwp%252Fwp-admin%252Fpost-new.php">pointed out</a> on Bluesky, the “speed completion” achievement requires players to hit 100 percent completion in under 30 hours. A similar achievement in the first Hollow Knight only gave players 20 hours.<em> Does that mean Silksong</em> is roughly 33 percent bigger than its predecessor?</p> <p>Maybe!</p>    <p>Mind you, the above achievement is effectively for a 100 percent speedrun, not an average playthrough. Most players have taken <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/26286">around 27 hours</a> to beat <em>Hollow Knight</em>‘s main campaign and up to 64 hours to defeat every boss and find last secret. Assuming Team Cherry is keeping the completionist achievement in <em>Silksong</em> just as difficult to get, we might expect it to take, on average, 10-30 hours longer to do everything there is to do in the game.</p>

 <p>While just a speculative guesstimate, the assumption aligns with some of what Team Cherry hinted at <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-interview-delay-hollow-knight-team-cherry-2000619168">in their first and only pre-release interview</a>. When explaining why the sequel took seven years to make, the developers said part of the reason was that they just couldn’t stop themselves from continuing to add new things to <em>Silksong</em>: more towns, NPCs, boss fights, and seemingly many more secrets.</p> <p>Of course, if you’re a world record <em>Hollow Knight</em> speedrunner like Kyle “LoLNebula” Dodson, you still might be able to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9NSvKncZbMM">100-percent <em>Silksong</em> in just a few hours</a>. That includes collecting all of the upgrades, charms, and improvements, and fighting lots of bosses multiple times. In fairness Dodson, like lots of other <em>Hollow Knight</em> superfans, has had over eight years to practice.</p>

              <p>Good morning! I’m not sure why I’m even writing today’s Morning Checkpoint, as nobody is going to read today’s edition. <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-steam-eshop-crashing-twitch-game-pass-hollow-knight-2000623137">Instead, you’ll all be out there playing your fancy new <em>Silksong</em>.</a> Congrats to all of you. For the few of you <em>actually</em> here, today’s Checkpoint includes news about another long-awaited indie game, an update on <em>Wolverine</em>, some info on the development of the Switch 2, and our thoughts on Bloober’s next big horror game.</p> <h2><em>The Binding of Isaac</em> creator’s next game finally gets a release date</h2> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-binding-of-isaac-creators-mewgenics-finally-gets-a-release-date-almost-13-years-after-it-was-announced">After first being announced in 2012, <em>Mewgenics</em> finally has a launch date.</a> And you thought the wait for <em>Silksong</em> was bad! <em>Mewgenics</em>, which is an RPG built around breeding many cats, is being developed by Edmund McMillen, the creator behind<em> The Binding of Isaac</em>, and will launch on February 10, 2026, which is about 13 years after it was first revealed. Not only did McMillen reveal the game’s release date, but he also uploaded <a href="https://youtu.be/cAiIiju7lCo">a 50-minute-long gameplay demo</a> showing off how the game actually plays.</p>  <h2>Insomniac’s <em>Wolverine</em> game is reportedly showing up in a State of Play soon</h2> <p>We’ve not seen much of <em>Wolverine</em>, the next game from<em> Spider-Man</em> makers Insomniac, since it was revealed in 2021. Well, unless you count all the leaked gameplay floating around out there after the studio was hacked. But it seems like the wait for a new official look at the upcoming superhero game might be coming to an end. <em>Insider Gaming </em>reports that sources have told the outlet a trailer for <em>Wolverine</em> is ready, and many expect it to appear in a Sony State of Play later this month. Will he say “Bub?” One can hope.</p>

 <h2>Nintendo delayed the Switch 2 a few times to make sure it had good games ready</h2> <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-repeatedly-delayed-switch-2-at-designers-request-report/1100-6534465/">A new report from <em>Bloomberg</em></a> <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2025-nintendo-switch2/">about Nintendo and how it makes games</a> says that the Switch 2’s launch was held back because the people working on launch games requested extra time to “perfect” their titles. Nintendo apparently made this their number one priority and delayed the Switch 2 a few times to make sure the games it launched with were as good as could be.</p> <h2><em>Shinobi: The Art of Vengeance</em> on Switch is getting a resolution boost</h2> <p>People like that new <em>Shinobi</em> game a lot! But on Switch, the 2D action-platformer is a bit fuzzier than it should be. <a href="https://x.com/SEGA_OFFICIAL/status/1963129469373407429?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">Sega knows and is patching the Switch port</a> to “improve” <em>Shinobi</em>‘s resolution. Here’s their full statement:</p>

 <blockquote><p><span>In response to feedback from all players, we are currently developing an update patch to improve the screen resolution in the Nintendo Switch version of this title. Please wait a little longer until the patch is released.</span></p></blockquote> <h2>Someone added a Nintendo Cease and Desist into <em>Smash Bros.</em> as a fighter</h2> <p>Truly the greatest enemy in Nintendo history: A legal cease and desist issued by one of the company’s many lawyers. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-cease-desist-letter-is-now-a-playable-character-in-smash-bros-mod/1100-6534471/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f">Now someone</a> has brought this iconic and terrible creature, which has stopped many a great mod and fan game, into <em>Smash Bros.</em> as a playable character.

              <p>Nintendo Switch Online, the Switch subscription service with the deeply irritating name, is rearranging the furniture to try to make things make a bit more sense. For one, various libraries of emulated games from older Nintendo systems are now being designated as “Nintendo Classics,” while the Game Boy Advance section receives a couple of significant improvements.</p> <p>First and foremost, on Switch 2 your GBA games—dating from 2001 to 2010—will now apparently run in a far shinier 1080p even when playing in handheld mode. Now, clearly this sets up quite the battle lines between those who believe emulated games should be played at the scale and resolution that was originally intended, ideally on the cloudy-screened technology of its era, and those who like it when things look pretty. Of course, the app also gives you the option to both run the games in a teeny window, and to “reproduce classic feel” by adding a bunch of effects to make it look like it used to. Saying all this, I’ve updated my Switch 2 and I absolutely cannot get the games to run in 1080p, nor find an option for it, so that’s odd.</p> <p>However, what I can confirm as working is control remapping, which is a very welcome inclusion. The option was recently added to the SNES games, and with an exemplary level of precision. For instance, if you’re adjusting controls for <em>Mario Kart Super Circuit</em>, there are options to reassign controls as specific as “Throw Bananas Ahead of You” and “Shoot Shells Behind You,” letting, you move them wherever is most comfortable for you. (Except, of course, to the rear triggers, because annoyingly those are forcibly reserved for reaching the emulator menu.)</p>

 <p>All of the previous consoles’ games are now in their own section on the Nintendo Switch Online app, under Nintendo Classics with the same branding, which makes a lot more sense. NES, SNES, Game Boy, GBA, N64, and GameCube are in a neat row. Of course, rather irritatingly this <em>doesn’t</em> include any games certificated M, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-online-forsaken-64-mature-2000622653">today’s addition of&nbsp;<em>Forsaken 64</em></a>, for which you need a separate app—the catchily titled <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Nintendo-64-Nintendo-Classics-Mature-2592474.html?srsltid=AfmBOoo6In-dwQyKw2KJlbPqUOKk6izShDf_yoce7GWRsGTtNp86uikR">Nintendo 64 – Nintendo Classics: Mature</a>.</p> <p>Let me know if you get 1080p working. Perhaps I’m missing something embarrassingly obvious.</p>
