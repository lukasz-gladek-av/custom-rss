              <p>In a night filled with gory trailers for loud action games, one of the new reveals at The Game Awards stood out for its gentle nature: <em>Coven of the Chicken Foot</em>. The game defied almost every trend of the night: it was a single-player game, in a beautiful cel-shaded animation style, in which the main character is an elderly woman. This, it turns out, is the first new game from Bruce Straley, one of the co-directors of the original&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>, since he left Naughty Dog in 2017.</p> <p>In <a href="https://www.polygon.com/bruce-straley-naughty-dog-exit-interview/">an interview with&nbsp;<em>Polygon</em></a>, Straley spoke for the first time about his surprise exit from Naughty Dog, soon after shipping his last game with the company,&nbsp;<em>Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End</em>. After 18 years at the developer, Straley found himself struggling with a sense of repetition as the studio settled into making, you know, Naughty Dog sorts of games. (In the two decades prior, the company had also put out both <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> and&nbsp;<em>Jak and Daxter</em> games, before settling on the cinematic action of <em>Uncharted</em> and&nbsp;<em>TLOU</em>, the only game series Naughty Dog has released since 2007.)</p>

 <p>“I felt like I was answering the same questions over and over again,” Straley told <em>Polygon</em>. “We were kind of in this paradigm of this style of game—that I was part of creating! But it felt like I’ve been in this position before. My brain isn’t good with that type of repetition. I need new problems to solve, I need new creative outlets. I’m not saying there wouldn’t be opportunities there, but couple that feeling with the idea that I was working really, really hard at something that wasn’t mine.”</p>

  <p><em>Coven of the Chicken Foot</em><em>&nbsp;</em>is certainly a significant step away. The first game from Wildflower Interactive, a 16-person team established in 2021, it describes itself as an “emotionally rich, stylized, single-player adventure.” You play as an elderly witch called Gertie, accompanied by a peculiar creature who will learn from Gertie’s actions how to best assist her in their journeys through woods, dungeons and bogs. The claim is that this unnamed beast will be an NPC dynamically shaped by how you play the game.</p> <p>Elderly women are extraordinarily under-represented in video games, almost always confined to being evil antagonists—the only other example of a playable elderly woman I can think of is in Tale of Tales’ 2008 tiny game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/27020/The_Graveyard/"><em>The Graveyard</em></a> (which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/preview-the-graveyard">I loved</a>).&nbsp;<em>Coven</em> looks charming, if a little too close to&nbsp;<em>Ori </em>in its&nbsp;creature design (and vocal sounds for that matter) for my liking. There’s no release date at this point, but you can of course already <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3041680/Coven_of_the_Chicken_Foot/">wishlist the game on Steam</a>.</p>

            <guid>1381990</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Almost everyone has that one mysterious corner of the house where the internet simply refuses to cooperate. You step into that corner, suddenly your phone can’t load a webpage, your videos start buffering, downloads stall, and frustration sets in — especially if that dead zone happens to be somewhere you actually need reliable service, like the bathroom. We will not go back to reading the back of a shampoo bottle like they did in cave man times.</p>
<p>A Wi-Fi range extender is an easy and effective way to eliminate those annoying weak zones. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6367/">Right now, this Wi-Fi 7 one from TP-Link has been cut in price by 25%</a>. For a limited time, you can pick one up for just $90. It’s normally selling for $120, so you end up saving yourself both $30 and a lot of headaches of dealing with crap internet coverage.</p>
<p>With Wi-Fi 7 technology, you can enjoy incredibly fast download and upload speeds totaling up to 3.2 Gbps. That means smooth 8K streaming, lag-free online gaming, and a noticeably more responsive connection throughout your home. This TP-Link Wi-Fi 7 extender supports dual-band 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz signals, with the 2.4 GHz band delivering up to 688 Mbps and the 5 GHz band reaching up to 2,594 Mbps. Note that this particular model does not include support for a 6 GHz band. Also you’ll only reach these speeds if your router, modem, and plan with your internet provider reach those speeds as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6367/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Wi-Fi Coverage in Every Corner of Your Home</h2>
<p>This TPL-Link Wi-Fi 7 range extender can provide additional coverage in your home of up to nearly 2,400 square feet. Its two high-performance antennas work together to broaden and strengthen your wireless signal, helping it pass through walls and reach areas your router couldn’t reliably cover on its own. The extender also boosts your network’s device capacity, allowing you to connect as many as 64 additional devices at once. That means more room for your smartphones, smart TVs, streaming sticks, Alexa Echo units, security cameras, smart bulbs, and all the other connected gadgets you rely on every day.</p>
<p>The range extender employs smart adaptive roaming. This means you’re devices will automatically connect to whichever is the strongest signal in your home. So if you have your main router on the first floor, and then the TP-Link range extender is upstairs, your phone can shift between the two when you go up and down the stairs, moving throughout your home with no extra effort from you.</p>



<p>If you’re home is already working on a mesh network, great news. The TP-Link ranger extender is EasyMesh-compatible. It can work in unison with other EasyMesh-compatible routers or nodes to keep increasing the Wi-Fi coverage of your property.</p>
<p>With the right range extender, you can finally enjoy strong, stable Wi-Fi in every corner of your home.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6367/"> And now that the TP-Link Wi-Fi 7 range extender is on sale for 25% off, now’s a great time to upgrade.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[HP Adds Another 80% Off Laptop as Holiday Clearance Deals Continue on Amazon, Not Listed on Official Site]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/hp-adds-another-80-off-laptop-as-holiday-clearance-deals-continue-on-amazon-not-listed-on-official-site-2000651632</link>

              <p>Laptops (and PCs) don’t have to be massive or insanely expensive to get the job done. If you’re after a machine that takes care of all your everyday work and play-related tasks with ease, Amazon is letting you upgrade for under $500 right now; you read that right.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6197/">The 15.6-inch HP laptop, which would run you around $2,000 on a regular day, is currently going for $400</a>. That’s after the retailer took a whopping 80% off its retail tag. But as you’d expect, the deal is selling fast. Whether you’re looking to snap one for yourself or want to gift it to a student or work professional in your life this holiday season, now is a good time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6197/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Immersive Display, Reliable Performance</h2>
<p>Looks-wise, it’s a classic HP laptop. The sleek, lightweight design makes it ultra-portable, letting you carry it around easily wherever you go. The 15.6-inch screen is bright, while the 85% screen-to-body ratio offers a larger room to work and play on. You’ll enjoy crisp, vibrant visuals consistently (for movies, shows, presentations), and also won’t have to fight your own reflections when working in well-lit rooms. Translation? An immersive viewing experience that’s easy on the eyes, even when using the laptop for an extended period of time. Paired with the screen is a full-sized, soft grey keyboard with a numeric keypad to make typing long documents comfortable.</p>
<p>HP has packed the laptop with a 4-core Intel N100 processor that’s capable of hitting speeds up to 3.4 GHz with Intel Turbo Boost Technology. It does not make the machine a powerhouse, sure, but it’s still great for regular office work, study requirements, and post-work entertainment. There’s a 16GB RAM to keep everything running smoothly, and especially comes in handy when you’re trying to multitask through busy days. With this at hand, you’ll be able to use a bunch of different applications at the same time, keep a ton of tabs open on your browser, take some quick meetings, and more; without noticeable slowdowns that kill the momentum.</p>



<p>As for storage, it gets you a 256GB PCIe NVMe M.2 SSD, which can house your important work documents, some media files, and necessary programs. We won’t sugarcoat it; the storage isn’t massive, so if you’re someone with a massive library of heavier projects, it might not be sufficient for you. But for casual use, it does the job. Moreover, SSDs are much faster than traditional drives, so you’ll also enjoy fast boot and load times with this one.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth 5.3 wireless card, and a wide range of ports, including one USB Type-C, two USB Type-A, one HDMI, one headphone/microphone combo, and an AC smart pin. Some other features that deserve a mention are dual speakers and an HP True Vision 720p HD camera to make video calls a breeze.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6197/">There’s a lot more to like about this laptop, especially at its current price. You can grab it for just $400 right now, which is nothing considering all the features</a> it packs. If you’re looking for more memory and storage, there’s a 32GB RAM/1TB SSD version of the laptop available too, which is currently sitting at $600. Again, the deal expires soon, so it’s better to grab yours before that happens.</p>
