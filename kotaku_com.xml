Back in February <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-switch-mega-evolution-1851766684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-switch-mega-evolution-1851766684">we had our last chunk of information about this year’s Switch game, <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a></span>, but since then all has been tremendously quiet.

But instead of a build-up to some big reveal, there’s been silence since. Now, the Spearow-eyed Joe Merrick of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://serebii.net/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://serebii.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Serebii</em></a></span> has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/joemerrick.bsky.social/post/3lufiuhjqq22w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/joemerrick.bsky.social/post/3lufiuhjqq22w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spotted</a></span> that due to a slip-up by the official Korean Pokémon YouTube channel, we know that this edition will be a lengthy 24 minutes.</p><p>But 24 minutes of what? A big part of why things feel so quiet right now is that, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-scarlet-violent-sword-shield-switch-2-1851766786&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-z-a-scarlet-violent-sword-shield-switch-2-1851766786">at any point over the last fifteen years</a></span>, this would be the point in the three-yearly cycle where we’d be inundated with reveals of an all-new generation of pocket monsters, building up to the fall release of the big, new, mainline <em>Pokémon </em>game. Except, for reasons never announced, that’s not happened—we’re experiencing our first four-year gap in the franchise in ages. (God, I <em>hope</em> it’s just four years.) And while <em>Z-A</em> is looking intriguing, and we’ll definitely get a good look at it again tomorrow, one thing it isn’t going to do is add any new Pokémon to the roster.</p><p>So could this Presents be hiding some sort of tease for Gen X? I wish I could believe that, but I have my doubts. If there is going to be a new mainline game next year, all of history suggests it won’t be until around October, and starting reveals over a year early seems unlikely. Still, it’d be good!</p><p>What’s more likely is we’ll get updates for the array of <em>Pokémon</em> games already out there, including <em>Unite</em>, <em>TCG Pocket</em>, <em>Sleep</em> and the rest, as well as reveals for perhaps a couple of new mobile apps and games, and maybe a new multiplayer game. Oh, and something about <em>Horizons</em> season 2, perhaps. Perhaps more on the new season of the wonderful stop-motion <em>Concierge.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>The stream will start tomorrow, July 22, at 9 a.m. EDT, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/pokemon&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via the official YouTube channel</a></span>. And intriguingly, if you tune into the Japanese channel an hour earlier, there’s apparently going to be an hour of DJ Pikachu Live? I have no idea. But it could well be promoting a surprise reveal of a DJ-based game in the main event.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-legend-z-a-youtube-dj-pikachu-1851786626]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Now in it’s 12th year, the free-t0-play loot shooter <em>Warframe</em> is still going strong and the future looks bright coming off a whirlwind series of announcements and teases from TennoCon 2025. The multi-day event included details on new story expansions, new frames, and access to an alpha build for Digital Extremes’ fantasy spin-off, <em>Soulframe</em>. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,196181" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>There was also an update on <em>Warframe</em> for mobile, which is getting a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.warframe.com/android&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.warframe.com/android" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">closed beta this fall</a></span>, and of course every new <em>Warframe</em> expansion gets a new kick-ass song, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPKo04oNQ9k&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yPKo04oNQ9k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this year’s included</a></span>. Here are the five biggest takeaways from the annual fan extravaganza. </p><h2 id="h247313"><a id=""></a>Unannounced fall 2025 update will finally explain <em>Warframe</em>’s convoluted mod process to new players</h2><figure id="" data-id="3c4a6e9f04dc9b517f81e72144eddf53" data-recommend-id="image://3c4a6e9f04dc9b517f81e72144eddf53" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Warframes appear in art for the fall season.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Warframe</em>, like <em>Destiny</em>, is practically ancient by modern live-service gaming standards now, and it has acquired a number of systems that have become second nature to ongoing players but inscrutable to newcomers. One of those is the mod system, which features a lot of customization and crafting. </p><p>While Digital Extremes hasn’t dished on what its big fall update will include (more info is coming in a devstream on September 25), we do know it will have a new quest called Teacher that will onboard players to the game’s most important buildcrafting tool. Hopefully it’s a good onramp for everyone still looking for one. </p><h2 id="h247314"><a id=""></a>The next story chapter is called<em> The Old Peace</em></h2><p><em>Warframe</em>’s next expansion drops near the end of 2025 and will take players into the past to witness the game’s “most tectonic historical event,” known as “The Old War.” It’ll feature a visual overhaul to player controlled Tenno Operators and WWI-inspired trench warfare. </p><p>It’ll include a playable Excalibur Prime for one of the quests, Caliban Prime, new Sentient allies and enemies, the devil-inspired Warframe Uriel, and two new Protoframes. Most importantly, it’ll set the stage for something the game has never done before.</p><h2 id="h247315"><a id=""></a>2026 will takes players to the distant Tau star system</h2><p>Following the events of <em>The Old Peace</em>, players will, for the first time in Warframe’s history, be taken to the new Tau star system. It was a target for colonization within the game’s fiction long ago, with self-replicating terraforming machines called Sentients tasked with preparing Tau for inhabitation. What will await players there next year is anybody’s guess. </p><h2 id="h247316"><a id=""></a><em>Soulframe</em> is still years away but fans went hands-on with an early test build called <em>Preludes</em></h2><p>In addition to continuing <em>Warframe</em>’s legacy, Digital Extremes has also been busy with the fantasy-based spin-off <em>Soulframe</em>. An extended demo during TennoCon 2025 showed character customization and a player tracking a monster through the woods, using a combination of melee weapons, archer, and spells to survive various woodland threats. While fans were able to try out the pre-alpha <em>Preludes</em> build over the weekend, a lasting free demo sounds a bit farther away. </p><p>Will the game be ready before the end of 2025? That’s sounding less and less likely.  “It’s an aspirational goal,” community manager Sarah Asselin told fans during a Q&amp;A <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-alpha-prelude-access-2025-delay-2026&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soulframe-alpha-prelude-access-2025-delay-2026" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over the weekend</a></span>. “We’re looking at where we’re at by the end of the year, but we want to feel confident that we’ve built<em> Soulframe</em> out to the point where it feels good to do so, for the players and the developers.” </p><h2 id="h247317"><a id=""></a><em>Warframe</em>’s devs would love to make a Switch 2 version but still haven’t received a dev kit from Nintendo</h2><figure id="" data-id="eaf5981b80d6f1aaf29bba3e598ac81e" data-recommend-id="image://eaf5981b80d6f1aaf29bba3e598ac81e" data-format="png" data-width="1186" data-height="669" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Warframe characters appear on a Switch 2.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Fortnite</em>,<em> No Man’s Sky</em>, and other Switch 1 ports have started receiving upgrades for Switch 2. Will <em>Warframe</em>, which could certainly benefit from better performance on Nintendo’s handheld hybrid device, be getting a similar treatment? Not until Nintendo gives Digital Extremes a Switch 2 dev kit, apparently. Like lots of other big third-party developers, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1kbl11o/official_source_nintendo_switch_2_dev_kits_are/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1kbl11o/official_source_nintendo_switch_2_dev_kits_are/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s still waiting for the hardware</a></span>. </p><p> “Our tech team is so excited to take advantage of the high-speed cores and the other really cool features of it,” CEO Steve Sinclair said <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/tennocon-2025-everything-revealed&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tennocon-2025-everything-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">during a Q&amp;A</a></span>. “There’s just such a backlog for dev kits. So, yeah, if you know anyone…just one, that’s all it would take. I know our programmers are just, like, ‘Oh, I can’t wait.’ We definitely have plans. When we get a dev kit, we will be doing a custom build for <em>Warframe</em>. Absolutely.” </p><p>We’ll see what ends up coming out first: <em>Warframe</em>’s Switch 2 upgrade or <em>Soulframe</em>. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/warframe-soulsframe-switch-2-tau-trailer-tennocon-2025-1851786622]]></content:encoded>

The game—in which you play as space criminal Kay Vess, rushing around the galaxy committing acts of malfeasance—had “softer than expected” sales on release, which caused a huge drop in Ubisoft’s share value to the lowest it had been in ten years.</p><p>The causes of this were, of course, multi-factorial. The enormous game was buggy, had crappy stealth and lackluster space-based sections, and these significant shortfalls immediately hurt word-of-mouth. It also released into the worst of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avowed-microsoft-obsidian-anti-woke-dei-twitter-1851714901&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-microsoft-obsidian-anti-woke-dei-twitter-1851714901">2024's tiresome campaigning by the wannabe-Nazis of the alt-right</a></span>, with the game committing the twin crimes of featuring a central character who was both a woman <em>and</em> a person of color. Also, people were noticeably getting tired of Ubisoft’s repetitive formula across all its games, and <em>Outlaws</em> took the brunt of this. It was a whole bunch of stuff, but the game’s own failings were a significant part of it. What no one at all was saying was, “It’s because <em>Book of Boba Fett</em> wasn’t that great of a show.”</p><p>During the shareholder meeting, someone in the audience stood up to ask an interminable barrage of questions, during which he asked of <em>Outlaws</em>, “What have you learned from the failure in terms of sales? Have you learned anything in terms of pricing, in terms of marketing?”</p><p> Guillemot replied, “We didn’t reach our sales targets. The game suffered from a number of items.” The first of these he listed was that “the brand that it belonged to was in a bit of choppy waters,” stopping before explaining exactly what he meant by that. He then added that “the game still had a few items that needed to be polished,” rapidly adding that they received polish in the early weeks of release, but saying that it “did affect sales volumes.” Guillemot then described the upcoming Switch 2 port as “a new version of the game.”</p><p>His underplaying of the bugginess of the game, dropped in as an afterthought after attempting to throw the entirety of <em>Star Wars</em> under the bus, is just odd! Was this an attempt to lump the game in with Disney+ TV series <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-canceled-season-2-1851627217&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-canceled-season-2-1851627217"><em>The Acolyte</em></a></span>, which was also the target of a hate campaign from the organized bigots? While the movies had gone quiet since 2021, the TV series were otherwise flying high, with <em>Obi-Wan Kenobi</em>, <em>Ahsoka</em>, and of course the beloved <em>Andor</em> proving critical successes. And if the entire franchise is to blame, then why didn’t this affect EA’s 2023 title <em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em>? EA CEO Andrew Wilson described that game’s sales as “strongly” beating expectations, saying that EA was “overjoyed” with its performance. </p><p>Anyway, shareholders and stock values are the antithesis of creative pursuits, and <em>Outlaws</em> was a fine game released into a broken industry where only astonishing success is acceptable.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-ubisoft-ceo-shareholders-choppy-1851786615]]></content:encoded>
