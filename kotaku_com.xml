              <p>Hideo Kojima is celebrating ten years of his Kojima Productions company with a lengthy livestream and live show later this month. Beyond the Strand will take place on September 23 at the TOHO Cinemas Roppongi Hills in Toyko, and be livestreamed out to the gorgeous masses, where the developer promises “glimpses into future projects.”</p> <p>It’s a somewhat premature celebration, given Kojima Productions wasn’t officially founded until December 16, 2015, but it seems likely the&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear</em> creator is itching to speak about what his studio is working on now&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding 2</em> is out. So far, Kojima Productions has given us two&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em> games, but we know that <a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-productions-death-stranding-2-od-physint-1851661289/3">a horror game called&nbsp;<em>OD</em></a> is already in the works, starring the extraordinary Sophia Lillis (<em>I Am Not Okay With This</em>,&nbsp;<em>It</em>) and Hunter Schafer (<em>Euphoria</em>,&nbsp;<em>Cuckoo</em>), as well as&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear</em> spiritual successor,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/physint-kojima-metal-gear-ps6-release-date-od-1851781247"><em>Physint</em></a>.</p>  <p>However,&nbsp;<em>Physint</em> is thought to be at least five years away, and there hasn’t been anything to see of <em>OD</em> since the above announcement video. The latter experienced an eight month delay due to the SAG-AFTRA strike, but is now back in development. So could we be getting updates on these, perhaps even something in-game? Well, given Kojima’s preference for flair and mystery, footage seems unlikely. But given this is scheduled to be two-and-a-half hours long, there’s got to be&nbsp;<em>something</em>.</p>

 <p>There’s also word that Kojima is <a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-movie-a24-1851099101">making a movie based on&nbsp;<em>Death Stranding</em></a>, so perhaps there’s news to be revealed on that? Maybe even shots of Norman Reedus falling over on a hill? The developer has also hinted at other&nbsp;<em>DS</em> adaptations, although been incredibly vague about what they could be. There’s also <a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-productions-death-stranding-2-od-physint-1851661289/7">been word about other TV or film projects</a> ahead of <em>Physint</em>, but again, Kojima does like to announce things a lot more than release them.</p> <p>The only details about Beyond the Strand we have right now, beyond the “glimpses,” are that there will be “special guest appearances.” Geoff? Oh god, imagine if he&nbsp;<em>didn’t</em> invite Geoff. That’d be such a move.</p> <p>If you live anywhere near Tokyo, <a href="https://l-tike.com/cinema/mevent/?mid=763198">tickets for the event went on sale today</a>, September 2, via a lottery system. The livestream details will apparently be announced closer to the event. In the meantime, my absolute favorite detail is in the small print: “<span lang="EN-GB">We cannot be held responsible for any disputes between attendees.”</span></p>
