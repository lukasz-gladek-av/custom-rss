This was a PS2 and Wii game released in 2009 (a very late PS2 game) that wasn’t great and was quickly forgotten. But hey, it never got an Xbox port, so its sort of Sony’s own exclusive Indiana Jones game. It’s not as good as last years <em>Great Circle</em>, which will land on PS5 in 2025, but hey, its something! </p><hr><p>Anyway, here’s the full list of games being added to PS Plus and its various tiers next week:</p><h2 id="h5915"><a id=""></a>PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>God of War Ragnarök</em>| PS4, PS5</li><li><em>Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name</em> | PS4, PS5</li><li><em>Atlas Fallen: Reign Of Sand </em>| PS5</li><li><em>SD Gundam Battle Alliance</em> | PS4, PS5</li><li><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em> | PS4</li><li><em>ANNO: Mutationem</em> | PS4, PS5</li><li><em>Orcs Must Die 3</em> | PS4, PS5</li><li><em>Citizen Sleeper</em> | PS4, PS5</li><li><em>Poker Club</em> | PS4</li></ul><h2 id="h5916"><a id=""></a>PlayStation Plus Premium</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings</em> | PS4, PS5</li><li><em>Medievil 2</em>| PS4, PS5</li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I enjoyed what little time I spent with the new tank hero Hazard, but a whole new hero shooter that felt fresh was a few button presses away on my PlayStation 5. My friends are playing <em>Marvel Rivals </em>regularly and are excited to do so, rather than requiring the weeks or months of my begging to have them begrudgingly play <em>Overwatch</em> for an hour. This will probably be the first time I don’t finish a battle pass in <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s lifetime. But I can’t lie, I miss <em>Overwatch</em>’s heroes.

In the face of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ success, <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s offerings feel even more paltry, and fans have taken notice.</p><p>The shift is palpable. While we can’t see concurrent players across all platforms, there are signs that <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is eclipsing <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s audience, such as the stark gap between the two in streaming numbers.</p><p><em>Overwatch 2 </em>has work to do if it wants to reclaim this ground. Right now, Blizzard is testing a 6v6 format akin to the original game, which has some fans interested in a return to the series’ roots. But there’s still a fair bit of stink on <em>Overwatch 2 </em>after Blizzard failed to deliver the game it announced in 2019. Without a sense of forward momentum, <em>Overwatch 2 </em>feels stagnant, and lackluster skins and cosmetics aren’t enough to overtake <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. This has resulted in a lot of <em>Overwatch </em>fans in a weird limbo of not wanting to say goodbye but not having much reason to go back. Still, I can’t help but look at the Soldier: 76 statue on my shelf and feel like I’m grieving a long-time relationship.</p><p>Despite all my issues with <em>Overwatch 2</em>, on a strictly mechanical level I think it’s probably the better game. Heroes are more balanced, the map design is more consistent, and as divisive as it might be, I love having Role Queue in <em>Overwatch 2</em>, meaning I can guarantee there will be healers on my team. But that broken chaos has also been what has made <em>Marvel Rivals </em>feel fresh. If <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s future doesn’t include the promised PvE modes, I don’t know what the game’s future looks like. Hopefully, now that <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is breathing down its neck, Blizzard will have a promising update in the coming months.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When Fisk asks why Murdock stopped being a vigilante, our blind hero answers, “A line has been crossed,” before we see his cracked Daredevil mask fall to the ground. From the sounds of it, Murdock is struggling with the common vigilante paradox of how enacting violence may debatably stop some violence but also blurs the line between justice and retribution. Obviously he gets back to bone-crushing action before all is said and done (and, by the looks of it, breaks many, many bones indeed), but the season could find him struggling to reconcile his thirst for vengeance with his duty to protect. </p><p>Another aspect of the new trailer that should pique everyone’s interest is the dynamic between Murdock and Mayor Fisk. The trailer reveals it was Murdock who invited Fisk to meet at the diner. But more importantly, we see Fisk’s almost sentimental connection to his archnemesis, displayed when he remarks, “It’s not entirely unpleasant seeing you again.” Looks like there may be a mutual level of respect between the two men who both succumb to their violent sides to serve their individual purposes.  </p><p>Something tells me there’ll be some common enemy or convoluted entanglement of circumstances that invariably leads to Fisk and Daredevil temporarily teaming up. We’ll find out if I’m right when the series premieres on March 4. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

My case is about 5 years old now, I have been going through the legal process the whole time I’ve been working on this. I have finally been found guilty and sentenced, and I’m going away next month.”</p><p>Fortune’s Run has been in early access for over a year at a price of $20. It currently has just over one hundred user reviews with a Steam rating of 90 percent. It’s due to receive more updates and content, but there’s no telling when, if ever, the game will actually be completed at this point. “It’s a shame, but it’s the consequences of my actions,” the developer continued. “I was a very violent person and I hurt a lot of people in my life. Unfortunately, the sentence isn’t going to help with that at all, but I guess we all know that. So the game isn’t TOTALLY dead, but unfortunately due to even further bad things happening, it’s unclear what will happen.”</p><p>The game is a boomer shooter take on PC classics like <em>Deus Ex</em> and <em>Thief</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>with the grimy post-apocalyptic punk visual style of the early <em>Fallout</em> games. It’s mission-based instead of an open-ended sandbox, making it a unique blend of old-school PC gaming sensibilities. <em>Fortune’s Run</em> is the kind of game about which people constantly write things like, “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmersiveSim/comments/16y788y/how_is_nobody_talking_about_fortunes_run/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ImmersiveSim/comments/16y788y/how_is_nobody_talking_about_fortunes_run/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How is nobody talking about Fortune’s Run?</a></span>” It was already a cult hit with the potential to be a lowkey GOTY-contender whenever it came out of early access.</p><p>“I know many of you will be upset and disappointed but please understand that there’s absolutely nothing I can do, these wheels were in motion long before I started making this game and it’s just been slowly unraveling in my face the whole time,” Dizzie wrote. “I want to underline that I’m no longer in financial dire straits since our game actually sold OK, so I should be able to afford rent once I get out, so there’s a chance that if you wait a few years I’ll be able to cap off the release. In fact, there’s not very much content left to work on, I’ve been making stubs and prototypes of the missing levels in my spare time.”</p><p>Before going to prison, the developer left players <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240?emclan=103582791470559969&amp;emgid=532087801681805320&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1692240?emclan=103582791470559969&amp;emgid=532087801681805320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with one last update</a></span>. It includes new missions, story sequences, puzzles, objects in the environments to interact with, and “hundreds upon hundreds of bug fixes.” However, it’ll break players’ existing saves and there’s no one to QA it. It’s unclear if Dizzie will be communicating with fans again before development goes on hiatus or if this is the last communication for some time. The game remains available to buy on Steam.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
