              <p><span>It’s been 12 years since the last </span><i><span>Bioshock </span></i><span>game and five years since 2K founded a brand new studio called Cloud Chamber to develop a new entry in the beloved shooter franchise. However, it sounds like we’re going to be waiting a bit longer for whatever the fourth </span><i><span>Bioshock </span></i><span>game ends up being, as a new report from </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil"><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i></a> <span>indicates that Cloud Chamber has hit a snag in development, resulting in a leadership shake-up.</span></p> <p><span>The story says that the next </span><i><span>Bioshock</span></i><span> “failed a review by executives” at publisher 2K Games. According to </span><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i><span>‘s sources, the game’s narrative was a sore spot in the internal evaluation and is now being revamped. Cloud Chamber studio head Kelley Gilmore has reportedly been removed from her position, and </span><i><span>Bioshock</span></i><span> creative director Hogarth de la Plante has been moved to a publishing role. Developers at the studio are worried that broader layoffs may follow after they were told in an all-hands meeting that Cloud Chamber needs to be “more agile and efficient.” A 2K representative told </span><i><span>Bloomberg</span></i><span> that the publisher believes the next </span><i><span>Bioshock</span></i><span> is already “a good game” but it is “committed to delivering a great one.”</span></p> <p><span>Buried at the very end of the </span><i><span>Bloomberg </span></i><span>story is confirmation that 2K was also working on a </span><i><span>Bioshock</span></i><span> remake, but that has since been shelved.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The </span><i><span>Bioshock </span></i><span>series has been MIA for over a decade, with the last game in the series being </span><i><span>Bioshock Infinite</span></i><span> in 2013. It was followed by a two-part DLC called </span><i><span>Burial at Sea</span></i><span>, which bridges the gap between </span><i><span>Infinite</span></i><span>’s airborne world of Columbia and the underwater city of Rapture from the first two games. Ken Levine, the original game’s lead, went on to found Ghost Story Games and is working on </span><i><span>Judas</span></i><span>, which </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/judas-previews-bioshock-ken-levine-1851367642"><span>sure looks like a spiritual successor to </span><i><span>Bioshock</span></i></a><span>.</span></p>
