" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>With the era of the original Switch just about to set below gaming’s horizon, Nintendo has hit the internet with a curtain call of a Direct for the portable console.</p><p>While next week’s,  Switch 2-focused Direct on April 3 is likely to set the internet ablaze, this was everything we saw for today, March 27, 2025's Nintendo Direct.</p></div></div><div><p>Showing off some luscious visuals, we got a nice look at the return of <em>Dragon Quest 1</em> and <em>2</em>, which follow last year’s <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em>. The release is expected to arrive this year, but no solid release date was provided.</p></div><div><p>In this new detective-focused game in the <em>AI: The Somnium Files </em>series, you’ll have to help out a poor idol in distress trapped on a space station with low oxygen, solving mysteries and such to help her. <em>No Sleep For Kaname Date</em> launches on July 25, 2025.</p></div><div><p>A remastered version of <em>Raidou</em>, originally released for PlayStation 2 in 2006 as <em>Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>is heading to the Switch on June 19, 2025.</p></div><div><p>With some sick-looking dark environments, the edgy <em>Pac-Man </em>spin-off <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> promises some brutal fights in which you can not only beat the crap out of your foes, but also eat them for enhanced abilities. <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> launches on July 18.</p></div><div><p>If you have fond memories of playing <em>Patapon</em> on PSP, good news! You can relive the portable experience with remasters of <em>Pataon 1 </em>and <em>2 </em>on the Switch, launching on July 11, and get that infectious rhythm stuck in your head all over again. <br></p></div><div><p>Want another farming sim? How about a throwback to the DS era? <em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em> hits the Switch on August 27, 2025.</p></div><div><p>With some absolutely gorgeous-looking environments, our girl Samus is back in first-person mode to hopefully escape a hostile planet. While <em>Dread</em> absolutely owned, it’s gonna be pretty sweet to focus on alien-blasting and scanning stuff yet again from inside her helmet. She’s also got some pretty neat psychic abilities for combat and exploration.</p><p><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> arrives on the Switch sometime in 2025.</p></div><div><p>Coffee and tea are pretty sweet, but in <em>Disney Villains Cursed Cafe</em>, you’ll get to make some nifty potions with unique narrative outcomes based on your choices. The game is out today, March 27.</p></div><div><p>How about a magic school that doesn’t suck? Well, that’s the dream anyway. <em>Witchbrook</em> features some nice-looking pixel art, magical learnings, and even co-op for up to four players. The game arrives on Switch this holiday season.</p></div><div><p>Billed as a “hand-drawn platforming adventure,” <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman </em>will let you smack the crap out of fools with a cane. Fun! <br></p></div><div><p>Oh hell yeah. Schmup fans will be eating well with this sick-looking collection of the <em>Gradius</em> franchise featuring not only some classics, but also a new adventure with <em>Salamander III</em>.</p></div><div><p>Haven’t you ever wanted to start a band to take on dark forces? Well, you can live out that very dream with <em>Rift of the Necrodancer</em>, available for the Switch today, March 27.</p></div><div><p>With adorable little meeps for dialogue, <em>Tamagotchi Plaza</em> looks like a chill store-management sim where you can explore all of your retail dreams, only cuter. This one arrives on Switch on June 27.</p></div><div><p>What do you mean you still haven’t caught ‘em all? Today we got another look at <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em>, in which a corporation is in charge of urban development, you know, to let humans and Pokémon live in peace together. It’s totally not an open air prison for the powerless critters.</p></div><div><p>If you’re looking for a rhythm game that drills timing down to the basics, <em>Rhythm Heaven Groove</em> eschews grand storylines and epic settings for something a bit more focused on timing your button presses to the beat. Past entries have been a delight, so it’s great to see this series make its way to Switch.</p></div><div><p>Hey, there’s a new Switch on the horizon. It’s left many of us wondering what’s gonna happen with our digital games; after all, many of us have dumped a fair bit of coin into that eShop. </p><p>Fortunately, Nintendo is promising us the ability to easily transport digital games via a virtual game card management system across two different Nintendo Switch systems (the trailer seems to indicate that’s the limit). You’ll also be able to share games within your Nintendo family. The feature is coming to both the Switch and the Switch 2, and is expected to arrive in April of this year.</p></div><div><p>Stoner-FPS-fest <em>High On Life</em> is hitting the Nintendo Switch on May 6, perfect for extended periods of couch lock for you troublemakers.</p></div><div><p>Promising speedy action adventure across a strange alien world, <em>Star Overdrive</em> lands on the Switch on April 10.</p></div><div><p>This alien settlement management sim arrives on the Switch on July 17.</p></div><div><p>A sequel to the Nintendo 3DS’ <em>Fantasy Life, The Girl Who Steals</em> <em>Time </em>promises open-world exploration and item crafting when it arrives on the Switch on May 21 of this year.<br></p></div><div><p>1999 PlayStation RPG<em> Saga Frontier II </em>is getting a remaster on the Switch. The original narrative is joined by some new story material and characters. <em>Saga Frontier II</em>’s remaster arrives on Switch today.</p></div><div><p><em>Monument Valley 1 </em>and <em>2 </em>promise chill adventures across geometrically complex environments. This package, which includes all DLC, on April 15, 2025. The third game, which released on Android in December of 2024, will also make its way to the Switch this summer.</p></div><div><p><em>Everybody’s Golf</em>, aka <em>Hot Shots Golf</em>, is making the leap from Sony platforms to the Switch with the appropriately titled <em>Everybody’s Golf: Hot Shots. </em>It arrives on Switch later this year. </p></div><div><p>If you’re craving some retro beat ‘em up action with legendary superheroes like Spider-Man and Wolverine, <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> looks like a pretty swell time, with single and cooperative play. <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion </em>arrives this holiday season.</p></div><div><p>The event’s final game reveal showed off the newest <em>Tomodachi</em> release in 10 years with this strange teaser that is already resulting in memes galore on social media.</p></div><div><p>At the very end of the event, Nintendo announced that they’ll continue the Direct series of video presentations, but they’re also launching a new channel via an app called Nintendo Today. It promises to update you every day with Nintendo news, which will be especially promising for next week’s big Switch 2 reveal. </p><p>The app is available for download today.</p><hr><p><br>And that wraps everything we saw at the original Switch’s final Nintendo Direct!</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

While it will allow you to share digital titles with friends and family members, this is still Nintendo we are talking about, so the whole system is a bit weird and complicated. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,194644" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“What if digital games could be as flexible and convenient as game cards?” That’s the question that Nintendo apparently asked itself when coming up with Virtual Game Cards. </p><p> Starting in late April, all digital games you own or buy will become <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/EWwyh74MXXY&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/EWwyh74MXXY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Virtual Game Cards</a></span>. These will be stored in a new menu screen on your Switch or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-mario-kart-9-1851772264&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-mario-kart-9-1851772264">Switch 2</a></span>. Nintendo says any registered user on the console can play that digital game. </p><p>The real news is that these VGCs can be “digitally ejected” and “digitally loaded”  into another Switch console and freely played on that second device. The original Switch user that bought the game can’t play that VGC anymore as it’s been “ejected” from the console. </p><p>The company promises that you are free to load and trade digital games using VGCs freely between two specific, paired systems. Think an upstairs Switch and downstairs Switch 2.  You will need to locally connect the two consoles the first time you do some digital swapping, but after that it should be easy and hassle free. </p><p>You can also share Virtual Game Cards with members of your Nintendo Account Family Group. However, this is a bit more limited. It must be done over a local wireless connection, and you can only lend one game at a time to each member. And after two weeks, they lose access to the Virtual Game Card and it returns back to original owner. Better hope it’s not a long game!</p><p>Nintendo claims this new system will make digital games even easier to use. And this new system will also work with the Nintendo Switch 2, as confirmed by the company during the Direct. But it does seem like a very Nintendo solution to a problem Xbox and others solved already. Still, I’m happy to see Nintendo doing something to make it easier to play owned digital games on multiple devices as we get closer to the launch of Switch 2. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

She has to fight off local vine-swinging enemies and solve puzzles with a set of psychic powers that let Samus control objects from afar. The new trailer ended with a look at a mysterious alien race Samus will be trying to help on the planet, as well as a new red suit they’ll seemingly unlock for her. </p><p>The footage also shows off the various environments on the planet’s surface and familiar sights like Samus coiling up into a ball and rolling through tiny underground passages. There’s also plenty of bugs, alien plants, and other local fauna to fight. The psychic powers look they’ll be used to help solve a number of tracing puzzles too, which seems like a good fit for the Switch’s touch and gyro controls. </p><p><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> still has no specific release date but Nintendo reaffirmed it’s coming before the end of 2025. With Switch 2 just around the corner, it’s possible it will have an upgraded version on the new console, similar to<em> The</em> <em>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>in 2017, which was cross-gen between Wii U and the original Switch. </p><p>Either way, <em>Metroid Prime 4 </em>seems likely to be the final hurrah for the current hardware, potentially taking it within spitting distance of its nine-year anniversary. Hopefully we still get HD remasters of <em>Metroid Prime 2</em> and<em> 3</em> on Switch before then. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
