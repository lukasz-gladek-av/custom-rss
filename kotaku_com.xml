              <p><i>RimWorld </i>has come a long way since its initial launch in November of 2013. Back then, a lot of what made the game great today was simple and barebones. Through regular content updates and multiple expansions, the team at Ludeon Studios has crafted one of the greatest story-generating colony sim games in this niche genre. But it’s the modding community that carries the torch forward. They’ve introduced the community to total overhauls, eyebrow-raising inclusions, and, of course, the ever-beloved quality of life mods. Let’s explore a few of those that many of us long-time players can’t do without!</p> <h2>Neat Storage</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614367" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614367"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614367">© Screenshot: Ludeon Studios / seobungzu</figcaption></figure> <p>One of the earliest rooms you’ll construct for your base—or, at the very least, that you should construct—is a storage room for everything you brought in the crash landing. If left outside in the weather and the fauna, your packaged food will quickly deteriorate. But no one wants to walk over junk on the floor, right?</p> <p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3416243474&amp;searchtext=neat+storage">Neat Storage</a> enables clean, aesthetically pleasing storage solutions for everything from raw resources to clothing to weapons to body parts. The shelves are simply, <i>mwah</i>, gorgeous to look at.</p>

 <h2>Character Editor</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614368" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614368"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614368">© Screenshot: Ludeon Studios / VOID</figcaption></figure> <p>You’ll encounter a wide variety of pawns during the creation process, most of which feature an abundance of quirks, high and low skills, passions, and even injuries. It’s random, and you could very easily get screwed over by the in-game character generator.</p> <p>If you’d rather have a little more agency over your colony, a tool like <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1874644848&amp;searchtext=character+editor">Character Editor</a> will allow you to completely resculpt a pawn into anything you desire. From a pyromaniac god-like character with maxed out abilities to a child warrior turned scientist incapable of cleaning or menial labor, it’s all up to you now!</p>

 <h2>Smarter Construction</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614369" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614369"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614369">© Screenshot: Ludeon Studios / Hultis</figcaption></figure> <p>Let’s be honest with ourselves, pawns in <i>RimWorld </i>aren’t the sharpest tools in the shed. Sure, they’ll satiate their basic needs if left to their own devices, but for everything else, you need to take an active hand in ordering them about. If you want something built, it’s up to your planning expertise. Need a food source, yep, it’s up to you.</p> <p>Pawns tend to construct entire structures randomly, sometimes leading to roof collapses that wipe out whole colonies or trapping a pawn inside an airless room. With <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2202185773&amp;searchtext=smarter+construction">Smarter Construction</a>, those mishaps are a thing of the past. They’ll build smart, leaving paths open for trapped pawns, and construct walls and supports in such a way that solidifies the building.</p>

 <h2>Filth Vanishes With Rain and Time</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614370" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614370"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614370">© Screenshot: Ludeon Studios / FrozenSnowFox</figcaption></figure> <p>Occasionally, as in rarely, I’ll play a peaceful colony that focuses on farming, ranching, or selling crafted resources like a merchant. But more often than not, <i>RimWorld </i>devolves into its usual dangerous, destructive planetary war as always. When a fight happens, all the blood, mud, and scorch marks remain until you send out your pawns to clean the place.</p> <p>But not anymore! With <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1508341791&amp;searchtext=filth+vanishes+with+rain+and+time">Filth Vanishes With Rain and Time</a>, the next time those rain clouds appear overhead, they’ll help cleanse the land and leave your settlers feeling content and devoid of dirty, germ-ridden thoughts.</p> <h2>Color Coded Mood Bar</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614371" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614371"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614371">© Screenshot: Ludeon Studios / CrashM / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Every minor and major incident in the game affects your pawn’s disposition. From a lack of food to too few recreational devices to a raid to discovering an underground network of tunnels leading to the ultimate bug hive beneath your base, your pawns will either roll with the punches or roll on the floor. But you can’t take steps to help them overcome such challenges with a clear head if you don’t understand their mood better.</p>

 <p>Sure, you could just go into the mood tab of their character HUD, but who has time for that? With <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2006605356">Color Coded Mood Bar</a>, a glance at the top of the screen will tell you everything you need to know. If your pawn’s portrait is red, look out!</p>  <hr> <p><i>RimWorld </i>is available now on Windows PCs, and its latest expansion, <i>Odyssey</i>, launched on July 11.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/itch-nsfw-adult-games-visa-mastercard-collective-shout-2000614199</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Itch.io, the indie gaming store<a href="https://kotaku.com/itch-io-nsfw-porn-games-delisted-collective-shout-1851786841"> that recently pulled all NSFW games from its site</a>, is beginning the process of “re-indexing” adult games. At the moment, this is only affecting free games, and the site is still in discussions with payment providers over how it can return paid-for NSFW games without facing penalization.</p> <p>This all came about after an Australian anti-porn pressure group, Collective Shout, campaigned payment providers to stop working with gaming stores that sold games of which it did not approve. First, <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-valve-adult-content-sex-games-online-safety-act-1851786391">Valve removed hundreds of adult games from Steam</a>, while introducing new and incredibly ambiguous rules about what was acceptable. Then soon after, Itch followed suit, but in a far more dramatic fashion, de-listing any game marked as “adult” or “not safe for work” from the store’s searchable pages. In the process, large numbers of games that in no way contravened even the most broad notions of acceptability were caught in the crossfire, and inevitably many of them were representing LGBTQ+ subjects.</p> <p>Now, itch.io founder Leaf Corcoran <a href="https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content">has released a statement</a> saying the store is bringing back free NSFW games, but is “still in ongoing discussions with payment processors,” meaning paid games will be reintroduced “slowly.”</p> <p>To get an NSFW game back on Itch today, developers must check the “No payments” box on their dashboard, making their game not only free, but also unable to accept optional payments from customers. Itch’s excellent systems usually allows customers to pay the asking price for a game, or opt to pay more if they wish. That allows developers to price their games as free but still receive payments from those who want to. That’s currently unavailable for any adult games.</p> <p>Leaf’s post explains that Itch spoke with its primary payment provider Stripe, with which it’s worked for a decade, and has been told they will “not be able to” take payments for “content designed for sexual gratification.” That ludicrously ambiguous phrase is helpful to precisely no one, given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_34">Rule 34</a> and the infinite reaches of kink. However, Stripe does seem to be making some progressive noises. The company asked Itch to share a statement:</p> <blockquote><p>“Stripe is currently unable to support sexually explicit content due to restrictions placed on them by their banking partners, despite card networks generally supporting adult content (with the appropriate registrations). Stripe has indicated that they hope to be able to support adult content in the future.”</p></blockquote> <p>Itch says as a result of this it’s now speaking to other payment processors to try to find a company that can cover what Stripe will not. In the meantime, NSFW games that do not violate Stripe’s current definition of unacceptability will be reviewed and possibly re-listed.</p> <p>The situation, no matter anyone’s opinion on the nature of the games being disallowed, remains deeply concerning. We are seeing multiple stores explaining to customers that their actions are now dependent upon what payment processors will tolerate, given any online store can be held to ransom by these corporations. If you cannot process a payment, you can’t sell a game, and it’s all or nothing. Thanks to the efforts of these ideologically driven pressure groups, companies like Visa, Mastercard, Stripe and the rest fear being associated with controversial adult content, and will simply refuse to work with stores that don’t adhere to their unclear and ever-changing limits. In other words, the moralities of a pressure group dictate the nature of what can be sold on a gaming store, because of the pusillanimous nature of the corporations in the middle.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-sales-figures-2000614194</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo%E2%80%99s-sold-6-million-switch-2s-and-over-5-6-million-copies-of-mario-kart-world.1259694/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>It’s fair to say that Nintendo’s had a pretty good few months. After just four days, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-sales-fastest-selling-console-ever-1851784293">the Switch 2 had sold 3.5 million units</a>, making it the most successful console launch of all time. <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801e.pdf">Nintendo is now reporting</a> it sold just shy of six million Switch 2s in the system’s first month, along with 8.6 million games. Of those, an incredible 5.63 million are copies of<em> Mario Kart World</em>. Alongside that, the console company still sold a million new Switch 1s in three months, and over 24 million games for that system. All told, from April to June, the company made sales of 572 billion yen, or $3.8 billion. It’s good to be Nintendo right now.</p> <p>All those numbers take us up to the end of June, meaning there’s actually a whole other month of as-yet unreported Switch 2 sales to take into account, meaning that number is likely closer (by our estimate) to eight million, ahead of Nintendo’s expectations, and well on the way to the company’s goal of 15 million units by March 2026. And don’t forget, they’ve got 2025’s holiday season to come before then.</p> <p>Interestingly, digital sales were down over 13 percent on the same quarter last year, which Nintendo attributes to, er, “a decrease in sales of downloadable versions of packaged software.” Well, yeah, selling fewer digital games would certain explain the lower sales of digital games. Piercing insight. There was also a drop in what Nintendo calls “IP related business,” down 4.4 percent, which is explained by “a decrease in movie-related revenue.” That’s actually a pretty impressively small drop, given it’s two years since&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> was released.</p>

 <p><em>Mario Kart World</em>‘s sales of almost six million, in large part a consequence of the game being offered as a bundle with the Switch 2 itself, make it the most successful <em>Mario Kart</em> launch ever–that’s pretty stunning given there was no previously established userbase for the console. For context,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart Wii</em> launched two years after the Wii came out, and sold an estimated 4.7 million copies in its first four months. <em>Mario Kart 7</em> was limited by the low sales of the 3DS, but <em>Mario Kart 8</em> had the reverse effect, causing people to finally buy the unloved Wii U, selling nearly 3 million copies in its first month. However, it only reached 8.5 million lifetime sales. <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</em>on the Switch is still the big leader, with astonishing lifetime sales of over 64 million copies, but even that was slower out of the gates than <em>Mario Kart World</em>. That game took a year to get to nine million copies, meaning&nbsp;<em>World</em> is well on its way to smashing that number.</p> <p>It’s notable that given 5.82 million Switch 2s have been sold (and that’s sold to real people, rather than just shipped to stores), and 5.63 million copies of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, that the game is almost ubiquitous among the console owners. That means people who didn’t opt for–or were unable to buy–the bundle have been buying a separate copy anyway. Yes, fair enough, it’s not like people were spoiled for choice when the Switch 2 launched, but it remains a remarkable number. It’ll be fascinating to see how&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> has sold, and even more fascinating to visit the alternate reality where Nintendo had that game ready for launch.</p>
