            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em><a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/ryan-hurst-cast-kratos-prime-video-god-of-war-1236683097/">Deadline</a> </em>is&nbsp;reporting that Sony and Amazon have tapped <em>Sons of Anarchy </em>and <em>God of War: Ragnarök </em>actor Ryan Hurst to play Kratos in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-war-tv-amazon-ps5-release-date-trailer-1851675600">upcoming live-action <em>God of War&nbsp;</em>series</a>.</p> <p>Hurst, who played Thor in the 2022&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>game, will be swapping roles for the show, and will lead the series based on the storylines of the modern <em>GoW </em>games, which find Kratos interacting with (and often fighting) figures from Norse mythology. We still don’t know who will be playing his son Atreus, but it’s cool to have Hurst on as someone who is intimately familiar with the source material.</p>  <p>Along with playing Thor, Hurst’s notable credits include playing Opie in&nbsp;<em>Sons of Anarchy</em>, as well as Beta in the&nbsp;<em>Walking Dead&nbsp;</em>franchise, both in the main series and the <em>Fear the Walking Dead&nbsp;</em>spin-off show. Most recently, he has played Miles in the new Netflix western series&nbsp;<em>The Abandons</em>.</p>

 <p>If you want a quick refresher on Hurst’s acting chops, someone was kind enough to compile all his scenes as Thor in <em>Ragnarök</em>.</p>  <p>That’s the only casting news we have for now, but given that the show seems to be comfortable picking from the game’s cast, it would be interesting to see Sunny Suljic&nbsp; reprise his role as Atreus for the series, though the 20-year-old actor might be a bit too old to play the child as he appeared in the 2018 game at this point. Atreus was still a young teen by the time <em>Ragnarök&nbsp;</em>came around, however, and Suljic still looks pretty young.</p>

 <p>There were rumors that Christopher Judge, the actor who plays Kratos in the Norse <em>God of War&nbsp;</em>games, was also up for the live-action role last year, but Judge himself seemed to debunk these in <a href="https://x.com/iamchrisjudge/status/1968155387863109880">an X post</a> in September.</p> <p>The&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>series is coming from writer, showrunner, and executive producer <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-tv-ronald-d-moore-battlestar-galactica-1851770751">Ronald D. Moore</a>, who is best known for his work on <em>Star Trek&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Battlestar Galactica</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Plenty of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a> <span>fans and engineers have created working Pokédexes complete with image recognition to let you scan toys and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-evolution-art-characters-raichu-2000659297"><span>art to identify your favorite monsters</span></a><span>. BigRig Creates and Mr. Volt have taken this a step further, creating what they’re calling the “World’s Smartest” Pokédex, capable of not only recognizing Pokémon, but giving you data about them from the games, acting as a voice assistant, and much more.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MrVolt"><span>Mr. Volt</span></a><span> is planning to release a video about the hardware side of things at some point in the future, but BigRig Creates has already put out a 13-minute rundown of how he accomplished all the image recognition and data dumps, and recreated a voice that sounds similar to the original anime’s Pokédex.</span></p>

  <p><span>Much of the coding under the hood draws from the </span><a href="https://pokemondb.net/"><span>Pokémon Database</span></a><span>, which includes lengthy Pokédex entries for all 1025 monsters, complete with stats, learnable attacks, locations in each game, and more. So now, the World’s Smartest dex can tell you pretty much anything you need to know about a Pokémon just by scanning an image of it. The device uses a reverse Google image search to name whatever monster you’re pointing it at, and it can identify anything from plushies to fan art.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The voice, however, needed some tweaking, so BigRig Creates used his own voice to create an AI text-to-speech voice model that sounded closer to the original but didn’t rip the lines from the show. He says this was in an effort to use the tech to make something “ethical” and “homegrown” rather than training it on the performances of actors Nick Stellate and Eric Stuart from the anime.</span></p>

 <p><span>Seeing the completed dex in action is pretty impressive. It correctly identifies several Pokémon, including a Ditto disguised as a Poipole, from toys, plushes, and some hastily drawn Remoraid fan art. It couldn’t quite wrap its head around a Spinda Labubu, though. No tech is perfect, I suppose.</span></p>

              <p>Last week, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>‘s</em> Season One Reloaded update hit the game on all platforms and added a lot of <em>Fallout</em>-themed content as well as some new multiplayer maps. One of these, Meltdown, is now at the center of some online shouting as some fans find the cleaner, more realistic version of the map in&nbsp;<em>7</em> inferior to the OG one first seen in <em>Black Ops 2.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>On January 9, <em>BLOPS7</em>‘s big new update added a lot to the online shooter. For <em>Fallout</em> fans, there’s a lot of content ripped right from the TV show on Amazon, including cosmetic skins based on the Ghoul and other characters. <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2026/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-warzone-season-01-reloaded#Maps">You can read the full blog post here</a> to see the impressive amount of new stuff that Activision has shoved into<em> Black Ops 7.</em></p>

 <p>But what has a lot of people online talking is the new map, Meltdown. This map, set inside a nuclear power plant facility, was extremely popular in the original <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</em> back in 2012 on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC, where I spent many hours playing it. So naturally, I was excited for its return in <em>BLOPS7</em>. But, well, this ain’t exactly the same Meltdown from 14 years ago.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Made a full yt video about the Meltdown graphics downgrade thing I've been seeing everyone talk about.<a href="https://t.co/aTe4jPQjmZ">https://t.co/aTe4jPQjmZ</a></p> <p>But TL;DW — I'm mostly fine with the lighting/color changes. I think it just looks too clean. <a href="https://t.co/ZalIsAvQjS">pic.twitter.com/ZalIsAvQjS</a></p> <p>— Replay Mode (@ReplayModeYT) <a href="https://twitter.com/ReplayModeYT/status/2011190255412457838?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This new remastered version of Meltdown features “updated visuals” and “dynamic lighting,” according to Activision. But, as seen in a comparison video posted online by YouTuber Replay Mode, the updated visuals seem to be cleaner and less grungy, with textures and props that are missing many of the old details like puddles, signs, exposed wiring, chainlink fencing, and warning decals.</p>

 <p>Replay Mode wasn’t the only person to notice this. <a href="https://www.threads.com/@dexerto/post/DTb11ZFDP1-/a-call-of-duty-fan-compared-how-meltdown-looks-in-black-ops-and-black-ops-via">If you look online</a>, <a href="https://x.com/itsHunterTV/status/2010914954690641981">you can spot</a> many people posting comparisons on social media of <em>Black Ops 7′</em>s version of Meltdown and the older original version of the map.</p> <p>In the comments, there are plenty of people arguing that the older map looks better, pointing out the fancier sky box and messier aesthetic. Meanwhile, other players say the new map looks better and provides better visibility.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Black ops 7 vs Black ops 2 .. <a href="https://t.co/MBsiDXWeJu">pic.twitter.com/MBsiDXWeJu</a></p> <p>— 1S Ghofy (@Ghofys) <a href="https://twitter.com/Ghofys/status/2010553685479207178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 12, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“How do you take a nuclear power plant and somehow make it look even more drab and lifeless?” asked one player.</p> <p>“Incredible how they’ve just completely sucked all the vibe and life out of the current <em>Call Of Duty</em> games. At least Zombies in <em>BO7</em> has some personality,” posted a person on Twitter.</p>

 <p>“The time of day makes the BO2 version look better, even though BO7 is most likely pushing far greater tech,” commented a player on Threads.</p> <p>“The fact that a 2012 game has better graphics is unbelievable,” said an upset fan.</p>

 <p>“Although&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em>&nbsp;has better fidelity, I think&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 2′</em>s version has a better art direction by miles.&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em> feels and looks so hollow,” posted another player on Twitter.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The map still plays well, but idk how they could look at the new map and not realize the lighting and skyboxes are is a downgrade. Shadows are very harsh in BO7 compared to BO2 as well <a href="https://t.co/kxxoyR27PP">pic.twitter.com/kxxoyR27PP</a></p> <p>— MrGoldenGamer (@MrGoldenGamerr) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrGoldenGamerr/status/2010931109757141272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 13, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>From what I can tell, the map changes made to Meltdown seem to be focused entirely on making it easier to spot enemies and react to threats. The old map features lots of walls that contain extra details and dark colors, which look nice but add extra clutter. These kinds of details can sometimes make it harder to spot an enemy player, so I can understand Treyarch removing them. Valve has made similar changes to old and new <em>Counter-Strike</em> maps over the years, too.</p> <p>Still, it does feel like the developer has picked clarity and esports balance over vibes and art style, and while I get that in 2026 many players demand perfectly balanced games with all the rough edges sanded down to keep things even, I think this “downgrade” is a good example of how we lose a lot in the pursuit of making everything fair.</p>
