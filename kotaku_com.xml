              <p><span>Most live-service games don’t get as many chances as </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>has gotten, but most of them aren’t made by Blizzard, which can afford to fumble, refocus, and rise from the ashes. The problem any game that’s gone on for 10 years faces is that different versions of it exist in the minds of everyone who’s ever played it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If you stopped pushing payloads during the height of the game’s domination, you may have a rosy image in your mind of a game that doesn’t really exist anymore. Those of us who came in later have only really known </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>as a fallen titan struggling to get back on its feet. When the sequel came out and never actually delivered the cooperative campaign Blizzard had promised, plenty of people dismissed </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>as a failed experiment and a fumbled bag. Even I, a person who has put over 1000 hours into Blizzard’s hero shooter, fell off for a brief period, though I kept my Soldier: 76 keychain on my ring even when I wasn’t playing.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000002089" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000002089"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000002089">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-perks-stadium-season-15-spotlight-preview-1851761919"><span>But last year, something shifted</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>may not have become the story-driven sequel I wanted, but Blizzard showed that even if its original plan had fallen through, it wasn’t going to leave the game as a skin-driven cash cow doing nothing more than giving Mercy fans another one hundred outfits in which to dress up their favorite medic. The introduction of Perks, or character-specific tweaks that change or lean into different playstyles on typically one-note heroes, and the build-driven Stadium mode, showed that all that work on skill trees and buildcrafting hadn’t been a complete waste of time.</span></p> <p><span>Now, in 2026, Blizzard is integrating the story in a way that’s probably more sustainable than a PvE campaign microtransactioned out over the course of years would have been. It’s taking its seasonal rollout and completely restructuring it to accommodate a linear story, rather than just leaning on character-setting lore drops with no forward momentum. It’s not the game we were pitched in 2019, but the Blizzard team that was leading the charge on that has been desecrated over the past few years.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Game director Jeff Kaplan </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-director-jeff-kaplan-leaves-blizzard-1846723205"><span>left Blizzard before </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>launched</span></a><span>, the narrative and events teams were </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-activision-blizzard-zenimax-1851196192"><span>subjected to layoffs</span></a><span> that left the story in limbo </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720"><span>until the campaign was canceled</span></a><span>, and for a while, it felt like </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>was back on life support similar to how it was during the years-long content drought leading up to </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s launch.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000005813" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000005813"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000005813">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>For some, it doesn’t matter that </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>has grown, changed, and gotten more than simply better, instead reaching a level of greatness some thought lost. For those people, that moment of disappointment when they stopped playing it remains too vivid, that betrayal too great, for them to so much as reinstall the game. People love a </span><i><span>No Man’s Sky </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Final Fantasy XIV</span></i><span> moment in which games that stumble in the beginning get their shit together. Those are becoming less common, however, in an industry that invests millions of dollars into service games it’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-review-sci-fi-hero-shooter-ps5-overwatch-1851630481"><span>unwilling to support longterm.</span></a><span> Players, meanwhile, are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><span>growing tired of live games</span></a><span> that feel like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-final-hours-videos-clips-stream-2000659367"><span>obvious ploys for their time and money</span></a><span> at a time when both of those things are becoming more scarce and precious.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In our modern, post-patch world in which games sometimes launch broken and get fixed later, people are becoming more jaded to the notion of bad or just lackluster games becoming good ones months or years down the line. There are too many games to play to waste time on one that isn’t giving you what you want right out of the gate. Most live-service games are sent out to die, Blizzard just has the institutional resources and stubbornness to not let a game like </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> slip through the cracks. In the past decade, </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>has become a symbol of both the potential live games have to reach and even surpass their former glory, and the fact that only the biggest companies can afford to fail now.</span></p>

 <p><span>I talk to friends who stopped playing </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>years ago and feel like I’m running up against versions of the game that haven’t existed in years. Age-old complaints that were long patched out or reworked still linger in their minds, or major overhauls merely exist as passing headlines they read once but never actually played for themselves.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000665015" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665015"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665015">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Live games are kind of like the friend you had growing up that let you down in one way or another, and if you’ve gone no contact, you might not know they’ve turned their life around. But the people who left for slights from years ago are often defining the narrative about the state of the game just as much as the people who are still playing and know what the game is like now.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Whether it’s because actual competition in the form of </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Deadlock</span></i><span> showed up kicking Blizzard in the ass or because the </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>team has finally been able to rebuild itself after years of strife, </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>is in the best state it’s been in the past decade, and finally has a pipeline that is letting the team take massive swings like releasing ten heroes in one year and giving the story the momentum and direction it’s desperately needed, even if it’s not what we once thought we were getting. There will always be skin imbalances to complain about, “what ifs” to ponder, and potential it feels like Blizzard failed to live up to. But the game we have now is the best version Blizzard’s ever given us. I guess we’ll see if it’s enough to correct the narrative in the months and years to come.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Here’s Why Some Overwatch Heroes Get More Skins Than Others]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Debates about who gets <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-kiriko-mercy-venture-reaper-season-12-skins-1851626893">the most cosmetics in </a></span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> are as old as the game itself, but these arguments have only gotten worse as the hero shooter has implemented <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-collaborations-survey-pokemon-star-wars-1851787277">collaborations with other brands</a>. It feels like a crossover can’t come and go without Kiriko, Mercy, or Juno getting some love while some heroes like Baptiste, Lúcio, and many, many others go without. Why? Well, many </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>fans hypothesize that it’s because Kiriko and Mercy mains are always willing to pony up cash, but according to Blizzard, it’s a bit more complicated than that.</span></p> <p><span>During a group interview with the art team on Blizzard’s Irvine campus, art director Dion Rogers explained that some of the characters who have historically been spoiled in </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s many collaborations are just easier to conceptualize in different outfits and accessories than others, but as the team has gotten more experienced at adapting outside looks for its heroes, they hope to better serve some of the neglected characters, like Lúcio.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Our team, we draw a bunch of stuff and it just works better with some heroes than others,” Rogers said. “It’s just the nature of the hero itself. I know Lúcio mains are hungry. We’ve got some stuff coming for Lúcio as you just saw with </span><i><span>Hello Kitty</span></i><span>. There’s even more coming for him. So as we become better at the work and more efficient, we’re nearing 50 heroes, also, so it’s really hard to get to certain guys. It is the nature of there are some characters that are easier to do things for than others.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“There’s some guys, you do it, and you see it, and you’re like, ‘that looks cursed. That’s not gonna work.’ Some of them actually slip out and make it out into the game. So that’s been a lot of the conversations we have sometimes. It’s more of, ‘does a fantasy truly work for a character or not, or are we making some sort of cursed thing?’ But now, 2026, you’re going to see the kind of fruits of our labor over the past two years of building a better pipeline, building more efficiency. We’ll be able to hit more heroes than before with broader concepting and stuff for the guys that feel a little underserved. We’ll get to them.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Character artist Melissa Kelly added that, as a Zarya fan, she sympathizes with the plight of those who play underserved heroes. That said, while Lúcio is getting some love in the Sanrio crossover, Kiriko, Juno, and Mercy are also in the line-up. So some old habits die hard.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Overwatch Is Starting A New Story, But What About The One From Its Cancelled Campaign?]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-ramattra-null-sector-canceled-campaign-2000665102</link>
            <guid>1425649</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>is entering a new era, and that comes with new annual storylines and an emphasis on lore that actually pushes the story forward. But this isn’t the first time we’ve been told to expect a new focus on narrative in the hero shooter. Once upon a time it was supposed to receive a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720"><span>cooperative campaign</span></a><span> that told the story of the titular organization fighting Null Sector, an army of Omnic machines led by Ramattra, a radical leader fighting for machine freedom. Since the campaign’s quiet cancellation, Blizzard has released </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-comic-zenyatta-ramattra-2000628236"><span>a few pieces of external media</span></a><span> that seemingly </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-pve-canceled-campaign-null-sector-2000641177"><span>wrapped up this story</span></a><span> pretty cleanly.</span></p> <p><span>Now, Null Sector and Ramattra are nowhere to be seen in </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s new Reign of Talon storyline. As a Ramattra player, I had to ask if Blizzard was dropping the story of the Omnic Crisis in favor of focusing on Vendetta and her ascent up the ranks of the terrorist organization Talon.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Ramattra is such an incredible character,” narrative lead Miranda Moyer said when I asked if the Omnic Crisis storyline was being swept under the rug during a group interview on the Blizzard campus. “He is one of the most compelling villains that I think </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>has, obviously, but that the whole of Blizzard has ever had. I think he’s someone who a lot of people can relate to despite the bad things that he does. So I personally am very excited about a lot of the storyline that he still has available. As we saw in the </span><i><span>Reconciliation </span></i><span>comic, he is currently down in Antarctica, so I feel like there is still a lot of room and places to take his specific story.”</span></p> <p><span>“Yeah, we haven’t cut any leads,” added audio &amp; technical director Scott Lawson. “There’s plenty of potential for us to keep developing.”</span></p>

  <p><span>So it sounds like Blizzard is open to revisiting Ramattra and the Omnic Crisis conflict, but that may not happen in this initial story event focusing on Talon’s rise. Given the amount of turnover the narrative team has undergone from the beginning of </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> to now, with </span><a href="https://www.michael-chu.com/blog/twenty-years"><span>original lead writer Michael Chu leaving Blizzard in 2020</span></a><span> and several others on the story side being </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-activision-blizzard-zenimax-1851196192"><span>subject to layoffs</span></a><span> following Activision Blizzard’s merger with Xbox and the narrative campaign’s cancelation, it makes sense that some things would have shifted. Even if Ramattra does return in a future season, though, we’ll still be left to wonder what the story would have been had Blizzard followed through on the planned campaign. </span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Everything Blizzard Announced For Overwatch’s Biggest Update Ever]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-spotlight-story-vendetta-cinematic-new-heroes-2000665327</link>
            <guid>1425643</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Blizzard just held its second annual Overwatch Spotlight presentation, and the lengthy showcase laid out a lot of changes coming to the hero shooter this year. </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s next season is being branded as a complete revamp to the game, so much so that Blizzard is calling it “Season One” rather than Season 21, and is also dropping the </span><i><span>2 </span></i><span>from the game’s title. So what is Blizzard bringing to the table with this clean slate? We attended a briefing on Blizzard’s Irvine campus earlier this month (paid for and accommodated by the company) where we saw the presentation, got hands-on time with new heroes and conducted interviews with the team. Let’s dive in.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000665329" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665329"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665329">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>A new cinematic that could change everything</b></h2> <p><span>The Spotlight showcase kicks off with a new cinematic starring Vendetta and Doomfist. The sword-wielding villain has been the star of much of </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s recent external media as she’s planned to take her rightful place at the top of the terrorist organization Talon. Her father, Antonio Bartalotti, was killed in the </span><i><span>Retribution </span></i><span>Archives event back in 2018, and once he was gone, she no longer had the ties to the organization that she was promised. So now she’s shown up on Doomfist’s doorstep to take it by force. This short is kicking off the first of </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s planned annual narrative arcs, which will be told with periodic lore drops over the next year. Rather than the character-establishing pieces </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>has typically done with comics, short stories, and cinematics, everything that comes out over the next year will be telling a story with a beginning, middle, and end.</span></p>

  <p><span>As for how this will be reflected in </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> itself, there will be noticeable changes in-game to keep up with the story playing out outside of it, such as updates to maps, pre-match banter that reflects the current state of the story, and in-game events. The first of these events will have players siding with either Overwatch or Talon, similar to a Splatfest in </span><i><span>Splatoon</span></i><span>. The story will conclude in season six, with a new one kicking off in 2027.</span></p> <h2><b>10 heroes are coming in the next year, and five are out next week</b></h2> <p><span>One of the most immediate changes coming in season one is </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>getting five new heroes on February 10 right when the season starts. This includes previously teased DPS heroes Anran and Emre, as well as Vishkar Tank Domina and two support heroes named Jetpack Cat and Mizuki. But this is only half of the new heroes coming to the game in 2026. A new hero will launch in each of the next five seasons, and while we don’t know who they are yet, we have seen their silhouettes. One looks like a mech pilot similar to D.Va, while another looks like an Omnic.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000665330" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665330"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665330">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Sub-roles make characters more distinct</b></h2> <p><span>There are three roles in </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>, but Blizzard is making moves to bring more diversity to how they operate within those archetypes. This is coming in the form of sub-roles, which further divide up the three roles to give each hero a more personalized passive ability, rather than giving every Tank, DPS, or Support hero the same advantages. The breakdown is as follows:</span></p>

 <p><b>TANK</b></p> <p><b>Bruiser:</b><span> Reduces critical damage received. While at critical health, gain movement speed.</span></p> <p><span>Mauga / Orisa / Roadhog / Zarya</span></p> <p><b>Initiator:</b><span> Staying airborne lightly heals you.</span></p> <p><span>D.Va / Doomfist / Winston / Wrecking Ball</span></p> <p><b>Stalwart:</b><span> Reduces knockbacks and slows received.</span></p> <p><span>Domina / Hazard / Junker Queen / Ramattra / Reinhardt / Sigma</span></p> <p><b>DAMAGE</b></p> <p><b>Sharpshooter:</b><span> Critical hits reduce your movement ability cooldowns.</span></p> <p><span>Ashe / Cassidy / Hanzo / Sojourn / Widowmaker</span></p> <p><b>Flanker:</b><span> Health packs restore more health.</span></p> <p><span>Anran / Genji / Reaper / Tracer / Vendetta / Venture</span></p> <p><b>Specialist:</b><span> Eliminating an enemy briefly increases your reload speed.</span></p> <p><span>Bastion / Emre / Junkrat / Mei / Soldier: 76 / Symmetra / Torbjorn</span></p> <p><b>Recon:</b><span> You detect enemies below half health through walls after damaging them.</span></p> <p><span>Echo / Freja / Pharah / Sombra</span></p> <p><b>SUPPORT</b></p> <p><b>Tactitian:</b><span> You can gain excess ultimate charge which carries over after using your ultimate ability.</span></p>

 <p><span>Ana / Baptiste / Jetpack Cat / Lucio / Zenyatta</span></p> <p><b>Medic:</b><span> Healing allies with your weapon also heals you.</span></p> <p><span>Kiriko / Lifeweaver / Mercy / Moira</span></p> <p><b>Survivor:</b><span> Using a movement ability activates passive health regeneration.</span></p> <p><span>Brigitte / Illari / Juno / Mizuki / Wuyang&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Competitive refresh</b></h2> <p><span>The new season is also bringing a refresh to the competitive mode, with rewards like a new red Crimson Wolf competitive weapon variant, a Doomfist Diamond+ skin, challenger tier integration, FaceIt tournament invites, and rarity-based competitive titles coming in season two.</span></p> <h2><b>UI/UX update</b></h2> <p><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>will be getting a major UI overhaul completely revamping the hero gallery, social panel, home menu, and notification hub for “faster navigation” and “reduced friction.” This will also include a new 3D hero lobby in season one, which will expand to a full party in season four.</span></p> <h2><b>Stadium updates</b></h2> <p><span>Also getting a UI update is the build-based Stadium mode, which is getting reworked icons for easier readability, and a Hero Builder that gives you recommendations for your character’s build over the course of its long matches. Vendetta will also be joining the line-up for the mode.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000665322" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665322"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665322">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Skins and a </b><b><i>Hello Kitty </i></b><b>collaboration</b></h2> <p><span>Like in every </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>season, there will be new skins. Mercy is getting her second customizable Mythic Skin, which I’m sure everyone will be very normal about, while Mei will get her first one at the mid-season patch. The following six characters will also be getting new skins as part of a Sanrio collaboration:</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Juno – Hello Kitty</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Kiriko – Cinnamoroll</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Mercy – Pompompurin</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>D.Va – My Melody</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Widowmaker – Kuromi</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Lucio – Keroppi</span></li> </ul> <p><span>Other Mythics planned for future seasons include:</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Mythic Hero Skins: Soldier: 76, Ana, Illari, Mauga, and Genji</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Mythic Weapon Skins: Genji, Hanzo, and Sojourn</span></li> </ul> <h2><b>The return of Post-Match Accolades</b></h2> <p><span>The original </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>had a feature where you could vote to recognize players for their achievements, whether that be high damage output or time on an objective. Blizzard is bringing this back in a future update, but rather than just being cards like in the last game, they will show up on a new screen that will include everyone’s hero models with the skin they wore during the match.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000665328" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000665328"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000665328">© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>A Switch 2 upgrade</b></h2> <p><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>will finally be getting a Switch 2 update in season 2, so hopefully it becomes an actual playable experience on handheld because I’d love to play the game on the go so my dailies aren’t neglected when I’m traveling.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>All of this will kick off when season one begins on February 10, which will also be when </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>drops the </span><i><span>2 </span></i><span>and just becomes </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>again. I’m sure that will not be confusing for any database that has divided both games in two up to this point. </span></p>
