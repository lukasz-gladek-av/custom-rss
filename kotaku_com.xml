              <p>Anker’s Prime Docking Station is a 14-port hub that can power your laptop and accessories and drive dual monitors from a very small footprint. It comes in a sleek, vertically oriented case that can be placed on your desk. Up front, it has ports for charging your devices, and on the back side, ports for data, video, and networking access. There is also a small LED screen that shows which ports are currently active and how power is being distributed. The device can handle both power and data transfer simultaneously, with a maximum of 160W of power distribution and 10 Gbps of data speed, making it a powerful tool for organizing your various accessories.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">Click here to purchase the Anker Prime Docking Station for $170 on Amazon, discounted from its regular retail price of $270. This is a savings of $100, or 37% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A quick and easy way to perform cable management with all your devices</h2>
<p>The Anker Prime Docking Station includes four USB-C ports, five USB-A ports, dual HDMI ports, an Ethernet jack, and audio jacks. The two USB-C ports on the front of the dock can deliver up to 160W of power and charge up to two devices simultaneously. Each port can provide up to 100W to a single compatible laptop, allowing you to charge your laptop while working. The rear USB-C and USB-A data ports support transfer speeds up to 10 Gbps, enabling faster transfers of large files between external storage devices and your computer. Since all your peripherals are attached to the docking station via a single upstream USB-C connection, you don’t have to unplug any peripherals when you disconnect your laptop.</p>



<p>The Anker Prime Docking Station features dual HDMI outputs for connecting multiple external monitors to your laptop. For example, you can connect two separate 4K monitors at 60 Hz, giving you ample space to spread out multiple applications across both. Alternatively, if you prefer a simple layout, you can connect a single monitor and still have the second HDMI port available for a television or projector.</p>
<p>The Anker Prime Docking Station is compatible with USB-C, USB4, and Thunderbolt laptops that support DisplayPort Alt Mode and USB-C Power Delivery, including but not limited to: many Windows 10, Windows 11, and Chrome OS laptops. Mac laptops can also use the dock; however, the two external monitors will mirror each other instead of providing a traditional three-monitor desktop environment. Note that the dock is not compatible with Linux laptops, and some gaming laptops may require their own chargers to operate at optimal levels. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">At a discounted price of $170, down from $270, the Anker Prime Docking Station is an effective way to convert a single USB-C port into a powered 14-port desktop configuration.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Stranger Things Documentary Gave Season 5 Haters More Ammunition]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-documentary-chatgpt-reddit-2000659351</link>
            <guid>1404601</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Given the very loud fallout from </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-reaction-byler-acting-2000656424"><span>series finale</span></a><span> and a portion of the horror show’s fandom descending into </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-secret-finale-conformity-gate-explained-2000656704"><span>a mass hysteria</span></a><span> in believing that a secret ninth episode </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-conformity-gate-secret-netflix-crash-2000658155"><span>might fix the whole season</span></a><span>, I have to wonder if there were any conversations at Netflix about not releasing the </span><i><span>One Last Adventure: The Making of Stranger Things 5 </span></i><span>documentary that went live on the streaming service yesterday, January 12. Already, every word that series creators the Duffer Brothers had been uttering in interviews </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-finale-matt-duffer-interview-2000656663"><span>was being picked apart</span></a><span>, and now the conspiratorial mindset fueling that scrutiny has been given a lot of new wood to burn by the documentary.</span></p> <p><span>The two-hour documentary includes behind-the-scenes footage of the writers’ room and table readings, as well as the set of the show during shooting. In a world where </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>hadn’t been combed through by fans looking for any proof that a secret episode was coming, it could have been viewed as a surprisingly honest look at all the moving parts a production of this scale has to contend with. But there’s a segment of </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fans looking for any explanation as to how it all went wrong, and the documentary sure has a few moments that fans are latching onto.</span></p>

 <p><span>Some of the things people are pointing out are mostly speculative. In one section, the Duffer Brothers are shown with what fans believe to be </span><a href="https://x.com/PopCrave/status/2010896631034707994"><span>ChatGPT</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://x.com/SThingsMeme/status/2010679300282871909"><span>Reddit tabs</span></a><span> open on a computer while writing the script for a season five episode. The Reddit logo is pretty clear in one shot, but the ChatGPT one is more contested. Even so, these tabs being open doesn’t actually confirm anything, but detractors are running around with accusations that the Duffers used ChatGPT or relied on fan discussions on Reddit when making important creative decisions, all based on…open tabs? Let’s be serious.</span><span><br> </span></p>

 <p><span>As for more substantial stuff, a few scenes in the documentary have caught the eye of people critical of the season, and more specifically, of the Duffer Brothers. At one point during filming of the finale, Montana Maniscalco, the key production assistant on the show, says that the episode isn’t completely written yet, with the presumptive takeaway being that the Duffer Brothers must still be trying to figure out how the season is going to end this late into production.</span></p>

   <p><span>Other scenes of note include a moment in the writers’ room in which writer Paul Dichter said that there should be more monsters in the finale’s climactic battle, even going so far as to name the Demogorgon from season one as a potential foe for the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>crew to face in the final fight. He says it would be “crazy” if there was nothing there. Well, if you saw the finale, you know that’s exactly what happened, and it seems Dichter’s feedback was “ignored.”</span></p>

   <p><span>In another clip, Maya Hawke is seen discussing a moment her character shares with her girlfriend Vickie. Their relationship is a secret at this point in the story, and we see Hawke is saying she wants to have this conversation “in a whisper.” This, too, is being read in the most bad faith way, with the narrative being that Hawke is having to “remind” the crew about things the writers “forgot” about characters, rather than actors sharing ideas on how things should be played because they’re a part of this process, too, and might have opinions.</span></p>

   <p><span>I don’t mean to be dismissive of people who didn’t like the ending, but I have “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=asthkXjWWQ0"><span>played these games before</span></a><span>.” I know what it’s like to be searching for any justification for your disappointment and projecting narratives onto some pretty normal interactions in a creative space. I can’t speak for why they ignored Dichter’s note about the monsters, but Hawke’s point about tweaking that scene? That shit happens all the time in movies and TV. We had this same conversation when James Gunn and David Corenswet </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/auz1txQ5WVc"><span>had a debate about some lines in the </span><i><span>Superman </span></i><span>movie</span></a><span>. People reacted to it as if it was a “fight,” but this is literally just something that happens when you’re collaborating with someone else on a creative project.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I know the confirmation bias is too embedded in the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>fandom right now, with people still holding out hope that there’s another finale locked away in a vault somewhere waiting to fix everything. Y’all can keep fighting ghosts, but I do hope that the people who are still caught up in this conspiratorial cycle find their way out of it.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dysons-carboat-handheld-vacuum-drops-to-a-record-low-now-priced-like-a-budget-cleaner-2000659256</link>

              <p>If you have a car or boat, it can be difficult to keep things tidy if you don’t have an appropriately sized set of tools. A handheld vac is just what you need to save the day. We’ve found one that you’ll absolutely love using, and it won’t break the bank. The Dyson Car+Boat Handheld Vacuum delivers strong cordless suction in a compact form factor that’s perfect for tight spaces, using Dyson’s digital motor and cyclone technology to maintain consistent performance from start to finish. This handheld vacuum weighs about 4.2 pounds, making it easy to maneuver around vehicle interiors, storage compartments, and other confined areas without strain.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6749/">Head over to Amazon to get the Dyson Car+Boat Handheld Vacuum for just $229, down from its usual price of $299. That’s a discount of $70 and 23% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6749/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Compact Design With Serious Suction</h2>
<p>Designed specifically for mobile environments, the vacuum has super strong suction as well as a mini motorized tool that uses a rotating brush bar to lift dirt and hair from upholstery and carpets. A Crevice tool helps reach narrow gaps between seats or along trim lines, while the Combination tool transitions between a wide nozzle and soft brush for dusting hard surfaces.</p>
<p>These attachments connect directly to the vacuum body, so you don’t lose them somewhere else. Plus, the bin holds about 0.14 gallons of dirt and debris and uses Dyson’s point-and-shoot mechanism to get rid of extra dirt.</p>



<p>Cordless operation plays a major role in how this vacuum fits into real-world cleaning routines, eliminating the need to manage cords or find nearby outlets. The balanced handle design keeps weight centered in the hand, which helps during longer cleaning sessions across multiple surfaces. Two power settings let you prioritize either maximum runtime or increased suction depending on the mess you are dealing with. That means the vacuum is super flexible. It can handle loose dust, sand, pet hair, and embedded debris with confidence.</p>
<p>Battery performance remains consistent throughout the cleaning cycle, with fade-free suction designed to deliver steady airflow until the charge is depleted. Recharging is handled through the included charger, and the vacuum is ready for repeated use without complex setup. Plus, it has washable filters so you don’t have to keep spending money on things like that.</p>
<p>Beyond cars and boats, the vacuum adapts well to stairs, furniture, shelves, and other areas where larger machines feel cumbersome. The compact body makes storage simple, and switching attachments is quick when moving between different surfaces. Dyson includes a two-year warranty, adding reassurance around long-term reliability and support.If you want an easy to use vacuum that’s perfect for keeping your car or boat (or other vehicle or small space) tidy, this is a great choice to get started with.</p>

              <p>At the very end of 2025,&nbsp;<em>Witcher 3</em> developer CD Projekt Red announced it had sold its long-running PC gaming store GOG to CD Projekt and GOG co-founder Michał Kiciński. And while Kiciński launched GOG with its anti-DRM ethos, he’s been away from both companies for the last 13 years, and it was unknown if he might take the now independent storefront in a new direction. According to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-new-owner-of-gog-discusses-taking-on-steam-the-devil-of-drm-and-following-in-nightdives-footsteps">an interview with&nbsp;<em>GI.biz</em></a>, there are no fears of GOG backing down from its bold stance, even if it means missing out on lucrative AAA gaming sales.</p> <p>Then known as Good Old Games, the store was originally launched by Polish developer CDPR in 2008, with a focus on selling classic games that had become hard to get hold of, stripped free of old, decaying digital rights management software. As the store developed, it began selling newer games too, but always on the condition that they shipped without any form of DRM.</p>

 <p>In the late 2000s, DRM had become the cause of a huge amount of controversy, with games shipping on DVD-ROM with ludicrous, game-breaking restrictions, such as limits on how many times they could be installed, the inability to run fully installed games without the discs in drives, and most insidiously, online checks that meant games couldn’t be played without an active internet connection. Ostensibly in place to prevent the illusory threat of “piracy,” these restrictions only ever prevented legitimate game owners from playing their games freely, while pirated versions were usually stripped of all DRM by the first day of a game’s release. It was a farce. (And it still is, with DRM software in digital games now severely impeding performance.) GOG has been run for the last 18 years with a refusal to sell DRM-infected games.</p>

 <p>It’s good to know that time hasn’t changed Michał Kiciński’s position on the matter. Speaking to&nbsp;<em>GI.biz</em>, the new outright owner of GOG explained that after a bidding process against an unknown rival company, he succeeded in buying the company he created because he sees “opportunities” for the business. GOG made very little money for CDPR, but Kiciński believes there’s a route to more financial success, and he’s not exactly unambitious.</p>

 <p>“I see huge opportunities for GOG to grow,” Kiciński says. “And somebody might say that having a competitor like Steam with 80 percent of the market share is a huge obstacle, but to me it’s the opposite. I see: ‘Oh, there is one big competitor, it’ll be difficult for them to defend the market, because they already have 80 percent, so it should be easier to take the market from them.”</p>

 <p>The focus to try to do this is not to try to out-Steam Steam, but rather to “just be better at a certain segment.” This is the site’s focus on classic games, but also working with independent developers with big-game games who are willing to sell via GOG. Citing games like&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur</em> and&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, which were simultaneously released on GOG alongside Steam, it proves that outside of the mega-publishers, there are those willing to embrace GOG’s ethos. Oh, and as part of the sale it was agreed that CDPR’s games will remain on GOG for at least the next six years—that certainly helps.</p>

 <p>When it comes to refusing DRM, Kiciński tells&nbsp;<em>GI.biz</em> that it remains “a core value of GOG, and there’s no signs that it might die in any visible future,” describing this as both an ethical and pragmatic choice. And, with a refreshing frankness, he says he has no time for publishers who don’t get it. “Most corporate people, they make plain stupid decisions.”</p>

 <p>You can read the rest of the interview, along with details over whey the company was sold and its plans for the future, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-new-owner-of-gog-discusses-taking-on-steam-the-devil-of-drm-and-following-in-nightdives-footsteps">over on&nbsp;<em>GI.biz</em></a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Is Offloading TP-Link’s Tri-Band WiFi 6E Router at Its Lowest Price With 42% Off]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-is-offloading-tp-links-tri-band-wifi-6e-router-at-its-lowest-price-with-42-off-2000659062</link>
            <guid>1404496</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Built to improve Wi-Fi performance in large homes, the TP-Link AXE5400 Tri-Band Wi-Fi 6E Router delivers faster speeds and more reliable connectivity. With the addition of an extra 6 GHz band, Wi-Fi 6E expands on the two bands (5 GHz and 2.4 GHz) that have been standard in routers for years, giving each device more space on the airwaves and reducing congestion. The combined speeds of all three bands reach up to 5400 Mbps, enabling smooth, uninterrupted 4K and 8K video streaming while you continue browsing the Internet, chatting, and downloading files on other devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6748/">The TP-Link AXE5400 Tri-Band Wi-Fi 6E Router is now available on Amazon for $116, down from its usual price of $200, for a savings of $84, or 42%.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6748/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful router to improve your home Wi-Fi connection</h2>
<p>With the added 6 GHz band in the tri-band Wi-Fi 6E on the Archer AXE5400, there are three independent paths for traffic, making it ideal for applications such as gaming, video conferencing, or high-bitrate video streaming, where interruptions can be frustrating. Smart TVs, gaming consoles, and laptops typically run on the 5 GHz band, while smart home devices and general web surfing can use the 2.4 GHz band.</p>
<p>This router has true tri-band capabilities and OFDMA (Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access), so it can communicate with multiple devices simultaneously rather than waiting for each device to connect one by one. It also includes a 1.7 GHz quad-core processor and 512 MB of RAM to handle heavy traffic, especially when many devices are accessing the Internet simultaneously.</p>



<p>In addition to delivering the performance gains of Wi-Fi 6E, the router also offers advanced network security features that enhance protection and control. HomeShield tools included with the router include: basic network scans, identification of new devices connecting to the network, built-in Quality of Service (QoS) capabilities, and reporting to display network usage patterns over time. There are also basic parental controls and WPA3 encryption, providing an additional layer of security for compatible devices compared to WPA2-based equipment, as well as support for both a built-in VPN server and a VPN client to protect your traffic or securely access your home network from remote locations.</p>
<p>As for compatibility, the TP-Link AXE5400 Tri-Band Wi-Fi 6E Router works with major Internet Service Providers (ISPs), including but not limited to AT&amp;T, Verizon, Xfinity, Spectrum, Cox, CenturyLink, and Frontier. However, most cable and DSL connections require a separate modem, which must be purchased separately. The router itself provides Wi-Fi, plus wired Ethernet WAN and LAN ports, and a USB port for supported accessories so that you can mix wired desktop computers with wireless mobile phones and streaming devices. Plus, the TP-Link Tether app lets you set up the router from your smartphone. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6748/">Once operational, the router’s relatively small size makes it easy to fit next to your modem, and its $116 sale price is a better value than the $200 original list price.</a></p>
