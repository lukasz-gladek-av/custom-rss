              <p><span>Pearl Abyss has confirmed that its highly anticipated open-world single-player game </span><i><span>Crimson Desert</span></i><span> will “definitively” not feature any kind of microtransaction-laden cash shop or in-game storefront at launch. The MMO maker says the single-player game’s $70 price tag reflects the all inclusive “premium experience” players should expect.</span></p> <p><span>The promise comes from an interview with Pearl Abyss’ PR and Marketing Director Will Powers on the </span><a href="https://youtu.be/MR9QMXJuGx4?si=lGwFcuz26j_cWZIJ&amp;t=1468"><i><span>Dropped Frames</span></i></a><span> podcast. Powers was asked if the game would feature a similar monetization model to Pearl Abyss’ MMO </span><i><span>Black Desert Online</span></i><span>. “This is a premium game you buy one time,” replied Powers. “I don’t wanna say there’s zero MTX, because there are pre-order bonuses that we have, but anything that’s announced and that’s coming at launch is strictly cosmetic.”</span></p>

 <p><span>When asked if there was a chance that </span><i><span>Crimson Desert</span></i><span> might launch with any sort of “cash shop” feature, Powers doubled down. “No. I can say that definitively,” he continued. “There is not a cosmetic cash shop. This is made to be a premium experience that you buy, and you enjoy the world, and not something for microtransactions…This is a premium experience. That’s the transaction. Full stop.”</span></p> <p><span>The “transaction” Powers is referring to in this context is </span><i><span>Crimson Desert’s </span></i><span>$70 launch price, in contrast to </span><i><span>Black Desert Online’s </span></i><span>“buy-to-play” model, which consists of a one-off $10 purchase, which can be combined with separate cosmetic microtransactions and one-time DLC purchases that range from $30 to $50. It’s also become more common even for single-player RPGs like <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> and <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em> to include microtransaction shops full of content that can’t be earned just by playing the game.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>While the need to clarify this may come across as odd to some, it likely stemmed from the announcement of </span><i><span>Crimson Desert’s</span></i><span> $80 “Deluxe Edition” pre-order option, which features several cosmetic items, such as the Kairos armor set and the Exclaire horse armor. There’s also a $280 “Collectors Edition,” but I’d wager you’re probably not bothered about microtransactions if you’re shelling out for that anyway. </span></p>

 <p><span>Powers’ wording also doesn’t rule out the possibility of other, non-cosmetic forms of DLC in the future, which wouldn’t come as a surprise considering that, as of February 1st, more than two million people have already wishlisted </span><i><span>Crimson Desert</span></i><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s that time of year when millions of young girls learn what it takes to be an entrepreneur—Girl Scout cookie season! Selling cookies can be challenging, but for one 6-year-old, reaching record-breaking sales is a piece of cookie cake. All it took was some clever social media buildcrafting and algorithm exploits.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Pim Neill is a Daisy Scout in Pittsburgh. On Sunday, she finally made it to a whopping 100,000 cookie box sales in just a single season, blowing past the national record. </span><span>A modern girl in a modern world, Pim and her family made social media posts to promote her cookies to wild success.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Hi, my name is Pim. Do you wanna buy some Girl Scout cookies?” Pim asks in a TikTok, holding a box of Thin Mints. Her blue glasses match her Girl Scout vest, and she ends the video with a gracious, “Thank you.” The TikTok has over five million views.</span></p>   <p><span>While her astronomical success may be attributed to the internet, that isn’t stopping Pim from also putting in the work the traditional way: going door-to-door in her neighborhood.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Pim wanted to join the Girl Scouts because when she was 3, she saw the girls selling cookies,” Luke Anorak-Neill, Pim’s dad, </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/pim-neill-girl-scout-cookies-record/"><span>told</span></a><span> CBS Pittsburgh. “This whole thing started by her observing girls performing what most people think is the only thing Girl Scouts do, and that’s sell Girl Scout cookies.”</span></p>

 <p><span>At first, Anorak-Neill had trouble finding a troop for Pim to join. “Our first troop, unfortunately, when we tried to join and ask questions about joining, the lady said that Pim’s disabilities would hold back the troop, and they didn’t want her to join,” he said. “And that was really disappointing, but I decided she must not speak for all Girl Scouts as a whole.”</span></p> <p><span>Pim was turned away from another troop for being too young. But finally, her family eventually found a match: a kindergarten-only troop where she is now a Daisy Scout with 10 other girls. </span><span>She began her history-making cookie campaign at the start of January. “We’ve had so much support from Girl Scouts navigating it,” said Anorak-Neill. “We’ve had a lot of support, and we’re just excited that we’re inspiring so many more girls.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Pim’s favorite cookies are Thin Mints, but she has also grown a liking for Samoas. You can buy Thin Mints, Samoas, and more from </span><a href="https://digitalcookie.girlscouts.org/scout/pim391562"><span>Pim’s digital storefront</span></a><span> until March 22.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Highguard Dev Bullied By Toxic Gamers Into Deleting Post About Toxic Gamers]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguard-developer-delete-post-toxic-reviews-2000669452</link>
            <guid>1437502</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, recently laid off <em>Highguard</em> developer Josh Sobel opened up about what it felt like revealing the game <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137">at the Game Awards 2025</a>&nbsp;and then watching some of the loudest parts of the internet dunk on the game up through its January launch. One of the things he called out was people <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-dev-who-just-lost-his-job-calls-out-toxic-online-reaction-2000668306">“gleefully” trying to manifest</a> the online hero shooter’s immediate downfall. The response to his earnest inside look at having worked on the game was immediately greeted by such a harsh and toxic backlash he’s now deleted the post as well as the rest of his account.</p> <p>“I’m not saying our failure is purely the fault of gamer culture and that the game would have thrived without the negative discourse, but it absolutely played a role. All products are at the whims of the consumers, and the consumers put absurd amounts of effort into slandering&nbsp;<em>Highguard</em>. And it worked,” Sobel wrote on X on February 12, just days after Wildlight Entertainment <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-studio-developer-layoffs-wildlight-entertainment-2000667841">announced sweeping staff cuts</a>.</p>

 <p>The post kicked off a fresh firestorm from a diffuse mob of angry online gamers and social media clout chasers who used the message to attack <em>Highguard</em>‘s developers as out of touch. They were accused of trying to deflect blame for making a game that just didn’t connect with many players. As happened with<em> Concord</em> before it, some people started looking for any post by anybody who worked on <em>Highguard</em> that they could find to start dunking on the person and the game.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Update:</p> <p>Josh Sobel has now deleted his X account entirely, just days after publishing an article blaming gamers for Highguard’s failure.</p> <p>Looks like the deflection didn’t land the way he expected. <a href="https://t.co/IQCneqclUm">https://t.co/IQCneqclUm</a> <a href="https://t.co/faxHwewyK4">pic.twitter.com/faxHwewyK4</a></p> <p>— MasteroftheTDS (@MasteroftheTDS) <a href="https://twitter.com/MasteroftheTDS/status/2023075675348074690?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Look, a few different things can be true here at same time. According to the <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/2022730613141442903">data firm Ampere Analysis</a>, an estimated 1.54 million people played <em>Highguard</em> last month. That’s around what Palworld hit when it launched. In other words, tons of people tried <em>Highguard</em> and then didn’t come back. That already makes it completely different from the apathy bomb Concord launched into. It also suggests that despite despite all the people trying to “manifest” failure on social media, <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em> had its shot</a> to find a big audience and just couldn’t capitalize.</p>

 <p>But it’s also true that regardless of whether it had any impact on initial downloads and playtime, anyone who paid attention to <em>Highguard</em> at all during it’s launch would have though the developers had advertised the game by dropping kittens off rooftops. Thousands of negative reviews by people who barely played a single match did get posted to Steam and plenty of people online were jonesing for a “Concord 2.0” flameout.</p>

 <p>Even if you think Sobel’s argument that an artificial gravity well of bad-faith negativity hurt the game is wrong, it still sucks that it happened. It’s also, frankly, bizarre. Another overlooked point made by the developer who, remember, had just lost his job working on his dream game, was that Wildlight Entertainment was not some mega publisher chasing market fits on a spreadsheet. <em>Highguard</em> was not a live service game designed in a lab by Excel.</p> <p>Not every game can succeed. Even great ones fail. But you can’t <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192">champion risk-taking in game development</a> while also engaging in witch hunts against people just for placing bets you don’t like.</p>
