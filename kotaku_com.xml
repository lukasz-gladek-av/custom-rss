The device, which costs $200, works like a charm and is quietly one of the best things Sony has made in some time. However, the Portal’s one big flaw was that, for some reason, it couldn’t stream games from the cloud. You had to own a PS5 and, when using the Portal, your PS5 would turn on and play your game remotely. It meant that the PS Portal was more an accessory than a console. But that changes today. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/19/the-playstation-portal-remote-player-experience-to-evolve-with-new-system-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On November 19, PlayStation released the latest update</a></span> for the PS Portal and while it adds some nice quality-of-life upgrades regarding sound settings, the real news is that starting today, players can play a selection of PS5 games via the cloud and without a console. In theory, you can now play PS5 games while out and about, assuming you have a wifi connection. </p><p>Sony says that over 120 PS5 games included in the PS Plus Game Catalog can be streamed on PS Portal after today’s update. The games include <em>Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Monster Hunter Rise, Ghost of Tsushima, </em>and <em>Dave the Diver.</em></p><h2 id="h71427"><a id=""></a> How to stream cloud games on your PS Portal</h2><p>To start streaming PS5 games on your <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-hacked-psp-gta-liberty-city-google-1851270852&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-hacked-psp-gta-liberty-city-google-1851270852">PS Portal</a></span> without a console, you’ll need an active PS Plus Premium subscription, and then you’ll have to download the update and follow these steps:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>Open “Quick Menu” and access “Settings” on your PS Portal.</li><li>Select the “Cloud Streaming (Beta)” button</li><li>Switch the Cloud Streaming (Beta) toggle on (this will be off by default).</li></ol></blockquote><p>At the moment, Sony is calling this a beta test, and not all features, like the capture button and party chat, will be supported in these streaming games on Portal. Likewise, Sony doesn’t currently support PS2, PS3, or PS4 games or purchased PSN games. </p><p>Hopefully, after testing and more updates, Sony will expand support and turn the PS Portal into a badass PlayStation streaming device capable of playing all those classic games added to the catalog each month as well as games you own.

Everybody brings their own special personal connection to the game.”</p><p>One of the big questions was why the<em> Minecraft </em>movie is live-action with tons of VFX instead of just being completely CGI-animated as fans may have expected a movie based on the hit survival crafting game to be. A fan-made trailer that was basically a shot-for-shot remake of the official one, only in <em>Minecraft</em> itself, seemed designed to provoke this question and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/Alumio_/status/1832765840925880633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1832765840925880633%7Ctwgr%5Ecbd372b14163693df74e0e787bdb42aa4565b322%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fdivisive-minecraft-movie-trailer-remade-in-animated-style-and-fans-love-it&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/Alumio_/status/1832765840925880633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1832765840925880633%7Ctwgr%5Ecbd372b14163693df74e0e787bdb42aa4565b322%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fdivisive-minecraft-movie-trailer-remade-in-animated-style-and-fans-love-it" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quickly went viral</a></span>. </p><p> “I mean, that was one of the things [fans were saying in response to the trailer]: ‘Why is it live action? Why isn’t it animated?’ I think a lot of people were expecting that, and just the fact that there was live action and directly real-life characters and physical sets didn’t feel right with them, because in their imagination, they’ve been playing it for a very long time,” Olafsson told <em>IGN</em>. “And they’ve kind of projected and seen a bunch of content obviously that’s been made both by us, the community, we’ve made a story mode. We made animated content before, and there’s a lot of it out there.”</p><p> Olafsson explained that one of the reasons to do a live-action adaptation was precisely because it was different and hadn’t already been done before. It was also something that had been put in motion long ago. Warner Bros. began working with <em>Minecraft</em> maker Mojang to produce a movie as far back as 2014, and the current version set to release in 2025 is the result of a long and messy process, with the project changing creative hands several times. </p><p> “This movie’s been in development for a very, very long time,” Olafsson said. “A lot of the people who will see it were not born when the first contracts and the first discussions were had, and there was always going to be live action.” </p><p>According to Hess, there were also a lot of things, like Momoa using the crafting table, that just didn’t come across right in the rapidly edited context of the initial trailer. The duo seem confident that the way those gameplay elements are communicated and fleshed out in the movie itself will make a lot more sense to long-time fans. </p><p>Apparently, early test audiences agree. The pair say early screenings of the <em>Minecraft </em>movie, even without completed VFX, have garnered positive feedback, unlike that first trailer. “People are like, ‘This is nothing like the trailer. This movie is awesome,’” Olafsson said. The movie is set to release on April 4 of next year. A second trailer, released today, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-official-trailer-jack-black-game-music-1851703319&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-official-trailer-jack-black-game-music-1851703319">looks a lot better</a></span>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
