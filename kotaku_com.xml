            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s <a href="https://youtu.be/YRtWz4NVYXA">a fun moment</a> in <i>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</i> where, if you position the camera over Snake’s head while standing in a location from the first <i>MGS</i>, Snake will deliver the following line:</p> <blockquote><p>Ah. Overhead view. Just like old times. Now you’re talking. Overhead view. That’s more like it.</p></blockquote> <p>It’s a reference, of course, to what had been the default camera style of <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> for quite some time, as well as many action games from earlier eras. But where I really think this style of fixed, or at least independent, camera angles shined was in old school 3D horror games. And in recently playing two older horror titles–the first <i>Silent Hill</i> and <i>Resident Evil 0</i>–I’ve found myself quoting Snake, sharing his enthusiasm for what those classic camera angles deliver.</p> <p>The pivot in recent decades that’s seen every big-budget action game, horror or not, need to be third- or first-person started, I suspect, after <i>Resident Evil 4</i> made such a huge splash in 2005. iIt was certainly not the first game to use such a perspective, but it marked a huge, and hugely successful, departure for <i>RE </i>as a series–so successful that it may have made more fixed camera angles start to feel dated and obsolete. I think we’ve lost something in that mass transition, a special kind of experience that made for some unique cinematic moments. And nowhere is this more apparent than in horror games. Consider this early moment from <i>Silent Hill</i>:</p>

  <p>The way the camera pulls back from Harry and twists over the alleyway adds to the unnerving sense that you’re entering some kind of strange reality; there’s a sense of control that’s taken away from you as the player. Moments like this aren’t possible when the camera is tethered to a character’s back like it is in modern games; it certainly wouldn’t feel as seamless and dreamlike if a modern third-person action game just yanked the camera control away from the playerEven in describing this moment, I’m using a kind of language I rarely do when talking about in modern games: What the camera is <i>doing</i>, how it frames the <i>scene</i>.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636062" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636062"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636062">© Screenshot: Konami / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But this lack of control over the camera also adds to the horror. In replaying <i>SH</i> recently, I’ve noticed that without that control, the foggy alleyways of Silent Hill and the dark rusted spaces of the Otherworld also feel less in my control, amplifying the fear and adding a bit of directorial intention behind how a scene was framed.</p>

 <p>The original <i>Resident Evil</i> games demonstrate this well, too. Take <a href="https://youtu.be/2_dn-L9hPLM?t=5579">this scene in the first <i>RE</i></a>. As Chris descends the stairs, the camera remains at the top with a Dutch angle (a term we’d rarely use to describe an interactive scene in a modern action game). It makes the stairs feel more ominous. It conveys a feeling of descending into the unknown that wouldn’t be there without an independent camera that intentionally framed the action in a certain way.</p>

   <p>I also love how camera shifts change the sense of place in these games. Again, original <i>Resident Evil </i>games do this all the time and to great effect. Early on in <i>Resident Evil 0</i>, Rebecca encounters a massive scorpion. Standard stuff for <i>RE</i>. But first, in a cutscene, she hears it outside of the train she’s exploring. And <a href="https://youtu.be/Anm_F89z7ks?t=1497">just before you leave the room</a>, the camera shifts to a position outside the train, where we can see Rebecca through a window. The audio also shifts to place you outside of the train. You can hear the wind, the drops of rain pelting the plate glass of the window. You can’t see the monster yet, but you know it’s out there; it’s a preview of that outside space where you know the monster is lurking, waiting to pounce, and it conveys a cinematic sense of space, one that stretches beyond the location of your character.</p>   <p>Don’t get me wrong: I love a good third-person shooter with a freely rotatable camera. But there’s a cinematic language that we just don’t see as often in games anymore with the death of fixed and independent cameras. It makes me wish that in addition to first- and third-person perspectives in the upcoming <i>Resident Evil: Requiem</i>, there’d also be a classic, cinematic style camera as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve dabbled at all in playing the original <i>Doom</i> or <i>Doom 2</i> on PC, you’ve likely used GZDoom before: It’s one of many “source ports” of the original <i>Doom </i>engine out there. Some ports are more suited for multiplayer, others offer more modern features like jumping and freelook (heathens!), and GZDoom is arguably the most popular after 20 years of history in the <i>Doom</i> modding scene.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/openai-chatgpt-erotica-mental-health-age-verification-sam-altman-2000635632">OpenAI Is Pivoting To Porn</a></p> <p>A fork from the previously popular ZDoom, it was published by Christoph Oelckers, known as Graf Zahl, in 2005. Graf has a reputation in the scene as somewhat of a feather ruffler, sometimes <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/ns6jbe/video_games_how_an_avantgarde_doom_mod_angered_an/">described as “elitist</a>” and prone to rash actions–the latest of which was sticking some <a href="https://kotaku.com/openai-chatgpt-erotica-mental-health-age-verification-sam-altman-2000635632">ChatGPT-written code</a> into GZDoom and, well, it’s going down about as well as you might expect.</p>

 <h2>Graf Zahl on using AI-written code: ‘fuck it!’</h2> <p>Graf Zahl justified his use of AI-written code in an amusing <a href="https://github.com/Zdoom/gzdoom/commit/584af500736b0317e42824f39285ed3d954fc4e2">exchange on GitHub</a> (h/t <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-modders-fall-into-civil-war-as-devs-launch-new-engine-in-protest-at-gzdoom-creators-leadership-and-use-of-chatgpt"><i>Rock Paper Shotgun</i></a>), saying in response to someone taking issue with it:</p> <blockquote><p>everybody is using AI for boilerplate code these days those who act as unreasonable as you did here will lose out in the end and be ridiculed.</p></blockquote> <p>This silliness follows a public <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/many-developers-leave-gzdoom-due-to-leader-conflicts-and-fork-it-into-uzdoom/">declaration on GZDoom’s Discord</a> that some folks working on the project were leaving their work on GZDoom behind to start work on a new fork, <a href="https://github.com/UZDoom/UZDoom">UZDoom</a>, which aims to carry over all of GZDoom’s beloved features. Unsurprisingly, “conflict [with] GZDoom’s lead developer/maintainer Graf Zahl” sparked the schism.</p>

 <h2>‘Ohh God please no. Spare gzdoom from the drama’</h2> <p>A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boomershooters/comments/1o6yw7o/important_announcement_regarding_the_gzdoom/">now-locked post</a> over on r/boomershooters gives further insight into how Zahl’s actions have gone over with the community. “Ohh God please no. Spare gzdoom from the drama” reads one post, speaking to the frustration over the inclusion of the code and the inevitable back and forth Internet Debates™ likely to spawn from any discussion of AI and LLMs.</p>

 <p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boomershooters/comments/1o6yw7o/comment/njk1pxu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one comment thread documents</a>, the LLM-added code was rejected and “it’s safe to say that the only versions of the port that have this wonky code are the latest dev builds,” meaning current public releases are likely still AI-free.</p> <p>Who knows how long that’ll last, though? Might be time to consider a new source port for your favorite WADs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>An Aipom’s paw curls today. </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is out now, and that means that all those </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>leaked Mega Evolutions are real</span></a><span>, and fans must contend with all these new forms of their old faves. Starmie, the ethereal, possibly alien starfish Pokémon, is one of the monsters that I have loved for years, even if it didn’t quite make it on my team in most games outside of Generation I. The jewel-wearing Pokémon has had plenty of fan-made Mega Evolution concepts that lean into its inherent beauty and possible cosmic origins. Game Freak had an opportunity to make a Mega Starmie worthy of the original, and instead, we got one of the silliest, least interesting Mega Evolutions in the series.</span></p>  <p><span>Mega Starmie was one of the many </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>Mega Evolutions whose description leaked ahead of the game, and essentially it boiled down to “its limbs get longer.” Yes, Mega Starmie’s arms and legs grow, giving it more humanoid proportions, but that doesn’t sum up just how goofy this thing looks as it’s running around on two legs. I had known about Mega Starmie’s concept for months, and even I wasn’t prepared for the horror of watching a once elegant, unknowable Pokémon turn into a cunty gremlin version of Patrick Star from </span><i><span>SpongeBob SquarePants</span></i><span>. I had months to process the basic concept, but a lot of fans aren’t watching leaks in the months leading up to launch and are just now seeing this monstrosity. Many are not taking it well, or at least they’re making some good shitposts.</span></p>

            <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Truly<br>one of the creatures to have been designed <a href="https://t.co/NgzUN7CgLx">pic.twitter.com/NgzUN7CgLx</a></p> <p>— Pr Quote (@pr_quote) <a href="https://twitter.com/pr_quote/status/1978681819772944711?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>According to the Pokédex,&nbsp; Mega Starmie’s more humanlike behavior could either be an attempt to communicate with humankind or something more insidious, like trying to replace humans. Both of those thoughts are equally horrifying because if Starmie isn’t trying to supplant us, it’s saying we all run around like something out of a Hanna-Barbera cartoon? That’s a sick burn, actually.</span></p>

 <p><span>The concept of a Starmie with longer limbs isn’t inherently the problem, as fans have been making mock-ups of the design based on the leaked description for months, and there are some cool ones out there.&nbsp;</span></p>    <p><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>adds over 20 new Mega Evolutions, and while there are some bangers, I am a bit disappointed in the cool-to-goofy ratio. I love me a silly little guy, but a lot of these Mega Evolutions come off more like gags than anything else. At least I have Mega Raichu to look forward to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><span>when the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC comes out</span></a><span>.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We just zoomed right on by Amazon’s final Prime member sales even of the year. We’re now in a bit of a no man’s zone before we get to Black Friday weekend and Cyber Monday. And yet, even though we’re in this deals desert, it’s not impossible to find an oasis of savings if you look hard enough. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4812/">Like right now, Amazon has this Kamrui mini PC going for 19% off. It’s normally priced at $209, but for a limited time, you can scoop one up for just $169</a>. That works out to a savings of $40.</p>
<p>Taking a peak under the tiny hood of this 2025 Kamrui mini PC, you’ll find a Twin Lake-N N150 four-core, four-thread processor with an integrated graphics card. Among that, you’ll also see 16GB of RAM and a full 512GB SSD for file storage. If that’s not enough for your needs, the M.2 PCIe 3.0 NVMe SSD slot is expandable to up to 2TB. With these specs, you can expect a quick system startup time and fast loading of your documents and data.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4812/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>As far as connectivity goes, the Kamrui Essenx E1 Mini PC is equipped with a multi-functional interface that include two USB-A 3.2 ports, two USB-A 2.0 ports, a DisplayPort 1.4, and HDMI 2.0 port, a Gigabit Ethernet port, plus audio intake and outtake. The HDMI and DisplayPort together means you can connect to two different displays at once. It’s capable of displaying in up to 4K.</p>
<h2>Why Get a Mini?</h2>
<p>So the obvious appeal of a mini PC its its footprint. The Kamrui Essenx E1 Mini PC measures in at only 3.96 inches long and wide and 1.57 inches tall. That shakes out to only about one tenth the size of a standard desktop PC. The ultra-compact form factor means you can dedicate more of your desk to other things like your books or perhaps a second monitor.</p>



<p>Mini PCs also work great as a multimedia hub for a home theater. Sure, most TVs nowadays come with smart features, and even if yours doesn’t, streaming sticks are cheap to come by. That said, a mini PC can provide you with more versatility as its running Window. Thus, you’ll have a wider range of formats supported when playing videos locally or from a PLEX server. Heck, the mini PC itself can serve as your PLEX server if you wish.</p>
<p>Save yourself a solid $40 for a limited time when you pick up the Kamrui Essenx E1 Mini PC at Amazon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Staring at another low-battery warning just when you’re about to leave home is the kind of modern frustration no one needs: A reliable wall charger (with several ports) has quietly become one of those gadgets we can’t go a day without. That’s where the <em>Baseus</em> 100W USB‑C wall charger comes in, and right now it’s sitting at an all‑time low price on Amazon: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4261/">three‑port power block has dropped to just $34, down from $49.99</a>, as Amazon clears out the last of its post–Prime Day stock.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4261/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power, and a Compact Build</h2>
<p>The <em>Baseus</em> version produces <strong>up to 100W of charging juice in the form of a single USB-C outlet</strong>, which is enough to fast-charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro from dead to nearly full charge in roughly an hour and a half. It’s <strong>PD 3.0 protocol compatible</strong> meaning it speaks the same charging “language” that most current laptops, tablets, and phones speak so you get the maximum speed you can get without heating up your devices.</p>



<p>What’s more, <strong>its prongs are collapsible so it easily fits in a pocket or laptop sleeve</strong> and takes up very little real estate in a carry-on. It’s meant for the frequent flier or commuter who wouldn’t be interested in having some battery brick taking up valuable space on the wall or acting as luggage dead weight. And in the form of a charger for its rated capacity, it packs well – only slightly larger than your average single‑port telephone adapter.</p>
<p>If you’ve been struggling with having to tote up multiple chargers or are tired of lugging a laptop brick with you, the <em>Baseus</em> 100W wall charger is more than worth snapping up at this all-time low right now. Offers like this almost never stay around after the last batch goes through them, and this one hits almost all the right buttons.</p>

              <p>Halloween is a great time to rewatch the classics like Harry Potter, and what better way to relive your favorite moments than with a fun Lego build? Lego has quite a few Harry Potter sets to choose from, but if you’re after something that’s easy to make and doesn’t cost too much, the Aragog in the Forbidden Forest set is a great option to consider.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4814/">It normally runs you around $20, but Amazon is offering it for just $16 after a sweet 20% discount.</a> You’re saving $4 on this budget build that’s fun to work on, and also makes a great gift for any Harry Potter fan out there.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4814/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bring Your Favorite Scenes to Life</h2>
<p>This set comes with 195 pieces and is appropriate for ages 7 and above. You’re getting Harry Potter and Ron Weasley minifigures with two wands and a lantern to guide them through the forest. You can choose between happy or scared faces, depending on the scene you’re trying to recreate. Though honestly, a scared Weasley feels a lot more fitting than a happy one.</p>
<p>There’s a fairly big Aragog figure, whose legs, fangs, and pedipalps are all movable, so you can create your own dramatic setups. The Aragog figure measures about 2.5 inches high, 6 inches long, and 7 inches wide. Plus, you’ve also got a small buildable forest section with plants, a spider web, and two baby spider figures. There’s a lot of room for creativity, so this set is sure to keep your little ones (or you) engaged for the weekend.</p>



<p>The included instruction manual guides you through the building process step-by-step. If that seems a bit too complicated, you can install the Lego Builder app on your phone. It lets you zoom in on the blocks, rotate your sets in 3D, and track your progress in real time.</p>
<p>If you’re a Harry Potter fan and want to introduce your kids to the wizarding world too, this Lego set is a great way to get started. It’s going to be a fun weekend project, and can also look great as a display piece. If you already own a set or two, place it with the rest of your collection to build your own version of magical adventures. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4814/">This set was already quite affordable at $20, but this deal brings it down to just $16.</a> The discount, however, might not last too long, so we suggest hurrying to grab it.</p>
