A translated feedback sheet says that the design Game Freak had in the works too closely resembled fan mock-ups, which led to the team shelving the idea. Unfortunately, we don’t have any images of the flying fox at the moment.</p><p>That being said, the way fan artists were able to respond to the news by immediately whipping out their existing mock-ups of the hypothetical Eeveelution kind of suggests that Game Freak’s own ideas were likely being cannibalized by fan artists at the time, too. Eevee’s entire schtick is that it can evolve into one of several Pokémon, each with a different elemental affinity, so fans have been drawing mockups of possible Eevee evolutionary lines for decades, including flying-types.</p><p>Eevee is one of the most popular Pokémon in the franchise, having become a secondary mascot to the series alongside Pikachu. Eevee even got its own game in 2018’s <em>Let’s Go, Eevee! </em>on the Switch. It’s been a long time, however, since it got a new evolution, with the last being Sylveon, who debuted in 2013 as one of the introductions to the fairy typing that was added in <em>Pokémon X </em>and <em>Y</em>. Whether or not Eevee needs more evolutions remains a topic of much debate among fans, with some content with the eight it already has, while others would like to see Eevee get a form for all 18 elemental types in the series. It sounds like Game Freak isn’t opposed to the idea, as long as it can find one that feels wholly original, and given how long people have been making fan art of fake Pokémon, that sounds like a difficult proposition. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With a bunch of sales going right now on every imaginable storefront, it’s a great time to pick up a great horror game or two, and I think the <em>Oxenfree </em>games are a perfect one-two punch for the season. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="192716" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Horror Game You've Never Heard Of Is Scientifically The Scariest Ever" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="174" data-playlist="192716,196215,195670" data-current="192716"><div><p>Horror Game You've Never Heard Of Is Scientifically The Scariest Ever</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192716/192716_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192716/192716_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192716/192716_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192716/192716_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18169.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As it so happens, the critically acclaimed narrative games from Night School Studio, including the seminal indie title <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/oxenfree-the-kotaku-review-1753813513&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/oxenfree-the-kotaku-review-1753813513"><em>Oxenfree</em></a></span> from 2016 and its 2023 sequel, are both heavily discounted on Steam right now. I’ve highlighted a number of shockingly low deals in my time doing this, but I don’t think I’ve ever spotted a deal as good as this one: <strong>both <em>Oxenfree </em>and </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-review-night-school-netflix-1850628828&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/oxenfree-2-lost-signals-review-night-school-netflix-1850628828"><em><strong>Oxenfree II: Lost Signals</strong></em></a></span>&nbsp;<strong>will run you just $3 till November 4.</strong><br></p><p>Why is this such a steal? Besides the low low price of approximately three Arizona drinks, the <em>Oxenfree </em>games are just some of the most effective minimalist horror in the medium. At their simplest, they are 2D side-scrolling narrative games featuring branching dialogue options. But <em>Oxenfree </em>distinguishes itself with some exceptionally grounded writing, bringing to life its teenage and later young-adult casts as they unearth ghosts both real and imagined.<br></p><p>In the first game, a crew of teenagers goes to Edwards Island, a tourist trap off the coast of their hometown that’s also a famously “haunted” locale. On the night that Alex, her stepbrother Jonas, and the rest of their friends depart for the island, they start picking up weird radio signals and wavelengths that begin to open what can only be described as a schism between worlds. The angular portals that begin appearing around Edwards Island invite other kinds of beings into Alex’s reality, at which point the crew stops being able to discern reality from the tricks of otherworldly spirits.</p><p>I love intimate stories driven by characters rather than larger plot machinations. A good character study is one of the most enjoyable things a story can deliver, and that’s what <em>Oxenfree </em>really is. While both games are set against hauntings, possessions, historical tragedies, and even the goings-on of a cult, they <em>mostly </em>center on the unraveling of the leads, characters so tightly wound that they need ghosts to shake loose traumas that therapy could barely touch. Alex and her friends—as well as Riley and Jacob in the sequel—are each holding onto <em>a lot </em>before their fateful encounters, but they walk away from these experiences fundamentally changed, and as players who learn to love them, we hope, at least, that it’s for the better.<br></p><p>The oft-unspoken highlight of these games, though, is their runtime. The first game can be finished in about five hours, meaning that if you simply sit on your couch tonight and play it straight through to the end, you can be in bed at a completely reasonable time. That then sets the stage for you to enjoy the slightly bigger, and similarly ambitious, sequel (which clocks in at between 6-8 hours) tomorrow on Halloween. Remember when I called this pick-up a one-two punch? That’s what I meant.<br></p><p>For an even sweeter deal, you can <strong>pick up both <em>Oxenfree </em>games, the soundtrack to the first game, and even <em>Afterparty</em>, one of Night School’s more underrated titles about drinking your way out of Hell, for about $3. </strong>No matter how you slice it, this deal is out of this world.<br></p><p>Even if you don’t specifically enjoy these games just in time for Halloween, the fall is a notoriously spooky season. Make a weekend out of enjoying <em>Oxenfree</em>, that’s what I did when I played the first game! If you ever need a low-key and casual scary time, and you don’t want to watch a movie or show, why not pop on these two games? They’re as good as any season of TV, they’re relatively easy commitments, and they’re both incredibly thoughtful coming-of-age stories set at two completely different stages of life, because we’re always growing, we’re always learning, and more importantly, we’re all haunted by something. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This is what makes their lack of explanation bewildering. It’s easy to have an inkling of what their purpose is, but figuring out how they work isn’t as simple. Here’s our breakdown of what each Battle Assist setting does and how to change them.</p><h2 id="h20182"><a id=""></a><strong>How to Adjust Battle Assist Settings</strong></h2><p><strong>You can freely toggle the various Battle Assist options by entering the Options Menu and then scrolling down to Accessibility.</strong> There are a lot of things to tinker with here, but a majority of them are different Assist features.

Once you’re in an actual fight, you can’t access this menu and the associated settings anymore.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="520539f8bd819bb58c7c20f0cb798aa9" data-recommend-id="image://520539f8bd819bb58c7c20f0cb798aa9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gohan punches Majin Buu on the ground, with a blue aura surrounding him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gohan punches Majin Buu on the ground, with a blue aura surrounding him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="520539f8bd819bb58c7c20f0cb798aa9" data-recommend-id="image://520539f8bd819bb58c7c20f0cb798aa9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gohan punches Majin Buu on the ground, with a blue aura surrounding him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Performing combos can take a bit of knowhow in this game. You’ll need to string along different melee rush attacks (X/Square) and projectile Ki blasts (Y/Triangle) together. Using the same attack patterns will drop a combo, so you need to keep things fresh. Remembering what you haven’t used yet to keep the attacks coming can be surprisingly difficult at first. Though these basic combos are primarily just two buttons, it’s enough to create a sizeable difference in damage between those who know the systems and those who mash away.</p><p>From what I can tell, <strong>Combo Assist is supposed to help by outputting an ideal attack to keep the combo up.</strong> I believe it does this by switching between rush attacks and ki blasts for you. This is the only assist feature I don’t recommend using, since I could not consistently trigger it in my time of testing. Sometimes I could use one button to get a longer-than-usual combo out and at other times there was no difference. Attempting to trigger it by intentionally pressing the wrong button for a combo felt inconsistent as well.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="06837ff3e23d656f45d0063f40f5299e" data-recommend-id="image://06837ff3e23d656f45d0063f40f5299e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gohan uses a two-handed smash attack to launch Majin Buu towards the ground." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gohan uses a two-handed smash attack to launch Majin Buu towards the ground." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="06837ff3e23d656f45d0063f40f5299e" data-recommend-id="image://06837ff3e23d656f45d0063f40f5299e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gohan uses a two-handed smash attack to launch Majin Buu towards the ground." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Many would think there aren’t many options after launching an opponent halfway across a map, but that isn’t the case in <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>.

Moving on the D-pad with classic controls is fine, but using the stick can be unreliable due to how precise it is.</p><p>It’s awesome that this is included, although I will say it’s not the most practical. The time it takes to activate isn’t great in a fast-paced game like this. Accidentally activating it and wasting your Ki doesn’t feel great either.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2ef28d9ed195298c11bf3201af3cc280" data-recommend-id="image://2ef28d9ed195298c11bf3201af3cc280" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Midway through flying, Gohan rears back to throw a punch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Midway through flying, Gohan rears back to throw a punch." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2ef28d9ed195298c11bf3201af3cc280" data-recommend-id="image://2ef28d9ed195298c11bf3201af3cc280" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Midway through flying, Gohan rears back to throw a punch." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Sometimes you don’t want to do anything fancy and just want to fly in and hit your opponent with a heavy punch. The timing of that can be awkward when everyone’s moving around at high speeds. <strong>Dragon Dash Attack Assist aims to make this easier by automatically throwing out an attack when your dash is in close range to the enemy.</strong></p><p>I find this to be a great idea but with some messy execution. Landing an attack from a homing Dragon Dash is fine, but it’s pretty hit or miss if you’re trying to connect while flying around. The timing of when the melee attack comes out is awkward too, since the animation takes a while and you need to be very close to begin with.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="06d586fba1e01b8184642d0295003426" data-recommend-id="image://06d586fba1e01b8184642d0295003426" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Majin Buu attempts to kick a guarding Gohan." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Majin Buu attempts to kick a guarding Gohan." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="06d586fba1e01b8184642d0295003426" data-recommend-id="image://06d586fba1e01b8184642d0295003426" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Majin Buu attempts to kick a guarding Gohan." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> is a fast game and I wouldn’t blame anyone who has trouble defending against the many quick attacks. If you keep getting punched in the face, <strong>Guard Assist can help by immediately blocking attacks from the front.</strong></p><p>This is a great option for those looking for a slightly less intense experience. It’s not a broken feature since it doesn’t guard against side attacks and seasoned players will find ways to deal damage, but it does make things less overwhelming. I recommend newer players use this to learn the ropes and study for openings during different character rush attacks.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bc039ab4aa49cdd44baabaa330cde14c" data-recommend-id="image://bc039ab4aa49cdd44baabaa330cde14c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gohan regains his composure in the air." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gohan regains his composure in the air." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bc039ab4aa49cdd44baabaa330cde14c" data-recommend-id="image://bc039ab4aa49cdd44baabaa330cde14c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gohan regains his composure in the air." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Even when you’ve been launched towards the stratosphere, it’s possible to get back in the fight pretty quickly. This typically requires a well-timed button press when sent flying into the ground, or a mashing of everything when you’ve been hurled through the air.</p><p><strong>The purpose of Recovery Assist is to take that busy-work away and automatically recovers for you.</strong> I found this to be pretty useful when it worked. My timing for ground recoveries isn’t great, while air recoveries triggered about as fast as I normally could. Unfortunately, while it worked more often than not, sometimes it just didn’t. Midair Knock Back Recovery from Lift Strikes was one that rarely triggered for me.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5287547011feefdb69b92b80124a64f8" data-recommend-id="image://5287547011feefdb69b92b80124a64f8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Majin Buu winces in pain after being punched by Gohan." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Majin Buu winces in pain after being punched by Gohan." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bandai Namco / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5287547011feefdb69b92b80124a64f8" data-recommend-id="image://5287547011feefdb69b92b80124a64f8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Majin Buu winces in pain after being punched by Gohan." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Although it can feel like it at first, you’re not entirely screwed when stuck in your opponent’s combo. There are ways to get out and one of the best is with Revenge Counters. These can be activated in the middle of an enemy’s combo to knock them back and level the field again. The only caveats are that it requires you to time the counter just right and it consumes a skill count.</p><p><strong>Revenge Counter Assist simplifies things by taking away the precision requirement.</strong> Unlike most of the assists we’ve mentioned, this one doesn’t seem to activate on its own. I still needed to press a button, although it didn’t need to be the specific Revenge Counter button. Even mashing the rush attack button during my opponent’s combo would activate it.

These are pretty helpful accessibility settings that feel balanced enough without breaking the game. What feels completely at odds with this is the lack of explanation and general inconsistency.</p><p>Despite that, these are still worth checking out. They could really improve your experience and foster a much more enjoyable time.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Of course, ever since the pandemic, rising prices throughout the grocery store have left us awestruck. Still, this Halloween feels different, more terrifying—it’s not the witches and ghouls roaming the streets.

That’s just the most recent increase. The cost of chocolate has steadily risen since 2020, with this year’s increase a drastic upturn. In all, the price of your favorite chocolate treats has doubled from January 2020 to January 2024 and even more since then.<br></p><p>So, why is your favorite candy more expensive than ever? The most significant detriment to the cocoa-production industry is the ever-changing and worsening weather conditions worldwide that continue to prove unfavorable for regions across West Africa.

Sadler said:<br></p><p>“Chocolate candy, there’s just not as many items per retailer on (the) shelf. We’re seeing double-digit increases in non-chocolate items.”<br></p><p>You’re in luck if your sweet tooth favors gummy or sour candies. Everyone’s favorite fruity flavors tend to sell well this time of the year—more so due to the rising cost of chocolate confectionaries—with Hershey unsurprisingly leading the pack with an entirely new line of Jolly Rancher gummies.<br></p><p>But come on, can you really resist Reese’s peanut butter pumpkins?
