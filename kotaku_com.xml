              <p>It‚Äôs a rule of the universe that if you release a successful indie game, there will almost immediately be crappy mobile knock-offs and a version built in&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em>. That‚Äôs as true as ever for&nbsp;<em>Peak</em>, the adorable co-op climbing game about scaling a mountain with your friends (<a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-cannibalism-patch-notes-bug-fixes-steam-1851787299">and sometimes eating them</a>), with a <em>Roblox</em> rip-off called&nbsp;<em>Cliff</em>. And&nbsp;<em>Peak</em> developers Aggro Crab are clearly not impressed.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/peak-steam-reviews-lethal-company-aggro-crab-1851786254"><em>Peak</em></a> came out on June 16, and has quickly gone on to be a summer smash. From the developers of 2024‚Äôs&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/another-crabs-treasure-review-1851435745"><em>Another Crab‚Äôs Treasure</em></a>, the indie co-op climbing sim has become massive, peaking at almost 115,000 simultaneous players, and still has 20,000 people playing right now. It‚Äôs been a splendid and well-deserved success. So of course, there are knock-offs. But my goodness,&nbsp;<em>Cliff</em>‚Äòs is beyond blatant. And Aggro Crab aren‚Äôt delighted about the situation.</p> <p>‚Äútbh would rather you pirate our game than play this microtransaction-riddled @Roblox slop ripoff,‚Äù says a post from Aggro Crab‚Äôs official X account, spotted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/peak/roblox-ripoff"><em>PCGN</em></a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">tbh would rather you pirate our game than play this microtransaction-riddled <a href="https://twitter.com/Roblox?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Roblox</a> slop ripoff <a href="https://t.co/ulRShLLGz2">pic.twitter.com/ulRShLLGz2</a></p> <p>‚Äî AGGRO CRAB üí• (@AggroCrabGames) <a href="https://twitter.com/AggroCrabGames/status/1952475157433549083?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Cliff</em>, by a developer called PewStudio, is the most obvious copy of <em>Peak</em>. Except of course it instead looks really crap because it‚Äôs made in <em>Roblox</em>. To demonstrate this isn‚Äôt hyperbole, here are a couple of comparisons. This is <em>Cliff</em> in <em>Roblox</em>:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614672" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614672"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614672">¬©Roblox</figcaption></figure> <p>And this is <em>Peak</em>:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614673" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614673"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614673">¬©Aggro Crab</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Cliff</em>:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614674" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614674"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614674">¬©Roblox</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Peak</em>:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000614675" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614675"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614675">¬©Aggrocrab</figcaption></figure> <p>It‚Äôs not exactly subtle. The same goes for how the games play, the floating hands for climbing, the plane crash start with the suitcases on the beach, pretty much everything. Except that in&nbsp;<em>Cliff</em>, everything costs money. From the airport at the start to the suitcases on the beach, the&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> rip-off wants you spending your Robux as often as possible, because of course it does.</p> <p>Of course, Aggro Crab would prefer you just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527290/PEAK/">paid for your copy of&nbsp;<em>Peak</em></a>, not least since it‚Äôs only $8 in the first place. But seeing their creativity reduced to a cash-in knock-off must be incredibly galling, not least when people could be playing the far superior game for a low up-front fee, and never have to spend another cent.</p> <p>Oh, and really, <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-child-account-safety-settings-danger-1851680045">no one should be going anywhere near&nbsp;<em>Roblox</em> in the first place.</a></p>
