Told through narration, <em>The Lake House</em> recounts Estevez’s investigation into the titular location, an FBC facility that has gone dark. Like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-night-springs-review-dlc-1851583087&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-night-springs-review-dlc-1851583087"><em>Night Springs</em></a></span>, the first of <em>AW2</em>’s expansions, <em>The Lake House</em> is a bite-sized experience that will take you only two to three hours to complete. That’s perfect, as it lets Remedy tell a more concise story with a clear point of view.</p><p>Despite being more closely connected to 2019’s <em>Control </em>than anything else in <em>AW2</em>, don’t expect <em>The Lake House</em> to play like that supernatural action game. Estevez isn’t packing special powers, just a pistol and a flashlight. As in the base game, you’ll collect a few more weapons along the way (including an entirely new armament) to fight off the now-infected inhabitants of the Lake House. As a conclusion to the AW2 experience, <em>The Lake House</em> clearly wants to challenge you, boasting some tough fights against large groups of enemies made even tougher by a seemingly abysmal amount of resources throughout the facility. If you aren’t careful, you’ll find yourself with an empty clip and no other option than to face your inevitable death and restart with a better plan. </p><figure id="" data-id="788e398a26370b05865facf6924b2149" data-recommend-id="image://788e398a26370b05865facf6924b2149" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="728" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A government agent points a gun and flashlight at a large paint monster" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A government agent points a gun and flashlight at a large paint monster" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="788e398a26370b05865facf6924b2149" data-recommend-id="image://788e398a26370b05865facf6924b2149" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="728" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A government agent points a gun and flashlight at a large paint monster" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The expansion’s titular facility gives <em>The Lake House</em> its own aesthetic identity, one that’s far more in line with <em>Control</em>. This is an FBC building, after all, and as soon as you walk inside its concrete lobby, the sleek brutalist architecture might almost make you feel like you’re back in the Oldest House. The enemies you encounter within the facility, like the weapons you find, are mostly rehashes of what you saw in the base game, a bunch of zombie-like figures who’ve been infected by the Dark Place. There is, however, something else lurking within the Lake House: looming humanoid figures dripping with paint that jump out of canvases to kill you. The Lake House itself is decorated with countless paintings and graffiti across its walls (alongside lots of blood).</p><p>The physical art you encounter around every corner in the Lake House represents the facility’s (and the expansion’s) continued obsession with the artistic process. Unlike Wake himself, and many other important figures in the extended lore of the series, the major players in <em>The Lake House </em>are not artists themselves, yet they are preoccupied with the production of it. The competing co-heads of the facility, whose story <em>The Lake House </em>truly is, conducted experiments in an effort to harness Wake’s ability to reshape reality through art, a path which ultimately plunged the building into chaos.</p><p>As you explore the levels of the Lake House, you’ll read emails and memos about two dueling projects, both of which seek to quantify the emotion of an artistic piece in some objective manner that can then be replicated. One researcher attempts this by dragging in a painter and forcing him to adhere to an inhuman production schedule to create the correct art for triggering a supernatural power like Wake’s. The opposing project believed that it could recreate the outcome of Wake’s writing through observation, measurement, and replication.</p><figure id="" data-id="c3ec9b8a73c4bf9be8fe452607142845" data-recommend-id="image://c3ec9b8a73c4bf9be8fe452607142845" data-format="jpg" data-width="825" data-height="464" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A government agent points her flashlight at a row of automated typewriters" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A government agent points her flashlight at a row of automated typewriters" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c3ec9b8a73c4bf9be8fe452607142845" data-recommend-id="image://c3ec9b8a73c4bf9be8fe452607142845" data-format="jpg" data-width="825" data-height="464" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A government agent points her flashlight at a row of automated typewriters" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the most striking environments in <em>The Lake House</em> is a sprawling open office filled with dozens—maybe hundreds—of automated typewriters trained on pages written by Wake that the FBC recovered. The mechanical whirring of machines and cacophonous clicking of keys produces countless pages of text. In a room off to the side you can find a white board on which researchers graded each resulting page on metrics like tone, style, readability, etc. There is a constant desire to define what makes something “art.”</p><p>It’s a not-at-all subtle takedown of artificial intelligence in tech, specifically products like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-openai-sam-altman-twitch-emmett-shear-1851035956&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-openai-sam-altman-twitch-emmett-shear-1851035956">ChatGPT</a></span> that scrape the work of real creators in order to produce empty facsimiles of art that impress only the most unimaginative people. Remedy beats you over the head with the sheer stupidity of both the Lake House experiments and their real-life counterparts. Signs plastered on the walls encourage workers to not decorate their desks and remind them that “art is for analysis.” At one point, a page written by Wake describing the projects within the Lake House reads “art was not art, just content for the experiment.”</p><p><br>That’s <em>Alan Wake 2</em>’s final message to audiences. Art is not content. It’s a word that’s become so much more prolific across cultural discussions in recent years as the proponents of AI push us toward conceiving of every piece of art as simply a product for viewer enjoyment rather than a thing that can challenge your worldview. Games are not content. Writing is not content. Art is not content. Those who create are not cogs in a machine to be used and disposed of or turned into food for an algorithm. <em>The Lake House</em> is Remedy’s clear statement that the push to quantify and replicate art without emotion is nothing short of a horror story. As far as farewells go, it’s a pretty fucking good one. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It almost seems like with every new entry of late the series has strayed from the desires of its outsized and fairly casual audience. <em>Call of Duty </em>is, after all, one of those games that most people pick up once a year and play till the next one comes along, much like a sports game. Folks who play those games tend to want refinements of core principles rather than drastic or convoluted reinventions.</p><p>All of which is to say, <em>Black Ops 6</em>’s return-to-basics approach was a welcome bit of news among the cacophony of showcases, directs, and overbearing blog posts about why <em>this </em>game would be the best <em>Call of Duty </em>ever. After <em>MWIII</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/modern-warfare-3-call-of-duty-single-player-campaign-1850991005&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/modern-warfare-3-call-of-duty-single-player-campaign-1850991005">flop of an open-ended campaign</a></span>, <em>Black Ops 6 </em>doubled down on having a cinematic, blockbuster story mode like the best in the series have offered. Its iteration on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-impressions-xbox-1851681562&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-impressions-xbox-1851681562">Zombies feels like a healthy mixture of new and classic features</a></span> and mechanics. Even the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-beta-weekend-1851638800&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-beta-weekend-1851638800">multiplayer feels sensibly pared back</a></span>, and it restores tenets that fans have missed, like the prestige system. Treyarch and Xbox clearly want us to think that <em>Call of Duty </em>is “back,” but is it really?</p><p>According to the reviews that <em>Black Ops 6 </em>is accruing on Steam, the answer’s a bit more complicated than a simple yes or no. Fans seem to generally agree that the campaign here is better than average, and some are even calling it the best story mode in a <em>COD </em>game in years. And of course there are players who have cherished the simplified renditions of both the competitive multiplayer suite and the cooperative Zombies mode, myself included. As is always going to be the case with a series this big and this polarizing, though, the more you look, the more people you’ll find who are disappointed in some of the game’s features.</p><p>One of the biggest problems many seem to have with <em>Black Ops 6 </em>actually has little to do with the game itself and more to do with the packaging, specifically the launcher, <em>Call of Duty HQ</em>. While the tool has been reworked since its initial release, it isn’t significantly better, and it seems to be even worse on PC, where fans of the series <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-launcher-sucks-bad-awful-review-1851684502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-launcher-sucks-bad-awful-review-1851684502">seem to hate it more than I do</a></span>! One review joked that <em>Black Ops 6 </em>is actually a “game is updating simulator.”</p><p>Elsewhere, <em>Black Ops 6</em>’s various modes are causing division. Some are appreciating their time with the competitive multiplayer suite, but there are also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-duty-black-ops-6-spawn-bug-blops-cod-1851682799&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-duty-black-ops-6-spawn-bug-blops-cod-1851682799">repeated mentions of terrible maps and spawns</a></span> throughout the reviews. Having played the beta extensively, as well as jumping in after launch, I can kind of agree that there don’t seem to be any unilateral winners among the crop of multiplayer arenas available right now. Zombies has enjoyed a more positive reception than multiplayer, but still there are players who are unhappy with the settings and crying out for more ambient (spookier) maps in the future.</p><p>Overall, <em>Black Ops 6 </em>seems to be earning its “Mixed” reception on Steam. It isn’t the greatest game, but it’s a perfectly fine and fun middling title, and that’s about all I need from it to have a great time. The divisiveness surrounding the game is at least producing some good material in the Steam reviews page, though, so read it and weep. </p><figure id="" data-id="04c1101de713e705ef1158eb55109f2e" data-recommend-id="image://04c1101de713e705ef1158eb55109f2e" data-format="png" data-width="1258" data-height="314" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Steam review reading, &quot;You spend more time loading up between Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies than actually spending time in those modes.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Steam review reading, &quot;You spend more time loading up between Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies than actually spending time in those modes.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Valve</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="04c1101de713e705ef1158eb55109f2e" data-recommend-id="image://04c1101de713e705ef1158eb55109f2e" data-format="png" data-width="1258" data-height="314" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Steam review reading, &quot;You spend more time loading up between Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies than actually spending time in those modes.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><figure id="" data-id="f9fc45049d661aab0a47ebd327a229e1" data-recommend-id="image://f9fc45049d661aab0a47ebd327a229e1" data-format="png" data-width="1248" data-height="480" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Steam review reading, &quot;Campaign is pretty good and zombies is like Cold War with Classic features mixed in.
