            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The second-generation Pixel Buds Pro were released last year in September. These minimal ANC buds retail for $229, but we just found a way to grab them for under $200.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6032/">Amazon just dropped the pair by 26%, bringing the overall price down to just $169.</a> You’re not just saving a nice $60 on your purchase, but also getting free delivery, as well as a two-month free trial of Audible with the order. This $169 price also matches what we saw during Black Friday, so if you missed grabbing the pair during the main event, now is a great time to pick them up. Additionally, all color options are discounted, so you’ve got quite a few options to choose from. However, note that only the earbuds change color; the charging case remains white.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6032/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Solid ANC Capabilities</h2>
<p>Google calls these the most comfortable earbuds ever – and we don’t doubt that. These small, round buds fit nicely for all-day use, plus come with a twist-to-adjust stabilizer for an even more secure fit. The latter is great for workouts, especially when things get a bit intense, such as during cardio or boxing. You won’t have to worry about them slipping out every few minutes.</p>
<p>The Tensor A1 chip delivers premium sound for all your tracks, whether you’re listening to something bass-heavy or a theme song that’s a bit on the calmer side. Vocals, with every beat, come through clearly, like never before. Active Noise Cancellation is the highlight here, though. This mode uses Silent Seal 2.0 to block all unwanted background noise for a more immersive sound experience. ANC comes in handy when you really need to focus on a task in a chaotic setting, or just want to zone out with your favorite song for a bit. Of course, that doesn’t work for every situation. For when you do need to stay aware of what’s happening around you, there’s a Transparency Mode you can switch to. This mode lets some sound in, while still letting you enjoy quality audio. There’s a conversation detection feature, too. It pauses your music and automatically switches the earbuds to Transparency mode when you speak.</p>



<p>Calls get better, as well. That’s thanks to a combination of beamforming mics, wind-blocking mesh covers, and AI assistance. These come together to deliver your voice on the other end clearly, even when you’re travelling or sitting in a busy cafe. Speaking of on-the-go usage, the Buds Pro 2 are IPX4 water-resistant, so rain or a few water splashes by the pool won’t hurt.</p>
<p>Battery life is another strong selling point. A single charge gets you up to 30 hours of listening with ANC on. Transparency mode consumes less battery, so you can extend the overall listening time by mixing both.</p>
<p>All things considered, if you’ve been looking for a way to upgrade to the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2, now is a great time to make the move. These offer two listening modes, transparency and ANC. The sound quality is exceptional, and the built-in microphones make it easy to hop on calls, even in noisy settings. You’ll also appreciate the long battery life, which offers extra peace of mind during long commutes and off-road adventures. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6032/">The current deal brings the price down to $169, making the upgrade much more affordable.</a> If you like the offer, consider grabbing these quickly, before the price goes back up.</p>

              <p>You don’t have to sacrifice your entire workspace just to fit a traditional tower PC on your desk. If space matters to you, switching to a compact yet capable mini PC can make a huge difference. The ACEMAGIC Mini PC is designed for students, professionals, and everyday users who want strong performance without clutter.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6421/"> It is currently available at a deep discount on Amazon in which you can save as much as $240 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6421/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Big Performance in a Small Footprint</h2>
<p>Despite its ultra-compact design, the ACEMAGIC Mini PC delivers impressive power. Inside this tiny chassis, there are a couple options for memory and storage. The cheapest option—housing 16GB of RAM and 512GB of storage—normally runs for $459, but is right now down 28% to just $329. You can choose to upgrade to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. That one is normally $499, but has come down to just $429 (14% discount). Both these options come with an AMD Ryzen 7 6800H processor with integrated graphics, though you can bump up to the upgraded AMD Ryzen 7 8745HS processor for just $519 total. That’s down by 32% from $759 (also comes with 32GB of RAM and 1TB of storage).</p>
<p>If you find you don’t have enough space for your needs, storage is expandable up to 4TB with an additional compatible SSD.</p>
<p>This hardware combination is well suited for everyday computing tasks such as web browsing, office work, creative projects, and even light gaming. Multitasking feels smooth thanks to the included 32GB of memory, which helps applications run quickly and efficiently. The system comes preloaded with Windows 11 Pro, allowing you to get started immediately without dealing with complicated setup steps or extra software installations.</p>



<p>For display capabilities, the mini PC supports impressive visuals. Using its USB4 Type-C or DisplayPort 2.0 output, it can deliver up to 8K resolution at 60Hz. There is also an HDMI slot available which is capable of up to 4K at 60Hz. All together, these enable you to connect three monitors at the same time for increased productivity or multitasking.</p>
<p>The ACEMAGIC Mini PC includes built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth 4.2, ensuring stable internet access and easy pairing with accessories like keyboards, mice, and headphones. You’ll also find two USB 3.2 ports on the front with four more on the back for even more peripheral options.</p>
<p>Thermal management has not been overlooked either. Dual centrifual fans and a stacked fin array design help keep internal temperatures under control. The independent aluminum SSD heatsink can disperse heat quietly, allowing you to maintain stable read and write speeds during extended use.</p>
<p>If you need a full-featured computer that takes up minimal space, the ACEMAGIC Mini PC is a compelling option. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6421/">With its current discount of up to 32%, the price of the highest tier model drops to just $519 for a limited time.</a> For anyone upgrading, downsizing, or building a clean, efficient workstation at home or the office, this mini PC may be just what you’re looking for.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Larian Boss Confirms Divinity Is A Turn-Based RPG, Thinks It’ll Be ‘Way Better’ Than Baldur’s Gate 3]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/divinity-turn-based-rpg-larian-studios-early-access-date-2000653845</link>
            <guid>1384588</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been less than a week since Larian Studios <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-original-sin-3-rpg-trailer-larian-bg4-game-awards-2000652714">revealed <em>Divinity</em></a>. Fans have spent much of that time <a href="https://kotaku.com/divinity-larian-trailer-turn-based-rpg-release-date-2000653105">debating whether it would be an action-RPG</a>.&nbsp;While much of the new game remains mysterious, studio head Swen Vincke isn’t trying to keep that part a secret. He recently confirmed it will indeed be a turn-based game like its other recent hits, including <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>. Except he’s also promising it will be “way better” than the 2023<em> Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>-based Game of the Year winner.</p> <p>“<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> was a good game and I’m proud of it, but I think this one is going to be way better,” Vincke <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a> this week. One challenge during&nbsp;<em>BG3</em>‘s development <a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-dnd-races-classes-hours-ps5-xbox-pc-1850590383">was taking the existing ruleset</a> for Wizards of the Coast’s pen-and-paper RPG and adapting it to a video game. “Here, we’re making a system that’s made for a video game. It’s much easier to understand,” he explained.</p>

 <p>Considering <em>BG3</em> is already one of the most beloved games of the last decade, surpassing it will be a tall order, but the veteran developer doesn’t seem worried. “[<em>Divinity</em>] is going to be us unleashed, I think,” Vincke said. “It’s a turn-based RPG featuring everything you’ve seen from us in the past, but it’s brought to the next level.”</p>

 <p>That “next level” includes growing development resources spread across a larger number of studios that will allow the team to make more of the game in parallel, <em>Bloomberg</em> reports. Ideally, that should cut down on the development time. Vincke said Larian is aiming for three to four years with <em>Divinity</em>, rather than the six it took to make <em>BG3</em>. It will still start in Early Access, however, and won’t be arriving anytime in 2026.</p> <p>Where will this new level of investment show up? More cinematic scenes and narrative experiments. In other words, the parts of <em>BG3</em> fans loved the most. “We’re doing a couple of things that you haven’t seen in RPGs before, I think,” the Larian cofounder said. I hope <em>Divinity</em> delivers.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-adds-the-galaxy-watch-8-2025-to-its-smartwatch-clearance-not-just-the-galaxy-watch-ultra-2000653806</link>
            <guid>1384585</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Samsung unveiled its Galaxy Watch 8 earlier this year, at a not-so-friendly, but quite justifiable retail price of $350. If you’ve been wanting to upgrade but the high price tag has been holding you back, we bring good news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6419/">Thanks to Amazon, you can now snap it up for just $250, after the retailer quite generously took a massive $100 off it</a>. The deal is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, and you’ll even get free shipping with your purchase, which means $250 is quite literally all you’ve got to pay. The deal applies to the graphite and silver color options. Additionally, Amazon is also offering a free two-month Audible trial with your purchase, which is a service that lets you buy and stream audiobooks, podcasts, and audio shows.</p>

<h2>Blend of Fitness and Health Features</h2>
<p>At first glance, the watch looks quite similar to its predecessor, but that isn’t really the case. It features a sleek, thinner-than-ever silhouette and offers a snug fit with a sporty style. The screen is both spacious and bright, letting you view your stats, check notifications, keep an eye on the latest news, and more, comfortably throughout the day. The interface has improved, too, so using the thing is going to feel more effortless than ever.</p>
<p>Watch 8 comes packed with a range of health and fitness features. We’re talking Vascular Load monitoring that monitors your stress levels, plus an antioxidant index that uses BioActive Sensor to measure carotenoid levels in your skin. When worn at night, the watch tracks how well you sleep at night, and offers Advanced Sleep Coaching to provide you with tips and insights that can help you rest better. Based on your performance/energy levels of the previous day, it even creates a personalized Energy Score with the help of Galaxy AI. This score lets you see how ready your body is for the upcoming challenges, which you can take into consideration while planning stuff for the day. For instance, a score over 85 indicates you’re well-rested, making it an ideal day to take on the tasks you’ve been putting off. A lower score suggests you need rest, so it might be a good idea to skip an intense workout that day.</p>



<p>Fitness-wise, the watch tracks your steps and comes with a Running Coach that monitors your performance and gives you real-time feedback. There are a bunch of fitness programs built right in, which you can follow to train better. As for the battery, the life depends on how you’re using the watch, but you can expect it to last around 1-2 days. What’s more, Google Gemini integration brings an efficient AI assistant right to your wrist. You can use it to find quick answers, brainstorm ideas, get help with replies, and a lot more.</p>
<p>Connecting it to your smartphone via Bluetooth gets you all your important notifications right on the app. You can check emails or messages, plus manage music without pulling your phone out.</p>
<p>In short, if you’ve been wanting to grab the latest Samsung Galaxy Watch 8, now is a great time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6419/">This deal lets you grab it at a nice $100 discount, for just $250.</a> There are two color options to choose from, and multiple band sizes available.</p>
