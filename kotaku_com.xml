You can tell when she uses Restage because phantoms of the enemies appear and reenact themselves receiving that damage.</p><p>Not only does Restage replay the Duchess’ previous damage output, but it also applies to any teammate’s. This has huge damaging potential as you could coordinate with your squad to have them unleash Ultimate Arts on a boss, only for you to activate Restage to pile on even more hurt.</p><figure id="" data-id="6fdc2bd87aeec5ef1fd34c2377fb8ad9" data-recommend-id="image://6fdc2bd87aeec5ef1fd34c2377fb8ad9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Duchess attacks an enemy with a phantom version of herself." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Duchess attacks an enemy with a phantom version of herself." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6fdc2bd87aeec5ef1fd34c2377fb8ad9" data-recommend-id="image://6fdc2bd87aeec5ef1fd34c2377fb8ad9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Duchess attacks an enemy with a phantom version of herself." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Restage can also be used at any time, including during the middle of a combo, while dodging, or even being attacked. The Duchess doesn’t have to reposition herself in order to activate. It’s essentially instantaneous. This skill has a relatively quick cool down period, so make sure to constantly utilize it.</p><h2 id="h301632"><a id="3"></a>Ultimate Art: Finale</h2><figure id="" data-id="d9fcf9a38a2ef656d6a3a54be4d35517" data-recommend-id="image://d9fcf9a38a2ef656d6a3a54be4d35517" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Duchess goes invisible in front of an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Duchess goes invisible in front of an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d9fcf9a38a2ef656d6a3a54be4d35517" data-recommend-id="image://d9fcf9a38a2ef656d6a3a54be4d35517" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Duchess goes invisible in front of an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Duchess’s Ultimate Art is called Finale, and it’s a pretty simple one. She pulls out her cape and turns herself and nearby teammates invisible. This lets those impacted to avoid detection from enemies. This skill is mostly used defensively, especially during boss battles. When the Duchess is invisible, this lets her take the time to revive downed teammates without being interrupted, or just take the pressure off and heal.</p><p><strong>While invisible, she can still be targeted</strong>, particularly by projectiles that home in on their targets. Area-of-Effect attacks will still hit her as well, along with grabs if she happens to get caught in one. Hitting an enemy will reveal her location, too; so make a big splash before coming out of invisibility.</p><h2 id="h301633"><a id="4"></a>A look at the Duchess’s attributes</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>HP</strong>: C</li><li><strong>FP</strong>: C</li><li><strong>Stamina</strong>: D</li><li><strong>Strength</strong>: D</li><li><strong>Dexterity</strong>: B</li><li><strong>Intelligence</strong>: A</li><li><strong>Faith</strong>: B</li><li><strong>Arcane</strong>: C</li></ul><p>Surprisingly, the Duchess’s highest stat isn’t Dexterity, but is instead Intelligence—although her Dexterity is still above average. This means that daggers are her best option as they take advantage of her rapid-fire attacks. Daggers are also great at inflicting status effects, so if you come across any rare ones like Bleed or Scarlet Rot, those will be a boon for your run. The more hits dished out, the faster status effects build up.</p><p>Despite being a melee character, she can put her high Intelligence to use with staves to inflict long-range magic damage. Speaking of long-range damage, bows scale well with dexterity, so you can use her as a backup ranged character if you can’t get in close..</p><p>“Successive attacks negate damage” is a really useful buff that’ll be incredibly helpful if you come across it. Because the Duchess inflicts so many small cuts without losing stamina, she can end up becoming tankier with this buff active, sometimes not even having to dodge out of enemy attacks.</p><p>Regardless of how you play her, the Duchess is well-worth unlocking and using on your next expedition.</p><hr><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There’s so much packed into the experience that it should keep fans busy for years to come.

There are a lot of little tricks and mechanics high-end players use to maximize their speed and efficiency in races, after all. But look, even if you’re just playing <em>Mario Kart World </em>casually, you should at least practice drifting reliably to help you round corners and curves without slowing down. </p><figure id="" data-id="9a468553394a86cc2c109c900587c905" data-recommend-id="image://9a468553394a86cc2c109c900587c905" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario grinds on a rail in Mario Kart World." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mario grinds on a rail in Mario Kart World." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9a468553394a86cc2c109c900587c905" data-recommend-id="image://9a468553394a86cc2c109c900587c905" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario grinds on a rail in Mario Kart World." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And there’s so much more new stuff now, too, including riding on rails and walls. Mastering these additional movement features and knowing when to use them can help you shave off a lot of time during a race, often by granting you access to shortcuts or letting you bypass parts of a track altogether. In some cases, riding a wall may even save you from falling off a track and losing your place!</p><p>No one says you have to take competitive racing in <em>Mario Kart World</em> seriously, of course. But learning how to make the most of its various mechanics will certainly help you place higher in races and navigate the game’s open world better. So, practice up!</p><h2 id="h308813"><a id="2"></a>Be a coin fiend</h2><p><strong>Every coin you pick up in <em>Mario Kart World</em> will increase your max speed</strong>. You can hold up to 20 coins, which is a step up from the usual 10 in previous games, but you’ll also lose three every time you get hit by a projectile. With this in mind, actively seek them out during the entire race in an effort to stay as close to the coin cap as possible. </p><figure id="" data-id="f2564c60b6314343ac7650aedc6822b3" data-recommend-id="image://f2564c60b6314343ac7650aedc6822b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="3437" data-height="1938" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A cow on a motorcycle speeds toward a coin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A cow on a motorcycle speeds toward a coin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f2564c60b6314343ac7650aedc6822b3" data-recommend-id="image://f2564c60b6314343ac7650aedc6822b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="3437" data-height="1938" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A cow on a motorcycle speeds toward a coin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To help with this, there’s always a chance that you’ll snag a power-up like the Coin Box or Coin Shell to give you a solid influx of coins, so make sure you use those when they come up. Just keep in mind that other racers can grab the additional coins dropped by these power-ups as well, so using them can feel like a double-edged sword at times. But yeah, still do it. Go fast. Vroom.</p><h2 id="h308814"><a id="3"></a>Don’t shy away from accessibility options</h2><p>When selecting your racer, you can press the X button to get a look at a few accessibility options. These can be extremely helpful for those with disabilities, as well as new players looking to ease into the racing experience with reduced punishment for mistakes.</p><figure id="" data-id="a127879b39e637d6fcb698443c51aeb6" data-recommend-id="image://a127879b39e637d6fcb698443c51aeb6" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Waluigi races in a motorcycle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Waluigi races in a motorcycle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a127879b39e637d6fcb698443c51aeb6" data-recommend-id="image://a127879b39e637d6fcb698443c51aeb6" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Waluigi races in a motorcycle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Smart Steering will stop your character from ever driving off the side of a track, while Auto-Accelerate will take care of keeping you moving so that you can focus all of your attention on steering</strong>. You can even turn on Auto-Use Item to make your character use items for you, though this takes away your ability to use power-ups strategically for any given situation.</p><p>Mess with these settings and toggle them on/off any time you want to customize your racing experience. The goal here is to have as much fun as possible, after all. </p><h2 id="h308815"><a id="4"></a>Get those double-item boxes</h2><figure id="" data-id="2fdebaa5dd34ab151bdb22551fc69a44" data-recommend-id="image://2fdebaa5dd34ab151bdb22551fc69a44" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters race toward boxes with question marks on them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Characters race toward boxes with question marks on them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2fdebaa5dd34ab151bdb22551fc69a44" data-recommend-id="image://2fdebaa5dd34ab151bdb22551fc69a44" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Characters race toward boxes with question marks on them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This one is simple: More items equal a higher chance for survival. Because of this, it’s usually a good idea to aim for double item boxes on a course so that you can snag two items at once, giving you two chances at disrupting other players or providing yourself with additional protection from incoming projectiles.</p><p>Of course, if you see someone else aiming for the double item box ahead of you, it may sometimes be better to snag a nearby normal item box instead so that you don’t risk a chance of getting nothing at all. I don’t want to think you’d get sniped in the butt by a red shell just because your greed left you without protection.</p><hr><p><br><em>Mario Kart World</em> is available now exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Seconds after that revelation, an FBI agent attests that Kivimäki revealed he had law enforcement sent to the families of FBI agents by making fake emergency phone calls, an act known as “swatting,” because “he thought it was fun, and he enjoyed hurting or seeing people suffer.” The teaser even features an unidentified man, presumably a victim of Kivimäki’s hacks, who vows to kill him the second the two are in the same location. </p><p>The documentary will not only have victims of his hacks, fellow hackers, SWAT team members, and FBI agents, but also the incarcerated Kivimäki himself. The first of four episodes will be released in September, but brushing up on the news of Kivimäki’s hacking spree will give you a better understanding of the criminal at the center of the doc more than any teaser could.

This excellent, albeit expensive, option is simply the best choice for playing games while your Nintendo Switch 2 is in docked mode. It’s immensely comfortable and features solid battery life. Plus, it’s filled with all of the features you’d expect—and then some. </p><figure id="" data-id="b28ef08d71ac4784951d89023f208c62" data-recommend-id="image://b28ef08d71ac4784951d89023f208c62" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b28ef08d71ac4784951d89023f208c62" data-recommend-id="image://b28ef08d71ac4784951d89023f208c62" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The new GL/GR buttons on the back are perhaps its most compelling additions from the last generation Pro controller. These rear-buttons can be mapped to function as any other button on the controller for ultimate customizability and an improved competitive edge. If you’re okay dropping $85 to pick up the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller, I feel pretty confident that you won’t regret it.</p><h2 id="h301673"><a id="2"></a>Nintendo Switch 2 Camera</h2><p>The Nintendo Switch 2's new Game Chat functionality means you can finally virtually hang out with your friends via voice and video. If you’re interested in the latter, you’ll want to pick up a USB-C camera, and I’d argue that the official <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-camera-123682/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-camera-123682/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Switch 2 Camera</a></span> is the all-around best option. With 1080p resolution, a sleek profile, and a useful privacy shutter, this accessory is well worth the $55 for anyone looking to jump into Game Chat with all the bells and whistles.</p><h2 id="h301674"><a id="3"></a>Nintendo Joy-Con 2 Wheel</h2><figure id="" data-id="000d7e7a76746fc0702f9acc90855b96" data-recommend-id="image://000d7e7a76746fc0702f9acc90855b96" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nintendo Switch 2 wheels hold new Joy Con." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nintendo Switch 2 wheels hold new Joy Con." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="000d7e7a76746fc0702f9acc90855b96" data-recommend-id="image://000d7e7a76746fc0702f9acc90855b96" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nintendo Switch 2 wheels hold new Joy Con." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re into motion controls, you may get a kick out of having a wheel for your Joy-Con 2 controllers while playing games like <em>Mario Kart World</em>. There are a handful of perfectly fine third-party options available, but the official <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-wheel-set-of-2-120834/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-wheel-set-of-2-120834/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Joy-Con 2 Wheel</a></span> is gonna be your best choice—especially at launch. The Joy-Con 2 controllers snap in using magnetic force for a stable connection, while the matching color schemes of the two included wheels ensure you can tell who’s who during two-player fun. These little wheels will run you $25—but if you think you’ll get some use out of them, they’re a worthwhile accessory to have around.</p><h2 id="h301675"><a id="4"></a>Spigen Dual Grip Cover</h2><p>It’s totally reasonable if you find the fairly thin Nintendo Switch 2 a little uncomfortable to hold in handheld mode for extended periods. Luckily, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://a.co/d/46DeG2m&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://a.co/d/46DeG2m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spigen Dual Grip</a></span> can alleviate a lot of that discomfort by making things more ergonomic for you. This lightweight polycarbonate grip cover covers all of the parts of the Nintendo Switch 2 needed to ensure you can have a comfortable grip on the device without compromising your ability to place the console into its dock or use the kickstand. The Spigen Dual Grip will run you $30, but you’re getting a much better grip on your console without making any sacrifice in efficiency, so I’d say it’s worth the investment for anyone frequently using their Nintendo Switch 2 in handheld mode.</p><h2 id="h301676"><a id="5"></a>Samsung microSD Express Card</h2><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 comes packing a lot more storage than its predecessor (256GB this time around), but if you’re the type to keep a smorgasbord of games on your console at once, you may want to expand your storage capacity with a microSD Express card. You can’t go wrong with the official Nintendo-branded <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/samsung-microsd-express-card-256gb-for-nintendo-switch-2-123685/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/samsung-microsd-express-card-256gb-for-nintendo-switch-2-123685/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung 256GB microSD Express Card</a></span>. Though you can certainly find both larger and cheaper microSD Express cards, this choice comes from one of the medium’s most trusted brands and doubles your overall storage for only $60. Hell yeah.</p><h2 id="h301677"><a id="6"></a>Transnovo 4-Slot Joy-Con Charging Dock</h2><p>If you’re the kind of person who uses your Switch 2 Joy-Cons frequently — and especially if you have more than two — a good Joy-Con charging dock is important. And the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://a.co/d/3jZIBLW&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://a.co/d/3jZIBLW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transnovo 4-Slot Joy-Con Charging Dock</a></span> is a rad choice. Your Joy-Cons snap into the dock magnetically from any angle, and they’ll charge to full in around 2 hours. LED lights let you know when they’re charging (orange) or fully charged (blue), and the multiple RGB lighting modes can add a bit of flair to your desk or entertainment center. That’s some pretty cool shit.</p><h2 id="h301678"><a id="7"></a>Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case</h2><p>Cases for the Nintendo Switch 2 are plentiful, so you should always pick one that meets your unique needs both in terms of looks and functionality. However, perhaps the best case on the market is the official <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-all-in-one-carrying-case-123692/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-all-in-one-carrying-case-123692/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case</a></span>, which offers impressive protection, high-quality materials, and tons of storage inside. This chunky case even has a spot to store your Nintendo Switch 2 dock so that you can transport your docked console experience anywhere you want to go. </p><figure id="" data-id="04aaf93627858699a5081aaf939b682d" data-recommend-id="image://04aaf93627858699a5081aaf939b682d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One carrying case." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One carrying case." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="04aaf93627858699a5081aaf939b682d" data-recommend-id="image://04aaf93627858699a5081aaf939b682d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One carrying case." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll find six slots for game carts, storage for a Pro Controller, and a large mesh compartment for all of your cables. The only downside is that this big boy costs $85, so opting for a smaller, and thus cheaper, case may be a better bet if you only need protection for the handheld portion of the console.</p><p>It goes without saying that there are plenty of other accessories out there to score for your Nintendo Switch 2. But hopefully, this short list helped you get a feel for some of your best options. Now, get off here and go play some video games.</p><p>.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
