              <p><span>We know </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-most-popular-netflix-streaming-2000620409"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span>, Netflix’s animated musical that has </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381"><span>set the world on fire for the past few months</span></a><span>, is likely </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-2-sequel-theories-questions-netflix-2000620717"><span>getting a sequel</span></a><span> after the movie’s runaway success. However, it seems like we might not have to wait too much longer to see Huntr/x, the film’s demon-slaying K-pop group, again, as the Motion Picture Association has leaked that a short film follow-up has been rated.</span></p> <p><span>A </span><a href="https://www.filmratings.com/Content/Downloads/cara_rating_bulletin.pdf"><span>document on the MPA film ratings website</span></a><span> includes a listing for something called </span><i><span>Debut: A KPop Demon Hunters Story</span></i><span>, which is rated PG for “some action/violence and scary images.” Sony is listed as the distributor, and the listing says it is a “short subject,” which is a designation given to short films rather than the feature-length movies the ratings board usually handles. The fact that it’s already been rated means that its release is probably imminent, and the title suggests it could cover the early days of Huntr/x’s K-pop career. Maybe we’ll get to see the girls meet for the first time, learn the truth about the demons preying upon humanity, and establish themselves as a dominant force in the K-pop world. If so, we might also get some new songs?</span></p> <p><span>All of this is speculation right now, but it was established back in 2023 that Sony would produce a short film based on </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><a href="https://variety.com/2023/artisans/news/spider-verse-short-film-spider-within-sony-animation-1235567757/"><span>through its LENS mentorship program</span></a><span>, which was also responsible for </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcGPpwFdE1Y"><i><span>The Spider Within: A Spider-Verse Story</span></i></a><span>, a seven-minute-long short based on the </span><i><span>Spider-Verse </span></i><span>movies. It’s unclear if </span><i><span>Debut </span></i><span>will be streaming on Netflix like the full movie or if it will be on publicly available channels like YouTube.</span></p> <p><span>If there is new music, I’ll have to update our </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><span>ranking of the movie’s original songs</span></a><span>, though it will take something really special to dethrone the song in the number one spot.</span></p>

              <p>Look, it’s OK. Some games are just incredibly hard, and not everyone has the skills or patience required to conquer them. Many people are finding their limit with&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, reaching a boss that just cannot be bested or realizing their fingers just aren’t capable of the dexterity required to master the super-hard platformer. But don’t wallow! Pick yourself up and try any of these games that offer a similar experience, without being quite so brutal.</p> <p><em>Silksong</em> has <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-difficulty-hollow-knight-easy-mode-2000624441">re-opened the wound of gaming difficulty discourse</a>, causing friction over the topic of how hard a game can reasonably be without offering difficulty options for less skilled players. Of course, for all the debate and discussion, one core truth always remains: developers are allowed to make their games any way they want. Some choose to do this by responding to feedback from players, but others have a fixed vision for their creation and aren’t going to be moved from that. There’s no sense fighting this, not least when the vast banquet of video games already offers so very many fantastic alternatives.</p> <p>I dearly wish I were better at <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> because it’s the so-called “metroidvania” format that so attracts me. The genre, whose name is somewhat awkwardly based on the franchises of <em>Metroid</em> and&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>, generally refers to platform games in which you gain a growing number of skills and abilities which, over time, give you access to previously inaccessible areas. Along the way, regenerating enemies attempt to thwart your progress, while one-time bosses are stationed at key points. The more skills you get, the easier those earlier areas become, and the better prepared you are for the later challenges. All that’s true of <em>Silksong</em>, of course! But there are very many games that offer it all without the punishing difficulty. Here are a few worth picking up if&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> is getting you down.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-60000mah-power-bank-has-never-been-priced-lower-than-now-blackout-and-camping-charger-light-combo-2000626100</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker%E2%80%99s-60-000mah-power-bank-has-never-been-priced-lower-than-now-blackout-and-camping-charger-light-combo.1300356/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When one device can address several inconveniences and annoyances while putting a pile of money back in your pocket, it’s well worth a look. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/">The Anker 548 Power Bank 60,000mAh portable power station cost $250 two years ago, but right now at Amazon it’s only $80 — its lowest price ever, and a 47% reduction from its most recent retail price of $150</a>. It’ll be the best $80 you’ve spent in a long while after just one camping trip or one blackout.</p>
<p>What are those annoyances it can eliminate for you? How about when the power goes out and you reach into the junk drawer for a flashlight, only to discover it’s dead and has likely been dead for a long time, leaving you to scramble for a handful of D-cell batteries. Or when you buy a “portable” power station only to discover it might be portable if you’re a powerlifter, but otherwise it’s a ginormous device that you’d really rather not have to carry around. The Anker 548 Power Bank is the $80 solution to those woes, and many more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Truly, Amazingly Portable</h2>
<p>Unless you enjoy the workout of lugging a “portable” power station that tips the scales at 25 or more pounds, the first thing you’ll notice about the Anker 548 Power Bank is that it’s really, truly portable for everyone. It’s barely over 5 pounds, and has a built-in handle atop its compact 4.6 x 4.6 x 8.2 inch body. It’s power on the go literally anywhere you need it — ideal for stashing in your bedroom for a power outage, keeping in the car for powering devices on long trips, or occupying a very small space in your vehicle on your next outdoor adventure.</p>
<p>The built-in light at the top of the Anker 548 Power Bank is retractable so it can give you either a little glow or a full-on light source, and there’s also an SOS mode for emergencies — ideal for roadside breakdowns. The Anker 548 is also ready when you need it, even if that’s months away — after a full year without being recharged, it retains an amazing 85% of its charge.</p>



<h2>Multi-Device Power</h2>
<p>The Anker 548 Power Bank has an enormous 60,000mAh capacity, and two USB-C and two USB-A ports ready for your devices. That’s enough to fully charge a MacBook Air almost 3 times, and an iPhone 14 Pro Max 7.4 times, and a 3W LED emergency lamp will stay lit for over 42 hours. The LED Smart Display shows you all the vital stats, including the power level of the 548 Power Bank itself. Recharging the Anker 548 Power Bank is a simple USB-C operation, or you can attach it to a compatible solar panel with an XT-60 connector for clean, endlessly renewable recharging.</p>
<p>It’s safe to say <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/">the Anker 548 Power Bank massively overperforms the $80 price tag it’s carrying during this limited-time Amazon deal.</a> It’ll take just one power outage or one fun camping trek for it to easily pay for itself, and since it has a projected lifespan up to 10 times longer than most competing models, you’ll have plenty of time to reap the rewards.</p>

              <p><span>We’re a week out from the assassination of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk, and the internet is still running wild with new information, commentary, and, as the internet often does, dark jokes. That includes AI slop, and one particular brand of it became so viral that Bandai Namco, or more specifically, the company’s toy division, has released a statement about its logo being used in fake mockups of Gunpla models depicting Kirk’s assassination.</span></p> <p><span>The statement was released on the company’s </span><a href="https://x.com/BandaiCollect/status/1968140558959882612"><span>social media channels</span></a><span>, and while it doesn’t reference Kirk’s death by name, it says that it has been made aware of “AI-generated images circulating online that depict the Bandai Namco Toys &amp; Collectibles America Inc. logo on packaging associated with graphic or violent content, including references to recent events.” The images, which </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>has verified, include a fake model of the moment Kirk was shot on September 10 at the Utah Valley University campus with a fake Bandai-branded box in the background. The full statement reads as follows:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>We have recently been made aware of AI-generated images circulating online that depict the Bandai Namco Toys &amp; Collectibles America Inc. logo on packaging associated with graphic or violent content, including references to recent events.</span></p> <p><span>We want to make it unequivocally clear: Bandai Namco Toys &amp; Collectibles America Inc. strongly condemns any form of violence and does not support or endorse the use of our brand, products, or logo in any such context. These images are not created, approved, or affiliated with our company in any way.</span></p> <p><span>We are actively investigating this matter and are taking steps to report and remove any unauthorized or misleading content. The misuse of our intellectual property in a way that misrepresents our values and intentions is deeply concerning and will not be tolerated.</span></p> <p><span>We thank our community for bringing this to our attention and encourage anyone who sees similar misuses to report them to us directly.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>Kirk’s death has sparked a whirlwind of controversy that has bled into various industries as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478"><span>public figures have reacted to the event</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>Helldivers 2 </span></i><span>has even been dragged into the entire ordeal after it was reported that a reference to the Arrowhead Game Studios game was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-helldivers-bullet-engraving-2000625439"><span>engraved on the bullet casings used in the fatal shooting</span></a><span>. Naturally, this has led to a rehash of long-debated discussions on whether </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/charlie-kirk-shooter-tyler-robinson-discord-reddit-memes-2000625746"><span>violent crimes can be linked to video games</span></a><span>.</span></p>
