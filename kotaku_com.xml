With <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-skyrockets-to-200m-in-first-month/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/pokmon-trading-card-game-pocket-skyrockets-to-200m-in-first-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rumors</a></span> that the game has netted over $200 million in its first month, it’s now been officially announced that the mobile app has been downloaded over 60 million times since its October 30 launch. To accompany this news, the <em>Pocket</em> devs have revealed a rather big surprise: there’s to be a new special set of Mew-themed packs called Mythical Island, arriving in the game on December 17.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,196663,197298" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It was widely expected that a new set would join (rather than replace, given the game’s so-far redundant “Select Expansion” page) the launch set, Genetic Apex, at the end of January, as this would follow the three-monthly cycle of the real-world version of the TCG. But I don’t think anyone was expecting a new “Themed Booster Pack” set before the end of the year. That’s the designation given to Mythical Island, which—and I’m speculating somewhat here with ambiguous information—appears to be a smaller “special set” (it’s coded “A1a”, to Genetic Apex’s “A1”), with just Mew pack art, that’ll throw some excellent spanners into the current meta.</p><p><em>Pocket</em> has so far featured just Genetic Apex, the unfortunately named set (everyone else sees it as the codename for a <em>Wolfenstein</em>-style enemy project, right?) that has featured Pikachu, Charizard and Mewtwo. While collecting the entire set <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974">would take you over a year</a></span> without paying astonishing amounts of money, it’s been around long enough now that most people have the cards to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-best-decks-mewtwo-charizard-1851696181&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-best-decks-mewtwo-charizard-1851696181">build the decks that are dominating the meta</a></span>. In fact, if you take part in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-emblem-event-sp-1851716406&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-emblem-event-sp-1851716406">fun new Emblem Event</a></span>, you’ll almost inevitably face either the Mewtwo, Charizard, Blastoise or Pikachu decks, almost without variation. So what the game really needs is a bunch of new cards thrown in to explode all that.</p><p>So hooray for news of Mythical Island in less than a week. The trailer flashes a whole bunch of new cards, including of course a Mew ex, which has a single energy 20 damage attack, but then a very Ditto-like ability for three energy (and energy of <em>any</em> type, making this a strong addition to any deck) called Genome Hacking. This lets you “choose 1 of your opponent’s Active Pokémon’s attacks and use it as this attack.”</p><p>However, I think the real game-changer is going to be an Aerodactyl ex that has an Ability to prevent your opponent from evolving their Active Pokémon. Given how much of the meta is based around such a move, this should shake things up! Better get used to evolving on the bench.</p><figure id="" data-id="4076bda49ed705f824db09785f24ab03" data-recommend-id="image://4076bda49ed705f824db09785f24ab03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A series of Pokémon cards from the Mythical Island set." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A series of Pokémon cards from the Mythical Island set." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4076bda49ed705f824db09785f24ab03" data-recommend-id="image://4076bda49ed705f824db09785f24ab03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A series of Pokémon cards from the Mythical Island set." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Also briefly glimpsed is a Vaporeon special art with a new Ability to transfer water energy between cards, and gorgeous special arts for Dedenne and Marshadow.</p><p>There are new Trainers, too, including Blue, who will reduce all incoming damage for a turn by 10 points, and Leaf who’ll really mess everything up by reducing retreat costs on your Active Pokémon by <em>two</em>. X Speed, step aside.</p><p>It’s hard to know if the set is very tiny, and just has the two ex cards and the two new Trainers, or if the trailer is being very selective in what it shows—infuriatingly, these <em>Pocket</em> cards don’t have the traditional numbering that shows you a set’s size. Still, at least I know <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-sword-shield-scarlet-violet-yuka-morii-1849600725&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-sword-shield-scarlet-violet-yuka-morii-1849600725">my Yuka Morii binder</a></span> will increase by at least one more card, with the addition of her splendid Exeggcute that originally appeared in <em>Sun &amp; Moon</em>’s Forbidden Light set in 2018.</p><p>I can’t wait to see how this forces everyone to change tactics come December 17.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With next year’s <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, there’s to be yet another innovative step: a “canon mode” that will optionally streamline its narrative to one historical path.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196299" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="385" data-playlist="196299,196470,195922" data-current="196299"><div><p>You Should Play Grand Theft Auto III Before GTA VI | Total Recall</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196299/196299_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21849.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>During <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/hi_we_are_brooke_charles_jonathan_and_thierry/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/hi_we_are_brooke_charles_jonathan_and_thierry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Reddit AMA last night</a></span>, four developers working on the game answered questions about <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, including news that the game will feature an “immersive mode” that will have all the game’s characters speaking in Japanese, while explaining that the game’s months-long delay has been used for polish, debugging and balancing, specifically fine-tuning the parkour and improving the parry mechanics. But perhaps the most interesting reveal is the “Canon Mode,” designed to appease players who are concerned about the game’s branching storylines, given the series’ focus on synchronizing with the past.</p><p>“Choices come more into play when recruiting allies and romance [sic] some of the characters,” said Jonathan Dumont, the director on <em>Shadows</em>. “Since the fan base is divided on branching dialogues, we have incorporated an option called CANON MODE which allows you to play the game with choices already made for you, to give you a choice free experience.” Elsewhere in the thread Dumont adds, “You will still be able to switch characters in [the] open in this mode.”</p><p>This news was met with delight by those taking part in the AMA. “Wait, WHAT??? Are you serious? That’s basically what the fanbase has been asking for since 2018,” said one person. “Oh my god, amazing,” replied another. A third suggested, “Wild pitch: retroactively add this mode to <em>Odyssey</em> and <em>Valhalla</em>.”</p><figure id="" data-id="0f054038f8cb7a853b5feaa9adccb21d" data-recommend-id="image://0f054038f8cb7a853b5feaa9adccb21d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1435" data-height="807" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The choice screen for playing as Yasuke or Naoe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The choice screen for playing as Yasuke or Naoe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f054038f8cb7a853b5feaa9adccb21d" data-recommend-id="image://0f054038f8cb7a853b5feaa9adccb21d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1435" data-height="807" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The choice screen for playing as Yasuke or Naoe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While there are some very loud voices that strongly believe all games should only be playable in their hardest modes, back in real life everyone approaches games very differently. Some seek super-hard, reflex-heavy combat, and want to be told the story by a fixed narrator, while others love to become embroiled in a twisting narrative on which they have huge influence but want to walk away at the sight of a boss fight. And indeed, everything in-between, outside of that, and the whole lot combined.</p><p>Ubisoft has been making some big strides in the games it <em>does</em> release regarding letting players structure a game according to their own tastes, and while it’s fair to say the publisher has led the way in this regard, many others are now following. Where once we were lucky to choose between Easy, Normal and Hard, it’s becoming more commonplace to let a player tweak specific aspects of their $70 purchase, creating the tone of game that best suits their desires. (We’re edging closer and closer to my <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-origins-tourism-difficulty&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-origins-tourism-difficulty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skippable boss fight future</a></span>.)</p><p>It seems yet another step in this direction to offer an option to those who simply don’t want to make narrative choices for whatever reason. There are many <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> die-hards who want a single, pure storyline, to make sense of the game’s reliving history through memory, and find the player-driven deviations, well, deviant. For others it could be choice paralysis—that awful fear that you might be picking the “wrong” option, and then worrying about that instead of enjoying the game. The Canon Mode will automatically select what the developers consider the true, historical path through the game, which the same AMA confirms will have a single canon ending.</p><p>And, of course, for those who find the idea plain strange, it is just an option, with a branching storyline for the two different characters set as the game’s default.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
