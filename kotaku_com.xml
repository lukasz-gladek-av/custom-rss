              <p>Valentine’s Day is just around the corner, and what better way to show your love than flowers that you can build together and never have to replace? We’re talking about LEGO roses, which aren’t just a sweet gesture, but also look incredibly beautiful and require zero upkeep.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6962/">If you haven’t picked a gift up yet, or are looking for a second one, the LEGO Roses set is available for just under $10 at Amazon, after a nice $5 discount</a>. It’s a great time to grab one without overspending, and even pick up a few, because a bouquet never hurts.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6962/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Quick to Build</h2>
<p>It’s not one of those massive builds that takes days and weeks to complete. LEGO keeps it short and sweet with this one. You’re getting a total of just 120 pieces, which come together to make two beautiful roses with adjustable stems. The stem of each rose measures over 10 in. (26 cm) long, so it’s perfect for displaying in a vase. You can plan a cute LEGO date around building these with your partner, while also asking each other thoughtful questions for a meaningful conversation, or go down memory lane together. Maybe stream a cute, romantic movie as you build – the possibilities are endless!</p>
<p>These are great as Valentine’s Day gifts, but also make a thoughtful present for Mother’s Day, Women’s Day, birthdays, and anniversaries. You can even treat yourself to a set because hey, you need to appreciate yourself too.</p>



<p>Building these is pretty straightforward. The set comes with a detailed instruction booklet that takes you through each step one-by-one. The book includes visuals to assist you, which makes the process even easier. LEGO also has its own building app – the LEGO Builder – which offers 3D instructions. You can zoom in on the blocks from each angle to understand the steps better. The app also lets you track your progress, build with friends, and save sets.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6962/">You can now grab the LEGO Roses set for just under $10, after Amazon took $5 off its usual $15 price.</a> If you’re open to spending a bit more, it’s also worth checking out other sets in LEGO’s Botanical collection. Several options are discounted right now, so you can mix and match flowers for a fuller, more colorful bouquet!</p>

              <p>The Pokémon Company has issued an apology after a listing appeared on its official site for a&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG</em> event said to be taking place at the Yasukuni Shrine. This controversial site has repeatedly caused consternation in Japan when visited by political figures, and even by previous Pokémon employees, and once again people were upset to see the location listed as the site of a TCG tournament.</p> <p>The Yasukuni Shrine commemorates the Japanese people who died in conflicts from 1869 to 1954, and thus includes the soldiers who died as part of Japan’s forces fighting for the Axis powers in World War II, many of whom were charged with the most serious of war crimes. As such, it’s a very controversial site, both within and without the country, and it causes serious stirs whenever anyone of prominence chooses to make a public visit. Indeed, The Pokémon Company discovered this for itself in 2019 when a number of employees from Creatures visited the Shinto shrine for its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsum%C5%8Dde"><i>hatsumōde</i></a>.</p>

 <p>Given its hugely complicated politics and the controversies that arise every time it’s visited, TPC clearly doesn’t want it used as the site of a <em>PTCG</em> event. However, live events are added to the company’s site by those with an official <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>Play certification, rather than by TPC itself. It works the same all around the world—if you want to find a local Play event near you, <a href="https://events.pokemon.com/EventLocator/?locale=en-us">you can look them up on the U.S. version of the site</a>. So it seems someone with such a certification in Japan added the event to the vast numbers listed for the country.</p> <p>“On the event search page of the ‘Pokémon Card Game Trainers Website’ operated by our company,” <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/media/news/detail/368.html">begins a statement on&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em>‘s corporate site</a> (via machine translation), “information about an event scheduled to be held at Yasukuni Shrine was posted.” The statement goes on to call allowing this Yasukuni Shrine event to be listed the result of a “lack of due diligence,” adding, “even though it should not have been held in the first place.”</p>

 <p>The event was canceled once discovered, say TPC, adding an apology (again, via machine translation). “We have received feedback and opinions from various parties since the information about this event was released, and we sincerely apologize for this.” The company adds that it will “fundamentally change and strengthen the review system and confirmation process for event information” to prevent something like this happening again.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Nintendo Direct Rumors Point To An Incoming Flood Of Switch 2 Ports]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/february-nintendo-direct-switch-2-3d-mario-2000664537</link>
            <guid>1420885</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The usual suspects are buzzing about an upcoming Nintendo Direct to kick off February. This one will reportedly be a Partner Showcase, so while I wouldn’t expect teases for anything wild like a new <em>3D Mario</em> game, we’ll probably got a healthy influx of new <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ports-cyberpunk-2077-ps4-ps5-xbox-dlss-outlaws-1851782817">Switch 2 ports</a> to help button down the first half of the platform’s year.</p> <p>Nintendo traditionally holds a February showcase to preview what’s coming and help fill in release calendar slots for its loyal fans. Podcasting insider <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2016962284921249815">NateTheHate</a> and YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKp9okfMtdI">GameXplain</a> have both suggested 2026 will follow a similar pattern, though the event will be a Partner Showcase rather than a full-blown first-party Direct. <em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-coming-next-week-dedicated-to-partner-games/">VGC</a></em> was also able to corroborate those claims. So expect a new Nintendo Direct somewhere around February 3-5.</p>

 <p>But what is Nintendo likely to show? Well, we’re still waiting on firm release dates for <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Switch 2. The latter was recently rumored to be coming near the end of February. There’s also been plenty of smoke about <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> making it over to Nintendo’s latest console, as well as the port for <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> coming sooner than expected. <em>Metaphor: Refantazio</em>, <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, and <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> also seem like potential candidates.</p> <p>I’m more curious to see where this missing Microsoft support for the Switch 2 is. Some version of <em>Call of Duty</em> is rumored to be coming to the platform this spring and the company still hasn’t confirmed a <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> remake port for the Switch 2. There’s also plenty of lower-hanging fruit like<em> Sea of Thieves</em>, <em>Diablo 4</em>, and <em>Avowed</em>, which is coming to PS5 next month. <em>Starfield</em> would also be a big get. Is a Switch 2 port part of the game’s rumored 2.0 plans? Hopefully.</p>

 <p>Announcements for new games would also be nice. We know we’re getting FromSoftware’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-duskbloods-elden-ring-hidetaka-miyazaki-switch-2-1851774753">multiplayer action game <em>Duskbloods</em></a> sometime this year. It’ll be interesting to see if any other major studios reveal exclusive side-projects for the Nintendo platform. But in the new era of every game being playable on every device, that seems less likely than a slew of new AAA ports.</p>

              <p>Calling the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 “ultra-wide” barely scratches the surface. This thing is enormous. At 49 inches across, it can dominate an entire desk. It’s the kind of monitor that makes dual-screen setups look quaint, delivering a single, seamless canvas that stretches far into your peripheral vision. Right now, it’s also far more affordable than usual. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3899/">The Odyssey OLED G9 normally sells for $1,249, but Amazon has dropped the price to $900, knocking a hefty $349 off the total for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3899/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Lose Yourself in Super Wide Worlds</h2>
<p>That massive panel isn’t just about size for the sake of spectacle. The display runs at a resolution of 5120 by 1440, effectively matching two 27-inch QHD monitors fused together. Games and apps have room to breathe, and multitasking feels natural instead of cramped. The 1800R curve gently wraps around your field of view, making long gaming sessions feel immersive rather than overwhelming. It mirrors the way our eyes naturally take in our surroundings, pulling you deeper into sprawling open worlds or competitive arenas.</p>
<p>Speed is another major highlight. With a 240Hz refresh rate, the Odyssey OLED G9 is built for fluid motion and fast reactions. Paired with an ultra-low 0.03ms response time, on-screen action stays immediate and razor sharp even during frantic firefights or high-speed racing. NVIDIA G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium Pro support keep frames smooth and synchronized with your GPU, minimizing screen tearing and stutter so gameplay stays consistent and responsive.</p>



<p>The OLED panel itself elevates everything you put on screen. Blacks are truly black, whites are strikingly bright, and colors have a depth that standard LCDs struggle to match. Contrast is intense and precise, with light and dark areas kept tightly controlled. There’s no distracting glow or bleed around bright objects, which helps scenes look cleaner and more realistic. Games, movies, and even everyday desktop use benefit from the added clarity and vibrancy.</p>
<p>Connectivity is refreshingly flexible. The monitor includes HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort, and a built-in USB hub, making it easy to juggle multiple devices. You can keep a gaming PC, work laptop, and another device connected at the same time and switch between them effortlessly. The Odyssey OLED G9 can even detect active sources and automatically jump to the right input. For power users, picture-in-picture and split-screen options allow two different systems to share the display side by side.</p>
<p>Deals like this don’t come around often for flagship OLED gaming monitors. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3899/">Dropping from $1,249 to $900, the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 becomes far more compelling for anyone ready to go all-in on a truly immersive setup.</a> For players who want size, speed, and image quality in one unapologetically massive package, this is a rare chance to save big.</p>
