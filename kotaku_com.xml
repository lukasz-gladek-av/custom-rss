But in August, it was reported that the game wasn’t making enough money and was hemorrhaging players. Ubisoft has now announced that <em>XDefiant </em>won’t be around for much longer.  </p><p>On December 3, Ubisoft confirmed that starting today, new players won’t be able to download <em>XDefiant </em>or register an account for the shooter. Servers will remain active until June 3, 2025. The game will then shut down. Ubisoft says the plan is to still release <em>XDefiant’s </em>season 3 content in the near future. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3lcgt4qickk2y&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/stephentotilo.bsky.social/post/3lcgt4qickk2y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Game File’</em>s Stephen Totilo reports</a></span> that Ubisoft is shutting down the San Francisco studio behind <em>XDefiant </em>as well as Ubisoft Osaka. It is also ramping down its Sydney team. Around 270 people are reportedly being laid off as a result of these shake-ups and half the <em>XDefiant </em>team is being moved to other projects. </p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has contacted Ubisoft for comment, but the publisher declined and pointed to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ubisoft.com/xdefiant-our-message-to-players&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ubisoft.com/xdefiant-our-message-to-players" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its official message on its website.</a></span></p><h2 id="h169390"><a id=""></a><em>XDefiant’s</em> boss confirms the shutdown</h2><p><em>XDefiant’s </em>executive producer, Mark Rubin, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/2wPUTEuXKpVoCvINTcxvGR&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/2wPUTEuXKpVoCvINTcxvGR" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a lengthy message confirming the news</a></span> and explaining that “until very recently,” Ubisoft was on board to keep supporting <em>XDefiant </em>in the hopes of it finding an audience and growing. However, Rubin says that “the journey became too much to sensibly continue.” </p><p>“Yes, this game has been a personal passion for me for years and yes, I know that not all challenges lead to victory, but I also want to recognize all of the developers who are being affected by this closure,” said Rubin. </p><p>“Each and every one of them is a real person with a real life separate from our own and they have all put so much of their own passion into making this game. And I hope that they can be proud of what they did achieve. I know that I will always be proud and grateful to have worked with such a great team!
