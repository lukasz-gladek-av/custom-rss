During one point in the Direct, Nintendo announced that it is changing how digital games work on Switch. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-digital-games-virtual-game-cards-vgc-switch-2-1851772706&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-digital-games-virtual-game-cards-vgc-switch-2-1851772706">Now players will buy Virtual Game Cards</a></span> that can be digitally shared between consoles and other players with some restrictions. This new system will go live in late April and will be compatible with Switch 2 at launch. And on a new website Nintendo created explaining Virtual Game Cards, there’s some fine print hinting at enhanced Switch 2 ports of past games. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lles54qmv527&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lles54qmv527" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by video game deals and news sharer Wario64</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/virtual-game-cards/#:~:text=*Available%20on%20Nintendo,title%20is%20ejected.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/virtual-game-cards/#:~:text=*Available%20on%20Nintendo,title%20is%20ejected." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some fine print at the bottom of this webpage</a></span> mentions something we’ve not heard about before: “Switch 2 Edition” games. These will only be playable on Switch 2 and will likely be enhanced native ports of older titles. </p><p>Here’s the full text with the important bits bolded: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Compatible systems must be linked to a Nintendo Account to use virtual game cards. Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games and<strong> Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games</strong> can only be loaded on a Nintendo Switch 2 system. To move virtual game cards between two systems, you must pair the systems via local wireless and an internet connection, but only when pairing the systems for the first time. Up to two systems total can be linked per Nintendo Account.</p></blockquote><p>Interesting! While we’ve known for a while now that Switch games will be mostly backward compatible with Switch 2, this is the first official mention of the possibility that some older games might get native ports to Switch 2. This will likely work similarly to PS4 games on PS5: most of them play just fine (or even better) on the more powerful hardware, but there are some titles that have received separate, native PS5 ports. For example, <em>Death Stranding</em> on PS4 plays great on PS5.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/234585/#:~:text=If%20you%20already,the%20discounted%20price.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/234585/#:~:text=If%20you%20already,the%20discounted%20price." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> But you can spend $10 to upgrade to the PS5 version which unlocks new visual features and options</a></span>.</p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has contacted Nintendo about this fine print and what it means. </p><p>For now, we can only speculate as to what “Switch 2 Edition” means. One possibility is that some of these Switch 2 Edition games will run at a higher framerate. Recently, dataminers discovered unused 60FPS code in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/544485/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-60-fps-switch-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/544485/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-60-fps-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em></a></span>. Many are theorizing that the game will run at a higher FPS on Switch 2. And that might be true, but perhaps only while playing a theoretical Switch 2 Edition of it. </p><p>Will you have to pay for these native ports? Maybe. Will they support cross-save and crossplay with older versions? Possibly. We don’t know yet, but hopefully we’ll learn more on April 2 during the announced Switch 2-focused Direct. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If you’re an anime enthusiast as well, you may have had your eye on <em>AI Limit</em>, which costs only $35. This may leave you wondering how long of a journey the game offers and whether it’s worth investing in. So let’s get into it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196773" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Summer Soulslike Keeps Looking Better And Better" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196773,196922,195502" data-current="196773"><div><p>This Summer Soulslike Keeps Looking Better And Better</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196773/196773_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196773/196773_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196773/196773_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196773/196773_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22330.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h37755"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to finish <em>AI Limit</em>?</h2><p><em>AI Limit</em> is a surprisingly meaty experience for about half the price of a standard game. Yes, this is partially because it poses a hell of a challenge (meaning you’ll die a lot), but it’s also packed with just as many locations and bosses as many far more expensive games in the soulslike genre. </p><p>Because of the difficulty, especially in regards to the many bosses you’ll encounter, how long it takes you to finish the game will be somewhat skill-dependent. However, <strong>an average playthrough is likely to take around 20 hours</strong>. This includes reaching the final boss without completing every side-quest or searching every nook and cranny.</p><p>But completionists can certainly get more from the game, especially those looking to score every achievement it has to offer. You’ll need to complete a rather large selection of cryptic NPC quests, including some that interweave and are dependent on one another. Additionally, you’ll have to obtain every weapon and spell, as well as see all three unique endings. </p><p>With all of that in mind<strong>, fully completing <em>AI Limit</em> absolutely requires multiple playthroughs via NG+, which allows you to carry over your level and weapons to a fresh run of the game</strong>. By doing this, you’ll be able to go back through and grab any missed weapons, spells, NPC quests, and so on. More importantly, you’ll be able to set yourself up for different endings. <strong>Doing all of this can easily net you upwards of 40 hours worth of gameplay in <em>AI Limit</em></strong>. </p><p>Again, how much time you ultimately get out of <em>AI Limit</em> will depend at least partially on your skill level and whether you reference any guides for helping you find any particularly well-hidden secrets. But either way, there’s quite a lot of soulslike goodness to enjoy in this anime-infused adventure!</p><hr><p><br><em>AI Limit</em> is available now for PS5 and PC.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The latest entry in the fighting game franchise that eventually spun off <em>King of Fighters</em> is out April 24 on PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC, and can count having the weirdest crossover fighter of all time among its distinctions. </p><p>But the funniest part about Ronaldo being in the next <em>Fatal Fury</em> is that it only vaguely looks like him and seems to be voiced by someone else entirely. At least it doesn’t look as bad as his bronze statue: </p><p>Ronaldo was previously <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-58528893&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-manchester-58528893" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accused of rape in 2009</a></span> but reached a settlement with the alleged victim and claimed he was innocent, even though she later came out publicly about the allegations following the 2019 #metoo movement. Why is he now in, of all things, a deep cut 2D fighter from Japanese arcade gaming’s past? It’s probably not just because the developers one day saw players in the <em>Fatal Fury </em>community having fun and decided to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PsychoSWeasel/status/1837901224298889454&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PsychoSWeasel/status/1837901224298889454" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turn those meme dreams into reality</a></span>. </p><p>Ronaldo plays for Al Nassr FC  after agreeing to take leave of Europe and help sportswash Saudi Arabia’s bad human rights record in exchange for over $200 million. Al Nassr FC is 75 percent owned by the Saudi royal investment fund which also happens to have a 96 percent controlling stake in<em> Fatal Fury</em> makers SNK. <br></p><p>“We’re not a political company or anything like that, so it doesn’t affect us in any way,” SNK designer and producer  Yasuyuki Oda said of the Saudi investment when questioned&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/snk-lead-insists-saudi-arabia-sale-will-have-no-effect-on-the-games-we-make/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/snk-lead-insists-saudi-arabia-sale-will-have-no-effect-on-the-games-we-make/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by<em> VGC</em></a></span> back in 2022. “It has no–<em>no</em>–effect on our creative output. We have full freedom on what we want to create.” Hmmm.</p><p>I had the chance to play <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> at Summer Game Fest last year and it was shaping up nicely, with a cool comic book art style and a new combat system to give players more offensive options from the start of each match. I can’t say I’m looking forward to playing as Ronaldo, but him being in the game also means getting to beat up on anyone who main’s him. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
