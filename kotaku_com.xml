In breathtaking fashion, 60 seconds of Season 1‘s final episode ask a terrifying question: What if the war with thinking machines isn’t over yet?</p><p>In the season finale, Sister Tula (Olivia Williams) and Sister Nazir (Karima McAdams) discover that the virus Hart has been whistling into people’s bodies, like a maniacal Pied Piper, feeds off of people’s fear. The virus burns the infected from the inside, attacking the amygdala, its power increasing as the victim succumbs to more fear. It’s still unclear how it may spread, or why nearly all of the Bene Gesserit in training were able to all have the same nightmares in past episodes. But, when we do find out what it is they’re seeing, the entire <em>Dune</em> universe is flipped upside down.</p><p>After confronting Hart near the end of the episode, Mother Superior Valya Harkonnen (Emily Watson) is able to fend off the virus, preventing it from feasting on her fears, and finally sees those glowing eyes shrouded in darkness that everyone infected were seeing. She, and everyone else, saw Hart’s traumatic experience of being swallowed by Shai-Hulud and then having the virus implanted into his right eye by a thinking machine while being watched by a shadowy figure. Unless Hart was devoured and then transported elsewhere, or never truly devoured at all, this would all but confirm that thinking machines had put Shai-Hulud under their control. </p><p>Their collaboration would make a lot of sense. When, in the penultimate episode, the spirit of Mother Superior Raquella Berto-Anirul (Cathy Tyson), in control of the body of her descendant Lila (Chloe Lea), examines the brain of Sister Kasha—Hart’s first Bene Gesserit victim—she sees a resemblance to a bioweapon used by thinking machines to kill humans by attacking their livers. Also, in the series premiere, Mother Superior Raquella, while on her deathbed decades before the events of <em>Dune: Prophecy</em>, saw a vision of the same burning flesh that resulted from anyone infected by Hart’s virus. She had that vision right after seeing Shai-Hulud devour Wallach IX, the home of the Sisterhood.</p><h2 id="h32911"><a id=""></a>This Changes A Lot For Season 2 And Next <em>Dune</em> Movie </h2><figure id="" data-id="5d13e1786dccb6b47879a01b2dcde1c0" data-recommend-id="image://5d13e1786dccb6b47879a01b2dcde1c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="960" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three people walking into Arrakis" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Three people walking into Arrakis" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Courtesy of HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5d13e1786dccb6b47879a01b2dcde1c0" data-recommend-id="image://5d13e1786dccb6b47879a01b2dcde1c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="960" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three people walking into Arrakis" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s a good thing HBO let the world know the series was renewed for a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dune-prophecy-season-2-hbo-bebe-gesserit-news-1851725756&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dune-prophecy-season-2-hbo-bebe-gesserit-news-1851725756">second season</a></span> before the season finale aired, because there would’ve been online riots demanding more episodes after the cliffhangers it leaves us with otherwise. In the season’s final moments, Tula reveal to Valya that Hart is the child whose death she lied to her sister about, and Valya embarks on an expedition trip to Arrakis with Princess Ynez Corrino (Sarah-Sofie Bousnina) and Kieran Atreides (Chris Mason). Those moments, in conjunction with the Shai-Hulud twist, show that <em>Dune: Prophecy</em>’s next season could be what sets up the Fremen being included in the show after an entire season of their absence. It also sets the stage for the next season to begin explaining how the Harkonnen and Atreides went from mortal enemies to collaborators in birthing the Messiah to lead humanity. </p><p>But this revelation of the thinking machines’ integration with Shai-Hulud also means the next season will likely see a showdown between the Bene Gesserit and the thinking machines. Valya remarks that the sisterhood came to Arrakis because “the path to our enemy begins here,” foreshadowing future conflict. As for the next <em>Dune </em>movie, the <em>Prophecy </em>season finale opens the door for the possibility that the sandworms that govern Arrakis in the films could still have a connection to thinking machines that has either been neutralized over the last 10,000 years, repurposed for their own benefits, or a combination of both. The prospect of thinking machines operating on humans inside of Shai-Hulud, not unlike the Fremen using the sandworms as transportation, opens the door for the possibility of some entity controlling those sandworms for their own motive. That person could possibly be Paul Atreides (Timothée Chalamet) when he fully becomes the Messiah.</p><p>It also can’t be a coincidence that the first person used by Shai-Hulud and thinking machines to bring Mother Superior Raquella’s destructive prophecy to fruition is the son of a Harkonnen and an Atreides, just like Paul Atreides is in the films. That, and Kieran embarking on an expedition with the current Mother Superior and the Bene Gesserit’s selection for ruler of the Imperium, could ultimately end up being footnotes in a long Atreides history that is glossed over in blood by the events of the next <em>Dune </em>movie. But the <em>Dune: Prophecy</em> season finale could foreshadow the lasting effects of the thinking machines’ virus, including it being genetically passed on in some fashion. </p><p>Does it sound far-fetched that thinking machines would embed a dormant contingency plan in the bloodline of a family set to birth the Messiah? Sure. Does it sound more far-fetched than thinking machines operating on a human being inside of a giant sandworm, infecting that person with a virus that feeds on fear? Absolutely not. We’ll just have to wait and see what <em>Dune: Prophecy</em> has done to the <em>Dune</em> universe.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

No matter which version you choose to sink your teeth into, you’ll have a bloody good time.</p></div></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/quentin-tarantino-toy-story-3-4-perfect-wont-watch-1851632823&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/quentin-tarantino-toy-story-3-4-perfect-wont-watch-1851632823">Quentin Tarantino</a></span>’s punchy dialogue and Robert Rodriguez’s chaotic direction were the perfect match to inject fresh blood into the vampire mythos. The filmmakers throw the crime, vampire, and western genres into a blender and watch the bloody remnants splatter on screen, creating an unhinged movie about a pair of bank robbers (George Clooney and Quentin Tarantino) who kidnap a preacher and his family, only to end up in a Mexican topless bar with a horde of rabid vampires. Like most of Tarantino and Rodriguez’s films, it’s filled with carnage and tension you can cut with a knife.</p></div><div><p><em>Byzantium</em> is a different kind of vampire story. Centered on a mother and daughter vampire duo, Eleanor (Saoirse Ronan) and Clara Webb (Gemma Arterton), the Neil Jordan-directed flick is far more pensive, questioning the existential burden of immortality and how you can come of age if you’re stuck at the same age forever. Eleanor wants to step out of her mother’s shadow, feeling remorse for her bloodlust, while Clara uses her power to fight back against the men who oppressed her. This patriarchal struggle offers a fresh spin on the typical vampire figure, and  Jordan’s gloomy, atmospheric direction gives vampirism a moving sadness seldom seen.</p></div><div><p>Ana Lily Amirpour’s <em>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night</em> is a unique vampire movie because it blends the horror, western, and noir genres while giving the vampire figure a feminist and global twist. It tells the story of an Iranian, skateboarding vampire, played by Sheila Vand, who preys on the men who exploit women. The stark black-and-white cinematography is stunning, giving <em>A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night </em>an eerie and surreal quality. In a world that often tries to hide crimes against women, the sharp, exacting colors reflect the clear-cut nature of the revenge she doles out, leaving no room to question what the men have done or what they deserve.</p></div><div><p>What’s cool about <em>Fright Night</em> is that the main character, teenage Charley Brewster (William Ragsdale), loves horror films and is completely obsessed with vampire mythology, which the movie both lovingly lampoons and infects with genuine frights. Charley is convinced his neighbor is a vampire and recruits an over-the-hill vampire killer to help defeat him. A highlight of the movie is the practical special effects, making the hellish creatures so well-made and finely detailed that they feel real. The movie cleverly interweaves monster movie tropes while riffing on neighborhood surveillance and suburban conformity, balancing just the right amount of camp and chills.</p></div><div><p>What if you had to live with your friends for the rest of your life? Ok, what if you were immortal? This humorous concept is at the heart of Jemaine Clement and Taika Waititi’s mockumentary, which follows a group of quirky, centuries-old vampires living together in modern-day New Zealand. We observe the vampire flatmates as they go about their rather mundane lives, despite being undead—arguing about household chores, adjusting to new technology, and finding their next feed. With countless pop culture vampires like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-blade-reboot-delay-production-issues-2025-mcu-1851678580&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-blade-reboot-delay-production-issues-2025-mcu-1851678580"><em>Blade</em></a></span>, <em>Twilight</em>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/slayer-shock-is-a-stealth-game-for-buffy-fans-1787546879&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/slayer-shock-is-a-stealth-game-for-buffy-fans-1787546879"><em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em></a></span>, this film stands out as a clever and original satire of vampire tropes.</p></div><div><p><em>The Lost Boys</em> seamlessly fits vampires into the sunny, fun-loving seaside town of Santa Carla, California. At night, the town comes alive with the roar of motorcycles and the bright, twinkling lights of carnival rides. Kiefer Sutherland leads a grungy gang of leather-wearing bloodsuckers, while Corey Haim and Corey Feldman deliver playful performances as the geeky, comic book-loving nerds who uncover the truth about the gang. <em>The Lost Boys</em> is a lot of fun, mixing humor and scares, while giving vampires a new, 1980s punk aesthetic that fits their rebellious, enigmatic cool perfectly.</p></div><div><p>Park Chan-wook is often at his best when he tackles more fantastical stories, and <em>Thirst</em> is no exception. His frequent collaborator Song Kang-ho plays a priest who transforms into a vampire after sacrificing himself for a medical experiment to find a cure for a deadly disease. He becomes caught between his moral values and his killer instinct, especially after he falls for an unhappily married woman. The conflict between his saintly and devilish sides is thrilling to watch in scenes with dark comedic twists, erotic encounters, and blood-soaked violence.</p></div><div><p> Universal Studios’ <em>Dracula</em> (1931), directed by Tod Browning, and featuring Bela Lugosi’s portrayal of Count Dracula, is the most well-known version of the blood-sucking legend in popular culture. Bela Lugosi’s Dracula has piercing eyes that can easily frighten his victims, but he’s also got that suave, seductive sophistication that makes him hard to resist. His heavy Hungarian accent and theatricality adds to the supernatural creature’s sense of mystery and debonair charm. The intricate designs of Dracula’s lavish castle, the melodramatic performances, and the gloomy atmosphere also give this version a lot of bite. This version of <em>Dracula </em>perfectly embodies the Gothic grandeur that immediately comes to mind when we think of the famous vampire. <br></p></div><div><p>Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, and a young Kirsten Dunst star as a makeshift vampire family navigating eternal life together, beginning in early 20th century New Orleans. Based on Anne Rice’s novel, <em>Interview with the Vampire</em> has the brooding vampire Louis de Pointe du Lac recount the story of his long, undead life to a biographer. We learn how tortured they were watching life change across centuries while never changing themselves. While <em>Interview with the Vampire</em> tends to drag in some parts and could have made the queer elements more apparent, the flamboyant performances (especially from Tom Cruise as Lestat) and ghoulish violence really suck you into their macabre world.</p></div><div><p><em>Shadow of the Vampire</em> creatively brings together horror and humor by imagining Max Schreck (a delightfully batty Willem Dafoe), who stars as Count Orlok in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nosferatu-robert-eggers-bill-skarsgard-movies-1851721835&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nosferatu-robert-eggers-bill-skarsgard-movies-1851721835"><em>Nosferatu: A Symphony of Horror</em></a></span>, as an actual vampire. He insists that he can only be filmed at night, never breaks character, and eagerly drinks blood. The crew can’t tell if he’s deeply immersed in his role, or if there’s some truth to him being the undead. Director F.W. Murnau (played by a wild-eyed John Malkovich) gleefully embraces Schreck’s unsettling commitment to his role—even to the deaths of his colleagues. <em>Shadow of the Vampire</em> makes us question our obsession with creating art that feels real, even at the risk of something truly monstrous.</p></div><div><p>Tomas Alfredson’s<em> Let the Right One In</em> offers a quieter take on vampire lore by telling a simple story about children. Frequently bullied by his peers, a lonely boy Oskar meets an elusive girl named Eli (Lina Leandersson) and learns that she is a vampire. The juxtaposition between childhood innocence and Eli’s thirst for violence is intense and fascinating, revealing itself in very swift and stark ways on screen. The themes of sadness, loneliness, and the struggle to fit in make vampirism feel perfectly suited to this coming-of-age story.</p></div><div><p>While the image of Nosferatu standing wide-eyed in the middle of the hallway with his claws curled has become more of a joke thanks to his appearance on <em>SpongeBob SquarePants</em>, the 1922 silent film is truly frightening. There’s a sense of dread lurking around every corner in the deep shadows. As Count Orlok, Max Schreck’s wide-eyed, unblinking stare, his hunched, gaunt figure, and those long, sharp curved nails create a truly terrifying character design. The fact that this movie is 100 years old, and you can see that in the grainy film stock, only adds to the creepiness, as if we’ve unearthed something from ancient history that should not be seen.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
