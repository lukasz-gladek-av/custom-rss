              <p>Summer is over. Sorry, folks. September is here, and even though the season doesn’t technically end until September 22, you and I both know that date is meaningless. Once August ends, I’m swapping my tank tops for flannels, drinking pumpkin spice lattes, and rewatching <em>Over the Garden Wall</em> again. And with summer ending, school is starting—a great time to save on a bunch of tech stuff with all the back-to-school sales. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3877/">Take this student laptop for instance. Normally priced at $1,400, this has dropped by 81%. That brings it under $300 to just $260 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><strong>This student-ready laptop is working with a powerful Intel N150 processor with an integrated graphics card</strong>. This thing won’t be playing <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> with ultra-high settings or anything, but it’s perfectly capable of taking care of basic everyday task a student might need. Things like browsing the web, sending emails, drafting up essays, or building slideshows will be easy-peasy. It comes pre-installed with Window 11 Home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3877/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The laptop’s got 4GB of RAM with 128GB of internal storage. However, it does come with <strong>an extra 128GB in the form of a microSDXC card</strong> generously included. That’s 256GB of workable space.</p>

<h2>Microsoft Office 365 Included</h2>
<p>You also get a full year subscription to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/microsoft-365">Microsoft 365</a>. That includes access to Word, PowerPoint, Excel, and more. Plus with OneDrive, you can get even more storage on the cloud which you’ll be able to access anywhere from your other devices. Forgot to submit your paper, but you’re sitting in class with your laptop back in the dorm? Not a problem. Just pull it up on your phone and send it away.</p>
<p>The anti-glare display stretches across at 14 inches and is capable of a resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels. You can expand onto a second monitor over either USB-C or HDMI which can support resolutions of up to 4K at 60Hz. In addition to those ports, you get two USB-A ports and an audio jack.</p>



<p>Collaboration is easy with the built-in mic and HD 720p web camera which can record crisp and clear videos.</p>
<p>With a long battery life of up to 11 hours on a single charge, you can keep it running all day. You won’t need to bring your charger with your when taking your laptop out to all your classes for the day.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3877/">For a limited time, you can save 81% on the HP 14 student laptop</a>. The price is down to just $260 for back-to-school season and it even comes with a year of Microsoft Office 365.</p>

              <p>Apple does not usually opt for leaving things at full price – basically as though they’re afraid to give discounts. It’s the brand image: high-end gear, high-end prices. Which is why this Amazon deal feels like a surprise: It apparently chose to do things its own way, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3886/">and it’s discounting the 2025 iPad 11-inch (Wi-Fi, 128GB) to a record-low $299 instead of $349</a>. So if you’ve ever thought that Apple deals don’t exist, well… here’s the proof that sometimes lightning does strike. The iPad itself? It’s rocking a <strong>near-perfect 4.8/5 rating</strong> from thousands of customers.</p>

<h2>Powerful and Affordable Tablet</h2>
<p>This iPad driven by Apple’s A16 chip which is the same fast silicon you usually only see putting iPhones into hyperdrive. Plus, you get 128GB of storage which is perfect for someone who requires space for apps and plenty of files. Add in all-day battery life, and you have a tablet you can easily carry around without concern for where the next power outlet will be.</p>
<p>Apple has put an 11‑inch Liquid Retina display in this iPad which is bright, clear and just nice to look at. Movies are colorful, games come alive on the screen, and sure—if you’re a designer or artist—the detail is great. Plus, the True Tone feature means the display adjusts to the lighting around you, so your eyes don’t feel fried after hours of use.</p>



<p>Now, let’s not forget the cameras: The front has a 12MP camera that’s perfect for FaceTime calls, online classes or Zoom meetings. Throw in Apple’s Center Stage technology and you are still well-framed on camera even when you move a little as you talk. The rear also has a 12MP camera which is handy for document scanning, taking quick shots, or even taking decent-quality video if your phone is out of reach.</p>
<p>With Wi‑Fi 6, uploads and downloads feel way faster and streaming is smoother. No dropped connections when you’re bingeing or working in the cloud. Apple also dumped the old Lightning port and replaced it with USB‑C which is a huge win. That means faster charging, quicker file transfers, and easy pairing with third‑party accessories.</p>
<p>Here’s the thing: this isn’t some stripped-down iPad that only lives to tantalize people into buying it. It’s the full 2025 model, with iPadOS preloaded and ready to go, and that’s where things come together. iPadOS has been optimized to really make the most of Apple’s processor, so multitasking is a joy, split‑screen is second nature, and you can actually do actual work on it.</p>
<p>So, let’s be real. The new iPad 11 is $299, its lowest price ever, and it just so happens to be one of the highest-rated tablets on the site. This is a tough bargain to beat if you’re looking for something that can do work, school, and entertainment in one fashionable package. Just hurry up—because with prices like these, stock never lasts long.</p>

              <p>Nintendo is adding a welcome fifth game to its grown up Mature section of the Nintendo Switch Online on September 4, with the arrival of 1998’s <em>Forsaken 64</em>. The six-degrees shooter is a total classic, and a superb addition to the top-tier version of Nintendo’s subscription service–although you’ll be hard-pressed to work out why it’s still considered an M.</p> <p>In the mid-90s, with the arrival of 3D graphics cards, developers were suddenly handed a whole other axis in which to explore. The stand-out example of this new-found freedom was 1995’s&nbsp;<em>Descent</em>, known as a “six degrees of freedom” game, where you controlled a floating ship that could orientate itself however it wished in 3D spaces. That shooter was created by Parallax Software, a name you might not recognize until I tell you the studio split in two, one half becoming Volition. (The other half became Outrage Entertainment which developed the incredible <em>Descent 3</em>.) So, the developer best known for <em>Saints Row</em> and&nbsp;<em>Red Faction</em> essentially launched a whole new genre, and it was into this that publisher Acclaim Entertainment released <em>Forsaken</em> in 1998.</p> <p>OK, that’s perhaps a somewhat generous way of observing just how derivative Probe Entertainment’s <em>Forsaken</em> was of&nbsp;<em>Descent</em> and its 1996 sequel, but it remains the case that&nbsp;<em>Forsaken</em> was outstanding in its own right. While wantonly lifting weapon types, power-ups and indeed the entire concept of flying a ship through 3D tunnels from its–uh–inspiration, the game became a pioneer of the growing 3D graphics market, and a solid six-degrees shooter in its own right.</p>

  <p>The N64 version of&nbsp;<em>Forsaken</em> came out just a week later, despite being partly developed by a different Acclaim studio, Iguana UK, and even having its own unique version of the storyline. The PC and PlayStation version of the game had you playing as a nefarious rogue attempting to plunder a nuclear-destroyed Earth for its treasures as a get-rich scheme, while <em>Forsaken 64</em> took a more noble interpretation, casting you as someone trying to take down those looters. It plays out the same, but Nintendo players had the moral highground.</p> <p>It’s obviously this version that’s due to arrive on the Nintendo Switch Online subscription service September 4, as part of its higher tier “Expansion Pack.” Except, for reasons that aren’t immediately clear,&nbsp;<em>Forsaken 64</em> is to be part of the separate <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Nintendo-64-Nintendo-Classics-Mature-2592474.html">Nintendo 64 – Nintendo Classics: Mature</a> app. That currently hosts&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark</em>,&nbsp;<em>Turok: Dinosaur Hunter</em>,&nbsp;<em>Turok 2: Seeds of Evil</em> and&nbsp;<em>Shadow Man</em>, all of which were originally released with an M rating in the ’90s. However,&nbsp;<em>Forsaken 64</em>‘s rating is a bit more confusing. The game was released with an M rating in the US, both on the box and the cartridge, <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/3485/forsaken-n64/">but despite the ESRB then and now rate the game as a T</a>. There’s some speculation this might be because the game featured a cheat where pressing Z, Down, C-Up, C-Left, C-Left, C-Left, C-Left, C-Down on the Start screen would unlock a Gore Mode, which would easily bump the game up from T to M in those days. If that cheat has been preserved for this release, then Nintendo presumably erred on the side of caution. Although of course this is all made a nonsense given&nbsp;<em>Golden Eye 64</em> remains a T and in the main app! And it all looks so gorgeously innocent and mild some three decades later.</p> <p>This release will support all the original 4-player multiplayer modes, which are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hCerd9OfTLY">still super-satisfying today</a>. The only real challenge this faces is being added on the same day&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> comes out.</p>
