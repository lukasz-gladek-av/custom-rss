The studios involved also explained that this new game will feature the familiar classes and vehicles, used in destructible maps—all hallmarks of the series. And this next <em>Battlefield </em>game, which remains unnamed and doesn’t have a release date, will include a single-player campaign, too.</p><p>The other big news announced today is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/battlefield/battlefield-labs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Battlefield Labs</a></span>. This program, which players can sign up for now, will let select users join in on early, pre-alpha gameplay tests. </p><p>While this might sound similar to a typical beta test—something EA has done before—the studios involved in this next <em>Battlefield</em> game indicated that Battlefield Labs is different. Players are going to be given more content than before, at an earlier state in development than usual, and will help provide feedback on what’s working and what’s not working. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/faq#:~:text=BATTLEFIELD%20LABS%20%26%20BATTLEFIELD%20STUDIOS%20FAQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/faq#:~:text=BATTLEFIELD%20LABS%20%26%20BATTLEFIELD%20STUDIOS%20FAQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here’s how EA describes Labs in a FAQ</a></span> found on the franchise’s website: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>[BF Labs] space for play and exploration; an environment where we can test concepts and mechanics with our players before we release them publicly. Our community is at the heart of <em>Battlefield</em>; their feedback is crucial in helping us know what to prioritize, what to improve and what feels like an authentic <em>Battlefield </em>experience.</p></blockquote><p>It will be interesting to see how BF Labs impacts the development of the game and also how much of the content from the tests leaks online for everyone to see. </p><p>EA is certainly investing a lot of money and resources into getting <em>Battlefield</em> back on track after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-bf2042-season-7-last-ea-motive-future-1851397390&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-2042-bf2042-season-7-last-ea-motive-future-1851397390"><em>2042 </em>and <em>BFV</em></a></span><em> </em>weren’t <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/one-year-later-battlefield-v-still-cant-please-fans-1840664898&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/one-year-later-battlefield-v-still-cant-please-fans-1840664898">huge hits with the community</a></span>. The return to modern-day combat and classic class-based multiplayer sounds promising, and the idea of bringing in player feedback early could help steer the teams in the right direction. For now, we have to wait and see how it all shakes out. </p><p>EA has not revealed a release window or official name for the next game. BF Labs’ FAQ indicates the next game will only available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some players said they’d never buy a Warner Bros. multiplayer game again. <em>MultiVersus</em> went from a “mostly positive” rating on Steam with over 100,000 reviews to “mostly negative” over the weekend. </p><p>But the fallout turned more ugly when a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1iew7s0/the_development_of_multiversus_was_problematic/?share_id=u1ZiehLmE-dYH35ydinoT&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1iew7s0/the_development_of_multiversus_was_problematic/?share_id=u1ZiehLmE-dYH35ydinoT&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">series of anonymous, unsubstantiated comments</a></span> claiming to be from people who worked on the game directly blamed game director Tony Huynh for all of its problems. It was made worse by a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ifi2g0/ausilmv_seems_to_debunk_a_lot_of_the_claims/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ifi2g0/ausilmv_seems_to_debunk_a_lot_of_the_claims/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seemingly fake roster</a></span> of finished characters that “leaked” and circulated over the weekend, which added fuel to fan conspiracies about <em>MultiVersus </em>prioritizing the wrong roster additions. </p><p>“I’m sorry if we couldn’t get to your favorite character,” Huynh <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Tony_Huynh/status/1886119648480915954&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Tony_Huynh/status/1886119648480915954" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote on X</a></span> over the weekend. “I do think Aquaman and Lola are really cool and I hope you all check them out. Character selection comes down to bunch of things including development time, listening to what the community wants, working with IP holders and approvals, if there is a cross-marketing opportunity available to support, and of course if the team is inspired to make the character. So a lot goes into to it.”</p><p>He continued:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> I don’t have the power some you think I do. PFG is a highly collaborative team and ideas are encouraged and can come from anyone and we promote delivering value to players. </p><p> I also hope that the community notices that we try to listen and act. Like any developer we’re limited by time and resources.  I know that this is painful for everyone, and I know every member of PFG feels it too, but I have to call this out, you’re entitled to what you say and think, but when there are threats to harm it’s crossing the line. I hope that you can take a step back and realize that this is an extremely sad time for the team. I am in deep mourning for the game. Nobody wanted this outcome and it wasn’t from lack of caring or effort.</p></blockquote><p><em>MultiVersus </em>community manager and game developer Angelo Rodriguez Jr. also came to Huynh’s defense. “I’ve legitimately been losing sleep over the past few days watching as all of [this] has been happening to Tony,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AJAX_HQ/status/1886134953546838238&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AJAX_HQ/status/1886134953546838238" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he wrote on X</a></span>, before going on to praise the director’s devotion to the game and the sacrifices he made on its behalf. “I know things aren’t the best right now and everyone is looking for answers,” Rodriguez Jr. continued. “Receiving threats of physical harm against him is not and will never be the way.”</p><p>It’s the second high-profile game Warner Bros. has pulled the plug on this year. It also abandoned <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>, which won’t receive any new updates but will remain online, after it struggled to win fans in its first year in what amounted to a reportedly $200 million loss for the publisher. The good news is that both games will remain available to play offline, unlike most live-service games that don’t make it. </p><p>And not everyone is using <em>MultiVersus</em>’ demise to settle scores or rehash old design debates.” Thank you <em>MultiVersus</em> for the awesome memories,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersus/comments/1igaodz/thank_you_multiversus_for_the_awesome_memories/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersus/comments/1igaodz/thank_you_multiversus_for_the_awesome_memories/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reads one recent top thread</a></span> on the subreddit. “Wanted to say thank you to the development team for the probably insane work that they’ve done to make this game,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersus/comments/1ighm6a/thank_you_to_the_dev_team_for_making_this_game/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MultiVersus/comments/1ighm6a/thank_you_to_the_dev_team_for_making_this_game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another</a></span> began. “It really is a shame that this game is shutting down, but I’m still happy that it happened and that we had the chance to play it. You could really tell that a lot of love was poured into this game.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
