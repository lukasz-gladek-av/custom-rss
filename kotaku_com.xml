              <p>Earlier this year, Microsoft ramped up the price of its current-gen consoles. The 512GB Xbox Series S jumped up from $300 to $380, with all the models above it seeing similar price hikes. Well, <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/hardware-network/console/may-2025-pricing-updates">Microsoft is at it again</a> as the company decided to tack on an extra $20 to make it an even $400 as of October 3. This comes alongside the announcement that the various levels of Xbox Game Pass are getting some light rebranding along with, you guessed it, price increases. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4524/">However, looks like someone forgot to tell Amazon because right now, you can score the 512GB Xbox Series S for just $329.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4524/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>All-Digital Gaming Console</h2>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4524/">This Xbox gaming consoles comes packed with one controller and an internal storage of 512GB</a>. A full 1TB version is available but that one is not on sale at the moment. This game system is disc-free meaning all the games you play will need to be downloaded onto the consoles or onto an external SSD which can be purchased separately. Some games are avail to be streamed from the cloud with the right Game Pass subscription as well.</p>
<p>The console does not support 4K gaming, but it still produces a resolution higher than the standard HD, rendering at 1440p. Through apps and streaming subscriptions like Netflix, HBO MAc, and Disney Plus, you can enjoy TV and movies in full 4K. It’s got HDR support to really make sure those dark spots stay dark and that vibrant colors brightly pop. A game like the newly released <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> looks awesome in HDR on a proper screen as so much of that game exists in solid black areas with radiant colors sprinkled throughout.</p>



<p>You can even play&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em>for free with a subscription to Xbox Game Pass. This does come with the small caveat of that price jump announced earlier this week. The top tier of this video game subscription service just went up from $20 a month to $30. A 50% price increase to the premiere game service alongside price increased for consoles across the board doesn’t exactly feel great. There are however some great titles on the Essential tier of Game Pass which is just $10 per month. On that tier you’ll find games like&nbsp;<em>Slay the Spire</em>,&nbsp;<em>Psychonauts 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tunic</em>,&nbsp;<em>Control</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Ori and the Will of the Wisps</em>. You may not be getting day one first party launches there but there is a deep treasure trove of awesome titles waiting to be played.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Lenovo 15.6″ Laptop (16GB RAM, 512GB SSD) Crashes to Nearly Free After 82% Cut, Early Prime Day Exclusive]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazons-giving-away-this-brand-new-loaded-2199-lenovo-laptop-for-practically-nothing-2000631661</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-lenovo-15-6%E2%80%B3-laptop-16gb-ram-512gb-ssd-crashes-to-nearly-free-after-82-cut-early-prime-day-exclusive.1317496/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When is something both overpriced and a massive bargain? When it’s a brand-new 15.6-inch FHD Lenovo laptop with an Intel N4500 processor, and Windows 11 Professional pre-installed, and it has a kinda-crazy original price tag that’s marked down in a <em>huge</em> way at Amazon. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4530/">This limited-time deal knocks 82% from the (overpriced) $2,199 original cost to a (massive bargain) $400.</a></p>
<p>Toss that original price and look at what the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 packs into a $400 package, and the quality of this Amazon deal becomes obvious very quickly. Simply, this is a stalwart everyday laptop that can handle serious work while giving you ample options to play. Lenovo’s longstanding reputation for building durable laptops enhances the broad appeal of the IdeaPad 1 for professionals, students, or just casual PC users.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4530/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Solid as a Rock</h2>
<p>From end to end, everything about the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 speaks to absolute reliability. There are faster laptops, there are laptops with more memory than the IdeaPad 1’s 16GB of RAM and more storage than the IdeaPad 1’s 512GB — although both are easily and inexpensively expanded — and there are laptops with bigger and more spectacular displays. But the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 isn’t lacking anywhere — the Intel Celeron N4500 processor can reach 2.8GHz in speed, the FHD display (1920 x 1080 resolution) has anti-glare treatment, and the Intel UHD Graphics chip pairs with the monitor to deliver a solid and reliable performance.</p>
<p>When it’s time to put the Lenovo IdeaPad 1 to the test with a video conference or video call, it comes ready with a 720p HD webcam with built-in Privacy Shutter, and two Dolby Audio speakers. The rest of your everyday productivity is made easy by the preloaded Windows 11 Professional OS, which includes Microsoft Copilot for an ultra-fast AI assist whenever you need it.</p>



<h2>Connections For All</h2>
<p>The Lenovo IdeaPad 1 has all the connections you need, and perhaps even more. Start with the Wi-Fi 6 11ax 2×2 and Bluetooth 5.2 hookups that make your browsing and streaming life a cinch, and the USB ports — a 2.0 Type-A, a 3.2 Gen 1 Type-A, and a 3.2 Gen 1 Type-C for fast data transfers — HDMI 1.4b port, and card reader present all the options you need for peripherals and external monitors.</p>
<p>We’re not really sure who came up with the original $2,199 price tag on this Lenovo 15.6-inch IdeaPad 1. It’s certainly not a price we’d ever recommend for an exceptionally solid and reliable laptop from a leading manufacturer. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4530/">But for just $400 after Amazon’s jaw-dropping 82%-off limited-time discount? </a>We’re all in on that.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-drops-lego-deals-big-for-prime-day-mini-f1-car-toys-now-selling-for-3-each-2000632056</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been looking for a way to share your Formula 1 enthusiasm with your kids while keeping them entertained with quality building toys, LEGO has created exactly what you need. The <strong>LEGO F1 collectible race cars pack</strong> brings the excitement of the racing circuit straight to your living room and right now, Amazon is offering this set at a record low price during Prime Big Deal Days: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4535/">Down from $30 to just $20, this mystery box collection has climbed into the top 10 best-selling LEGO sets</a> on the site.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4535/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Twelve Teams, Virtually Limitless Possibilities</h2>
<p>The allure of this set is its mystery box structure: <strong>Six randomly picked mini F1 race cars out of a total of 12 varying models</strong> are received, which makes for a different combination with each purchase. The available roster consists of <strong>RB20, Mercedes-AMG, Ferrari, McLaren, Aston Martin, Alpine, Williams, VCARB, Sauber, Haas, a generic F1, and an F1 Academy car</strong>. Each model is incredibly small (being a few inches in length) which makes them ideal for little hands to hold on to and operate for creative race scenarios. The<strong> randomness provides for a surprise that children dearly enjoy</strong>&nbsp;and creates a fuss around the unboxing alone as children see which teams ended up in their individual collection.</p>



<p>LEGO did not skimp on details here: Each car comes decorated in <strong>genuine team colors with actual team logos emblazoned</strong> directly onto the bodywork so that young supporters will have the opportunity to recognize their favored teams at a glance. A <strong>team helmet occupying each cockpit</strong> adds another note of realism which F1-fixated youngsters will love.</p>
<p>The wheels spin smoothly, too, which makes these from passive display pieces into dynamic racing toys. Children can push them around the floor, prepare racing grids on the table top, or devise elaborate race scenarios pitting disparate teams against one another for the championship crown. At a total of 174 pieces divided between six cars, individual assemblies, which take between 10-15 minutes, remain small enough for little ones but still encounter enough challenge to be satisfying.</p>



<p>They’re compact enough that you can toss a few into a purse for restaurant waits, road trips, or flights when you’d like something to amuse kids without wasting valuable luggage space. They’re ideal birthday party favors when you’re hosting a racing-themed party, too. Instead of gaudy-cheap pieces of plastic that snap off after a few hours, guests depart with actual LEGO constructions they’ll be able to use repeatedly and treasure.</p>
<p>At $20 for a six-car pack, you’re out about $3.33 per model, which is extremely cheap considering each one is a complete buildable set complete with actual F1 branding. Because there are 12 distinct cars overall, acquiring two 6-packs provides a good likelihood of assembling a majority or all of the released models. As built, the little racers look great lining a shelf in your child’s bedroom, on a starting grid layout, or assembled into team alliances.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon has formally rolled out <strong>Prime Big Deal Day</strong>&nbsp;which makes tens of thousands of special deals available for Prime members alone. This is one of the primary membership perks: you get sale prices at all-time lows on hottest items across the board. If you have been waiting for a Wi-Fi 7 router from a world-class manufacturer, this is the deal that you simply cannot pass up.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4520/">TP-Link Archer BE800 has gone on sale at $299 (original $599), which is a stunning 50% off one of the best routers available</a> on the market today. This tri-band giant solves the growing problem of bandwidth saturation common in homes nowadays where dozens of devices compete for connectivity, phones, laptops, smart TV and gaming devices being some examples.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4520/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>WiFi 7 Technology That Redefines Your Network</h2>
<p>The Archer BE800 takes Wi-Fi 7’s revolutionary capabilities and combines them<strong> for a total of 19 Gbps across three bands</strong>: 11,520 Mbps on the 6 GHz band, 5,760 Mbps on the 5 GHz band, and 1,376 Mbps on the 2.4 GHz band. These translate to real-world performance that <strong>handles several 4K and 8K streams at once</strong> without buffering, supports VR-AR gaming without lag and keeps video calls going smoothly even when other members of the household are downloading large files.</p>



<p>The 320 MHz channel bandwidth doubles the pipe compared to Wi-Fi 6’s highest 160 MHz channels and allows for more information at once. Combined with 4K-QAM modulation which encodes more information per transmission, the router provides much better throughput compared to previous generations. Multi-RU functions allow the router to support many devices at once on the same channel without creating the bottlenecks that occur when many devices contend for attention.</p>
<p>The physical connectivity choices are just as solid: <strong>Two 10 Gbps ports support future-proofed wired connections</strong> for high-end users such as NAS setups, desktop workstations, or ISP connections above the standard gigabit rates. One is a combo SFP+ fiber and RJ45 port and allows flexibility should you have your fiber broadband setup or wish to upgrade at a future date. The remaining four 2.5 Gbps ports support devices requiring faster-than-gigabit speeds but not necessarily the full 10 Gbps, such as Wi-Fi 6E access points or high-performance gaming PCs. A USB 3.0 port exists for network-attached storage or shared printing throughout your network.</p>



<p>The <strong>eight strategically mounted antennas</strong> operate with beamforming tech which emits the wireless signal straight at devices instead of broadcasting it omni-directionally. That directional method provides range extension along with stability of connections and shows a particular advantage for large homes or homes on interference hotspots.</p>
<p>TP-Link’s HomeShield security suite includes network scanning, IoT device identification, parental controls, and quality of service management in the free tier. The separate IoT network feature lets you isolate smart home devices on their own protected Wi-Fi network, preventing potential security vulnerabilities in cheap smart bulbs or cameras from compromising your main network. EasyMesh compatibility means you can expand coverage by adding compatible TP-Link extenders that create seamless roaming throughout your home.</p>
<p>For $299 on Prime Big Deal Day, you’re getting enterprise-class networking tech that will last your home networking needs for years into the future.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bye-bye-bose-airpods-max-are-selling-for-peanuts-on-amazon-right-now-2000631785</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bye-bye-bose-airpods-max-are-selling-for-peanuts-on-amazon-right-now.1317412/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When Prime Day rolls around at Amazon, even Apple gets on board with their biggest deals of the year. It’s no coincidence that the last time Apple offered the AirPods Max, their premium over-ear headphones, for only $429 was during the last Prime Day event back in July. But Prime Day’s back, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4532/">and so are the $429 AirPods Max (down from $549)</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4532/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>This <strong>21% deal is big stuff for Apple</strong>, especially for their top-of-the-line wireless headphones. And the one tried and true fact about Apple is, you get what you pay for – their tech goods might run higher in price than much of the competition, but the performance backs up every penny of it. The AirPods Max are just another bit of proof.</p>

<h2>Amazing Engineering</h2>
<p>The <strong>Apple H1 chip is the secret sauce</strong> that makes the AirPods Max just that much better than much of their competition. There’s also the dynamic driver that tracks your head position in real time, instantly adjusts the sound, and all the while intelligently optimizes the output after analyzing your unique ear shape. It’s very likely as close to a live listening experience as you can get from a pair of wireless headphones.</p>



<p>When it comes to the <strong>all-important noise cancellation performance</strong> — because, honestly, what good are headphones if the sound has to compete with the noise around you? — the AirPods Max are among the very best on the market. It’s active noise cancellation that adjusts on the fly and, if you like, can almost completely isolate you so all you hear is what you want to hear from your smartphone, tablet, or laptop. But you also have the ability to take control and switch the AirPods Max to transparency mode, allowing exterior sounds and conversations to be heard while still delivering primo sound.</p>



<h2>All-Day Comfort</h2>
<p><strong>An all-day battery life</strong> is pretty much useless without the ability to wear your headphones comfortably, and vice versa. Thankfully the <strong>robust 20-hour battery life</strong> of the AirPods Max is backed by exceptional comfort with the lightweight AirPods Max sporting a knit-mesh canopy band that is breathable yet holds the phones firmly in place, and memory foam ear cushions that form a perfect seal over your ears for optimal sound, but also optimal comfort.</p>
<p>There’s certainly no guarantee that Apple will drop the price of the AirPods Max as low as $429 again come Black Friday or during Cyber Week, and do you really want to wait for the next Prime Day event in 2026 to score a pair of pro-level wireless headphones? This Prime Day deal looks like a solid winner.</p>
