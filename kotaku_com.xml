For four seasons of Netflix’s stalker drama <em>You, </em>Joe Goldberg (Penn Badgley) has cheated death (and a few love interests) enough to warrant him being eliminated from existence forever, and the final season looks like it’s going to do just that. Today, Netflix put us all out of our misery by finally announcing the release date for the final season of <em>You</em>, while also offering some  hints about Joe’s potential fate.</p><p>The final season of <em>You </em>will release on April 24, a little under 5 1/2 years after the series made its way over to Netflix from its original home,&nbsp;<em>Lifetime</em>. The teaser recaps Joe’s litany of victims while the lovestruck sicko narrates about the trail of blood, bodies, and broken hearts that led him to where he was always meant to be. He eerily remarks that some anonymous “you” is the one constant throughout the years while lovingly caressing the glass case he’s imprisoned numerous people in over the last four seasons. Is he talking to his torture chamber? Is he talking to his latest love interest? Is he breaking the fourth wall and actually talking to the viewers?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196915" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Halo’s Joseph Morgan On Playing Nuanced Characters And The Flaws of Season 1" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="158" data-playlist="196915,193799,195369" data-current="196915"><div><p>Halo’s Joseph Morgan On Playing Nuanced Characters And The Flaws of Season 1</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196915/196915_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196915/196915_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196915/196915_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196915/196915_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22479.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Regardless of who he’s talking to, Netflix leaves little doubt that he won’t be talking for much longer. The logline for the seasons says Joe is returning to New York after spending Season 4 in London, but “his perfect life is threatened by the ghosts of his past and his own dark desires.” His life being threatened isn’t new to a guy who was almost killed on the kitchen floor by the mother of his child, but there are more allusions to his time being up. In addition to providing the release date and the teaser trailer, Netflix also gifts us with the poster for the final season, which sees Joe stomach-deep in water inside the glass case with the words “To The Last Breath” above his head.</p><figure id="" data-id="1867a15561cda75fc0fec0c3aaf1a15d" data-recommend-id="image://1867a15561cda75fc0fec0c3aaf1a15d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="2222" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joe Goldberg standing in water" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joe Goldberg standing in water" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1867a15561cda75fc0fec0c3aaf1a15d" data-recommend-id="image://1867a15561cda75fc0fec0c3aaf1a15d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="2222" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Joe Goldberg standing in water" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you need any more convincing that this is the end for Joe, he concludes the teaser inside of the glass case by looking directly into our souls and saying, “Goodbye, you.” We’ll check back on April 24 to see how Netflix decides to wrap up one of the creepiest stories in its collection. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So that’s my theory, and the PlayStation team respects his wish.”</p><p>Yoshida reiterated that this wasn’t secret information but just his own guess as to why FromSoftware and Sony have never moved forward with anything related to the franchise, even a potential remake by another studio like Bluepoint Games. It previously produced the well-received <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> and <em>Demon’s Souls</em> remakes, and was at one point rumored to be working on something related to <em>Bloodborne </em>before later leaks suggested it was actually working on an original IP. </p><p>We don’t know exactly what Miyazaki and FromSoftware are working on at the moment. A separate team within the studio is shipping 2025's <em>Elden Ring</em> spin-off, <em>Nighreign</em>. The director recently said other teams within the studio would be focusing on new projects in different genres. Sony is now the largest single shareholder in FromSoftware’s parent company, Kadokawa Corporation. Who knows, maybe <em>Bloodborne 2</em> will be a launch game for the PS6. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Hence, unsure of themselves. They don’t think the “Nintendo” way of doing something would work.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> But everything was different 15 years ago. The Switch is still an outlier in the console space.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Yeah. 15 years ago Nintendo was still selling a home console <em>and </em>a portable console.</p><p><strong>Ethan Gach:</strong> RIP Iwata</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> I also think the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-gallery-differences-comparison-joycon-1851740928&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-gallery-differences-comparison-joycon-1851740928">Switch 2</a></span> will still be weird in some ways we don’t know yet. The mouse stuff is weird! Cool, too</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> I mean, doing something “weird” in this case would almost certainly be a failure from a business standpoint. The Wii, while “weird,” was also savvy business-wise, as it didn’t make sense for Nintendo to compete with Sony and MS at their own game.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Yes, but it was weird.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> So was the virtual boy.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Nintendo just announced an iteration of their current console and put a “2" on the name. That’s REALLY unlike them. It’s weird because it’s what everyone else does.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> Yes, but there is not an opportunity today for them to do something that is both “weird” and that would be that successful IMO.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Also, I bet if you asked Nintendo designers they wouldn’t call any of that stuff weird. Just new ideas they were trying</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> The SNES wasn’t weird. it was basically the equivalent for the time of the Switch 2.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Gameboy Color was basically just Gameboy but color. Nintendo isn’t above iteration.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> No one expected a Wii, and at the time everyone said it was a mistake because it was so technologically weak. </p><p>When the Switch was announced, there was SO much discourse about how it couldn’t compete with the other consoles because it was so weak. </p><p>I think if Nintendo had done something totally new and weird and original, they could have still had a huge amount of success. And sure, make the Switch XL at the same time.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> Like what? What’s your amazing “weird” idea that could have done gangbusters today for Nintendo?</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> And not break compatibility with hundreds of games.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> That’s the point! Only Nintendo could come up with it!</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> [indifferent face emoji]</p><p> Yeah I mean, times change. I just don’t see that opportunity today. Maybe it will arise again in the future, but right now, this was the play.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> I think you’d have said the same post N64, post GC, etc. And post Wii!</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> I would not.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Clearly the Wii U was NOT the move, but I love that it WAS the move.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> I mean, post N64 maybe, Nintendo didn’t really get “weird” with consoles until the Wii.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> Here were my two AMAZING suggestions in my Switch 2 Disappointed piece:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“It’s a wearable piece of tech that uses holograms, or a bizarre twist on AR where the flagship Mario game uses our house furniture for platforms.”</p></blockquote><p><strong>Zack:</strong> I hate it.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> Right, that sounds like shit.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Ask Apple how well AR is doing.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> There is no way that would have a high adoption rate. No way.</p><p><strong>John:</strong> THEY AREN’T REAL PITCHES!</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Well my reaction was very real. lol.</p><p><strong>Caro:</strong> I know but like, you’re just presuming that Nintendo can, under any and all marketplace circumstances, generate ideas for consoles that would be both groundbreaking and hugely successful. I don’t see a basis for that at all.</p><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Also, after the last decade of merging all their software development into ONE platform instead of two distinct divisions (portable/home) the Switch 2 was always going to be the play. </p><p><strong>John:</strong> If you said to me after the GameCube, “Come on then, think of something,” I wouldn’t have replied, “Um, a thing with a sensor bar and two sticks you wave around.” And if I had, you’d have said “hate it.”</p><p><strong>John: </strong>“Oh you mean like the Kinect?

That little lens spotted in the Joy-Cons is something Nintendo will likely use in some really innovative ways, even if other developers never notice it’s there. I often think about one of the most wonderful aspects of the Switch—the all-too underrated Labo. Those cardboard packs, in conjunction with the peculiar controllers, that had you build working pianos, fishing rods for fishing games, and even a remote-controlled bug creature. It used the Joy-Con’s haptics to move around, and the infrared sensor as a tiny camera! That was bloody incredible! That was astoundingly imaginative, and I have high hopes that Nintendo has similarly inventive plans for using the new Joy-Cons’ tech. I like to imagine they’ll have pushed it all a little harder to third-party developers this time, so we can see some of the wonderful madness that appeared in the first few months of the Nintendo DS.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Zack:</strong> Yeah, that’s my point!

And it’s a clamshell?
