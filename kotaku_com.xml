            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><i>The Trolley Solution</i> is a fantastic collection of silly dilemmas and game genre spoofs
                </p><div>
              
              <p>We’re all familiar with the trolley problem. We’re all so familiar with it that we’re also familiar with all the spoofs of the trolley problem that have sprung up in recent years. But I’m pleased to say I’ve found a fresh take on the entire scenario: even sillier (if smarter) spoofs of the trolley problem. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219410/The_Trolley_Solution/"><em>The Trolley Solution</em></a> brings the classic black-and-white sketches to life in a series of video game vignettes, beginning with the classic question, but quickly descending into fantastically funny nonsense, including some completely splendid mini-games, one of which is a visual novel love story.</p> <p>You know how the trolley problem goes:</p> <blockquote><p>“A trolley is rapidly approaching five people tied to the tracks.</p> <p>You have the option to divert the trolley onto a different track.</p> <p>This action would save the five people, but it would kill someone else.</p> <p>What would you do?”</p></blockquote> <p>But in&nbsp;<em>The Trolley Solution</em>, the classic philosophical dilemma and many absurd riffs on it are brought to life in 3D, bringing a whole new level of reality to the hypothetical problem when the crudely animated people splatter into little blobs. What if, for instance, rerouting the trolley would knock a dog’s bone away? Can you really make the choice if it means watching the little doggy look into his empty bowl, his tail down, his head despondently hung? Other new variants it introduces on the classic dilemma are more elaborate and wonderfully original, unlike anything I’ve seen in those overly long Reddit threads where people with undue confidence misattribute philosophical doctrine. For instance,</p> <blockquote><p>“A trolley is quickly approaching your girlfriend, who is tied to the tracks.</p> <p>You have the option to divert the trolley to a different track, but on that track is your best friend, also tied up.</p> <p>However, you discover that your girlfriend has been cheating on you with your best friend.</p> <p>But your best friend didn’t know she was your girlfriend.</p> <p>To complicate things, your best friend is terminally ill and will die of cancer in a month.</p> <p>What will you do?”</p></blockquote>  <p>Honestly, I’m simple enough that I’d have been charmed just by a series of increasingly daft scenarios like these, especially since you get to see each play out, choosing whether to pull the lever or not. But&nbsp;<em>The Trolley Solution</em> is much more ambitious in its daftness. Levels constantly introduce one-off mechanics, at one point seeing the game turn into a perfect spoof of the billions of monochrome “hidden object” games that appeared in the wake of the fantastic&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/hidden-object-puzzle-game-hidden-folks-is-getting-free-1843541062"><em>Hidden Folks</em></a>, here with an entire trolley “hiding” in enormous, screens-wide illustrations packed with visual gags. I scarequote “hiding” given it’s a trolley, and even glasses and a <em>Where’s Waldo</em> hat can’t quite do it. Bless it, it’s trying. (The <em>Where’s Trolley</em> joke works much better in the UK where the books are called <em>Where’s Wally?</em>)</p>

 <p>At another point it becomes a third-person racing game, as you jump between tracks to gather coins and avoid oncoming trolleys. And yes, in one extended and completely brilliant sequence, the game becomes a lampooning visual novel, in which you play a young Japanese girl who, on her way to school, falls in love with a trolley. It has many different endings, one of which describes the situation where the girl and the trolley rush too quickly into an overly committed romance, later realizing the foundations for a lasting relationship had never been established, the two growing to loathe one another, before finally, acrimoniously, breaking up. Another, naturally, results in people getting run over by a trolley. It’s all very romantic. It contains dialogue like,</p> <blockquote><p>“Tameko tells Tomodachi all about her dream. As she talks a weird gut feeling makes her uneasy. She explains the nuances of picking between Deontology and Utilitarianism. It feels like there is something more to it, like a prophecy in the making…”</p></blockquote> <p>As much as I want to blurt out every single surprise game mode that appears, l obviously won’t, but I do have to share one more: There’s an entire Tamagotchi sim in there, in which—yes of course—you must feed, clean, and play with a young trolley until it grows into a happy and profitable adult. “Can you take care of it until it gains monetary and moral stability?” asks the game.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000625734" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625734"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625734">©DanDans / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s worth saying&nbsp;<em>The Trolley Solution</em> is not taking anything seriously, and you’re going to see a lot of people get squished in front of trolleys. Because the game’s black and white, and because the human characters are like even simpler <em>Human Fall Flat</em> figures, obviously it’s nothing outlandish, but people sure do go splat when they’re run over. And you will want to note that it does include a moment with someone jumping in front of a trolley. When that happened I shouted, “GOD DAMN IT!” and laughed very hard, because it really wasn’t OK in the best way.</p> <p>I swear, for all the stuff I’ve mentioned, there are so many more surprises in here. There are whole other short games, spoofs of well-known genres I’m dying to tell you about, and while a few of these are perhaps a little over-long (something done five times can be a lot more fun than something done ten times), they’re all so well-realized and funny. There’s a total of 40 levels, each containing its own unique trolley problem situation, and precisely none of them take the conceit seriously. Thank goodness.</p>

I installed it simply because I liked the cartoon art, having no idea where it was heading. It turns out it was heading all over the place, with a wicked sense of humor, and the chops to pull off half a dozen genre spoofs along the way. (And don’t worry if you see the DLC on the Steam store—as much as you can absolutely buy it (and the developer deserves it!), it’s part of a gag.)</p> <p>What a joyfully silly thing to exist. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3219410/The_Trolley_Solution/">You should go buy it right now, it’s only $6.50</a>.</p>

                  The Phantom Thieves are joining in the <em>Fortnite</em>-ification of Blizzard’s hero shooter
                </p><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-5-tactica-tactics-rpg-review-switch-1851020804"><i><span>Persona 5</span></i></a> <span>collaboration was announced </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-18-persona-collaboration-skins-joker-2000619195"><span>shortly before the game’s current season began</span></a><span>, and at the time, we didn’t know who would be dressing up as a Phantom Thief in Blizzard’s hero shooter. I’ve grown increasingly tired of how Blizzard has turned </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>into </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> with all these licensed crossovers replacing its own iconography and worldbuilding, but I’m also a </span><i><span>Persona </span></i><span>superfan, and I get to be a mark sometimes. Today, Blizzard announced the five heroes who will be suiting up as the vigilante high schoolers, and while I’m excited that one of my mains is getting a collab skin, I’m also glad to see that Kiriko, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-kiriko-mercy-venture-reaper-season-12-skins-1851626893"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s teacher’s pet</span></a><span>, is nowhere to be seen this time around.</span></p> <p><span>Blizzard showed off Wuyang, Genji, Lifeweaver, Mercy, and D.Va sporting costumes based on the Phantom Thieves. These will all be available tomorrow, September 16, and they look, well, pretty much exactly like the characters they’re referencing. There are some interesting details, though, such as the rose petals falling from Mercy’s wings, which are evocative of Ann’s Persona Carmen; Lifeweaver’s flower-petal back piece, meanwhile, has some of Yusuke’s iconography attached to it, and D.Va’s mech has been made to look like Makoto’s motorcycle Persona, Johanna. The full rundown:</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Wuyang as Joker (Ren)</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Mercy as Panther (Ann)</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Lifeweaver as Fox (Yusuke)</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>D.Va as Queen (Makoto)</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Genji as Skull (Ryuji)</span></li> </ul> <figure id="attachment_2000625741" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000625741"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000625741">© Blizzard Entertainment / Atlus</figcaption></figure> <p><span>These skins will likely come with other cosmetics, but Blizzard hasn’t revealed those yet. When the collaboration was first teased, we saw what appeared to be a highlight intro based on </span><i><span>Persona 5</span></i><span>’s All-Out Attack animations, so we’ll see if all five characters get that, or just Wuyang. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/in-defence-of-persona-5-s-ryuji-1797700262"><span>Ryuji</span></a><span> is my favorite </span><i><span>Persona 5 </span></i><span>character, so I wish I played Genji, but I do play Lifeweaver, so I will be donning the Fox mask for a few matches later this week.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dragon-quest-7-remake-ps1-switch-2-graphics-chrono-trigger-2000625721</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> was one of the most surprising announcements to come out of last week’s Nintendo Direct. It’s yet another remake for the often overlooked PS1-era Japanese RPG, and it’ll arrive amid a recent influx of other<em> Dragon Quest</em> remasters. This one has my full attention, though, and not just because the original game is a sprawling adventure I’ve always wanted to go back to and properly finish. It’s also the art style, which moves past the recent obsession with HD-2D pixel art glow-ups and offers a blueprint for how to revive tons of other beloved JRPG classics.</p> <p>The new “hand-crafted” aesthetic is more akin to the toys-and-dioramas-style visuals of<em> Yoshi’s Woolly World</em> or the<em>&nbsp;Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em> remake than what we’re used to getting from Square Enix. <em>Dragon Quest VII</em> <em>Reimagined</em> sits somewhere between the HD-2D retro sensibility of last year’s excellent <em>Dragon Quest III</em> remake and the hyper-realistic, Unreal Engine visuals of the <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>remake trilogy, with detailed graphics that exaggerate the storybook whimsy of Akira Toriyama’s original designs rather than running away from them.</p> <p>The big secret to this new look? Scanning actual dolls. Hi-res captures of IRL toys for characters like Hero, Kiefer, and Maribel helped ground the new art style while retaining all of the whimsy. “For this game, we scanned figurines, like this one here, to create the in-game models,” the remake’s producer said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTTfUC4MUZs">a short overview</a> with series creator Yuji Horii. “They’re very well done. Using a graphical aesthetic we call the ‘diorama style,’ we’ve depicted the stories and the characters’ emotions in an entirely new way.”</p>

 <p>The game isn’t far away either. It comes to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Switch 1, and Switch 2 on February 5, 2026 (one small bummer is that the Switch 2 physical version is a game key card only and progress <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1nfv3i9/dragon_quest_vii_reimagined_the_switch_2_version/">doesn’t transfer</a> between the two console generations).</p>  <p>Alongside exploring dungeons, engaging in familiar turn-based battles, and tinkering with a meaty job system, <em>Dragon Quest VII</em> revolves around an island-hopping adventure that sees its heroes time-traveling between the past and present as they confront the Demon Lord Orgodemir. It’s a very, very long game, clocking in at up to 100 hours just for the main story. Despite the heft, it was mostly overlooked when it first came to PlayStation due in part to its dated-looking graphics. It didn’t get localized in the West until 2001 after the PS2 was already out and just a month before the arrival of <em>Final Fantasy X</em>.</p>

 <p><em>Dragon Quest VII</em> got a second look when it was remade for the 3DS in 2013 as <i>Dragon Quest VII: Fragments of the Forgotten</i> <em>Past</em>. It completely overhauled the graphics into 3D polygons and abridged much of the story to shave dozens of hours off the average runtime. <em>Reimagined</em> will make further improvements, including an even more streamlined story and new quality-of-life features like a redesigned UI to make the game easier to navigate. But the most pivotal change will probably be the new “Moonlighting” mechanic that lets characters use abilities from two different jobs simultaneously.</p> <p>We’ve seen Square Enix take all sorts of different approaches to reviving its back catalog in recent years. While <em>FFVII</em> got the full remake treatment, other PS1 games like <em>Chrono Cross</em> and <em>Legend of Mana</em> have simply received HD resolution boosts and additional features that would be considered barebones even by the standards of a third-party emulator. Then there’s stuff in the middle like <em>Dragon Quest III</em> and <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> which are ground-up overhauls that still try to remain as faithful the originals as possible.</p> <p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em><em>&nbsp;</em>offers a fourth alternative that would be perfect for other games like the original <em>Chrono Trigger</em>, which Toriyama also designed the characters for. It even looks perfect for seemingly impossible-to-remake RPGs from other publishers like <em>Earthbound</em>. Players have been sharing fan art of that SNES classic in the style of <em>Reimagined</em> for decades now. We even recently <a href="https://noisypixel.net/earthbound-clay-figure-set-hobonichi/">got new clay models</a> of the main cast that are perfect for scanning. I hope the <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined </em>model proves to be viable for projects beyond Square Enix, though I could certainly see it working for something like the long-rumored <em>Final Fantasy IX </em>remake as well.</p>
