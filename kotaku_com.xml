              <p>Winter storms have a way of knocking out power at the worst possible times but the <strong>Jackery Explorer 1000 (1500W) portable power station</strong> offers a solid solution to keep your essentials running when the grid goes dark. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5401/">Amazon has slashed the price from $899 to $449</a>, which makes this one of the best times to grab reliable backup power without emptying your wallet. You’ll also get a <strong>free 3-port 103W fast charger as a bonus</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5401/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<h2>Delivers Power When You Need It Most</h2>
<p>The Explorer 1000 houses a 1<strong>,070Wh LiFePO4 battery within its compact frame, weighing only 23.8 pounds</strong>. This capacity translates to real-world performance that matters during an outage: running a full-size refrigerator for roughly 10 hours to preserve your groceries, powering a space heater for about 1.5 hours to stay warm, or keeping your internet router and laptop running for an entire day to work from home. Most household appliances are handled easily with its<strong> continuous output of 1,500W, while the 3,000W surge capacity</strong> is there when devices like refrigerators need that initial power boost to start.</p>
<p>The LFP battery chemistry separates this model from the more affordable options: Typical lithium-ion batteries do not last long, but this LiFePO4 arrangement retains <strong>upwards of 70 percent of its original capacity after 4,000 charge cycles</strong>. That kind of longevity equates to well over a decade of service, making that $449 price tag seem much more reasonable if you calculate it on a cost-per-year-of-ownership basis. This battery technology is also less susceptible to temperature extremes than a standard lithium-ion cell.</p>



<p>Getting from empty to full in just one hour through the emergency charging mode via the Jackery app changes how you can use this power station. If you hear about an incoming storm, you can top it off quickly instead of waiting overnight. The default 1.7-hour charging mode balances speed with battery health for everyday use, which helps explain that 10-year lifespan claim. <strong>ChargeShield 2.0 technology automatically regulates voltage and temperature</strong>, and safeguards both the power station and whatever devices you plug into it.</p>



<p>Port selection matters when you try to keep multiple devices alive during an outage: The <strong>Explorer 1000 has three AC outlets for standard plugs, two USB-C that provide up to 100W for fast charging laptops and tablets, one USB-A for older devices, and a DC car port for 12V equipment</strong>. This means not having to choose between charging your phone and powering your CPAP machine.</p>
<p>The <strong>foldable handle and relatively light weight</strong> make this truly portable despite its capacity. You can take it down to your basement during bad weather, toss it in the back of your truck for that weekend camping trip, or bring it to an outdoor concert where your band requires power for amps and mixers. Lighting from built-in LED lights helps navigate through darkened homes during nighttime power outages, with no fumbling for flashlights in the dark.</p>
<p>At $449, you’re getting backup power that costs less than a typical emergency generator while offering more flexibility and cleaner energy. Gas generators require fuel storage, regular maintenance, and produce fumes that make indoor use impossible. The deal is a massive 50% discount from the regular $899 price (and you get a free fast charger as well) which makes this an all-time low worth grabbing before winter weather arrives in full force.</p>

              <p>Dell keeps this massive 71% discount completely off its official website because the company probably doesn’t want to advertise such aggressive pricing on premium hardware. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5400/">Dell Inspiron 15.6-inch model with 1TB SSD storage and 32GB RAM normally lists for $2,549, but Amazon just quietly dropped it to just $749</a> for an early Black Friday clearance.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5400/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>



<p>The 13th Gen Intel Core i5-1334U processor features 10 cores split between two performance cores and eight efficiency cores: This hybrid architecture handles demanding applications on the performance cores while routing background tasks to the efficiency cores and maximizes both speed and battery life. The processor boosts up to 4.6GHz on performance cores when you need extra power for intensive tasks like photo editing or running multiple browser tabs with streaming video.</p>



<h2>Perfect for Daily Tasks</h2>
<p>The 32GB of DDR4 memory crushes the performance bottlenecks that plague laptops with 8GB or 16GB configurations. You can have dozens of browser tabs open, as well as multiple Office applications, video conferencing software and background programs running, all without slowdowns or the dreaded spinning cursor. Indeed, this much memory proves essential for professionals who are constantly switching between email, documents and web research during their workday.</p>



<p>The 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD affords a ton of space for documents and applications without necessitating constant file deleting. Most budget laptops stint with either 256GB or 512GB drives that fill up within months of normal use. This drive capacity fits in years of accumulated files comfortably, not giving you anxiety over running out of space in the middle of your project. The PCIe NVMe interface provides blazing-fast read speeds of over 3,000 MB/s and translates to near-instant file transfers and lightning-fast application launches.</p>



<p>The 15.6-inch touchscreen FHD display offers 1920 x 1080 resolution with anti-glare coating and narrow bezels. Touch brings in great convenience while scrolling through documents, zooming in on photos, or navigating Windows 11’s touch-optimized interface. Video playback is smoothly handled by the Intel Iris Xe graphics, which also support up to dual external monitors via the included HDMI and USB-C ports.</p>
<p>The selection of ports includes all the essential connectivity options: <strong>three USB Type-A ports, one USB Type-C port for modern peripherals, HDMI output for external displays, a headset jack for private listening, and an SD card reader</strong> for transferring photos from cameras. This variety ensures you don’t have to deal with dongles and adapters that clutter your workspace.</p>
<p>This $749 price is an exceptional value when comparable laptops with these specs typically cost $1,200 or more. You’re saving $1,800 off Dell’s list price while getting a machine that handles professional workloads easily.</p>
