            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon revealed a first look at its <a href="https://kotaku.com/heres-our-first-look-at-the-god-of-war-show-oh-no-oh-noooo-2000674450"><em>God of War</em> TV show</a> on Friday and it went terribly. People rushed to gawk at the live-action adaptation’s set image <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-amazon-show-cast-kratos-atreus-mimir-actor-2000666932">featuring Ryan Hurst as Kratos and child actor Callum Vinson</a> as a very young Atreus. The internet immediately spit out its Kombucha juice in collective confusion and bemusement. Hurst has now responded to the backlash on Instagram with a cryptic message that has some fans praying for an “ugly Sonic” turnaround.</p>

 <p>“Don’t believe everything you see on the internet, kids,” the <i>Sons of Anarchy</i> actor wrote on his Instagram stories <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GodofWarRagnarok/comments/1rgzptt/this_was_posted_on_ryan_hursts_kratos_instagram/">over the weekend</a>. Fans were confused given that the image everyone was reacting to was an official marketing beat from Amazon to promote the upcoming series and not, like, a weird leak from the set or AI deepfake. But some fans are hoping that the image was just terribly assembled and touched up with AI effects and so the <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-amazon-live-action-image-online-reactions-kratos-atreus-2000674479">Spirit Halloween-looking result</a> isn’t actually representative of the real end product.</p>   <p>Look, out of context TV and movie promotional photos often look like crap. Remember everyone freaking out about Superman lacing his shoes while aliens shot purple lasers in the background in the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/2024/06/29/new-superman-set-photos-generate-strong-fan-reactions/">first photo</a> for James Gunn’s reboot? First looks like these also give studios a chance to adapt costumes and makeup in light of fan reactions. Maybe this was just an elaborate trial balloon to figure out the final design?</p> <p>That’s basically what some <em>God of War</em> fans are hoping for as they stick Amazon’s Kratos in the same bucket as “ugly Sonic.” People reacted so poorly to the initial trailer for CGI Sonic in the live-action movies that the filmmakers ended up going back and spending a bunch of money and time fixing every frame of his face. That’s one possible outcome here, though it’s still unclear what deeper truth Hurst is referring to. Is the image above failing to correctly capture how Kratos actually looks in the new TV series, or is he suggesting the show has already changed things up since back when this was taken?</p> <p>I can’t wait to see how this all pans out.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Zen And The Art Of Van Maintenance Meets Firewatch In Steam Next Fest Hit Cozy Survival Sim Outbound]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-next-fest-feb-2026-outbound-demo-firewatch-cozy-2000674849</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There’s a game I love called </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-long-dark-is-boring-and-thats-why-its-great-1775860048"><i><span>The Long Dark</span></i></a><span>. It’s a relentless survival sim that pits you against the elements out in the wilderness. You can starve, freeze to death, or get mauled by a pack of wild wolves. It has this oppressive, foreboding vibe to it that few games can match. <em>Outbound</em> is kind of the cozy sim version of that.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I played the Steam Next Fest demo for </span><i><span>Outbound</span></i><span>, a campervan driving survival game from developers Square Glade Games, and it feels like someone ran </span><i><span>The Long Dark</span></i><span> through a Pixar filter. These two games share so much in common: light crafting elements, a need to scavenge to fill your stomach, an intentionally light focus on your sense of direction, and that lonely feeling of living within a world that other people have left behind.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000674851" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674851"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674851">Square Glade Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>And yet, </span><i><span>Outbound </span></i><span>is also kind of the very antithesis of </span><i><span>The Long Dark</span></i><span>. You get hungry, sure, but you won’t starve to death: you’ll just pass out. The world is devoid of human interaction, but there’s plenty of cute little animals to make friends with instead (and a co-op mode I, ironically, couldn’t convince a friend to try with me). You can’t even run the animals over with your massive, unwieldy campervan. Trust me, I tried. There’s friction but the world isn’t out to make you fail.</span></p> <p><span>Strangely, that’s what I loved about my three hours with </span><i><span>Outbound</span></i><span>, whose demo is one of the most popular of February’s Steam Next Fest</span><span>. It’s an easy, breezy experience. It’s a survival game about trying your best to live as opposed to one about desperately trying not to die. There’s really no wrong way to play it, either, because the focus is on, if you’ll excuse the pun, simply enjoying the ride. You’re not even really tasked with accomplishing any specific goals. Sometimes you’ll get a prompt telling you there’s a new schematic you can unlock or a location you’ve yet to visit, but there’s always this “only if you want to” mentality to it all. </span><i><span>Outbound </span></i><span>won’t scream at you for playing it the wrong way, because there’s no right way to begin with.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000674853" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674853"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674853">Square Glade Games©</figcaption></figure> <p><span>There are plenty of silly systems to interact with, though, if you so choose. You can build a big house, start your own farm, or even amass a friendly army of bunnies by feeding them heaps of berries. All of these mechanics are straightforward to use and, most importantly, extremely forgiving. If all you wanna do is munch on some wild mushrooms and sit by a fire with your dog, </span><i><span>Outbound </span></i><span>doesn’t care, man. Put your hulking brute of a motorhome in park and just watch the sunset go down if you want, dude. No wolves are gonna rip you limb from limb once the moon appears, bro. Just pet the cute bunnies and let the chill, outdoor vibes wash over you.</span></p>

 <p><span>I saw a few reviews poke fun at <i>Outbound</i> for being “cozyslop,” and my heart goes out to those poor souls. Do we always need a deep endgame or a grand cause to work toward? Does there have to be a destination? Because if you go into </span><i><span>Outbound </span></i><span>expecting </span><i><span>Dark Souls</span></i><span> meets </span><i><span>Burnout</span></i><span>, you’re gonna come away disappointed (even though that sounds sick). But if you go in expecting </span><i><span>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance </span></i><span>mixed with </span><i><span>Firewatch</span></i><span>, you’ll get what you came for: a relaxing game about doing nothing in particular. I’m already looking forward to cozy-friend-slopmaxxing my </span><i><span>Outbound </span></i><span>playthrough </span><span>when the full release drops sometime before summer 2026.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation Retro Anime Spoof Will Be Available Outside Japan For The First Time In 27 Years]]></title>

              <p><span>What’s that riff about more time elapsing between </span><i><span>That ‘70s Show</span></i><span> and now than the time between </span><i><span>That ‘70s Show</span></i><span> and the actual 1970s? ‘90s PlayStation freaks, we stand on razor-thin wire. It has been 27 years since </span><i><span>Robot Anime Geppy-X </span></i><span>released on the first PlayStation, and 27 years between </span><i><span>Robot Anime Geppy-X</span></i><span> and the broadcast debut of </span><i><span>Mazinger Z</span></i><span>. Don’t know what </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4120310/70sstyle_Robot_Anime_GeppyX/"><i><span>Robot Anime Geppy-X</span></i></a><span> is? Well, thanks to a new remaster, you can quickly familiarize yourself with the giant mecha spoof, which is now as retro as the cartoons it’s making fun of.</span></p>

 <p><span>Released in 1999, </span><i><span>70s-style Robot Anime Geppy-X</span></i><span> is a sideways shoot-em-up about blasting mechanical space fiends. A competent enough shmup, what established </span><i><span>Geppy-X</span></i><span> as a cult classic in Japan was its lovingly crafted send-ups of ‘70s anime, such as </span><i><span>Getter Robo</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Mazinger-Z</span></i><span>. An ever escalating robo-opera divided between episodes, with mean robot bosses, increasingly absurd transformations, and suffocatingly tight disco speedsuits. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/edgar-allen-poe-cult-classic-horror-steam-pc-2000669201"><span>And unlike other recent cult-classic Steam ports</span></a><span>, this one’s unwieldy long title is in fact the original.</span></p>  <p><span>The four-disc (count ’em, four) release also held a Saturday morning’s worth of cartoons. Not only the FMV theatrics of the brave </span><i><span>Geppy-X</span></i><span>, but mock commercials for toys, shampoo, and parodies of other vintage anime.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Now </span><i><span>70s-style Robot Anime Geppy-X</span></i><span> is getting </span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4120310/70sstyle_Robot_Anime_GeppyX/"><span>an official remastered Steam release</span></a><span>, its first time leaving Japan. In addition to new localized language offerings, this remaster also restores the full-motion cutscenes, having digitized the original master tapes. Even across four PS1 discs there ain’t enough leg room for robots that big without some serious 320×240 compression.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>70s-style Robot Anime Geppy-X</span></i><span> comes to Steam this July for all the ‘90s kids whose media diets were primarily send-ups of late ‘60s variety shows they may never see themselves.</span></p>
