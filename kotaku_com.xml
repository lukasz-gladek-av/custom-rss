And to be abundantly clear, <strong>ex Pokémon are still prevalent in the game’s strongest decks</strong>. The difference now is how you incorporate them into your deck, as many launch-day strategies are virtually obsolete now. Let’s break it down.</p><h2 id="h146"><a id="1"></a>The ex-killer cards are on the loose</h2><p>In the current meta, ex Pokémon have to contend with several cards that exist <em>specifically </em>to defeat them. In past expansions, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2a/36&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2a/36" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sudowoodo</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2b/71&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2b/71" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red</a></span> were common staples in competitive decks. They’ve gone down in usage as of writing, but they’re still threats you need to watch out for. The 20 extra damage Red grants against ex Pokémon can turn otherwise survivable attacks into lethal damage, so you’ll always have to consider the possibility that your opponent could play that card during their next turn.</p><p>Meanwhile, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2b/7&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2b/7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Meowscarada</a></span> is still seeing use in the competitive landscape. 60 damage for two Grass Energy on a Stage-2 monster wouldn’t normally be impressive, but<strong> its attack gets a massive bump up to 130 damage when facing ex opponents</strong>. Its Grass-typing is also dangerous, as it can make use of type-specific healing cards such as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1/219&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1/219" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erika</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/147&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/147" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Leaf Cape</a></span> to keep it on the field longer. This card was already dangerous when it debuted during the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/shiny-revelry-pokemon-tcg-pocket-ranked-rare-charizard-1851771590&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/shiny-revelry-pokemon-tcg-pocket-ranked-rare-charizard-1851771590">Shining Revelry</a></span> expansion, and now it can get on the field faster thanks to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/144&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/144" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rare Candy</a></span> item that debuted with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-celestial-guardians-alolan-raichu-1851777665&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-celestial-guardians-alolan-raichu-1851777665">Celestial Guardians</a></span> set.</p><figure id="" data-id="a65682bfcc334d6eb8226a2551d836de" data-recommend-id="image://a65682bfcc334d6eb8226a2551d836de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1108" data-height="1545" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Ocicorio on a card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows Ocicorio on a card." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Timothy Monbleau / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a65682bfcc334d6eb8226a2551d836de" data-recommend-id="image://a65682bfcc334d6eb8226a2551d836de" data-format="jpg" data-width="1108" data-height="1545" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Ocicorio on a card." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This brings us to the bird of the hour: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/66&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/66" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Electric Oricorio</a></span>. The safeguard ability nullifies damage from ex Pokémon, which can potentially trap you into an unwinnable state if you aren’t careful. It’s not <em>invincible </em>against ex Pokémon, as Oricorio can still take indirect damage. For example, Darkrai can still inflict chip damage via Nightmare Aura, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/33&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/33" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Incineroar ex</a></span> can damage Oricorio by using Fire Fang to inflict burn. Still, <strong>considering ex Pokemon can inflict up to 200 damage in a single turn, cutting their maximum potential damage down to 20 is a serious nerf</strong>. Even if Oricorio isn’t <em>meta </em>at any point, its sheer presence in the game means you have to plan a counter for it in the event it shows up.</p><p>Combine all the above factors with the fact that ex Pokémon award two points upon defeat, and you get an environment where these monsters are way riskier to use than before. Decks consisting solely of ex Pokemon can still work, but they now need to be built with the above threats in mind to avoid completely unwinnable matchups.</p><h2 id="h147"><a id="2"></a>How to incorporate ex Pokémon into your deck</h2><p>In previous expansions, the most prevalent non-ex Pokémon played supporting roles. For example, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/22&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shaymin</a></span> would stay on the bench to heal, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1a/56&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A1a/56" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Druddigon</a></span> would take the lead on the front line while you stacked Energy on your heavy hitter. Now, it’s much wiser to pair a strong ex-Pokémon with a capable non-ex attacker. For example, players using <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/122&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/122" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Solgaleo ex</a></span> will typically bring <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/111&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/111" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skarmory</a></span> or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3a/27&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3a/27" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Shiinotic</a></span> to inflict damage in the early game and take out any ex killers that could stop them later. You will find yourself praying for a good starting hand that doesn’t force you to deploy your late-game cards off the bat, but that’s practically unavoidable no matter which deck you run.</p><p>Alternatively, you can run a pure ex-deck as long as you have contingency plans in mind against your toughest matchups. For example, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-darkrai-ex-cyrus-guide-1851766515&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-darkrai-ex-cyrus-guide-1851766515">Darkrai ex</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2b/35&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2b/35" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Giratina ex</a></span> are still very strong together despite the shifting meta. Darkrai’s Nightmare Aura ability paired with tools like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/146&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A3/146" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Poison Barb</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/148&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/148" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rocky Helmet</a></span> can counter Oricorio, and Giratina’s huge burst damage potential can bring down Meowscarada. It’s not a consistently successful strategy, but no deck ever is. You just need a strategy that works at least as often as it doesn’t.</p><h2 id="h148"><a id="3"></a>In the end, you need luck and skill to win</h2><p>While ex Pokémon have huge obstacles they need to watch out for, many previously reliable Pokémon are also struggling because of how aggressive the game has become. Rare Candy is a huge culprit here: a player can now get a powerful Stage 2 monster on the field as early as turn three or four and begin a sweep that only a perfect hand can counter. Meanwhile, you could face the same deck and get the easiest win of your life just because your opponent’s candies are at the bottom of their deck. Cards like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/P-A/6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/P-A/6" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Card</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/155&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pocket.limitlesstcg.com/cards/A2/155" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mars</a></span> have spiked in popularity strictly to keep strong monsters off the field as much as possible.</p><p>The competitive landscape of <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> has seen huge changes with every expansion introduced so far, so all the strategies listed here could become obsolete in a month’s time. However, given the escalation of cards that specifically target ex Pokémon, it’s unlikely we’ll see these otherwise powerful cards become less risky to use in the future. Just <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-free-player-spend-money-1851723336&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-free-player-spend-money-1851723336">do your best with the cards in your collection</a></span>, make sure you <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-grind-thanks-battle-trick-1851769030&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-grind-thanks-battle-trick-1851769030">say thanks even if you lose</a></span>, and if all else fails, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-price-value-team-rocket-1851779160&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-price-value-team-rocket-1851779160">maybe you can play the regular tabletop game instead</a></span>.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For instance, we know that the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-shipped-45-million-units-in-2020-matches-ps4s-launch&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-shipped-45-million-units-in-2020-matches-ps4s-launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PS5 sold 4.5 million units</a></span> in total by the end of 2020, which works out to across about seven weeks, and rather importantly included the holidays. (Despite being a launch beset by nightmares, from covid to supply chain disasters, it still pretty much matched sales for the PS4 in 2013.) Even more usefully, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ps5-is-biggest-console-launch-in-history&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ps5-is-biggest-console-launch-in-history" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">we also know that the PS5 had outsold the PS4's 2.1 million units in its first two weeks</a></span>, although without a specific number. That was described at the time as the “biggest console launch in history,” and given the Switch 2 massively beat that figure in less than a week, it’s safe to say the mantle has been passed on.</p><p>Nintendo stops short of the full boast, but observes this makes the Switch 2 it’s own fastest-selling device.

(It’s fun to note that the Wii U sold a total of 3.5 million units over its first six months.)</p><p>Of course, initial sales are not a guaranteed predictor of long-term forecasts, but they do tend to bode well. Nintendo has rather modestly set its predicted sales for the year at 15 million, presumably trying to keep investors within reasonable expectations against <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-trump-tariffs-vietnam-china-trade-war-1851774438">a bemusing market</a></span> that could be flipped upside-down at any point with the latest of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.404media.co/sea-of-idiocy-economists-say-trump-tariffs-will-raise-price-of-switch-2-and-everything-else/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.404media.co/sea-of-idiocy-economists-say-trump-tariffs-will-raise-price-of-switch-2-and-everything-else/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trump’s mercurial tariff idiocy</a></span>.</p><p>Either way, it’s good times for Nintendo, and a good sign for a gaming industry that is having the shit beaten out of it of late. While the prices <em>aren’t</em> the same around the world, at the U.S.’s $450, that would mean sales of over $1.5 billion in less than a week. Now if only there was a new <em>Super Mario</em> game to play on it.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That understated showing extended to the actual “Play Days” show floor in Los Angeles, where developers gave press and content creators a chance to try out new games. What made the show so odd on a smaller scale was that I was the only person on-site covering the show for <em>Kotaku</em>. </p><p>I’ve been to Play Days the past three years, and for reasons outside of our control, fewer <em>Kotaku</em> writers have been sent to the biggest American games event with each trip around the sun. As just one person, I was only able to see a handful of games during the event. This means <em>Kotaku</em> unfortunately missed out on a ton of really cool projects, games that I was only able to look at longingly as I passed by them at the show.</p><p>I hope things are different in 2026, but for now, here are the games I played and saw at Summer Game Fest 2025. </p><p><strong><em>This article will be updated periodically as embargoes lift.</em></strong></p></div></div><div><p>I know <em>Mario Kart World </em>is the kart racer to beat right now, and while I can’t say definitively if Sega’s latest <em>Sonic Racing</em> game clears that high bar, I can say what I’ve played of <em>Crossworlds </em>is a blast. The big headliners from the show were the crossover characters announced at the showcase, but I didn’t play as Hatsune Miku, Joker, or Ichiban; I was focused squarely on getting behind the wheel as my guy Shadow the Hedgehog. <em>Crossworlds </em>definitely feels a bit lighter and floatier than other kart racers, but what it lacks in weight, it makes up for in a surprisingly deep customization system that lets you create builds for your vehicles tailored to your playstyle. I was able to add perks like starting races with a specific item to give me an edge at the beginning of a lap, reducing damage when I was on the wrong end of an incoming attack, or even using aggressive gameplay to my advantage by granting myself a boost if I collided with an enemy racer. I’m interested to see what the meta turns out to be when <em>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds </em>launches on Switch, PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One on September 25.</p></div><div><p><em>Guacamelee </em>developer Drinkbox Studios’ latest game, <em>Blighted</em>, is unlike anything the studio’s done before. In the brief time I spent with the action RPG, I was most captivated by its world, in which people can gain memories of the dead by eating their brains. This desecrated land is overrun by horrifying creatures that stand between you and a monster who has begun feasting on the brains of the living and blighted the rest of this world. The game feels reminiscent of <em>Hades</em>’ frantic but strategic combat with an isometric view. Its enemy design is its greatest strength, with several of the monsters I faced requiring me to change up my play style and adapt to the moment. </p><p><em>Blighted </em>is launching in 2026.</p></div><div><p><em>Dosa Divas </em>is the next game from Outerloop Studios, the team behind <em>Thirsty Suitors</em>, one of 2023’s most delightful surprises. Though I only got to play about 30 minutes of the turn-based RPG, I was already drawn in by its cheeky, timely satire. The game follows siblings Samara and Amani as they face a third sister, who has created a fast food empire so pervasive that it has essentially turned the culture of cooking into a bygone era. The people in <em>Dosa Divas </em>have become so accustomed to convenience that good food created with love and intention is dying out in favor of meaningless slop. That sure does sound like, well, every creative medium right now in the wake of AI-generated garbage and America’s attempts to eject entire cultures from its borders. A quick and easy approximation of something is no replacement for the potential of the original when it’s made with heart and soul. This cathartic premise is enough to grab my interest, but its simple yet engaging turn-based combat is also a fun vehicle to ride as I watch this sibling rivalry play out.</p></div><div><p><em>Snap &amp; Grab </em>is one of the more interesting takes on a heist game that I’ve seen. Rather than executing the crime of a lifetime on your own, the game<em> </em>has you scope out a location to plan a course of action for someone else to take in your stead. As world-renowned photographer Nifty Nevada, I was able to freely take photos at a fancy rich people party, yet instead of merely capturing the festivities, I was actually taking photos of the penthouse to chart out a plan for one of my goons to come in and steal a priceless artifact for me. I had access to most places in the home, so I was able to take photos of where guards would be posted and note potential distractions or weaknesses in the security system. If I could account for all those pitfalls, it’d be a quick grab and dash for my accomplices. As I walked through the penthouse, I noted several other potential setups that I missed in previous runs, so <em>Snap &amp; Grab </em>seems to give you a lot of freedom to chart your own course. I hope it has more surprises in store when it launches next year.</p></div><div><p>Leading up to my appointment, <em>Mixtape </em>was far and away one of the most talked-about games at Summer Game Fest, and I wasn’t disappointed. Beethoven and Dinosaur’s adventure game stars a group of teenagers in the ‘90s creating a playlist for their final night together. Each song on the mixtape is accompanied by what is essentially a playable music video animated in a distinct, <em>Spider-Verse</em>-like, stop-motion-esque art style. Every segment is as unique and memorable as the song that accompanies it. The songs are attached to flashbacks of the group’s high school antics, and in just the short time I played, each segment was a rolicking good time full of that kind of “us-against-the-world” hope you feel when you’re a teen who hasn’t had that optimism beaten out of you yet. I want it now, but I’ll have to wait until the full game is released later this year.</p></div><div><p><em>Absolum </em>was probably my biggest surprise of the show. I went in with no real knowledge, and was kinda disappointed when I had to stop playing it for another appointment. Developed by the team behind <em>Streets of Rage 4</em>, <em>Absolum </em>marries those same pitch-perfect beat-em-up stylings with roguelite runs. It’s frenetic, stylish, challenging, and has a gorgeous 2D animation style that’s lovely to look at. I played as an agile character whose base kit prioritized quick, vicious combos, and a grappling hook that let me close distance and tear through enemies with reckless abandon. But <em>Absolum </em>has multiple playable characters with different playstyles that you customize throughout each roguelite run. What I played felt deep, demanding, and rewarding, and I can’t wait to play more when the game launches on PC, PS4, PS5, and Switch.</p></div><div><p>The old-school <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>games were a blind spot for me for a long time. I played a little of the 3D action titles on the original Xbox and my fair share of <em>Dead or Alive</em>, but as far as the tough-as-nails sidescrollers that started it all, I never saw Ryu Hayabusa’s origins. Ryu isn’t the main character in <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em>, but his apprentice Kenji is taking the lessons he’s learned from the OG out into the field with him. <em>Ragebound </em>is a pretty tough and unforgiving sidescroller that can lay you out in a second if you’re not careful. Its combat is one pillar of that challenge. But its platforming, in which you scale walls, hang from ceilings, and overall use every surface to your advantage in one way or another, tests your spacial awareness while half a dozen enemies are pestering you (or just one enemy you can’t even damage under normal circumstance is menacingly charging up an attack, preparing to take you out in an instant). It feels like a faithful throwback, and your mileage may vary on whether you’re up for the task.</p></div><div><p>If you’ve ever played something from Supermassive Games, you probably have some idea what you’re getting into with <em>Directive 8020</em>. The narrative horror team is delving into sci-fi for the latest entry in <em>The Dark Pictures Anthology</em>, and while I spent probably the least amount of time with it of all the games I checked out (roughly 15 minutes), I did see enough to know Supermassive is still doing what it does best: riffing on different horror genres with difficult choices and consequences for your actions. <em>Directive 8020 </em>shows a space station crew turning against each other in paranoia as an alien force that can transform into anyone infiltrates their group, sowing distrust between them as they try to survive. My time with the game was short but sweet.</p></div><div><p>Vermila Studios’ horror shooter <em>Crisol: Theater of Idols </em>wears its OG <em>Bioshock </em>influence on its sleeve. But rather than a sunken city, it takes place in a worn-down version of Spain haunted by twisted puppets and mannequins that can only be destroyed by bullets powered by your own blood. It’s unnerving and atmospheric, and its use of your health bar as your blood-fueled ammo means you have to make every shot count, lest you die while fighting for your life.</p></div><div><p>The farming sim genre can feel a bit oversaturated these days, as everyone chases <em>Stardew Valley</em>’s success. To stand out in 2025, you’ve gotta have some kind of twist that keeps things fresh. <em>Grave Seasons </em>illustrated that to me in just 30 minutes. The moment that made it click for me was when I was pulling crops out of my garden and found a severed human hand buried in the dirt alongside them. Farming sims are often viewed as a cozy getaway, so <em>Grave Seasons </em>using it as a stage to explore a supernatural murder mystery is the kind of subversive take that carves out space in a crowded market.</p></div><div><p>&nbsp;<em>Relooted </em>was another interesting spin on a heist game that I played in LA, with its bite-sized robberies feeling like brain-teasing puzzles about meticulously planning one swift run from entrance to exit. The game follows an African crew reclaiming stolen artifacts from Western museums, with each member having a skill that makes them crucial to getting these items back where they belong. Your job as the field agent is to assign your team to different stations, so when you grab an item, you’ve cleared a path for yourself to book it once the alarms start blaring. Arranging a perfect getaway feels satisfying, and it helps that <em>Relooted</em>’s sidescrolling parkour is smooth as hell. I played a few early heists, so I can only imagine how much more elaborate later heists can get, and how crafty I’ll have to be to see them through.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
