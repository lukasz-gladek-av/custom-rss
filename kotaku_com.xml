              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> was supposed to kick off the Nintendo Switch 2’s first big fall season but it’s now been indefinitely delayed as Gearbox Entertainment works to deliver the “best possible experience” for fans on the new portable console. It’s a surprisingly last-minute move for a game that was supposed to ship in less than two weeks, on October 3. The pivot comes after weeks of heated debate over the loot shooter’s performance on other platforms.</p> <p><span>“We need to share that the release of<em> Borderlands 4</em> on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed,” the studio wrote in an announcement on Tuesday evening. “We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Greetings, Vault Hunters – We need to share that the release of Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed. We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development…</p> <p>— Borderlands (@Borderlands) <a href="https://twitter.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The studio said it hopes to peg the new release date for <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Switch 2 to the arrival of cross saves for all versions of the game, but didn’t provide a release window for that either. “We will update you all on the new release timing once we’ve fully adjusted our plans,” the announcement reads.&nbsp;</span><span>In the meantime, all digital pre-orders on the eShop have been canceled in accordance with a Nintendo policy, and will be refunded starting September 26.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p>The sudden delay comes after lots of complaints about <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765"><em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s performance on PC</a> as well as some concerns on other consoles, including an apparent memory leak that makes the game run worse if you play it continuously for long stretches of time without quitting out and relaunching. The game is capped at 30fps on Switch 2, and initial hands-on impressions with the game suggested it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DosYcQK5y2Q">ran well enough</a>, though experiences on Steam Deck have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOCMeKugDOQ">reportedly been subpar</a>. Digital Foundry’s analysis of the game across various platforms has also been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRWW6qwjFBA">less than glowing</a>.</p> <p>Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has been <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kotaku+randy+pitchford&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;oq=kotaku+randy+pitchford&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgBEAAY7wUyCggCEAAYgAQYogQyBwgDEAAY7wUyCggEEAAYogQYiQUyBggFEEUYPNIBCDM1MjhqMGo0qAIAsAIB&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">all over social media</a> since the sci-fi sequel launched earlier this month, but hasn’t yet weighed in on the delay as of publishing time.</p>

              <p>Star Wars is the number one selling license of LEGO, even surpassing Harry Potter in fan enthusiasm. Most Star Wars LEGO sets have wonderful reviews, usually 4.8 out of 5 on Amazon and both children and adult fans enjoy them. One set that’s flying off the shelves, especially with its all-time lowest price just before Prime Day, is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3759/">Ahsoka Tano’s T-6 Jedi shuttle: Now offered for $54, where it was once $79</a>, it’s a bargain if you’re looking to revisit the galaxy far, far away adventures.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3759/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Step Into the World of Star Wars Adventure</h2>
<p>This LEGO set mimics the streamlined and signature look of Ahsoka Tano’s starship in the well-known animated TV series. <strong>With 599 pieces</strong>, the set provides a satisfying build experience that’s <strong>perfect for kids 9 and up</strong> but suitable for adult collectors who desire a displayable model as well. The shuttle includes an opening cockpit that is well-suited to house the included LEGO mini-figures.</p>



<p>The collection includes <strong>four detailed mini-figures: Ahsoka herself, with two lightsabers; Sabine Wren, with two blasters; Professor Huyang, with a wrench; and Marrok, with a double-bladed lightsaber</strong>.</p>
<p>Functionality gets its proper place in this model with two stud shooters and storage bays that can hide tools, weapons and accessories and add realism and interactive play. The landing gear folds up neatly on the shuttle, automatically placing the wings in flight mode.</p>
<p>What makes this offer different from the typical Star Wars attraction is the combination of quality, level of detail, and now phenomenal pricing: Dropping to an all-time low of $54, the set gives children and collectors a chance to pick up a highly rated model at a friendly price at just the right time for holiday shopping or adding to a collection.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Valve awarded Steam user SonixLegend a special achievement on Tuesday. It’s called the “Game Collector” badge, and it was bestowed upon SonixLegend after they purchased over 40,000 Steam games. As far as we know, they’re the only person to have ever done it. Cool! But also how?</p> <p>As <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/behold-the-first-steam-user-to-own-40-000-games-claim-the-biggest-hoarder-badge-valve-can-offer-and-build-the-pc-gaming-library-of-alexandria/"><em>Gamesradar</em> reports</a>, SonixLegend <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/behold-the-first-steam-user-to-own-40-000-games-claim-the-biggest-hoarder-badge-valve-can-offer-and-build-the-pc-gaming-library-of-alexandria/">has a reputation</a> in the Steam community for being the super-user even among super-users. Based in Shanghai, China according to their public records, they’ve been active on Valve’s PC gaming storefront for over a decade and have an account level of 303. They’ve been collecting games for years and it’s finally caught up with them in the form of a new Steam record.</p> <p>Thanks to places like SteamDB, we can glean all sorts of weird info about SonixLegend’s collection. Technically, they have 97,000 titles in their account, but majority of them are junk that don’t qualify for the achievement. If you were somehow able to magically refund everything in the library at today’s prices, the total catalog would be worth over <a href="https://steamdb.info/calculator/76561198028121353/">$640,000</a>. Man, would it suck to lose the password to that account or get banned for breaking Valve’s TOS.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000628034" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628034"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628034">Valve / SteamDB / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://steamdb.info/calculator/76561198028121353/"><em>Polygon</em> estimated</a> that it would take over seven years to beat every game in SonixLegend’s collection. But at the rate they’re actually going, that will probably never happen. SonixLegend’s actual favorite game, ironically enough, is a free-to-play co-op shooter called <em>Alien Swarm</em>. It came out back in 2010. They have played it for over 550 hours. They also have over 100 Steam products that cost more than $200 each.</p> <p>But while SonixLegend is currently winning Steam, they’re hardly the only person gunning for the 40K achievement. A <a href="https://steamdb.info/badge/13/">leaderboard shows</a> nearly 20 other Steam users who all have over 30,000 games in their libraries. SonixLegend appears to be in a semi-direct race with at least one in particular who goes by&nbsp;<a href="https://steamdb.info/calculator/76561198017975643/" rel="nofollow">Ian Brandon Anderson</a>. They’re the current runner-up with 39,497 qualifying games. Just, uh, another 533 to take first place. The current value of their library is $542,444. But being the first to 45,000, assuming Valve adds an achievement for that? Priceless.</p> <p>The money for Gabe Newell’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-3-leak-sgf-2025-rumor-gabe-newell-yacht-1851783832">next yacht</a> has to come from somewhere.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Starting a Pokemon card collection can be exciting but also overwhelming when you’re figuring out where to begin. If you’re just getting into it, here’s a deal that’s hard to pass up: <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/">an assorted lot of 50 Pokemon cards for just $5, down from $9</a>. That’s around 40% off the regular price, and $0.10 for each card. Now, you will not be opening up rare cards, and there could be duplicates that show up, but this is a wonderful way to start your collection under way without spending too much money.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>How to Build Your Pokemon Collection with a Budget Boost</h2>
<p>This mixed bag is a <strong>mix of standard Pokemon cards and energy cards</strong> from a variety of series with a surprise feature that makes it interesting. You never know what you are going to receive in each pack, so the excitement from not knowing which cards appear adds some zip to the action. <strong>Value is in terms of quantity and mix rather than rarity</strong>, so it is ideal for beginners wanting to establish a good foundation set or for backyard collectors who want cheap means of expanding their collection.</p>



<p>The randomness does have some dups but that’s just the bet for bulk purchasing at this price level. Silver lining is that dups can be used to make trades with buddies or strengthen your deck by having multiples of a specific card. Over time, this encourages more interaction with fellow gamers and collectors.</p>
<p><strong>For $5 for 50 cards, this deal lowers the entry price for Pokemon players and collectors</strong>. It is a solid choice if you have been eager to start playing without spending a lot of money upfront.</p>
<p>Sure, you may not get the super-huge ones here, but the thrill is in unpacking the boxes, organizing cards, and discovering new favorites. And for serious players, these base cards provide the foundation for trades and deck enhancements.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-is-clearing-out-its-summer-stock-of-mini-4k-drones-prices-back-to-black-friday-lows-2000627999</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Choosing the right drone can feel like a real challenge with so many options out there. But if you’re just starting out or flying for fun, there’s one key thing to keep in mind: <strong>your drone should weigh under 250 grams to avoid the hassle of FAA registration</strong> and Remote ID requirements.</p>
<p>That narrows your choices quite a bit, and luckily, DJI offers two solid options in that category. The ultimate bang for your buck <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4270/">is the Mini 4K — and right now, it’s available on sale at an all-time low of $249, down from $299, at Amazon</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4270/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The Ultimate Drone with Impressive Power and Precision</h2>
<p>The DJI Mini 4K is not just light but it’s also designed to impress. Its small body is lightweight but it’s what it does in the air that truly counts: Loaded <strong>with a 4K Ultra HD camera and combined with a 3-axis gimbal stabilization system</strong>, it records video with silky, movie-quality smoothness. Whether capturing a sunrise, sunset, or nighttime scene, the sharpness and clarity are excellent. This means <strong>you don’t necessarily need to be an expert to create professional-grade videos</strong>.</p>
<p>Due to its brushless motors, the Mini 4K supports <strong>wind resistance as high as 38 kilometers per hour</strong> — that’s Level 5 wind resistance. It also comes with the ability to <strong>take off and fly at altitudes as high as 4,000 meters</strong>. This guarantees that your flying experience is still stable and sensitive even if the weather gets a bit challenging.</p>



<p>The increased battery life adds an important plus to your flight duration: You can purchase sets that include one battery for 31 minutes (like that one on sale at Amazon), two batteries total of 62 minutes, or even three batteries where you can fly for up to 93 minutes.</p>
<p>Casual flyers and beginners will appreciate its simplicity and safety features: With one-tap takeoff and landing, GPS-enabled “Return to Home” and automatic hovering, even those new to drones can quickly get comfortable behind the controls. Plus, the DJI Fly app offers in-app tutorials to speed up the learning process so you’ll be flying and capturing your best shots in no time. The Mini 4K also comes with intelligent QuickShots like Helix, Dronie, Rocket, Circle, and Boomerang that make tricky flying maneuvers a breeze and capture stunning shots with only a few taps.</p>
<p>If you want to try aerial photography, this drone is the ideal friend.</p>

              <p>Boom! Bang! Kablam! Etc. and so on. There will be a lot of that happening today as a big new event on Steam has a whole host of fantastic retro-inspired first-person shooters on sale for the rest of the week.</p> <p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/boomstock2025">On September 23, Boomstock 2025 started on Steam</a>. The event celebrates “all boomer shooters and retro-inspired” FPS games and features a ton of new trailers, demos, and of course, a load of games on sale. This includes some genuine bangers, like<em> Dusk</em>, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/mullet-madjack-anime-fps-roguelike-hades-review-steam-1851475865">Mullet Madjack</a></em>,<em> Project Warlock</em>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/"><em>Selaco</em></a>, and<em> Sulfur</em>.&nbsp; But don’t wait too long, as the event wraps up on September 27, which is just a few days away. If you need help picking out a new shooter to buy, here are some of the best and biggest deals we spotted from the event:</p> <ul> <li><em>Nightmare Reaper</em> – $15 ($25)</li> <li><em>Brutal John 2</em> – $9 ($13)</li> <li><em>Selaco</em> – $19 ($25)</li> <li><em>Forgive Me Father</em> – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Forgive Me Father 2</em> – $15 ($25)</li> <li><em>Wizordum</em> – $15 ($20)</li> <li><em>Dusk</em> – $7 ($20)</li> <li><em>Sulfur</em> – $16 ($22)</li> <li><em>Zero Protocol</em> – $7 ($12)</li> <li><em>Project Warlock 1+2</em> – $12 ($27)</li> <li><em>Mullet Madjack</em> – $15 ($20)</li> <li><em>Warhammer 40K Boltgun</em> – $11 ($22)</li> <li><em>Blood We</em>st – $9 ($25)</li> <li><em>Heavy Bullets</em> – $2 ($10)</li> <li><em>Viscerafest</em> – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Supplice</em> – $15 ($22)</li> <li><em>Wild Bastards</em> – $9 ($35)</li> <li><em>Shadow Warrior</em> (2013) – $3 ($30)</li> <li><em>Shadow Warrior 2</em> – $3 ($30)</li> <li><em>HROT</em> – $10 ($20)</li> <li><em>Gravelord</em> – $15 ($20)</li> <li><em>Quatermain and the Cult of Cthulu</em> – $2.50 ($3)</li> <li><em>Hard Reset</em> – $1.50 ($15)</li> <li><em>Hard Reset Redux</em> – $2 ($20)</li> <li><em>Serious Sam 2</em> – $2.50</li> <li><em>Mycopunk</em> – $11 ($14)</li> <li><em>Graven</em> – $5 ($23)</li> </ul> <p>I’d also like to shout out some demos for upcoming games that you can play for free right now. You totally should check out these games if you love classic shooters. Or <em>Tetris</em>. You’ll see what I mean. Anyway, here are some Boomstock demos worth playing:</p> <ul> <li><em>Sportal</em> – A boomer shooter all about using sports equipment like bats and tennis rackets.</li> <li><em>Blocks for Babies –</em> <em>Tetris</em> meets <em>Doom</em>. It mixes 2D and 3D gameplay. It’s an odd one, but worth checking out.</li> <li><em>Slyders</em> – This one is part<em> Serious Sam</em> and part roguelike, which is already a great pitch, but then you add in a cool cartoon fox protagonist, and you’ve got something special.</li> <li><em>The Last Exterminator</em> – This is the <em>Duke Nukem 3D</em> sequel we deserved. This isn’t a new demo; <a href="https://kotaku.com/duke-nukem-3d-last-exterminator-demo-boomer-shooter-pc-1850918547">I covered it last year</a>, but it’s a part of the event and still worth checking out.</li> </ul>
