            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For many months now, some fans online have suggested that <a href="https://kotaku.com/onimusha-way-sword-pragmata-resident-evil-9-preview-2000618849">Capcom’s upcoming sci-fi adventure <em>Pragmata</em></a> is actually a secret<em> Mega Man r</em>eboot. However, <em>Pragmata’s</em> producer says it is not, even laughing about the conspiracy theory when recently asked about it.</p> <p>Fans and content creators online have spread this theory around for a while. Many point out that <em>Pragmata’s</em> cybergirl sidekick, Diana, shares a lot of design elements with Mega Man<em>,</em> with her coat lending her the robot’s signature color and her arm expanding during some moments in a way reminiscent of the Blue Bomber’s oversized blaster arm. There’s also the game’s narrative setup, which involves evil robots. <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcom-settles-it-no-pragmata-isnt-a-secret-mega-man-game/">But, in a recent interview with&nbsp;<em>VGC</em></a><em>,</em> <em>Pragmata’s</em> producer Naoto Oyama completely denied this theory.</p> <p>“<em>Pragmata</em> is not a <em>Mega Man</em> game,” said Oyama. <em>VGC</em> also reports he was laughing as he answered the question. He then added, “It is a completely new game from Capcom.</p>

 <p>“I was actually one of the producers on the <em>Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collectio</em>n as well, so I’m happy to see that people who love <em>Mega Man</em> are passionate about <em>Pragmata</em> too,” Oyama told the outlet. “From my standpoint, it’s nice to see people are being so positive about it.”</p> <p>So that seems like a definitive no. However, I expect some fans will claim that Capcom is lying. That, <em>of course</em>, they won’t confirm <em>Pragmata’s</em> connection to <em>Mega Man</em>. It’s supposed to be a big secret, so Capcom will deny it until <em>Pragmata</em> launches sometime in 2026. (<a href="https://kotaku.com/capcom-pragmata-delay-delayed-2023-2024-ps5-xbox-pc-1850531732">Remember when this game was revealed in 2020 and was supposed to be out in 2022?</a>)</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="PRAGMATA – Announcement Trailer, Extended Cut | Next Gen (2022)" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZJxXPZGmTzY?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>However, I’d argue that Capcom knows how much people want new<em> Mega Man</em> games, and if they were making one, they’d be shouting about it from the rooftops. Also, keep in mind that Capcom isn’t above referencing and hinting at other games in their new IPs. <a href="https://kotaku.com/exoprimal-dino-crisis-reboot-sequel-dinosaur-shooter-ca-1849066060">We saw this happen with <em>Exoprimal</em></a>, which many fans were convinced was a <em>Dino Crisis</em> game. And to fans’ credit, Capcom did include a woman with red hair in a debut trailer for the game about dinosaurs. So I’m not surprised there’s some <em>Mega Man</em> inspiration in <em>Pragmata</em>. Capcom really needs people to remember this game exists and care about it in 2026. And what better way to do that than by sprinkling a few references to something much more popular and hoping the fans take the bait.</p> <p>Anyway, even if <em>Pragmata</em> isn’t a <em>Mega Man</em> game (and I really don’t think it is), the game sounds like it might be an interesting throwback to the kind of linear action games we got back in the 2010s on Xbox 360 and PS3. <a href="https://kotaku.com/pragmata-capcom-preview-summer-game-fest-impressions-1851784342">Here’s what our own Kenneth Shepard thought about it when he played it earlier this year</a>:</p> <blockquote><p><em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>feels a bit like a game out of time, as its gruff old man protagonist, slow-moving enemies, and brutalist sci-fi aesthetic are all evocative of the over-the-shoulder shooters from the PS360 era. Given those seemingly bygone qualities, it’d be easy for&nbsp;<em>Pragmata&nbsp;</em>to feel rote and dated, but what I played was just inventive enough to feel novel. I was super impressed with it.</p></blockquote>

              <p>Valve’s extremely popular PC gaming store Steam is now requiring users in the United Kingdom to <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-child-account-safety-settings-danger-1851680045">verify their age</a> using a credit card. This is a direct result of the UK’s controversial Online Safety Act.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-steam-users-must-now-verify-age-to-access-store-pages-for-mature-games-thanks-to-online-safety-act">As of August 29, as spotted by <em>Eurogamer</em></a>, it looks like Valve is now requiring that all users in the United Kingdom verify how old they are before they will be able to access mature video games. <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/292B-3DA3-CFC8-97F6">Valve has also updated its official Steam Support website</a> with new information about age verification, telling UK users that “in order to access Steam store pages for mature content games,” they’ll need to go through an “opt-in process” that requires age verification via credit card. Going through this process will “trigger a £0 authorization” on the card to check if it’s active and real.</p> <p>Valve says that as long as the credit card stored on the Steam account is valid, the account is considered “age verified.” So you should only have to do this once. Hopefully.</p> <p>According to the updated Steam Support website, Valve “reviewed” all age verification methods and determined that using a credit card preserved “the maximum degree of user privacy” compared to some other sites and services that use AI-powered facial scanning tech.</p> <p>“The data processed in the verification process is identical to that of the millions of other Steam users who make purchases or store their payment details for convenience,” explained Valve on the website. “The verification process therefore provides no information about a user’s content preferences to payment providers or other third parties. Valve handles the verification process using its own internal payment processing system, which is independently certified under the PCI-DSS standard.”</p>

 <p>Also on the site, when explaining why this new verification process is being forced upon users, Valve directly and politely lays the blame on the UK’s new online safety laws and Ofcom, the nation’s independent regulator for online safety.</p> <p>Valve isn’t the first video game company to run into issues with the UK’s Online Safety Act, which has placed large, <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2025/08/no-uks-online-safety-act-doesnt-make-children-safer-online">controversial restrictions and regulations</a> on how people under 18 can access the internet. In July, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-age-verification-uk/">Xbox began rolling out its own age verification process</a> in the United Kingdom. <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/account/age-verification-faq/#:~:text=We%20are%20piloting%20an%20age%20verification%20process%20for%20players%20who%20register%20for%20new%20accounts%20in%20the%20UK%20and%20Ireland.%20If%20you%20are%20setting%20up%20an%20adult%20account%2C%20you%20will%20be%20asked%20to%20provide%20proof%20that%20you%20are%20over%20the%20minimum%20age%20for%20that%20type%20of%20account%20using%20an%20age%20verification%20service.">Sony is “rolling out”</a> an age verification process in the&nbsp; UK, too.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-most-popular-netflix-streaming-2000620409"><span>officially the most-streamed English movie in Netflix’s catalog</span></a><span>. It is one of the most surprising success stories of the year. A completely original animated musical has captured the hearts and minds of audiences, all while Sony and Netflix were woefully unprepared for it to blow up the way it has. It debunks conjecture that people aren’t interested in original animated features, and now that it has, we can examine why projects by Pixar, once the&nbsp; top dog in animation, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pixar-best-movies-toy-story-nemo-incredibles-inside-out-1851785148"><span>haven’t hit the same way they used to</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Elio</span></i><span>, Pixar’s sci-fi </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/anime-manga-genre-isekai-enter-oxford-dictionary-1851375582"><span>pseudo-isekai</span></a><span> film about an orphaned boy looking for family among aliens, had the company’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/elio-worst-box-office-bad-pixar-disney-dragon-weekend-1851784926"><span>worst-ever box office debut</span></a><span> back in June, and as Pixar’s original movies continue to flounder and fail to gain an audience while a sequel like </span><i><span>Inside Out 2 </span></i><span>can be </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ne-zha-2-inside-out-2-box-office-record-2-billion-china-1851765730"><span>one of the highest-grossing animated films of all time</span></a><span>, the narrative increasingly becomes “people don’t want original stories or ones too specific to a certain lived experience.” Well, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-jinu-death-memorial-anime-expo-rumi-2000620346"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>is a brand new story based in Korean mythology and is topping the charts for both movies and music, so that’s obviously not true. What’s the difference? Well, one </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>artist has a theory.</span></p> <p><span>Radford Sechrist is a story artist on </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>, as well as the husband of director Maggie Kang. Sometimes he posts about art and animation on TikTok, and he had some insight as to why </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>has been so successful while movies like </span><i><span>Elio</span></i><span> and even </span><i><span>The Bad Guys 2</span></i><span>, which had a pretty significant drop in box office after its opening weekend, are struggling. Sechrist says that even though a lot of animated movies are marketed as “all-ages,” only so many of them are truly aiming for adults as well as kids. He then goes on to argue that, in order for an animated film to become a big pop culture phenomenon, it has to target people in their 20s and up, and it will then naturally trickle down to children through platforms like YouTube and TikTok.</span></p>

   <p><span>“I think the issue is that kids only watch shows where they’re seeing people talking about it on YouTube, and the people talking about it on YouTube are in their 20s,” Sechrist says. “So if you’re developing a movie, you kind of have to think about people in their 20s first before the kids will even hear of the movie. So things like anime, </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>, you have to sort of shoot for that age of demographic and you have to get people in their 20s excited so they’re talking about it. Then the kids will see that, and as long as you don’t put anything in the movie that’s too much for a kid—but let’s be honest, there’s like 5-year-olds watching </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>.”</span></p> <p><span>Sechrist points out that some of the most notable exceptions to this are in animation targeting pre-school children, or in shows like </span><i><span>Bluey</span></i><span>, which are aimed at children but engage in enough adult themes that parents gladly watch the show alongside their kids. Anecdotally, when I went to see </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>for </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-box-office-showtimes-songs-2000620026"><span>its singalong screenings</span></a><span>, the kid to adult ratio in the crowds wasn’t exactly lopsided. I went with a group of adults, and we weren’t the only childless party at those screenings. My friend even joked that she forgot the movie was “for kids” until we arrived at the theater because its fandom has transcended age. That speaks to the truth of Sechrist’s theory that </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i><span>’ adult appeal, which it establishes through adult themes, quality animation, and music you’d actually listen to outside of the movie, has helped it break past the “kids movie” bubble that movies like </span><i><span>Elio</span></i><span> may be stuck in. He says that he would encourage Pixar, Disney, Dreamworks, and anyone else working on an animated property to consider if something is reaching the 20s-and-up demographic, or if they want it to be so specific in its younger audience that it never escapes those trappings.</span></p> <p><span>Pixar’s box office trajectory has become a big topic in conversations about the state of animation writ large, but some nuance is lost when you ignore that several of Pixar’s movies have been released on Disney+ alongside a limited theatrical release in the years since the covid-19 pandemic. In any case, Pixar’s upcoming projects are pretty sequel heavy, with </span><i><span>Toy Story 5</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Incredibles 3</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Coco 2</span></i><span> all in the works. The studio’s next movie, an </span><i><span>Avatar</span></i><span>-like story called </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hoppers-trailer-pixar-animation-teaser-inside-out-2-1851786456"><i><span>Hoppers</span></i></a><span>, is coming to theaters on March 6.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-remake-snake-eater-collectors-edition-2000621395</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’ve purchased few collector’s editions in my time. I never know where I’m gonna put the damn things, I often end up selling the stuff later on, and, well, sometimes you hear and see horror stories that dissuade you from shelling out two or three times the cost of a game to just get some ugly plastic junk. Sadly, it seems that the <a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-delta-remake-2000619269">excellent <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta</i></a> has that very problem, with its special edition containing a diorama that sounds neat in practice, but is actually pretty ugly and disappointing according to fans.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-snake-eater-delta-remake-2000619269"><i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i>: The <i>Kotaku</i> Review</a></p> <p><a href="https://www.konami.com/games/us/en/topics/2529/">Advertised as a pretty neat-looking diorama</a> of a memorable scene from early in <i>Snake Eater</i> when Snake has to recover his backpack from a hanging tree branch, fans on r/metalgearsolid are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1n2na11/mgs_delta_collectors_edition_is_trash/">sharing their disappointment</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1n2y9gf/that_200_is_feeling_way_worse/">with the actual product</a>. The foliage not only doesn’t match what was advertised, but in some cases it looks like it was just tossed in there, with some stuff laying on its side. Oh, and the model of Snake? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1n2qr02/major_do_you_read_me_this_is_snek/">Yeesh</a>. I’ll also add that Snake is supposed to call Major Zero on the radio <i>after</i> he gets the backpack, so like omg this scene just totally disrespects the lore.</p>   <p>If you managed to get your hands on the Japanese or European versions of <i>Delta</i>’s collector’s edition, however, you likely have a much prettier piece of shelf decoration. In Japan it retails for 38,500 yen or around 260 bucks, a bit more than it did here, but the bust of Snake it comes with isn’t just <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1n3a9kd/the_collector_eu_is_beautiful/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">satisfyingly detailed</a>, with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/metalgearsolid/comments/1n2sipk/snake_finally_complete/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">the pale viper wrapped around him</a> <a href="https://www.siliconera.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-japan-collectors-edition-includes-snake-bust/">as matches the advertisements</a>; it also features a lovely reference to one of the game’s ending scenes in the white and red flowers blooming around its base.</p>   <p>So if you’re an <i>MGS</i> sicko like myself, and you do have shelf space to spare, definitely figure out how you can get your hands on the overseas version of this collector’s edition.</p>
