              <p>Microsoft’s Windows 11 Pro is one of the most efficient and productivity-focused operating systems out there. It features several business-oriented features you won’t find in the Home version, which makes it great for professional use. However, as you’d expect, a subscription doesn’t come cheap.</p>
<p>It typically retails for closer to $200, but Stacksocial is making the upgrade easy. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/">Right now, you can grab a lifetime license for Windows 11 Pro for just $10 on the platform, which is a massive 94% off the usual retail price</a>. It’s a digital license, which means you will receive your redemption code via email immediately after purchase. You just need to redeem your code within 30 days of purchase. The only catch? The deal is selling out fast, so you might want to act fast to get your orders in. Once it’s gone, it’s unclear if (or when) it’ll be back at this price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>Advanced Security and Productivity Features Right From the Get Go</h2>
<p>While the installation process is quite simple, your system and hardware need to meet certain requirements before you can get started. These include a 64-bit processor with at least 1GHz clock speed, 4GB of RAM, and 64GB of storage. The device you’re planning to install it on should also have TPM 2.0 enabled, a graphics card that’s compatible with DirectX 12 or later with WDDM 2.0 driver, a high-definition (720p) display that is greater than 9 inches diagonally, as well as should support UEFI firmware. Most modern devices already meet these standards, but it’s still a good idea to double-check compatibility using Microsoft’s own tool before proceeding with the purchase.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro includes everything from the Home version, plus it gets you a bunch of additional advanced features like BitLocker encryption and Hyper-V virtualization. Gamers will appreciate support for DirectX 12 Ultimate, which translates into better graphics performance and smoother gameplay. There’s also Remote Desktop for accessing your PC from anywhere, which is especially helpful for remote workers.</p>



<p>Productivity features come loaded in as well, like Snap Layouts to manage multiple windows on your screen, improved voice typing, and an overall better search experience. Copilot support also means you’ll have a smart AI assistant right at your fingertips at all times. You can use it to get answers to random questions, create summaries, craft replies, get code suggestions, and a lot more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4452/">This deal saves $189 off a powerful, easy-to-use operating system, but it won’t be around for long. Grab it while you can.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It shouldn’t be surprising that Disney, the company that has become willing to degrade its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/quentin-tarantino-toy-story-3-4-perfect-wont-watch-1851632823"><span>boldest, most artistic endeavors</span></a><span> for profit by churning out unnecessary sequels and bland live-action remakes, is talking to AI companies about letting fans make endless user-generated slop of their properties on Disney+. And indeed, the company that has </span><a href="https://web.law.duke.edu/cspd/mickey/"><span>changed IP law</span></a><span> to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mickey-mouse-infestation-88-origins-horror-game-1851134630"><span>keep Mickey Mouse</span></a><span> out of the hands of the masses is now apparently doing just that.</span></p> <p><span>According to </span><a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/digital/disney-plus-gen-ai-user-generated-content-1236426135/"><i><span>The Hollywood Reporter</span></i></a><span>, Disney CEO Bob Iger said in the company’s latest earnings call that it is “in the midst of rolling out the biggest and the most significant changes — from a product perspective, from a technology perspective — since [Disney+] launched.” Part of this is a licensing agreement with </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>developer Epic Games to add “a number of game-like features” to the streaming service, and the other is working with unnamed AI companies to allow subscribers to create short-form video content based on Disney properties.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“The other thing that we’re really excited about, that AI is going to give us the ability to do, is to provide users of Disney+ with a much more engaged experience, including the ability for them to create user-generated content and to consume user-generated content — mostly short-form — from others,” Iger said.</span></p>

 <p><span>If you hear that and immediately think of how such an opportunity would obviously be exploited by people who want to make explicit or crude videos featuring Mickey Mouse and the rest of Disney’s characters, Iger says that the company is seeking an arrangement that would “reflect [Disney’s] need to protect the IP.” Good luck, bub. I expect the </span><i><span>Zootopia </span></i><span>stans to make short work of whatever safeguards you try to put on this garbage, and we’ll see Nick Wilde and Judy Hopps making out within the first hour.</span></p> <p><span>It’s pretty damning that Iger uses the words “content” and “consume” when talking about these hypothetical AI slop videos, because that’s all AI-generated videos are: time-wasting, artless content meant to be consumed and discarded. For a company that has been so particular about how its characters are used in the past, this is such a bald-faced heel turn. Disney’s films and characters have been such a major part of pop culture for so long because the company has always been pretty stringent about how its characters were used or portrayed, which made the brand synonymous with quality control (just ask anyone who works at a Disney park about <a href="https://www.explore.com/1612677/bizarre-rules-disney-park-character-performers-follow/">the rules they have to follow in-character</a>), so just letting the reins loose for cheap slop is a real mask-off moment for the company’s priorities.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Lenovo Mini PC (32GB RAM, 1TB SSD) Hits Almost 70% Off, the Cheapest Way to Build a Windows Setup Right Now]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/save-a-massive-64-off-the-efficient-lenovo-thinkcentre-tiny-m70q-gen-5-pc-just-ahead-of-black-friday-2000643576</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-lenovo-mini-pc-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-hits-almost-70-off-the-cheapest-way-to-build-a-windows-setup-right-now.1352812/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>PCs don’t have to be bulky power-hogs that take over your entire workspace or super expensive to be efficient. If you’re after something that saves space while keeping up with your everyday work and play needs, there are quite a few solid mini PCs on the market. And Amazon is making it easier than ever to grab one.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5557/">The retailer has dropped the price of the Lenovo ThinkCentre Tiny M70q Gen 5 PC to just $800, after a massive 64% discount</a>. Even better, you’re not just getting the PC. This deal also includes a USB Calliope keyboard and mouse, plus Windows 11 pre-installed. That’s a full setup ready to go right out of the box. The deal, however, is selling fast, and there’s no telling how long the offer or the stock will stick around. If you’ve been waiting to upgrade your desktop situation for less, now is the time to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5557/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Impressive Performance In a Lightweight Frame</h2>
<p>This is a mini PC, which means you’re getting impressive power packed in a compact, lightweight frame. It measures just about 7 x 7 inches with a slim 1.4-inch depth, so it can fit into any setup without demanding a lot of space. Those who prefer a cleaner setup can simply tuck it behind their monitor or under the table using the VESA mount support, but you will have to purchase the mount separately.</p>
<p>Power-wise, it’s equipped with Intel Core i5-14400T, which is a 14th Gen chip with 10 cores (6 performance, 4 efficiency) and 16 threads, clocking up to 4.5GHz when needed. There’s a massive 32GB RAM that keeps everything running smoothly, which can especially be helpful during multitasking. You can perform a bunch of different tasks at once without experiencing frustrating slowdowns that kill the momentum.</p>



<p>Storage is handled by a 1TB PCIe SSD. It offers enough space to store all that you own, from photos to videos, programs, a ton of work documents, backups, and more. You really won’t have to invest in another storage solution anytime soon. And since it’s a solid-state drive, you can also expect much faster load and boot times compared to the traditional options out there. Together, both memory and storage ensure that you’re able to access your system quickly, plus get through busy days with ease.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth, and a wide port selection, including USB-C, multiple USB-A ports, Ethernet, and a headphone/mic combo jack. You can enjoy faster wireless connectivity, as well as expand your system by adding an external display or peripherals.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-quietly-dumps-the-forerunner-265-now-selling-the-garmin-watch-for-pocket-change-2000643948</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-quietly-dumps-the-forerunner-265-now-selling-the-garmin-watch-for-pocket-change.1352767/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You don’t need to spend $1,100 on the latest <em>Fenix 8</em> to get a serious running watch that tracks everything you need. The sweet spot in Garmin’s lineup has always been the <em>Forerunner</em> series, and for good reason: these watches outsell everything else in the brand’s catalog. The Forerunner 265 is the most premium and popular model in the range and packs a brilliant AMOLED display and advanced training metrics that rival watches costing twice as much. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5552/">just quietly marked it down to $299, slashed from its usual $449 price tag</a>. That’s an <strong>all-time low</strong> for a watch that delivers fantastic running features without the extreme price of Garmin’s flagship models.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5552/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Runners Keep Picking This Watch</h2>
<p>The difference is apparent from the very first moments you fire up the Forerunner 265: that <strong>brilliant AMOLED touchscreen pops with color and sharp text</strong>&nbsp;which remains quite readable under direct sunlight, joined by traditional button controls that work beautifully when your hands are sweaty or you’re wearing gloves. The <strong>46mm size</strong> makes the watch feather-light on your wrist so you just about forget it’s there on those ultra-long runs-or really through most of the day. Get <strong>up to 13 days of battery life in smartwatch mode</strong> and up to 20 hours in GPS mode to give you plenty of juice for training weeks.</p>
<p>Your day begins with a personalized report which provides context for how to approach each and every training day. Upon waking, you get an overview of your sleep quality, recovery status, and training outlook alongside HRV status, training readiness, and local weather. This information helps you decide if today is the day to push hard or if your body needs an easier session. The training readiness score brings together <strong>sleep quality, recovery, training load, and HRV status</strong> to tell you if you’re primed to go hard and get the most out of your workout.</p>



<p>Race preparation becomes strategic with <strong>personalized daily suggested workouts</strong>. You input your target race and course details into the Garmin Connect app, and the watch creates training plans that adapt after every run to match your current performance and recovery status. The race widget on your watch keeps your goal front and center while the workouts adapt as your body responds to training.</p>



<p>Multi-band GNSS technology with SatIQ provides accuracy in positioning that more affordable watches simply cannot attain. This matters when you’re running in areas with tall buildings, heavy tree cover, or challenging terrain where the basic GPS signals struggle. Optimizing this accuracy for battery life means you won’t be sacrificing runtime to get accurate distance and pace. You <strong>have more than 30 built-in activity profiles for running, triathlon, cycling, open-water swimming, and lots more</strong>.</p>
<p>Safety features add peace of mind during solo training sessions. <strong>Incident detection works</strong> during select outdoor activities and sends a message with your live location to emergency contacts when paired with your compatible smartphone. The <em>Assistance</em> feature lets you manually trigger an alert when you need help, something that is good to have when you are exploring new routes or training in remote areas.</p>
<p>At $299, you’re getting a watch that competes directly with models costing $600 or more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Some of the biggest games of the year are getting new difficulty options. Some of the biggest companies would kindly like their workers to quietly leave. Welcome to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily round-up of gaming news and culture. <a href="https://beta.ideas.lego.com/product-ideas/0046a36e-c287-4ddf-9ff2-dc1b553dfde1">This Lego arcade</a> is one of my favorite new proposed fan sets. It would go perfectly in that giant Lego city I have no time or money for building in my attic.</p> <h2>Krafton will let developers voluntarily resign as it doubles down on AI</h2> <p>The <em>PUBG</em> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101"><em>Subnautica 2</em> publisher</a> will allow employees based in South Korea to be part of a new voluntary resignation program that gives anywhere from six months to three years of severance,<em>&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.businesskorea.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=256319#google_vignette"><em>Business Korea</em> reports</a>. Krafton says the plan isn’t aimed at sneaking through “soft” layoffs, but is “to support members in proactively designing their growth direction and embarking on new challenges both inside and outside the company amid the era of AI transformation,” according to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/krafton-launches-voluntary-resignation-program-for-employees-as-it-transforms-into-an-ai-first-company/">a translation by <em>Automaton</em></a>.</p>

 <p>The news comes after <a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-krafton-ai-pubg-bloodlines-2-motion-blur-2000638553">Krafton committed $70 million</a> in investment for GPU clusters to drive its agentic AI transformation and as fellow South Korea publisher <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gen-ai-nexon-eurogamer-voices-2000643436">Nexon suggested</a> adopting generative AI technology is a matter of survival.</p> <h2>220 <em>GTA 6</em> devs signed a letter blasting the firing of 31 colleagues</h2> <p>The IGWB trade union group in the UK announced on Thursday that the letter was delivered to Rockstar management. It accused the company of union busting and demanded the reinstatement of the previously fired developers. French union STJV is planning a protest in front of Take-Two France on Friday.</p>

 <p>“It’s heartwarming to see so many of our colleagues supporting us and holding management to account—during a period where Rockstar want us to feel scared, my brave former colleagues are marching straight up to our boss’s door and demanding our voices are heard and not backing down,” one of the fired employees said in a statement. “It’s clear to everyone close to this situation that this is a blatant, unapologetic act of vicious union busting. Rockstar employs so many talented game developers, all of whom are crucial to making the games we put out.”</p>

 <h2>Could <em>GTA 6</em>‘s delay also delay the launch of the PS6?</h2> <p>That’s the thought experiment one recently analyst proposed. “We are currently forecasting a next-gen PlayStation and Xbox to arrive in late 2027–but might the console companies be tempted to get more from the current console generation by riding the <em>GTA 6</em> wave and waiting until 2028?” Ampere Analysis research director Piers Harding-Rolls <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-games-industry-reacts-to-the-delay-of-gta-6">posed the idea to <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a>. “The fact that games are now cross-gen makes this less of a factor, perhaps, but such is the size of the <em>GTA</em> franchise, the launch timing will get all areas of the games business thinking about their product strategies.”</p>

 <p>The idea here is that GTA 6 will lead to a spike in new console sales that will dramatically increase the current-gen install base. If that peak doesn’t come until early 2027, console makers might have an incentive to wait a bit before pushing out their next hardware release. But as Harding-Rolls also points out, backwards compatibility makes that less of an issue these days.</p>

 <h2><em>Silent Hill f</em> just got a new easy mode</h2> <p><a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/f/gate?p=q9avy6C9QUKFRFGSGPvBvfio1VMukY6Si2kFcyPbJy1IDNigoCWC1RGMUocaVwR2">Patch 1.10 added</a> a “casual” difficulty for players who are tired of messing around with the <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505">Souls-y action combat</a> and just want to experience the world and story. It also fixes bugs on PC and makes the New Game + experience much more brisk.</p> <h2>Steam hit <em>Clover Pit</em>, meanwhile, is getting a new hard mode</h2> <p>A new update celebrating 1 million sales adds a new difficulty that features double the deadline amount.

If you’ve ever wanted to hear Starr be a broody simp for a Pokémon streamer, here’s your chance.</span></p>   <p><span>It’s a funny bit and I have to applaud the artistic choices made with a mostly straight face here, but it does underline that a lot of the character of these games can be dialed up and enhanced with a good voice actor in the booth. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> definitely shows that Game Freak has the writing chops to execute </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-credits-npc-dialogue-school-kid-2000638839"><span>some really funny, memorable scenes and jokes</span></a><span> despite not including voice acting, but every time I hear a fan try to embody these characters, I just wish the games had that same spark we get in projects like the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389"><i><span>Pokémon </span></i></a><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389">anime</a> or the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/detective-pikachu-returns-pokemon-review-switch-1850915720"><i><span>Detective Pikachu </span></i></a><span>games. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>takes a baby step toward this future by giving your main character Link-like grunts and yells when they do some actions, but they’re one person in a city full of heroes and villains that I’d love to hear speak instead of just reading. Don’t get me started on that weird scene in </span><i><span>Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield </span></i><span>where a whole concert was happening just for a character to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tC9vQmmvvfI"><span>pantomime the performance instead of singing</span></a><span>. Though that’s also </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thecamsteady/video/7536409709599870222"><span>allowed fans to interpret that character’s musical chops</span></a><span>, as well.</span></p>
