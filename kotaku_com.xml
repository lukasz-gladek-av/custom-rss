              <p>Anyone who makes videos or podcasts for a living knows that the impact of audio comes above just about everything else. Seriously, if your sound quality is good enough, then everything else is often secondary, and that’s why having really good microphones is so important. If you’re looking for an amazing option, then you’ll want to get a good lavalier microphone, because they’re a lot more subtle in appearance while providing excellent sound quality.</p>
<p>Right now, Amazon has a deal on which means that the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5079/">DJI Mic Mini is currently on sale with 38% off, which means it’s down to $74 for a limited time:</a>&nbsp;It’s normally $119, so that’s a decent discount for sure. Not only that, but <strong>this comes with two transmitters and one receiver</strong>, so you can even use this for duo productions.</p>

<h2>Mic Check</h2>
<p>The microphones here are incredibly light, weighing in at only ten grams, which means that you’ll not only be able to connect them to just about any bit of clothing, but also not be weighed down by them. That means you’ll look better on camera, but it also means you can fine-tune the placement to get the perfect sound quality, no matter what environment you’re recording in.</p>



<p>They also feature amazing noise cancelling, with you being able to switch modes as needed. Basic will get rid of standard noises you’d expect, but strong can handle all sorts of sounds. It means that you’ll be getting crystal clear audio at all times, and that’s really important. The microphones have an amazing range of 400m as well, so you can set this up indoors then go outside to record as needed.</p>
<p>The battery life is also very impressive. You can keep these on for up to 10 hours in total, which means that you can record for an entire work day without any problems. That’s plenty of time for a huge number of takes, interviews, or different video or audio ideas as you need. These are small, mighty, and long-lasting microphones that are sure to make you sound better, no matter what you’re using them for.</p>
<p>This is a brilliant discount, but it’s also one that we’re not expecting to last for very long. So, if you do want to enjoy this amazing price tag, we recommend doing so soon. The $74 could run out at any time, and that means time is of the essence if you want to save big and sound good.</p>
