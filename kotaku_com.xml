        <p><span>Everyone needs something from you in </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span>. From military leaders to bartenders, oligarchs to battlefield medics, the population of its science fiction world seems stuck in limbo without your character to guide them. The universe is vast, the game suggests, and entirely inert when outside of your view.</span></p> <p><span>Though it’s a sequel to 2019 predecessor </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds</span></i><span>, Obsidian Entertainment’s follow-up doesn’t assume or require any real familiarity with what came before its story begins. It starts off by tossing you into its setting, a far-flung future where a now-spacefaring humanity has spread across multiple planets; introduces you to your character’s role as the Commander, an agent of a blandly heroic space cop organization called the Earth Directorate; and swiftly plops you into a high-stakes covert mission to save a galaxy-spanning colony from looming obliteration.</span></p>

 <p><span>Heir to the tradition of not just </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds</span></i><span>, but also first-person action RPGs like Obsidian’s own </span><i><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> presents the Commander as a blank slate for the player to mold to her preference. This extends from physical customization options and a set of loosely sketched character backgrounds—a professor or ex-convict, for instance—to a variety of personal attributes and attending skills. These run the usual gamut of role-playing traits, like how well the Commander can sneak around enemies, hack computers, pick locks, or convince others to adopt their point of view through conversation.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000638373" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638373"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638373">© Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Once out in the world of the game, these skills have a large impact on how </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> plays out. The prologue sees you investigating a connection between humanity’s “skip drive” space travel technology and the appearance of roiling, reality-distorting “rifts.” This involves infiltrating a space station, either by crouch-walking through vents, manipulating machinery and avoiding the attention of enemy patrols, or simply shooting through the opposition and sweet-talking guards when the opportunity presents itself. Either way, the mission inevitably descends into violent chaos—big explosions, side characters bloody in the wreckage, some mild intrigue. The plot picks up nearly a decade later, with the Commander waking from suspended animation after drifting through space following the disaster, now finding themselves with a scarred survivor of the failed assignment and a talking robot as companions, and the thin but serviceable motivation of setting out into the galaxy to figure out exactly what went wrong with their mission as the catalyst for the two dozen or so hours that follow.</span></p>

 <p><span>None of this is particularly exciting, despite the pyrotechnics and lingering plot questions of it all. There’s an immediate sense, as you venture onto the surface of the first sprawling planet of the many that will be explored throughout </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span>, that you’ve seen most of what the game has to offer in its prologue alone. In a way, this is true. The set-up is familiar video game sci-fi; warring factions of hardened, real-life-adjacent ideologues and high-concept cosmic mysteries introduced before letting the player loose to poke around a vast world at her leisure.</span></p>

  <p><span>For anyone who’s played the modern </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>The Elder Scrolls</span></i><span> games, let alone Obsidian’s own </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds</span></i><span> and this year’s </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>, the shape of what’s to come is all too apparent from the outset. You will run around sprawling natural and urban landscapes, crafting and collecting items, chatting with strangers to take on quests, finding companions to accompany you on your journey, and massacring countless enemies along the way. There are experience points to gain, characters milling around towns with a few lines of dialog to hear, and an overarching plot to progress that often feels beside the point during hours of idle exploration.</span></p>

 <p><span>The texture of this familiar terrain can go a long way toward making a game work or not. Fortunately, the act of moving and murdering through the game’s world is enjoyable enough to distract from its larger failings for a while. </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> is focused on sprinting (and, once a specific item is acquired, double jumping) across a series of planets; gunning down enemies that include human soldiers, whirring drones, hulking battle robots, and an assortment of alien animals; and reading notes while picking through the drawers, corpses, and countertops of enemy bases. The fighting is best at range, with a large arsenal of guns to pick from that span the typical video game line-up of pistols, shotguns, submachine guns, and rifles through to more bizarre variations that might, in one case, throw bolts of lightning or, in another, globs of putrid green goop. The smack of bullets against enemies and the bursts of numbers that come flying from them as their health bar depletes is brain-tickling enough to make doing so over and over again less of a chore than it might otherwise be.</span></p>

 <p><span>This is all helped along by the fact that </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> has a strong, if too familiar, look. Each planet contains vistas resembling the covers of pulp sci-fi paperbacks. Whether a forested planet, where the broad red leaves of trees contrast with green mountains and purple flowers, or a broken-down art deco train station overlooking rocky canyons, with spears of rocky mineral deposits jutting from its ground, the vibrant, sometimes garish colors of the game’s environments are a consistent highlight. This extends through to the setting’s architecture, too. The military and research installations that dot each of the planets feature rounded plastic exteriors and chunky, postwar computer terminals, with wooden crank handles attached to their sides as controls. The retrofuturist look of glowing hologram advertisements and 20</span><span>th</span><span> century propaganda posters may be as kitsch as the game’s soundtrack—a selection of mid-century jazz that would fit as easily in a </span><i><span>Fallout</span></i><span> game as it does here—but it all works to enliven the otherwise dull proceedings.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000638375" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638375"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638375">©Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span>, a set of ideologically rigid factions vie for control of the setting. These include the ruling Protectorate, a pseudo-communist authoritarian monarchy with a penchant for high technology, as well as Auntie’s Choice, a hyper-capitalist corporation created from a merger of the first game’s Auntie Cleo and Spacer’s Choice companies. There are also the Commander’s Earth Directorate, and a cultish force of utopian math-worshipping scientists called The Order of the Ascendant. Most of the game’s major choices involve sympathizing with or opposing these factions, helping them achieve their goals, thwarting them, or finding compromises that keep everyone as happy as possible—even working together in uneasy alliance during some sequences. At its best, the thorny conversational decisions featured in this style of design can resemble a series of philosophical puzzles that make the player consider their own outlook on life through difficult moral dilemmas. Here, though, the major factions are presented with such cartoonish simplicity that it’s hard to feel much of anything for them.</span></p> <p><span>The Protectorate are depicted as hapless and brainwashed, their love of robots and unthinking devotion to their leadership stifling their ability to think creatively about how to achieve the egalitarian society they desire. The capitalists, on the other hand, are so in love with buying and selling that they willfully turn a blind eye to the human suffering that their devotion to unregulated commerce entails. Every faction is totally devoted to their ideology, typically unable to recognize blind spots in their thinking until the Commander, with a high enough Speech skill, shows them the gaps in their outlook.</span></p>

 <p><span>All of this is colored with a satiric tone that papers over the thin characterization of these factions and their members. </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span>’s limp sense of humor prevents its story from becoming oppressively grim, but it also keeps its portrayals of corporate servitude and the terror of authoritarian rule at arm’s length, maintaining a hedged distance from its subject matter that replaces emotional honesty—and dramatic heft—with an ironic wink at nearly every turn. (A Tweedledee, Tweedledum pair of Auntie’s Choice executives, for instance, raise the issue of a worker’s strike at one of their factories with outsized disbelief at the concept of their laborers’ ingratitude for their crushing jobs.)</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000638374" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638374"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638374">©Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>This approach makes the line-up of companion characters who join up with the Commander throughout the story a bland bunch, too. Each of them is presented as a mascot for their faction, whether that be an Auntie’s Choice soldier who’s been the subject of macabre scientific experiments, a Protectorate fanatic struggling with his role as a violent agent of the state, or a cultist with a serial-killer-like thirst for blood. Each of these characters’ story arcs supplement your understanding of their respective factions through a personalized representation of that faction’s ideology. But these plotlines are largely flat, terminating with abrupt moments of “growth” in which the companion realizes the need to broaden their viewpoint. Worse are those that hinge on convincing companions to spare a character they’re set on killing, usually in an act of revenge, which is hard to care much about when the worth of one life is measured against the dozens of unnamed enemies that have been murdered en route to the scene in question.</span></p>

 <p><span>While common to video games, this blinkered sort of moral questioning is hardly convincing—and it points toward </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span>’s generally compromised approach to interactive drama. There is, basically, no sense of conviction to any topic the game addresses. </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> motions broadly at the concerns of our actual world, through abstracted versions of real history and modern society, and condemns what it finds there through aloof jokes about the wilful blindness to human misery that authoritarian rule and a consumerist culture require.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“Shoot for the moon.

A deep-pocketed patron might be necessary to fund games as lavishly constructed as </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span>. The fact that its money comes from a real-world corporation</span> <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/boycott-microsofts-xbox"><span>currently facilitating genocide</span></a><span> has a way of dulling the bite of its intended anti-corporate satire, though. This is a problem inherent to big-budget art and entertainment, where money often comes from corporations whose actions may—and, in this case, do—damage the intent of the work made in association with them. But the result is impossible to ignore.</span></p> <p><span>Together with the indifferent, overly simplistic portrayal of its subject matter, the context of the game’s production means that the many choices you’re asked to make throughout </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> ring hollow. By the time the credits roll, preceded by a slideshow of images showing how your Commander’s decisions impacted the future of the game’s world, there’s a deflating sense that none of the time spent inhabiting its setting has mattered. Its characters might have changed their point of view, and the outcome of the final battle might have played out slightly differently based on your choices, but the cast is so artificial that it’s easy to imagine them all quietly shuffling back to their original marks, ready to start the whole story over again from the beginning when another player boots up the game. </span><i><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></i><span> promises flexibility in storytelling, but when that flexibility comes from interacting with one-dimensional characters who inhabit such an unconvincing world, there isn’t much of a point to it.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-review-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000638368]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[HP’s 21.5-Inch All-in-One Desktop Sees 71% Off Today Only, More Than 50% Cheaper Than Apple iMac]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/hps-gorgeous-21-5-inch-all-in-one-desktop-is-half-the-price-of-the-imac-during-this-amazon-deal-2000636216</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hp%E2%80%99s-21-5-inch-all-in-one-desktop-sees-71-off-today-only-more-than-50-cheaper-than-apple-imac.1332571/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s easy to forget that Apple does not have the market cornered on the all-in-one desktop setups, despite their 40-year history of desktop dominance. There are some pretty sweet all-in-ones on the Windows side of the fence too, with this 21.5-inch HP model among the very best. It’s about to get even better, because <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4948/">thanks to this hot limited-time Amazon deal, the HP All in One is half the price of the current iMac — just $646.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>At 21.5 inches, the HP is slightly smaller than the 24-inch iMac, but this model that’s on sale at Amazon has a 1TB SSD and 32GB of RAM — twice the RAM and four times the storage capacity of Apple’s entry-level iMac, which is currently a $1,300 machine. In fact, to get an iMac with as much RAM and storage as this HP, your price suddenly goes up by a cool grand to $2,300.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4948/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>One-Stop Shopping</h2>
<p>As convenience goes, you can’t beat an all-in-one setup with big FHD monitor, keyboard, and mouse all included. The HP All in One is bundled with an accessories package to further narrow your shopping list, with a 7-in-1 USB hub, mouse, 128GB USB thumb drive, and Windows 11 Professional included. The only thing you need to add to this package is you and all of your computing needs, whether they be for work or play.</p>
<p>The Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3 connections, paired with the built-in HP True Vision HD camera, are the perfect combination for video calls and conferencing. The big 21.5-inch display has anti-glare treatment to reduce eye strain, which you’ll definitely put to the test when you use that big screen and fast internet connection to turn the HP All in One into a top-notch streaming device.</p>



<h2>Expansion-Ready</h2>
<p>As much as you’ll love the cord-free nature of an all-in-one desktop, there are plenty of options built into the HP All in One for expansion or other devices. There are four USB-A ports at the back of the monitor — two with 5Gbps data transfer speed, and a USB-C port that also moves data at up to 5Gbps. An HDMI-out port and RJ-45 Ethernet port complete the package.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4948/">Dare we say the HP All in One that’s currently on sale at Amazon for just $646 is even better than the iMac, and at less than half the price while this limited-time 71% deal is in place?</a> We might not stick out our neck that far, but it’s absolutely in the same league as the iMac, and don’t forget the larger RAM and storage capacities that the HP comes with. This might be the best one-stop shopping tech deal you see all year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Offloads Samsung’s AirPods Pro Rival, Now Cheaper Than Budget ANC Earbuds]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-offloads-samsungs-airpods-pro-rival-now-cheaper-than-budget-anc-earbuds-2000638386</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-offloads-samsung%E2%80%99s-airpods-pro-rival-now-cheaper-than-budget-anc-earbuds.1332541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The rivalry between Samsung and Apple extends far beyond smartphones, and nowhere is this more apparent than in the premium… earbuds market. Apple just launched the AirPods Pro 3 a few weeks ago, but Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, despite being a few months older, pack even more powerful (AI) features under the hood.</p>
<p>Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">has slashed these pro-level earbuds from $249 down to $189, an all-time low that makes Apple’s pricing look almost unreasonable</a>. If you’ve been tired of dealing with mediocre sound quality on crowded commutes or struggling to hear your calls clearly in noisy environments, these earbuds solve those exact frustrations.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Samsung has redone the fit and comfort formula with the Buds 3 Pro, and abandoned that classic in-ear rubber tip form that lots of us find uncomfortable after a long period of wear. Instead, it uses a <strong>new ergonomic form that holds pressure more evenly across your ear</strong> so you’re able to wear these for extended periods of time on long flights, work marathons or at the gym without that pesky pain that causes you to reach for relief.</p>
<h2>Why They Beat Other Earbuds</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro’s<strong> active noise cancellation works on a different plane than budget models and actually holds its own with Apple’s</strong>. Samsung uses adaptive ANC tech that’s always scanning your world and tweaking cancellation power in real time. What this means in practical terms is that the earbuds automatically understand that you transitioned from a quiet office to a noisy street and turn up the cancellation. It’s a profound difference: plane engine hum vanishes, subway roaring dissipates, and that noisy coworker’s keyboard typing is barely a nuisance.</p>



<p>The sound-optimizing feature uses AI to analyze what you’re listening to and shifts equalizer settings automatically&nbsp;: If you switch from a podcast to a bass-heavy hip-hop beat, your earbuds sense this move and shift audio profile dynamically. This happens transparently in the background so you get studio-quality sound on every kind of content without having to manually shift settings via an app.</p>
<p>Call quality has been wireless earbuds’ Achilles’ heel, but the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro remediate this with a <strong>high-end three-microphone system on each bud</strong>. They work in conjunction with <strong>AI-driven voice processing</strong> to separate your voice from ambient noises. On video or phone calls, others at the receiving end will hear you distinctly even if you’re strolling on a windy street or at a coffee shop. The wind cancelling algorithm identifies that pesky whooshing sound that always compromises outside calls, making these buds truly useful for individuals who work from home or receive calls on foot.</p>



<p>Battery life comes in at approximately <strong>six hours with ANC active, with a further 24 hours of juice contained in a charged case</strong>. There’s a rapid charge facility that delivers an hour of listening time from a mere five minutes in the case, which comes in useful on hurried mornings which you had planned to charge overnight. Support for wireless charging allows you to plonk the case on any Qi-enabled pad which adds a convenient touch to your day.</p>
<p>This special Amazon exclusive release comes with a <strong>two-year extended warranty</strong> instead of a typical warranty of one year. With a price tag of just $189, which is below that of most mid-range pairs that cannot compete with such powerful noise cancellation, sound, or intelligent features, it really is almost ridiculous that they undercut AirPods Pro 3 by such an amount.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-quietly-ditches-galaxy-z-flip7-on-amazon-now-going-for-pennies-on-the-dollar-2000638381</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-quietly-ditches-galaxy-z-flip7-on-amazon-now-going-for-pennies-on-the-dollar.1332511/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If there’s one smartphone that fashion lovers and trendsetters have been obsessing over, it’s the <strong>Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7</strong>. This premium flip phone isn’t just a tech gadget, it’s a statement piece that solves the eternal struggle of wanting a full-sized smartphone that actually fits in your pocket.</p>
<p>Here’s the good news: Samsung seems to be quietly moving stock through Amazon rather than their official site, and right now<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3984/"> you can snag this 256GB beauty for $849 instead of the usual $1,099</a>. That’s a $250 discount on a phone that rarely sees price cuts this aggressive, and honestly, we’re kind of obsessed.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3984/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Galaxy Z Flip7 addresses something we’ve all felt: that moment when you’re trying to stuff your phone into a clutch, a tight jeans pocket or a small bag and it just won’t cooperate. This <strong>phone literally folds in half and gives you all the screen real estate you need when it’s open</strong> (perfect for scrolling, watching videos, or texting), then collapsing into a compact square that slips anywhere. It’s the best of both worlds without compromise.</p>
<h2>Why This Flip Phone Upends It All</h2>
<p>Samsung has genuinely improved the <em>FlexWindow</em> on the Z Flip7, that outside screen you get when you close the phone. This no longer just shows notifications: With this new <em>MultiStar</em> integration, you get to personalize this external cover screen with your favorite apps, your widgets and shortcuts. This revamped edge-to-edge display gets everything more in reach, gets rid of that awkward moment of reaching for your phone for just about anything.</p>



<p><em>Now Bar</em> feature warrants a special mention as it actually simplifies your life. This smart strip on your cover screen gives you contextual information during your day. Watching a sports game? You get live scores. In the middle of a workout? You get your progress. Waiting for a delivery? You get your tracking information there. All this comes without opening your phone, which translates to staying informed but not getting bogged down in that endless scroll pit.</p>



<p>Google Gemini integration with FlexWindow raises the bar for convenience: You’re able to <strong>carry on complete conversations with Gemini’s AI assistant</strong> directly from the cover screen, asking questions, making reminders, or getting directions without taking your hands off the wheel. Galaxy AI-driven Now Brief identifies your patterns and automatically brings to your attention personalized information, such as your day’s calendar summary in the morning, bad-weather alerts, or traffic for your commute.</p>
<p>The <em>FlexCam</em> feature is where this phone comes into its own for content creators, as well as for selfie takers: Since the phone is able to support itself at different angles at a partially unfolded state, you’re provided with a <strong>built-in tripod for hand’s free photos as well as videos</strong>.
