It’s refreshing after seeing <em>Overwatch 2</em> sand off all its edges in pursuit of being the main esports hero shooter on the market. However, the hope that the wonkiness would last felt like a pipe dream for <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, as NetEase was eventually going to have to put out some balance changes that would tone down some of the shenanigans. However, now we have the details on the first balance patch launching alongside the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-fantastic-four-patch-notes-map-1851733602&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-season-1-fantastic-four-patch-notes-map-1851733602"><em>Fantastic Four</em>-focused season</a></span> and it contains just the right amount of tweaks, offering some encouragement for the game’s future.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>NetEase released the full patch notes after teasing them earlier this week as it rolled out information about Season 1. Some of the previously announced hero changes are here, such as the nerfs for Hela and Hawkeye and the buffs for Venom and Captain America, but there’s also a handful of smaller tweaks to a large swath of the roster. I’d still argue Cap needs a bit more damage to his kit if he’s going to be a brawler and that Hela’s minimal health reduction is not enough, but it’s probably the right approach to make some light changes here and there instead of turning the dial too far in either direction.</p><p>Individual heroes got rebalanced, but several Team-Up abilities also got some buffs. Almost all of the ones affected received perks of some kind, whether that be in shorter cooldowns or increased damage output. The full notes patch read as follows:</p><h2 id="h124878"><a id=""></a><strong>VANGUARD</strong></h2><p><strong>Captain America</strong><br><em>Steve will receive some enhanced survivability, allowing more frequent entering and exiting of the combat.</em><br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Reduce the delay time for shield restoration after releasing Living Legend from 3s to 2s.</em></li><li><em>Reduce Liberty Rush cooldown from 12s to 10s.</em></li><li><em>Increase base health from 650 to 675.</em></li><li><em> Reduce the energy cost for releasing Freedom Charge (ultimate ability) from 3400 to 3100; Reduce the additional health provided per second to self after releasing it from 110 to 100.</em></li></ul><p><strong>Doctor Strange</strong><br><em>We’ll be reducing the threat range and increasing the defense window of the Sorcerer Supreme.</em><br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Add damage falloff to Maelstrom of Madness and Gamma Maelstrom.

And like Steam becoming the de facto way people play PC games in 2025, SteamOS will soon be the most popular way to play PC titles on the go, which is not great for Microsoft. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196131" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="328" data-playlist="196131,194341,194651" data-current="196131"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21668.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-console-switch-horizon-zero-dawn-re-1848628507&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/valve-steam-deck-pc-console-switch-horizon-zero-dawn-re-1848628507">The Steam Deck launched in February 2022</a></span> and within months, it had changed the landscape of the video game industry and popularized the idea of handheld, portable gaming PCs. But the Steam Deck wasn’t powered by Windows as most gaming PCs are these days. Instead, it was powered by SteamOS, a Linux-based, gaming-focused operating system that made it easier than ever to buy, install, and play almost any PC game on the portable device. And it’s SteamOS—and Valve’s dedication to making a gaming-focused OS—that made the Steam Deck a big hit. </p><h2 id="h48282"><a id=""></a>SteamOS is the reason the Steam Deck is popular</h2><p>Companies had tried to do handheld gaming PCs (not laptops) before Valve. One example would be the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPD_Win&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPD_Win" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPD Win</a></span>, which featured a full keyboard and built-in Xbox controls. It could play games, but it ran on Windows, and felt clunky and slow. Other Windows- or Linux-based handheld PC were similarly clunky, hard to use, and often expensive. </p><p>The Steam Deck succeeded because it’s dead simple and easy to use, thanks to SteamOS and its compatibility features. Nearly any Steam game you already own, besides VR stuff, can work on the Steam Deck. And, in most cases, you won’t have to do much of anything to get it running. You use the easy-to-navigate menus of SteamOS to select a game, install it, and hit play. That’s it. </p><p>In the years since Valve released the Steam Deck and its slick operating system, other companies like Lenovo and ROG have released Steam-Deck-like competitors. And while many of these devices are more powerful than the Steam Deck, none of them include SteamOS, instead running on Windows 11. As a result, these devices are harder to use and clunkier. And sure, the companies behind them have tried to add their own software to make things easier, but it’s never quite as simple as the Steam Deck It’s that simplicity that allowed a lot of people who didn’t consider themselves PC gamers to buy a Steam Deck and enjoy it anyway as a straightforward, console-like experience.</p><h2 id="h48283"><a id=""></a>Microsoft let Valve create and then dominate the market</h2><p>During all of this, Microsoft had a chance to potentially step in and offer a lightweight, easy-to-use version of Windows 11 that portable PC makers could slap onto their devices. But the parent company of Xbox never did. </p><p>Now, in 2025, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve is ready to make it easier</a></span> than ever to install SteamOS on more devices. Not only that, but now <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lenovo has announced the first third-party device</a></span> that will ship with SteamOS.  I expect by 2026 all handheld makers will offer SteamOS versions of their existing devices; likely at a cheaper price, too. </p><figure id="" data-id="8a510f7ec82ad73c8bef3a543c182f2a" data-recommend-id="image://8a510f7ec82ad73c8bef3a543c182f2a" data-format="jpg" data-width="720" data-height="405" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8a510f7ec82ad73c8bef3a543c182f2a" data-recommend-id="image://8a510f7ec82ad73c8bef3a543c182f2a" data-format="jpg" data-width="720" data-height="405" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/handheld-xbox-microsoft-pc-console-1851734989&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/handheld-xbox-microsoft-pc-console-1851734989">Sure, <em>now </em>Microsoft is talking more openly about a portable</a></span>, Xbox-like device and changes to Windows 11 that will make it a more handheld-friendly experience. But it really feels like Microsoft dragged its feet for too long and is now trying to play catch up. And I just don’t think it will be able to offer a version of Windows 11 that will be better than SteamOS anytime soon.</p><p>In the meantime, Valve is soon going to let any company use its gaming OS as the backbone of future devices, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2025/01/07/valve-set-to-release-a-steamos-beta-for-multiple-devices/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2025/01/07/valve-set-to-release-a-steamos-beta-for-multiple-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">let users install SteamOS</a></span> on any portable PC they own.</p><p>This is likely to lead to a situation in which SteamOS is just considered the default way to play games on a portable PC, similar to how Steam is vastly more popular than Microsoft’s built-in Microsoft/Xbox/whatever app store that comes pre-installed on all Windows devices. And if SteamOS makes its way onto TV-based console-like devices or desktops, I think it will find a lot of success there too. A lot of people want to just play games, surf the web, and maybe listen to some music on their PC, and SteamOS can accommodate all of that easily. </p><p>Microsoft had a chance to compete with Valve in the handheld gaming space. Instead, it just...didn’t. Microsoft will likely never be able to dethrone SteamOS as the most popular way to play PC games on the go, especially if Valve keeps updating it to be better, faster, and easier to use. </p><p>Sure, Microsoft won’t go bankrupt anytime soon, but Xbox had a chance to dominate a corner of the gaming market and possibly expand its reach on desktop PCs, too. But time has seemingly run out for that to happen, and Valve has won again.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I love the Switch, I think it’s a wonderful piece of tech, and I would really love to have an upgraded version of it that’s capable of running more powerful games, and perhaps even running its own store software. But at the same time I realize, if that’s what we’re getting, it also feels like a big anticlimax.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,193658,194644" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>One of the things Nintendo has been so reliable for is bizarre innovation. For generations, it’s been utterly impossible to guess what the company might create next, given the complete surprises of, say, a two-screen clamshell touch-screen portable gaming device, or a gesture-led under-TV console that shines best when the whole family is prancing around together. Even the failed Wii U that the Switch replaced was a ludicrous combination of console and a giant handheld screen as a controller. The Switch was just as imaginative, a handheld <em>and</em> dockable console, with detachable controllers, in wild defiance of the tech-first, ever-larger boxes sold by rivals.</p><p>Even when Nintendo was creating iterative updates for its most successful products, like the GBA SP follow-up to the Game Boy Advance, or the DSi XL evolution of the original Nintendo DS, it seemed to be doing something else at the same time. Between the DS and the DSi we also got the Wii! The GameCube came out the same year as the Game Boy Advance! But, given the extraordinary scrutiny being put on every patent and parts manufacturer Nintendo is attached to, it seems vanishingly unlikely that there’s some secret second project being hidden behind the noise of the as-yet unnamed second Switch.</p><p>And the Switch 2? It’s another Switch. The controllers look likely to slot in magnetically, rather than slide in on those tracks that only match up the third time you try, and the screen is very likely to be bigger, all running on far more powerful chips. But…given it’s backward compatible, given it’s an iteration of the same format with improved tech, I find it hard to think of it as anything more than the equivalent of a souped-up Switch XL.</p><p>As I say, I <em>want</em> a Switch XL. If that were announced, independent of anything else, I’d be first to pre-order. I bought the Switch OLED as soon as I could, and I was delighted to have it. A Switch 2, as it so distressingly seems likely to be called, is a thing I want. But, at the same time, it’s not what I want to want. I want to be on the timeline where Nintendo says, “Sure, here’s the Switch 2,” but then pulls back the curtain on what else it’s cooking up. The thing that’s so wild, so peculiar, that even my silliest suggestions feel feasible. It’s a wearable piece of tech that uses holograms, or a bizarre twist on AR where the flagship <em>Mario</em> game uses our house furniture for platforms.</p><p>Just making a better Switch is so safe, so ordinary, so utterly un-Nintendo. Can you imagine any other company in the universe having the phenomenal success of the Nintendo Wii, and responding to that not by making a more powerful version of the same, but a two-screen console so complicated to explain that no one understood what it was for? Sure, that was a <em>terrible</em> idea in hindsight, but it was also the sort of thing I expect from Nintendo, and it’s impossible to understate just how equally crazy the pitch for the Switch seemed at the time, following the Wii U.</p><p>I still hold out hope that the Switch 2 will have some surprises. That little lens spotted in the Joy-Cons is something Nintendo will likely use in some really innovative ways, even if other developers never notice it’s there. I often think about one of the most wonderful aspects of the Switch—the all-too underrated Labo. Those cardboard packs, in conjunction with the peculiar controllers, that had you build working pianos, fishing rods for fishing games, and even a remote-controlled bug creature. It used the Joy-Con’s haptics to move around, and the infrared sensor as a tiny camera! That was bloody incredible! That was astoundingly imaginative, and I have high hopes that Nintendo has similarly inventive plans for using the new Joy-Cons’ tech. I like to imagine they’ll have pushed it all a little harder to third-party developers this time, so we can see <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.eurogamer.net/a-dsloveletter&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-dsloveletter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some of the wonderful madness that appeared in the first few months of the Nintendo DS</a></span>.</p><p>But, you know, I’m still a bit sad. It could have been something bonkers! It could have been something capable of running Switch games like the 3DS could run DS games. But if all the rumors and leaks are true, there’s no entire new plane of gaming existence being added here, just a Switch that can run prettier games. I’m buying one, for sure. But I will still lament a little the brand new Nintendo console innovation it doesn’t look likely to be.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
