            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="290">Apple introduced the highly anticipated AirPods Pro 3 just a couple short months ago, and just in time for the holidays, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/">these popular earbuds are already seeing a discount thanks to Cyber Monday.</a> The earbuds launched with a price tag of $249, but this week you can scoop them up for 12% off. That ends up saving you $29, with the price coming down to just $220. So if you’re searching for a standout gift or just treating yourself to an upgrade, now is the perfect opportunity to grab a pair.</p>
<p data-start="292" data-end="812">So, what’s new about the AirPods Pro 3? The AirPods Pro 3 now feature an improved real-time noise canceling, removing up to twice the noise as the previous generation was capable of.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="814" data-end="1252">The battery life has also been improved. You can now enjoy up to 10 hours of listening time (eight hours with active noise cancellation enabled) on a single charge—ideal for long flights or long days at the office. The charging case retains its MagSafe compatibility and now includes a built-in speaker, which helps you locate it using Apple’s “Find My” feature. If your case slips between couch cushions or gets lost in your bag, the speaker will ping, making it easier to track down.</p>
<p data-start="1254" data-end="1617">Apple has also upgraded the fit of the AirPods Pro 3. The updated design allows for better in-ear stability during physically demanding activities such as running, HIIT, yoga, and more. The earbuds now come with new foam-infused ear tips in five different sizes. This is includes a new XXS size to better fit ears of all shapes and sizes.</p>
<p data-start="1254" data-end="1617">Another welcome change is the switch from Lightning to USB-C for charging. This aligns the AirPods Pro 3 with Apple’s 2025 product lineup and simplifies the charging process for users with other USB-C devices. Of course, the case still supports Qi wireless charging, so if you already have wireless charging pads at home, you can continue using them without any issues.</p>


<h2 data-start="1254" data-end="1617">Smart Features</h2>
<p>The features of other Apple products seem to be leaking their way across product lines. Much like an Apple Watch,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4214/"> the AirPods Pro 3</a> are now capable of heart rate sensing. Track your heart rate and calories burned for up to 50 different workouts. You can access the data tracked via your iPhone.</p>
<p data-start="1619" data-end="1988">The AirPods Pro 3 now support live translation. With the help of Apple Intelligence, you can communicate with someone across languages — having your AirPods translate to your native tongue in real-time, right in your ear. Ever read <em>The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em>. We now have real-world babel fish.</p>
<p data-start="2499" data-end="2884">While the AirPods Pro 3 aren’t exactly a budget buy, they are the most refined version of Apple’s flagship earbuds to date. You get enhanced sound quality, noise cancellation, and thoughtful design improvements. If you’ve been considering a pair, now’s the time to take advantage of the discount before the holiday rush. Own them for just $220 for a limited time.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-sells-15-6-portable-monitor-for-peanuts-fhd-screen-works-with-switch-and-laptop-2000648886</link>
            <guid>1368520</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Small screens on laptops or handheld consoles (like the Switch) are fine for most things but they can be hard to see when you’re trying to find enemies in competitive games or edit spreadsheets with small text that hurts your eyes. A portable monitor fixes this by giving you a full-sized screen wherever you need one.</p>
<p>The<em> Arzopa A1</em> has a <strong>15.6-inch Full HD screen and can connect to almost anything with USB-C or HDMI</strong> which makes it great for gaming, working or streaming. For Cyber Monday, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5746/">Amazon drops the price of this portable monitor from its usual $104 to $63</a> and this is the lowest price ever which it almost too cheap to pass up to buy a second screen.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5746/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>IPS Panel Quality in a Package That’s Easy to Take on Trips</h2>
<p>This monitor has a 15.6-inch IPS panel with a resolution of 1920×1080 and the text is clear and the colors are bright which makes spreadsheets and games look sharp. The<strong> IPS technology lets you see the screen from 178 degrees both horizontally and vertically</strong> so the picture stays the same even when you look at it from the side or from above. This is important when you’re sharing the screen with someone next to you or when you have to put the monitor at an angle because of lack of desk space.</p>



<p>The <strong>60Hz refresh rate</strong> works well for regular gaming and work tasks, but competitive gamers might notice a difference when playing fast-paced shooters on 120Hz or 144Hz monitors. <strong>Response time is about 5ms</strong> which is fine for casual games, RPGs and strategy games where clear visuals are more important than quick reactions. The 16:9 aspect ratio works with most laptop screens and gaming consoles so there are no black bars when you mirror displays or make your workspace bigger.</p>
<p>The <strong>built-in kickstand folds out from the metal back panel</strong> and locks into different positions which means you can use it on desks, tables or even your lap without needing a separate stand. This design saves space when you travel and gets rid of extra accessories you would have to pack. The m<strong>onitor is only 1.6 pounds and 0.35 inches thick at its thinnest point</strong> so it fits easily into laptop bags or backpacks with your other gear.</p>



<p><strong>USB-C ports</strong> that can handle both video and power from compatible laptops are part of the connectivity which means that everything can be connected with just one cable, so you don’t need a separate power adapter. The <strong>mini-HDMI port</strong> can take signals from gaming consoles, desktop computers, cameras, or any other device with an HDMI output. If your laptop can’t provide enough power, the monitor can get power from a separate USB-C power adapter or through USB-C from your laptop.</p>
<p>The package comes with the monitor,<strong> a USB-C to USB-C cable, a USB-C to USB-A cable, a mini-HDMI to HDMI cable, and a case that protects the monitor</strong> and acts as a screen cover while it’s being moved. It only takes a few seconds to set up because all you have to do is plug in the right cable and the display turns on by itself.</p>
<p>If you buy this portable monitor for $63 instead of $104, you’ll get a price that beats most basic external displays while still keeping Full HD resolution and IPS quality. For less than the cost of budget monitors that don’t have portability features, you get a real portable second screen with a built-in stand, multiple ways to connect, and compatibility with a wide range of devices.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-drops-the-new-fire-tv-soundbar-plus-to-an-all-time-low-losing-all-margin-to-rival-jbl-and-bose-2000648813</link>
            <guid>1368517</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cyber Monday deals are rolling in. Most of these are Black Friday discounts being carried into the weekend, so if you missed grabbing something during the sale, there’s still a chance to bag it for less.</p>
<p>While several retailers are offering plenty of discounts, Amazon is being the most generous right now. It’s offering up to 50% off its own devices, taking hundreds off security cameras, smart displays, streaming sticks, Kindles, and more. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">Those looking to give their entertainment setup an upgrade this holiday season should consider nabbing the latest Fire TV Soundbar Plus while it’s going at a 40% discount</a>. This brings the price down to just $150. You’re saving a massive $100 on an audio solution that’s going to make it easy to hear dialogues clearly, plus enjoy your favorite tunes to the fullest. Even better, both Prime and non-Prime members will enjoy free delivery on their purchase, which adds even more value to the offer.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Audio Modes</h2>
<p>Design-wise, it’s pretty similar to the older Fire TV soundbars. It sits nicely on your TV console without drawing too much attention to itself, and can even be mounted on a wall for a clean, tidy setup. But despite the compact frame, it does not compromise on the sound. Three full-range speakers, three tweeters, and two woofers push audio in all directions. Pair that with Dolby Atmos and DTS:X, and you’ll enjoy a 3D, room-filling experience that pulls you in, making you feel like you’re a part of whatever is playing on the screen. Sound mimics real life; the Battle of Pelennor Fields from The Lord of the Rings plays out as if it’s happening right in your living room. Watching a scary movie? Footsteps and whispers are going to feel like they’re coming from behind, making the whole thing even spookier.</p>
<p>The Dialogue Enhancer works overtime to keep the conversations sharp by actively pushing voices above background sounds, even with low volume. You won’t have to constantly rewind just to hear what was said. You can also choose between multiple audio modes that optimize the sound based on what’s playing. These include Movie, Music, Sports, and Night modes. The night mode for instance, delivers balanced audio that won’t wake the entire home up, while the music mode gives bass a boost. Speaking of music, you can even use the soundbar as a speaker by connecting it to your smartphone or tablet via Bluetooth and streaming your favorite tracks.</p>



<p>Setting everything up and getting started couldn’t be simpler. Plug your soundbar’s HDMI cable into your TV’s eARC/ARC port, and power the TV on with your remote. The audio will instantly change from your TV to the soundbar; simple as that. As for the compatibility, it plays nicely with just about any smart TV, plus the screens connected to streaming media players.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4053/">There’s a lot more to like about this soundbar, especially now that it’s going at a $100 discount.</a> This deal lets you grab it for just $150, which is basically nothing for all that it’s packed with. It’s an early Cyber Monday deal, but keeping past trends in mind, we’re expecting it to expire soon. If you’ve been after a reliable audio solution, today is the day to make the move. You’re also going to enjoy free delivery if you place your orders before Dec. 4.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ASUS Dual NVIDIA RTX 3050 Gaming Graphics Card Returns at an All-Time Low After Selling Out on Black Friday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/asus-dual-nvidia-rtx-3050-gaming-graphics-card-returns-at-an-all-time-low-after-selling-out-on-black-friday-2000647705</link>
            <guid>1368505</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>PC gamers and computer DIYers alike are going to love this Cyber Monday deal at Amazon after Black Friday — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6105/">the ASUS Dual GeForce RTX 3050 is a gaming graphics card that’s capable of upgrading an older gaming rig or being the visual nerve center of a self-built one, and it’s just $160 after a 20% off deal</a>. That’s a great price for a major upgrade on an older computer, and definitely a more economical choice than buying an entirely new machine.</p>
<p>The RTX 3050 is compatible with PC towers, not laptops. It connects to the PC’s motherboard to drive the computer’s graphic performance. It’s an exceptional mid-range gaming graphics card with 6GB of GDDR6 VRAM, PCIe 4.0 support, HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4a ports, and a compact dual-slot build that allows it to also fit into the more-slender desktop PCs. It’s power- and heat efficient so you don’t need the large tower or big cooling setup to prevent it from overheating.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6105/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Reliable HD Gaming</h2>
<p>Installation of the RTX 3050 could not be easier — open the tower, find the motherboard, and either add the card in an empty graphics slot or replace the existing one. Once up and running, your PC will be fully capable of 1080p gaming, which is great for shooters, indie games, and eSports games thanks to the high frame rate and stable performance. It’s not a 4K gaming machine, but it’s plenty of HD power for an exceptional price.</p>
<p>The HDMI 2.1 hookup and fast refresh rate give you the further option of hooking up your upgraded PC to a faster monitor or TV. And as a new card, the firmware updates and the driver support will be better. Since every piece of a tech setup has a finite life before it reaches obsolescence — the point where the manufacturer no longer provides updates or support, and games are no longer compatible — a brand-new graphics card will push that deadline further down the road, thus extending the lifespan of your entire PC for a small price.</p>



<h2>Upgrade or Build</h2>
<p>Swapping out a graphics card to upgrade and extend the life of a PC is rewarding, but building one either from scratch or from the bones of an old dead tower is&nbsp;<em>fun</em>. But the cost does add up when you’re shopping for all of the components — motherboard, internal storage, RAM, and five or six things you didn’t know you needed until you tried to boot up. An inexpensive graphics card is a key component of a DIY build or rebuild, and the performance you get from the GeForce RTX 3050 for its original $200 price earned it an average 4.6-star rating from Amazon reviewers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6105/">Now with this Cyber Monday deal that drops 20% off the price, the RTX 3050 vastly overperforms on its new $160 price</a>. Hit Amazon now before this Cyber Monday gamer deal ends.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/playstation-vr2-goes-zero-profit-for-cyber-monday-ps5-owners-get-premium-vr-for-budget-headset-money-2000648879</link>
            <guid>1368502</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday is over but Cyber Monday keeps the excitement going by lowering prices even more on gaming hardware at Amazon. The <strong>PlayStation VR2</strong> is a next-level virtual reality headset that feels completely different from smartphone VR headsets and if you have a PS5 and want to get deeper into immersive gaming, this is the headset for you.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5779/">this bundle is only $299, down from the usual $399 and it comes with Horizon Call of the Mountain</a>, so you can start playing a full AAA VR adventure as soon as you open it. This bundle is at its lowest price ever on Amazon for Cyber Monday.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5779/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>OLED Screens and Eye Tracking</h2>
<p>The <strong>PSVR2 has two OLED panels that give each eye a resolution of 2000×2040</strong>&nbsp;which is 4K total resolution. This gets rid of the screen-door effect that older VR headsets had, where you could see individual pixels. The <strong>110-degree field of view</strong> gives you peripheral vision that is similar to real life, so virtual environments feel truly big instead of like you’re looking through binoculars. With <strong>HDR support</strong>, deep blacks and bright highlights stand out and gives images more depth. The 90Hz or 120Hz refresh rate options make fast gameplay smooth which helps with motion sickness and makes head movements feel natural instead of laggy.</p>



<p>The <strong>PSVR2’s best feature is eye tracking</strong> which lets the headset see where you’re looking and use that information in many different ways. Foveated rendering uses the graphics processing power to focus on what you’re looking at directly and lower the detail in your peripheral vision, and it makes things run faster without you noticing any quality loss. Some games use eye tracking to help you aim in shooters, make eye contact with NPCs in story-driven games, or start events based on where your gaze stays.</p>
<p>When there are explosions, impacts, or weather effects like rain, <strong>haptic feedback vibrates through the headset itself</strong> and adds a physical element that regular VR doesn’t have. The <strong>adaptive triggers on the included Sense controllers push back against your finger pressure</strong> in a way that makes drawing a bowstring feel tense or pulling the trigger on a gun feel real. Inside-out tracking uses four cameras built into the headset to keep an eye on the controllers and your play area and you don’t need any sensors mounted around your room.</p>



<p><em>Horizon Call of the Mountain</em> shows off what PSVR2 can do with a VR adventure set in the Horizon universe: It has climbing mechanics that use hand-over-hand motion, archery that requires real aiming and drawing and beautiful views that show off the graphics quality. The game was made specifically for VR instead of being a port of a flat-screen game which means that every interaction uses the headset’s eye tracking and haptic features.</p>
<p>For $299 instead of $399, you can get the PSVR2 with Horizon Call of the Mountain which makes high-end VR available at a price that used to only get you entry-level standalone headsets. For $100 less, you get Sony’s best VR technology, including eye tracking, haptic feedback, and 4K OLED visuals – plus, you get a full AAA game that would cost $60 on its own.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Forget Nintendo, Sony Goes No-Margin on the PlayStation Portal Remote Player as It Hits an All-Time Low After Black Friday]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-nintendo-sony-goes-no-margin-on-the-playstation-portal-remote-player-as-it-hits-an-all-time-low-after-black-friday-2000648779</link>
            <guid>1368496</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Handheld gaming consoles have come through in a big way this past decade. The Nintendo Switch paved the way for the other big players in the gaming space to rethink what it means to be able to game while on the go. We’ve since seen the advent of the Steam Deck—Valve’s PC gaming handheld—along with some other third parties throwing their hats in the race with the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6104/">PlayStation has its own take on the format with the PlayStation Portal Remote Player for PS5. Amazon happens to have it discounted for Black Friday and Cyber Monday.</a> The 11% savings equates to the handheld system dropping from $200 to just $179 for a limited time. You end up saving $21.</p>
<p>On the surface, the PlayStation Portal Remote Player looks like if you hacked up a PS5 DualSense controller and stuck the pieces to the side of your Nintendo Switch. That’s not a bad thing. The PS5 controller is comfortable to use, and having the handheld mimic it almost exactly allows for a more seamless experience when playing games between your PlayStation 5 console and your PlayStation Portal Remote Player. The handheld is capable of playing games at up to 60fps, displaying in a resolution of 1080p. Choose between either the white version or the midnight black model.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6104/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Where the PlayStation Portal Remote Player differs from the other gaming handhelds is its not a standalone unit. The Portal doe not let you play games directly on the unit itself. the games you play are either streamed from the cloud or streamed from your home PlayStation 5 console. So in that sense, it’s more akin to the Wii U gamepad as opposed to the Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Remote Play let’s you play compatible games you have installed on your PS5 console, be they PlayStation 5 games or PlayStation 4 games. This makes the PlayStation Portal Remote Player a great accessory for families who share the TV room. Are you a dad, trying to catch up on&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us: Part II: Remastered</em> before the new HBO season comes back? You can sit and enjoy the game on your PlayStation Portal Remote Player with some headphones while your kid enjoys Ms. Rachel on the TV.</p>



<h2>Better With PlayStation Plus</h2>
<p>With PlayStation Plus, you gain access to an expansive catalogue of digital games—a good chunk of which are Cloud Streaming compatible.</p>
<p>The Game Catalogue is filled with newly released titles that you will have access to play with a monthly subscription. It’s Netflix applied to video games. Dive into games like&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> and&nbsp;<em>God of War: Ragnarök</em>. You also gain access to the Classics Catalogue where you can explore all the PlayStation games of yesteryear. You can play through the entire original God of War trilogy before stepping into the two latest games that came with 2016’s soft-reboot of the series.</p>

              <p>Samsung’s 83-inch S85F TV proves that OLED screens have finally gotten big enough to turn your living room into a real home theater. This 2025 model packs 20 neural networks that upscale everything to stunning 4K clarity and the OLED panel delivers deep blacks and vivid colors that LCD technology can’t match. The good news is that Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6101/">just slashed the price to $2,497 for Cyber Monday weekend, down from the original $4,297 sticker</a>, which marks <strong>an all-time low for an 83-inch OLED with this level of AI processing power</strong>.</p>

<h2>AI Processing Works While You Watch</h2>
<p>The <strong>NQ4 AI Gen2 processor has 20 specialized neural networks</strong> that each work on a different part of image quality, such as sharpness, color accuracy, motion handling, and brightness optimization. These networks look at each frame in real time and find objects, faces, and scenes so they can make specific improvements instead of blanket processing that can make some content look too sharp or too bright.</p>
<p>When you stream a show that was made in 1080p or lower,<strong> the AI upscaling doesn’t just stretch the picture to fit the 4K panel</strong> but it also fills in missing details by guessing what should be there based on patterns it sees. This means that older movies and TV shows become clearer and more defined, so they can be watched on an 83-inch screen without looking pixelated or soft around the edges.</p>
<p>Samsung’s Vision AI goes even further by <strong>automatically changing settings based on the type of content you’re watching</strong>: Sports get better motion smoothing to keep fast camera pans clear, while movies get a different kind of treatment that keeps the cinematic feel with the right color grading and motion handling. You never have to go into settings menus or change picture modes by hand because the processor makes these changes automatically as scenes change in the same piece of content.</p>



<p>The<strong> OLED HDR feature makes contrast that LCD panels can’t match</strong> because each pixel makes its own light instead of using a backlight that bleeds into dark areas. When a scene goes from a bright outdoor shot to a dark interior shot, you can see true blacks in the shadows and highlights that stay bright without washing out the whole frame. This self-emissive technology lets you sit at wider angles without changing the color or lowering the contrast.</p>
<p>When you watch nature documentaries, cooking shows, or anything else where accurate color reproduction changes how you see the picture, Pantone validation makes sure that the colors match real-world references. Instead of looking too pink or orange like some TVs that value bright colors over accuracy, skin tones look natural in different lighting and ethnic groups. This validation process checks the display output against Pantone’s color standards.</p>



<p><em>Object Tracking Sound Lite</em> makes <strong>sounds that move across the screen to match where the action is happening</strong> in the frame: This makes the game feel more real, even if you’re using the built-in speakers instead of a surround sound system. The sound moves with the car as it drives from left to right instead of staying in the center channel and it helps your brain naturally connect visual and audio cues. <strong>Alexa integration lets you control the TV</strong>, look for content, and manage smart home devices without having to get up from your chair.</p>
<p>Right now, you can save $1,800 off the regular price of $2,497, and you get the <strong>newest model from 2025 with better AI processing</strong> that older models don’t have. This Cyber Monday deal is great for anyone who wants to improve their home theater and the huge screen, self-lit OLED pixels, and neural network upscaling work&nbsp; make streaming services, gaming, and regular TV watching feel like high-quality entertainment that is worth the money.</p>

              <p>Samsung’s goal with their AI-powered earbuds was to make them understand how you listen instead of making you change how you listen – and they did this before Apple even announced that the AirPods Pro 3 would have similar features. The <strong>Galaxy Buds 3 Pro has adaptive intelligence</strong> that automatically changes based on your surroundings and makes them smarter than anything else you have in your ears right now.</p>
<p>The good news is that Amazon has <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">lowered the price of these silver earbuds from $249 to just $159 for Cyber Monday weekend</a>. This is the lowest price ever for Samsung’s best wireless earbuds. Since Apple’s latest model doesn’t beat these on any important spec, this deal is even better for anyone who wants high-quality sound without the high price.</p>

<h2>AI That Hears What You Say</h2>
<p>Samsung made these earbuds with Galaxy AI technology which does the hard work for you so you don’t have to think about it. The adaptive active noise cancellation <strong>always keeps an eye on your surroundings and changes itself on the fly</strong>, so you don’t have to mess with settings when you go from a quiet office to a busy street. This means that when the earbuds sense that the environment is louder, they automatically turn up the noise cancellation. And when you need to hear conversations or announcements around you, they turn it down.</p>
<p>The adaptive equalizer goes even further by looking at how the buds fit in your ear and changing the sound profile to fit: Everyone’s ears are different, so the same earbuds can sound very different to different people.</p>



<p>The new fit fixes one of the biggest problems people had with older Galaxy Buds models: they were uncomfortable to wear for a long time. Samsung changed the design of these Buds 3 Pro to a canal style and the stems are shaped like blades which helps with <strong>stability and keeps the weight evenly distributed</strong>. When you use the stems, they light up with a soft glow. This looks cool and also makes them easier to find when you put them down in low light.</p>
<p>The Real-Time Interpreter feature turns these earbuds into a t<strong>ravel buddy that helps you talk to people in person</strong> who don’t speak the same language. When you turn on this feature, the person speaking Spanish hears their language through the phone speaker, and you hear the English translation directly in your ears. This makes the conversation flow smoothly without both people having to huddle around a screen.</p>



<p>The <strong>sound quality is good because there are two amplifiers and planar tweeters</strong> that handle high frequencies well and keep distortion low even when the volume is high. The dedicated high and low frequency channels keep bass and treble processing separate. This keeps tracks with a lot of instruments in different frequency ranges from getting muddy. You can hear this separation best in orchestral music or thick electronic music, where cheaper earbuds tend to make everything sound like a wall of sound.</p>
<p>At $159, you’re getting Samsung’s best earbuds for $90 less than their normal price: This puts them in the same price range as mid-range options that don’t have any AI features. The <strong>two-year Amazon-only warranty</strong> gives you twice the coverage you would normally get.</p>

              <p>Permanent outdoor lighting systems get rid of the yearly hassle of putting up and taking down disposable holiday lights every winter, then storing the tangled strands that always stop working the next year. Govee’s permanent outdoor lights “Pro” stay up all year on your roofline or eaves and you can change the color scheme for holidays, seasons, or everyday accent lighting with just a few taps in an app.</p>
<p>Installation is surprisingly easy because the clips have adhesive backs that attach each light in about eight seconds: This gets rid of the ladder gymnastics and frustration that make hanging lights the most hated chore. Normally, this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/">200-foot kit with 120 RGBIC LED lights costs $759 but Amazon is currently offering it for just $459, which is the lowest price ever</a>. This deal started on Black Friday and will last through Cyber Monday weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>RGBWWIC Technology Gives You Real Color Flexibility</h2>
<p>The RGBWWIC label means that <strong>each bulb has six separate LED chips: red, green, blue, warm white, cool white</strong>&nbsp;and an integrated circuit control that lets you control each light separately. This wider range of colors goes beyond basic RGB systems that have trouble getting whites right. It gives you bright, saturated colors for parties and holidays, as well as natural warm and cool whites that are good for everyday outdoor lighting.</p>
<p>The <strong>warm white mode at 2700K makes the room feel cozy</strong>, like old-fashioned Edison bulbs. The <strong>cool white mode at 6500K</strong>, on the other hand, gives off bright light that is great for security or task lighting around doorways and walkways.<strong> Each light can give off up to 50 lumens</strong>&nbsp;which is bright enough to light up the outside of your home instead of just adding decorative touches that get lost in street lighting.</p>
<p>The anti-glare lens design makes the light into a triangular beam pattern that cuts down on harsh glare while still letting people on the street and in nearby homes see it. This optical engineering stops the raw LED bulbs from blinding people when they look directly at them, making the display more pleasant for you and anyone who walks by your house. The<strong> 75 pre-programmed scene modes</strong> have animated effects like color waves, twinkling patterns, and gradient transitions that move across the whole 200-foot run.</p>



<p>The Govee Home app lets you control each LED individually so you can change the colors of different parts of your roofline to make patterns, text, or images on the outside of your home. You could show off the colors of your favorite sports team, write messages for special occasions, or make patterns of the American flag for patriotic holidays without having to buy different light strings.</p>
<p>The <strong>lights and power adapter both have an IP67 waterproof rating</strong>&nbsp;which means that they can be submerged in water up to 1 meter deep without being damaged. This makes them very safe from rain, snow, and sprinkler overspray. The <strong>IP65</strong> control box doesn’t protect as well but it can still handle heavy rain and dust without any problems. <strong>Govee says these lights will last for 50,000 hours</strong> which is more than 5 years of continuous use or decades of normal seasonal use.</p>



<p>To install, use the included VHB (Very High Bond) adhesive and clips to attach the lights 2 to 4 inches away from the wall or soffit. Each clip snaps onto the light housing and sticks to the outside of your house. This keeps the bulb at the right angle and distance for the best light distribution. The system comes in 16.4-foot sections that connect with waterproof joints. This lets you go around corners, over different rooflines, or skip parts where things like chimneys get in the way.</p>
<p>This Cyber Monday price of $459 instead of $759 makes permanent outdoor lighting cost less than many homeowners spend on disposable lights over just a few years, while delivering capabilities that temporary strands can’t approach.</p>
