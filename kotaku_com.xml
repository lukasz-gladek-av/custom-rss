              <p>I need <em>Marathon</em> vs.<em> Arc Raiders</em> to be the <em>Battlefield</em> vs. <em>Call of Duty</em> of 2026. But which is which? There’s no standalone <em>Zombies Call of Duty</em> game, Activision claims. And another notable March release gets delayed to April. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture.</p> <p>I think it’s time for every gaming CEO to put their gamer cred on the line. The head of Nightdive Studios has played <a href="https://x.com/pripyatbeast/status/2025968715289027064">over 8,500 hours</a> of <em>Dota 2</em>. Anyone willing to come out and admit to beating that? I’ve only got about 2,000 hours in <em>Dota 2</em> and I regret every one of them. But would I do it all over again if given the chance? Also yes.</p>

 <h2><em>Arc Raiders</em> gets defensive about anti-cheat</h2> <p>Yesterday, Bungie’s imminent shooter&nbsp;<em>Marathon</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-is-already-improving-on-arc-raiders-in-one-key-area-2000672901">outlined a zero-tolerance policy for cheating</a>, unlike <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ escalating three-strike rule. In today’s patch notes for its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPaKRV76Tlc">Shrouded Sky update</a>, the current extraction shooter king tried to explain its recent struggles with exploits. “When we shared our last update about tackling unfair play, we didn’t fully convey the complexity and scale of what goes into cheat detection,” the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/shrouded-sky-patch-notes-1-17-0">development team wrote</a>. “Our defenses operate on multiple levels: some checks are simple and definitive, while others are behavioral and data-driven and evolve over time.”</p> <p>The note went on to try to expand on that complexity and scale. <em>Arc Raiders</em> leverages “broad gameplay telemetry and machine learning techniques” to detect malicious behavior. But these systems are hard to develop and don’t offer “instant certainty” for quick bans the way “blunt software detections” do. Embark Studios says that this is why most of its bans operate on what I might call a cold, warm, hot scale.</p>

 <p>“Strong detections will receive permanent bans right off the bat, while others will receive a temporary suspension and a single chance to correct the behavior,” read the patch notes. But don’t worry! <em>Arc Raiders</em> is “tightening our rules and stepping up enforcement” so that “serious infractions now carry stricter consequences.”&nbsp;A dedicated anti-cheat team is working “tirelessly to keep the game fair.”</p>

 <p>Players will judge for themselves if one extraction shooter feels like it has fewer exploits and instant-kills. It’s nice to see some competition though. Like with <em>Battlefield 6</em> and<em> Black Ops 7</em>, a friendly rivalry forces everyone to up their game.</p> <h2>Activision shuts down standalone <em>Zombies</em> game rumors</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The rumor factory working overtime.

The official <em>Call of Duty</em> account responded by vaguely denying the claims. “The rumor factory working overtime,” it <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/2026038116364992596">wrote</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/this-aint-it-activision-issues-rare-denial-of-standalone-call-of-duty-zombies-report"><em>IGN</em></a>). “This ain’t it.”</p>

 <h2>The studio that made <em>Prototype</em> is back</h2> <p>All some gamers want is a remake of the 2009 action-adventure sandbox <em>Prototype</em>. Well, the developer behind it, Radical Entertainment, has reformed as New Radical Games according to the <a href="https://www.newradical.ca/">studio’s updated website</a>. Microsoft currently owns the IP, so never say never, though I’m not sure going back to the well of a series that ushered in the studio’s closure is a smart move in the ultracompetitive landscape of 2026. Still, bringing back <em>Prototype 3</em>, canceled before Radical became a support studio for <em>Destiny</em>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoBestFriendsPlay/comments/1rcru49/comment/o70k5fc/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">would be sick</a>.</p> <h2><em>Mouse: P.I. for Hire</em> slips to April</h2> <p>Originally set to release on March 19, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-recap-xbox-october-showcase-game-pass-fbc-1851675394/6">1930s-style animated noir shooter</a> will arrive on April 16 instead. “As we approach the final stages of development, we want to ensure we are taking the extra time and care needed to make <em>Mouse: P.I.

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel’s Wolverine Reveals Fall Release Date With Plenty Of Distance From GTA 6]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/wolverine-ps5-release-date-insomniac-sony-2000673283</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Another one of Sony’s 2026 PlayStation 5 exclusives has a release date. Insomniac Games revealed that <em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em> will arrive on September 15. That gives the console’s tentpole first-party release plenty of buffer room, with <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> coming two months later.</p> <p>“Let’s cut to the chase: <em>Marvel’s Wolverine</em> launches September 15, 2026,” the studio <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/insomniac.games/post/3mfmnbgtbbg2x">wrote on social media</a> on Tuesday. The unexpected timing of the release date announcement comes just a couple of weeks after the last PlayStation State of Play showcase in which Wolverine was notably absent.</p>

 <p>As Sony’s first-party pipeline has slowed during the PS5 generation, we’ve been getting about two big single-player PlayStation Studios exclusives a year. 2026 sees <em>Marathon</em> arrive in March followed by <em>Saros</em> in May. <em>Wolverine</em>‘s September release date puts it a month before Sony’s other fall console exclusive, <em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em>.</p> <p><em>Wolverine</em> getting a date this early suggests companies are taking Rockstar Games’ renewed commitment to launch<em> GTA 6</em> on November 19 seriously. With two of this fall’s biggest blockbusters now locked in on the calendar, other companies can start slotting in their release dates. Other big games like <em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>, <em>Control: Resonant</em>, and <em>Fable</em> are all still currently TBD.</p>
