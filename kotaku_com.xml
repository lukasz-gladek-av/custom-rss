              <p>Black Friday is a great time to stock up on essentials, plus treat yourself to purchases that are a little hard to justify during the rest of the year. We’re spotting hundreds of discounts across almost every single category you could think of, including games. Titles have dropped in prices, and so have the consoles.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to surprise your little ones with something that gets them moving in your living room, we might have just found the best gaming deal of the season. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6060/">Nex Playground — a cube-like console — is currently sitting at $199 on Amazon, after a 20% discount on its close to $250 price tag</a>. You’ll also get $25 back in Amazon credit with your purchase, which brings the total down even further. Note that both discounts are only valid till supplies last, and that might not be long. To avoid any last-minute disappointments, it’s best to get your orders in fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6060/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Interactive Motion Games</h2>
<p>Nex Playground looks quite like a mini projector, but in a fun way. It connects to your TV and lets you play interactive motion games using just your body. There are no controllers needed, as the built-in wide-angle camera uses AI to scan your movements to register them in games on its own.</p>
<p>Multiplayer setup is supported. Up to four people can hop in at the same time to get some workout in. Five games are packed for free, including Fruit Ninja, Starri, Whac-a-Mole, Go Keeper, and Party Fowl; showcase your chopping skills with the fast movement of arms, or put that adrenaline to good use by nailing down as many moles as you can. For a bit more variety, you can purchase a 3-Month or 12-Month Play Pass, both of which cost $49 and $89, respectively. These get you instant access to a full catalog of games, plus enjoy new games each month. Games include Barbie, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, How to Train Your Dragon, Peppa Pig, Care Bears, Elmo, Miraculous Ladybug, Gabby’s Dollhouse, Kung Fu Panda, and more, so there’s going to be something for everyone. It encourages kids to move around, and is perfect for playdates or family game nights. Honestly, we won’t judge if you want to get a solo session in after putting the little ones to sleep. It’s also appropriate for kids of all ages, since it doesn’t support ads or in-app purchases. They can play their favorite games without needing you around!</p>



<p>Getting started couldn’t be simpler. Nex Playground connects to your TV using a single HDMI cable. Plug the power supply cord into the console and then plug the adapter into an outlet. Switch the thing on, and manage it using your TV remote; simple as that.</p>
<p>All things considered, this console offers a fun way to get your family moving together. Your living room is going to turn into a mini playground (or a battlefield) without a console or tons of other accessories. Just connect it to your TV, and get the party started. You’re getting five games included for free, but will need to purchase the Play Pass to unlock more.&nbsp;<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6060/">The current Black Friday deal drops the price down to $199, letting you save a nice $50 on it. Additionally, you can get $25 back in Amazon credit, which brings the price down even further.</a> Just note that the promotional credit is added automatically to your account 30 days after shipment, so you might not be able to access it right away.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-goes-more-aggressive-than-apple-as-surface-pro-2-in-1-drops-to-a-budget-pc-low-2000648444</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="65" data-end="603">This Black Friday,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6058/"> the Microsoft Surface Pro has seen a massive 36% price drop, now available for just $900 (down from its original price of $1,400)</a>. You end up saving a whole $500. This sleek, versatile device blends the functionality of a laptop with the convenience of a tablet, making it a great choice for both professionals and creatives alike. Whether you’re looking for a portable option for work or a device just for entertainment and casual web browsing, the Surface Pro is worth considering—especially with this Black Friday discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6058/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="605" data-end="630">Stunning OLED Display</h2>
<p data-start="632" data-end="1208">The 13-inch OLED touchscreen delivers stunning visuals with deep, rich blacks and vibrant colors, making it ideal for both productivity tasks and entertainment. Doesn’t matter if you’re editing photos, streaming a new TV show, or putting together a presentation, the OLED panel ensures that every detail pops with crisp clarity. Unlike standard LCD screens, OLED technology offers better contrast and more vivid colors. The blacks look like real black, not that weird dark blue you get on LCDs.</p>
<p data-start="1210" data-end="1621">With 120Hz refresh rates, you can scroll through web pages, flip through apps, and interact with media without any lag. This makes the Surface Pro ideal for tasks that require precision, such as graphic design or video editing, as well as for casual activities like gaming or watching movies.</p>
<p data-start="1210" data-end="1621">You can connect to additional displays using either of the two (or both) USB-C ports. These can allow for up to 4K resolutions with refresh rates of up to 60Hz.</p>


<h2 data-start="1623" data-end="1650">Impressive Battery Life</h2>
<p data-start="1652" data-end="2208">The Surface Pro offers up to 14 hours of life on a single charge, depending on your specific usage patterns. This long-lasting battery is perfect for on-the-go professionals, students, or travelers who don’t want to be tied down to an outlet. It offers fast and flexible charging of 65W. You can charge the Surface Pro over either its Surface Connect port or simply using is USB-C port.</p>
<p data-start="2497" data-end="2963">Under the hood, the Surface Pro is powered by the Snapdragon X Elite 12-core processor, which offers both efficiency and power for multitasking and demanding applications. It’s good for bouncing between multiple tabs, editing videos, or working with any other kind of resource-heavy software. This chip along with the 16GB of RAM ensures that your device won’t slow down. This Surface Pro ends up clocking in even faster than the MacBook Air powered by the M3 chip. The device is also equipped with up 256GB of solid-state storage, giving you a decent amount of space to store files.</p>
<p data-start="2497" data-end="2963">As most new products in the last couple years, Microsoft is toting how this combination laptop and tablet is built for the AI era. It comes equipped with Copilot_ which can be used to help with searching through documents, drafting emails, creating images and more. That’s all optional, of course.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Kindle Paperwhite Drops to Record Low, E-Reader Now Cheaper Than Buying a Few Physical Books]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/kindle-paperwhite-drops-to-record-low-e-reader-now-cheaper-than-buying-a-few-physical-books-2000648434</link>
            <guid>1367629</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Kindle e-readers have evolved into reading experiences that rival physical books through <strong>e-ink displays mimicking printed paper and provides instant access to over 15 million titles that would fill entire libraries</strong>. The convenience proves transformative through lightweight portability replacing heavy books in bags, immediate downloads eliminating bookstore trips, and adjustable lighting enabling reading anywhere regardless of ambient conditions.</p>
<p>The newest <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6054/">Kindle Paperwhite with 16GB storage (and ads) costs $124 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $159</a>, and hits a record-low price where Amazon removes profit margins completely on their own hardware. The ad-supported version saves money through occasional lock-screen advertisements, though <strong>spending an extra $20 for the ad-free model proves worthwhile</strong> if promotional content bothers you.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6054/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>The fastest page turns that are like real books</h2>
<p>The next-generation processor makes <strong>page turns 25% faster than older Paperwhite models</strong>: This gets rid of the short lag that made earlier e-readers feel slow compared to flipping through real pages. The speed boost is especially noticeable in scenes with a lot of dialogue or action, where quick page turning keeps the story moving instead of making fake pauses that break the immersion.</p>



<p>The <strong>7-inch glare-free screen gives you a lot of reading space</strong> in a small package: It can fit more text on the screen while still being portable which is something that bigger tablets give up. The anti-glare coating makes it possible to read in direct sunlight where phone and tablet screens wash out completely which means that you can read at the beach, in an outdoor cafe, or at a sunny window seat without having to squint or move around like you would with reflective screens.</p>
<p>The <strong>adjustable color temperature changes from bright white light for reading during the day to warm amber tones for reading at night</strong>: This lowers blue light exposure, which can affect sleep quality. The warm light lets you read before bed without the blue light that phone and tablet screens give off, which keeps your natural sleep patterns going instead of messing them up.</p>



<p>The<strong> IPX8 waterproof rating</strong> means that the device can be submerged in water for up to two meters for 60 minutes. This means you can read by the pool, relax in the bathtub, or spend time at the beach without worrying about your electronics getting wet. The device won’t break if it falls into a pool, gets splashed by waves, or gets rained on, so you don’t have to be as careful with it when it’s wet, like you do with most expensive electronics.</p>
<p>The <strong>battery lasts for 12 weeks on a single charge</strong> so you don’t have to charge your phone or tablet every night, which can make them feel like they need constant care. Read every day for months without needing to charge, take vacations without bringing chargers, or keep reading without worrying about the battery running out like you do with devices that need daily power. The USB-C charging makes it easier to charge when needed because it doesn’t need special cables like older Kindles did.</p>
<p>The<strong> 16GB of storage can hold thousands of books</strong> which is much more than what most readers read before they upgrade their devices. The storage is especially useful when traveling internationally, when buying books can be difficult.</p>
<p>If you’ve thought about getting an e-reader but were put off by the usual prices, this is the perfect time to make the switch from physical books.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Lenovo Idea Tab Hits an All-Time Low, Now the Cheapest Android Tablet With Pencil and Case Included]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/get-a-headstart-on-your-2025-holiday-tech-shopping-with-the-ai-powered-lenovo-idea-tab-2000636961</link>
            <guid>1367626</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The digital device in pretty much every student’s backpack doesn’t absolutely have to be an expensive laptop computer. The apps and tech that make digital note-taking, research, and AI-assisted writing and coursework has filtered down not just to high-end tablets, but also some of the more affordable models as well. That’s where the Lenovo Idea Tab sits — an 11-inch Android tablet armed with everything a student needs, including Lenovo AI Notes, but without the hefty price tag that comes with a laptop. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/">It’s on Black Friday sale right now at Amazon for just $180 (-25%).</a></p>
<p>Odds are the Lenovo Idea Tab is going to outperform most if not all other $180 tablets for academic and productivity purposes. It comes with the Lenovo Tab Pen and a folio case, both of which are almost always added expenses with tablets. Google’s Circle to Search feature is built in as well, along with Lenovo’s AI Notes.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Clear Picture</h2>
<p>The Lenovo Idea Tab comes with four apps that are tailor-made for academic performance: Squid, the powerful paper-replacing Android app for handwritten notes, PDF markups, and other tasks; MyScript Notes (formerly Nebo), a great freehand-sketching app; MyScript Calculator, which can solve your handwritten numerical equations; and Lenovo AI Note, which transforms your handwritten notes into AI-generated quizzes, and can also use AI to expand on your notes with greater insight.</p>
<p>Whether you’re working or playing, the 11-inch 2.5K screen on the Lenovo Idea Pad isn’t going to let you down. The MediaTek Dimensity 6300 octa-core processor ensures that the images on that screen come through smoothly, and the seemingly inexhaustible battery is good for up to 12 hours of video playback.</p>



<h2>All the Tablet, Without the Price</h2>
<p>Everything else you would ask of the tablets in the higher price brackets — fast internet, smooth streaming, quality built-in camera and Dolby Atmos quad speakers for video calls, and total portability (just 6.5 x 10 x 0.28 inches in size and 1.05 pounds in weight) — are here with the Lenovo Idea Pad, and don’t forget the included-in-price Lenovo Tab Pen and folio case.</p>
<p>The Lenovo Idea Pad might be considered to be an “entry-level” tablet by some, and to be fair, we wouldn’t throw it in the ring against the latest iPad Pro or Samsung Galaxy Tab S11 Ultra. But you’re certainly not getting anywhere near either of those heavyweights for $210, and the differences between them and the Lenovo Idea Pad probably don’t quantify the $1,000-plus price difference. Long story short, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6048/">you’re getting far more tablet than you would expect for $180 from the Lenovo Idea Pad, so this Amazon Black Friday deal is a solid thumbs-up.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/top-all-your-essentials-in-one-go-with-the-3-port-65w-anker-usb-c-charger-for-just-24-2000648212</link>
            <guid>1367599</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday has arrived in all its glory, slashing rates across a wide range of categories right, left, and center. We’re spotting tons of items hitting their lowest ever prices, and even some of the latest releases getting surprise discounts. It’s basically a great time to pick everything you’ve had your eyes on for less, whether it’s a MacBook, a pair of premium Bose headphones, or even an air fryer to finally start eating healthy.</p>
<p>If you rely on multiple devices to get through the day and are done dealing with cord clutter, a multiport charger is the way out. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6044/">Right now, you can snag the 3-port 65W Anker USB-C charger for $24, after a whopping 40% off its usual price of $40 at Amazon.</a> And as if that wasn’t enough, the retailer is also throwing in 2 free months of Audible with your purchase to sweeten the deal even more. Both Prime and non-Prime members can grab it, but subscribers will enjoy free shipping, so they’re saving a few bucks on that front, too.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6044/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>High-Speed Charging for All Your Devices</h2>
<p>This compact charger is roughly the size of an AirPods Pro case, and the plugs fold in for easy portability. The smooth, scratchproof surface handles everyday wear and tear well, making it easy to take it with you on the go without worry.</p>
<p>There are three ports (two USB-C and one USB-A) to charge up to three devices at the same time, whether it’s your smartphone, tablet, or even a laptop. 65W ultra-fast charging is enough to juice a 14-inch MacBook Pro to 50% in just 35 minutes, or a Google Pixelbook to about half in a little over 40. You’ll get maximum power when using a single port, but when multiple devices are plugged in, the charger automatically spreads the output intelligently. For instance, when topping three devices up at the same time, the top USB-C port can output 40W, while the second USB-C port and USB-A port can deliver 12W each. You can connect your power-hungry devices to a USB-C port, while other essentials to the rest.</p>



<p>Despite this power, the charger stays calm and cool while it works. GaN II technology makes for higher energy efficiency and upgraded heat dissipation in a compact frame that is around 53% smaller than your regular, everyday blocks. The box comes with the Anker 735 Charger, a welcome guide, and an 18-month warranty for some extra peace of mind.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6044/">To wrap it up, you’re saving a massive 40% or $16 on this compact, but powerful charger that’s easy to use and makes any workspace more efficient.</a> It plays nicely with a range of devices, so you can use it to top up your earbuds, smartwatches, smartphones, tablet, laptop, and even consoles.&nbsp;You’re also getting a free 60-day Audible trial on top of that, which typically costs $15 a month. Audible gets you access to a huge library of podcasts, audiobooks, and Audible Originals that include documentaries, comedy shows, and more. You can purchase titles, enjoy on-demand streaming, and even enjoy offline access to your favorites!</p>
<p>Both the offers, however, are expected to expire soon, so it’s best to get your orders in quickly. Once these are gone, there’s no guarantee they’ll be back. This is also a great time to grab other tech gadgets for less. We’re covering the top deals here at Kotaku, so don’t forget to check back for the latest drops and some exclusive offers.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-expensive-oled-tvs-4k-fire-tv-on-black-friday-sale-does-the-job-for-97-of-people-2000648430</link>
            <guid>1367569</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon sells Insignia-branded TVs despite the brand being owned by competitor Best Buy and creates the unusual situation where Amazon’s platform promotes a rival’s house brand.&nbsp;Several popular sizes including <strong>55-inch and 75-inch variants have already sold out</strong> completely, but remaining models like this 50-inch version offer exceptional value that doesn’t justify spending significantly more on competing brands.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5462/">55-inch TV costs $169 during Black Friday on Amazon, down from $299, and hits a record-low 43% discount</a> that makes 4K smart TVs cost less than many soundbars or streaming devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5462/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fire TV integration</h2>
<p>The <strong>4K Ultra HD resolution at 2160p has four times as many pixels as 1080p Full HD</strong>. This makes images sharper with text that is still readable, faces that show detail, and faraway objects that stay clear instead of becoming blurry copies. HDR10 support improves dynamic range by using metadata to adjust brightness and color on a scene-by-scene basis, and this lets you see more detail in shadows in dark scenes while keeping bright highlight information.</p>



<p>The wide color gamut shows more colors than standard dynamic range and makes images that are more colorful and realistic like what we see in real life, instead of the flat colors that SDR content has. The upscaling engine looks at content with lower resolution and smartly adds detail to make it look like 4K quality.</p>
<p>The <strong>60Hz refresh rate works well with regular TV and movie content</strong> because it has native frame rate support that stops the judder from happening on displays with different refresh rates. The refresh rate is good enough for almost all types of content, including streaming services, cable TV, and DVDs and Blu-rays, which never go above 60 frames per second.</p>
<p>You don’t need any extra streaming sticks or boxes to <strong>use the built-in Fire TV operating system to get to streaming services</strong> like Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, and thousands of other apps right away. The all-in-one design gets rid of the HDMI port, the need to switch between remotes, and the mess of cables that come with separate streaming devices.</p>



<p>With the <strong>smart home hub</strong>, you can watch camera feeds from compatible video doorbells and security cameras directly on the TV in picture-in-picture or full-screen mode. You can use voice commands to control Alexa-compatible lights, thermostats, and smart plugs through the TV remote. This makes it easier to manage your smart home without needing separate Echo devices or phone apps.</p>
<p>Insignia’s 50-inch 4K Fire TV is now the cheapest on Black Friday at $169: It <strong>costs less than many 32-inch TVs but has a much bigger screen and all the smart features you could want</strong>. This deal makes 4K smart TVs available at prices that have never been seen before so you can get big-screen entertainment without losing any of the important features.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/crucial-x10-1tb-ssd-now-costs-less-than-a-dime-per-gb-actually-only-0-08-while-black-friday-supplies-last-2000647763</link>

              <p>Cruising Amazon for the best Black Friday deals is a hunting expedition for those red digits next to the price — the negative numbers with the percentage sign that guide you to the biggest price drops. It was -13% that led us to the deal on the Crucial X10 1TB Portable SSD, but it was the Crucial name and the features of this awesome drive that led us to click “buy now.”</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6043/">The new $85 Black Friday price on the Crucial X10 is well worth jumping on.</a> The 1TB capacity of this model of the X10 is enough to serve as a secure backup for tens of thousands of irreplaceable files. It’s compatible with Windows, Mac, Android, and many gaming consoles. The Crucial X10 transfers data at a fast 2,100MB/s, and it has advanced dust, water, and drop resistance built in. Crucial might not have as recognizable a name as SanDisk or Samsung or some of the other big tech companies, but the reputation and the performance are impeccable.</p>

<h2>Tiny Yet Enormous</h2>
<p>When you click over to Amazon to check out the Crucial X10 the first thing you’ll notice is how much smaller it is than most other portable SSDs. Just 2.55 by 1.96 inches square and a truly remarkable 0.39 inches thick, it’s probably the most pocket-sized 4TB drive on the market. Even so, you don’t have to treat it with kid gloves — the Crucial X10 has IP65 dust and water resistance ratings, and drop resistance of nearly 10 feet.</p>
<p>With that kind of rugged construction combined with the 1TB capacity and outstanding speed of data transfer make the Crucial X10 a prime candidate for anything you would use a portable SSD for. Add 1TB of storage to your gaming console — it works with PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Xbox — and bring the extra games with you on the road. It’s a perfect Time Machine drive for automatic Mac backups, and as storage or transport for huge files like hi-res photo and video files, it’s a massive amount of space in a tiny package, and it can move the files back and forth to your editing station with great speed.</p>
<h2>Ditch the Thumb Drive</h2>
<p>Students, remote workers, and frequent business travelers have mostly relied on USB thumb drives for ferrying their files. They’re pocket-sized, plug-and-play, and inexpensive, so that tracks. But the Crucial X10? Pocket-sized, plug-and-play, and for a exceptionally fast, nearly universally compatible, massive-capacity drive, inexpensive. And unlike those thumb drives, the Crucial X10 can take a little bit of abuse, and isn’t going to glitch out on you like those cheap thumb drives. It’s a worthy investment in keeping your irreplaceable files safe and secure, especially during this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6043/">Amazon Black Friday sale with the fat 13% price drop that makes the Crucial X10 one of the best portable SSD buys of the day at just $230.</a></p>
