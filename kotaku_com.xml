              <p>Two of the biggest, most popular and most utterly enormous RPGs of the recent era are coming to Xbox Game Pass in the next few weeks. First, on February 19, the Complete Edition of <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em> arrives on Microsoft’s gaming subscription platform, followed by&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> on March 3. And that’s alongside a bunch of other games of note.</p> <p>February has already seen the arrival of a preview build of RTS <em>Menace&nbsp;</em>and the arrival of&nbsp;<em>Diablo II: Resurrected&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>High on Life 2</em> to Game Pass, which is hard to sniff at (until you remember that <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-hike-cod-2000632122">Microsoft increased the price</a> of the subscription from $20 to $30 a month last year). But the second half of the month is much more busy, starting today with the addition of&nbsp;<em>Aerial_Knight’s DropShot</em>, and Ubisoft’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisofts-avatar-game-is-so-much-better-than-fire-and-ash-2000659445">surprisingly great</a>&nbsp;<em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</em>. Additionally, Obsidian’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525">wonderful RPG</a>&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em> is brought down from Ultimate to Premium, to let more people in.</p>

 <p>Coming up in a couple of days is&nbsp;<em>Death Howl</em>, a deckbuilder that was already on PC Game Pass and is now spreading its spiritual wings to console, joined by last July’s <em>EA Sports College Football 26.</em> And then there’s the rather large matter of <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em>‘s return to Game Pass after leaving way back in 2021. This time the CD Projekt RPG is in its updated Complete Edition form. (It’s worth noting you <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sub/124923/">can grab the same from Steam</a> for just $10 right now.)</p> <p>Another game preview arrives Feb 24 with&nbsp;<em>TCG Card Shop Simulator</em>, which hopefully won’t include regular break-ins from which to recover. The next day, PC Game Pass gets dice-rolling roguelike <em>Dice a Million</em>, and the day after that, on Feb. 26, action-RPG <em>Towerborne</em> comes out of early access as a fully finished release.</p>

 <p>Jump to March 3 (presumably February is just too short of a month to cram it all in) and two more big names get squished in. First is <em>Final Fantasy III</em>, and then the headliner, <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>. Last year’s action-RPG from Warhorse was a smash hit, and despite the company’s CEO and director Daniel Vavra having been <a href="https://kotaku.com/my-e3-meeting-with-a-pro-gamergate-developer-1715511964">a consistently destructive</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/we-keep-having-the-same-video-game-arguments-and-its-dr-1841027051">voice</a> in the industry, the game somehow managed to piss off all the worst people for its more progressive values. Hooray!</p>

 <p>Anyway, if&nbsp;<em>Witcher 3</em> and&nbsp;<em>KCDII</em> aren’t enough to keep you busy on top of <em>High on Life 2</em> and&nbsp;<em>Avatar</em>, I dunno how to help you.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-switch-2-multiplayer-ditto-2000660646"><i><span>Pokémon Pokopia</span></i></a> <span>is taking a page from </span><i><span>Minecraft </span></i><span>in how it handles shared worlds between players. Rather than taking the </span><i><span>Animal Crossing </span></i><span>approach where each island has a “host” player that must be present for you to access it, </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>is giving players persistent worlds that no one person has to be online for you to reach. That way, multiple players can cultivate one of its reinvigorated Pokémon towns without having to drag one person into the play session, though it will have some restrictions.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202602/66124"><i><span>Famitsu</span></i></a><span> (translated by </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/simulation/pokemon-pokopia-follows-minecrafts-lead-in-featuring-persistent-private-servers-with-unlimited-member-caps-but-youll-have-to-swap-in-and-out-as-it-only-accommodates-four-at-once/"><i><span>GamesRadar</span></i><span>+</span></a><span>), </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>chief director Takuto Edagawa explained that the life sim will use a feature Koei Tecmo calls “cloud island,” which allows multiple players to access an island regardless of whether the island’s owner is present. However, only four players will be able to enter the island at the same time. So even though no one person has to be in the game at that moment, you can’t have dozens of players building all at once.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“There is a different system that is unique to this game called the ‘cloud island,’” Edagawa said. “This is an island that everyone can create together, and even if the host (the island’s owner) is not online, everyone is free to join and play. If you can’t find the time to meet up and play together, you can still work together to build the island little by little in your free time.”</span></p> <p><span>So if you’ve got more than three friends who want to contribute to the island, they’ve gotta wait in line, which is a shame. I have a group of friends I’d love to make an island with, but it sounds like the game’s limitations will make that a more arduous process than in something like </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>.</span></p>

Speaking with </span><i><span>Famitsu</span></i><span> (once again translated by </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/pokemon-pokopias-new-pikachu-form-was-dubbed-unfortunate-pikachu-by-co-dev-koei-tecmo-but-it-comes-from-a-place-of-love-we-were-surprised-and-thrilled/"><i><span>GamesRadar+</span></i></a><span>), Edagawa said that Peakychu was dubbed “unfortunate Pikachu” by the team after they saw its design, which was created by </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>developer Game Freak, so if you were worried that Koei Tecmo was creating some kind of unsanctioned version of </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s mascot, it sounds like Peakychu, the moss-covered Snorlax called Mosslax, and other alternate forms in </span><i><span>Pokopia</span></i><span> are coming straight from the source. Edagawa says that Peakychu has a“temporal and melancholy feel,” which sure sounds like she’s a ghost of some kind. Is she dead? Is she dying? We’ll find out when </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>comes out on Switch 2 on March 5.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[15 Tips If You’re Coming Back To Stardew Valley In 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/stardew-valley-tips-tricks-beginner-2000669702</link>
            <guid>1438201</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been almost a decade since the release of the legendary farming sim <em>Stardew Valley</em>, and it’s easy to be daunted by its massive reputation and dedicated player community. Fortunately, the game is all about chilling out, and isn’t too tough on newcomers. That being said, going in totally blind can be a bit overwhelming in a game so packed with information. So, whether you’re a brand new player or it’s been so long you’ve forgotten the ropes, here are 15 tips for starting a fresh <em>Stardew Valley</em> save in 2026.</p> <h2>Choose the Four Corners, Standard, or Forest Farm</h2> <p>There are eight different farm maps to choose from, but not all are created equal. Be sure to make an informed decision — you can’t change your mind later!</p> <p>The Four Corners farm is described as being ideal for multiplayer, but it’s my favorite for single player, too. Four Corners’ structured layout is great for planning how you want to organize your base later on, and each corner has a different perk to it.<br> The Standard farm is another solid choice since it gives you the most space for raising animals and farming crops. The Forest farm also works well; it doesn’t offer a lot of farming space, but it’s great for foraging, which is a crucial skill in the early game.<br> The other farms make starting out more challenging, and <em>Stardew</em> is already overwhelming enough without adding extra hurdles. I would know; my first ever farm was on the Riverland map (because it’s the prettiest), but I got so frustrated I abandoned the save.</p>

 <h2>Take it easy</h2> <p>It’s inevitable that you’re gonna make a mistake. Whether you can’t get home before 2 a.m., or you give someone a present they don’t like, or you miss out on farming a particular crop before the season changes, don’t beat yourself up about it. <em>Stardew Valley</em> is a game about going at your own pace—it’s not possible to play it “wrong,” so long as you’re having fun. It isn’t the end of the world if you accidentally sell something you need later on. Find the joy in stumbling as you learn.</p> <h2>Plan ahead for the Community Center</h2> <p>That being said, if you do want to strategize, the best thing you can do is keep track of what you’ll need to finish rebuilding the Community Center. I like to keep a physical list of all the stuff I need to complete the Community Center handy for quick reference.</p>

 <h2>Watch TV every day</h2> <p>Flicking through the TV when you wake up will reward you with helpful intel from a variety of channels. The content on every channel changes daily, so make a habit of TV surfing before you head out each morning.</p> <h2>Keep one of every item</h2> <p>As a general rule, I like to keep at least one of every item I stumble upon stored at my base. Odds are the stuff you think is worthless now will turn out to be useful later on.</p>

 <h2>Start a tree farm</h2> <p>You’re gonna need a lot of wood in this game. Trees take forever to grow, so set up a designated area for trees on your farm as early as you can.</p> <h2>Don’t plant too many seeds</h2> <p>Believe it or not, there is such a thing as too much farming. Watering your plants costs energy, which you have a limited amount of each day. There’s much more to explore beyond your farm, so don’t spend all your time trying to till every square inch of your land—keep it manageable.</p>  <h2>Go fishing</h2> <p>Fishing is one of the best things you can do in the early game. Not only is it a quick and easy way to earn some cash, you also have a chance of fishing up rare treasure. Upgrading your rod as soon as you’re able is also a good move.</p>

 <h2>Fish where you see bubbles</h2> <p>If you see bubbles in the water, make sure to cast your line there. Fish are way quicker to bite in bubble spots and you’re less likely to catch trash.</p> <h2>Dig for worms</h2> <p>When you’re walking around, keep an eye out for any grass tiles that have three little worms wriggling on them. Using a hoe on that tile will yield valuable items.</p> <h2>Place chests in key locations</h2> <p>Remember that you can place chests anywhere so long as they aren’t on NPC walking paths. It’s easy to run out of inventory space while spelunking, so having a chest right outside the elevator in the mines is super helpful. I also like to keep chests on the beach and by the river for fishing.</p> <h2>Build a silo ASAP</h2> <p>Silos automatically store all the grass you cut. Constructing one before you start on any other buildings is a good idea because it’ll give you a big reserve of hay for when you do get animals.</p>

 <h2>Pet your animals</h2> <p>Once you get livestock on your farm, right-click to pet them! If you make a daily habit of it, you’ll be rewarded with higher quality animal goods—plus a cute heart animation. It’s my favorite part of the daily farm routine (no I will never buy the auto petters).</p> <h2>Prepare for winter with heaters</h2> <p>Winter is tough. Your farmland is rendered barren and your animals can’t go outside, so you’ll have to rely on resource reservoirs and animal produce to survive. Make sure your animals have a siloful of hay to munch on and a heater in every barn/coop so they don’t go cold.</p>

 <h2>Press and hold right-click to save time</h2> <p>Most repetitive actions can be done en masse by holding down the right mouse button. It makes harvesting crops, petting animals, and collecting items from machines way faster.</p>
