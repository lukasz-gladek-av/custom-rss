He also confirmed that The Initiative, the team behind the<em> Perfect Dark </em>reboot, was being shut down. </p><p><em>“</em>We have made the decision to stop development of <em>Perfect Dark</em> and <em>Everwild </em>as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio. As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, The Initiative,” said Booty. </p><p>“These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment.”</p><p>Booty told staff that if they were “directly affected” by the layoffs and studio shutdown, they could apply for other roles within Xbox and that HR would “provide support.” </p><p>The cancellation is part of a larger round of layoffs at Microsoft. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-to-lay-off-as-many-as-9000-employees-in-latest-round/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-to-lay-off-as-many-as-9000-employees-in-latest-round/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Around 9,000 people are reportedly losing their jobs</a></span>, with many Xbox employees affected by the cuts.

At one point, it restarted development and shifted to Unreal Engine 5. </p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has reached out to Xbox for more information. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864">In 2024, Xbox revealed the first gameplay for <em>Perfect Dark</em></a></span>, and the response was mostly positive. The game looked great, with gorgeous visuals, a slick art style, and gameplay that seemed like a combination of <em>Deus Ex, Dying Light,</em> and the old <em>Perfect Dark</em> games. However, the gameplay trailer didn’t include a release date. And now it seems this cool-looking reboot won’t ever see the light of day. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/xbox-reportedly-cancels-that-cool-looking-perfect-dark-1851785531]]></content:encoded>
