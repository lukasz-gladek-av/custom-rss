              <p>When it comes to gaming monitors, you have an overwhelming amount of options to pick from and specs to consider. Not just deciding on a brands, but also size, resolution, refresh rate—all of these factors come into play when finding what’s best for you and your budget. Though there’s one detail that’s more important than the others. How <em>curved&nbsp;</em>is it? If you’ve never worked with a curved monitor, it may just sound like a cheap gimmick, but you couldn’t be more wrong. Asus happens to have one of its curved monitors on sale right now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6994/">The 34-inch VG34VQL1B TUF curved gaming monitor has seen a price drop at Amazon, coming down from $369 to just $289</a>. That 22% discount adds up to you being able to save a whole $80 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6994/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="0" data-end="472">Fully Immersive Gaming</h2>
<p data-start="0" data-end="472">A curved monitor is really something you need to experience firsthand to fully appreciate its advantages. The Asus 34-inch monitor features a 1,500R curvature designed to mirror the natural curve of human vision and how we perceive our surroundings. When placed at the optimal viewing distance, this curvature delivers a level of immersion that flat monitors simply can’t replicate, filling your peripheral with what’s happening on screen.</p>
<p data-start="474" data-end="1149">The Asus curved gaming monitor supports refresh rates up to 165Hz through its two DisplayPort 1.4 connections and two HDMI 2.0 ports, while also offering compatibility with AMD FreeSync and NVIDIA GeForce Adaptive-Sync to eliminate screen tearing. With a rapid 1ms response time and a QHD 1440p resolution, the display provides sharp, smooth visuals that are well suited for a 34-inch screen. Color performance is impressive for its price range, and the variety of available ports makes it an excellent choice for both PC and console gamers.</p>


<p data-start="1151" data-end="1391" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">The display is mounted on a stand that allows for both height and tilt adjustments. This enables users to fine-tune the viewing position for maximum comfort, making it easier to enjoy longer and more extended gaming sessions without strain.</p>
<p>As a little bonus, Asus has generously thrown in a 3-month license for Adobe Creative Cloud. This software suite comes with applications like Photoshop, Illustrator, Premiere, and After Effects. Normally, you’d be paying in the ballpark of $70 per month for an Adobe subscription, so you can see this as a $210 value included for absolutely free. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6994/">If this is something you happened to already be planning on subscribing to and now you don’t have to pay, you can think of it as this monitor only costing you $79.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-apple-pencil-alternative-drops-43-to-a-new-record-low-compatible-with-ipad-pro-and-ipad-mini-2000664837</link>

              <p>Tablets make it incredibly easy to stay productive and entertained on the go. If you mainly use yours for creative tasks or note-taking, you can take the experience even further by investing in a Stylus Pen.</p>
<p>Apple has its own Pencil, but like most products from the brand, these don’t come in cheap, with the latest options sitting over $100. If you’re not keen on spending that much, but still want to enjoy the features and precision, there are plenty of third-party options around, available for way less. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6991/">Now is a great time to pick one, as we just spotted the Jamjake Stylus Pen going at a 43% discount at Amazon, which brings its price down to just $17.</a> This offer applies to the white option. Several other colors are discounted too, but the prices may vary.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6991/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Better Accuracy and Higher Precision</h2>
<p>This stylus pen features a 1.5mm pen tip that can easily replace your finger to execute finer instructions. You’ll enjoy higher sensitivity, an accurate signal, and a more comfortable hold, along with palm rejection technology that lets you place your hand on the screen while working. The pen offers a natural writing feeling and quick interaction with the screen, so you won’t have to press/drag it against your iPad to make work; just write or draw how you would in a regular notebook!</p>
<p>Compatibility is seriously impressive. The stylus plays nicely with iPad series 2018-2025, which includes models like the 13-inch M4 iPad Pro, 12.9-inch iPad Pro (3rd/4th/5th/6th), all generations of the 11-inch iPad Pro, iPad Air (M3, M2, 5th, 4th, 3rd generation), iPad series 6th through 11th, iPad Mini 5th, and iPad Mini 6th gen. The models it doesn’t support include iPad Pro (1st and 2nd gen), the 10.5-inch iPad Pro, 9.7-inch iPad Pro, iPad series 1st through 5th, iPad Mini 1st through 4th gen, or iPhones. It’s best to double-check compatibility before you purchase the stylus to avoid issues later.</p>



<p>The pen magnetically clicks onto the side of your iPad for easy storage and quicker access. Activating the thing is quite straightforward; simply touch the cap button to get started. As for the battery life, one full charge gets you around up to 10 hours of usage, which is more than enough to go a full day without worrying about topping it up. Even better, recharging doesn’t take forever. A quick 5-20 minute charge prepares it for the day.</p>
<p>Just note that the stylus pen does not come with a pen cap or a charging port cover. The manufacturer also suggests using a 5V2A power adapter to charge the product to maintain its efficiency.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking for an easy way to take notes or sketch on your iPad, this stylus pen is a must-have. You can use it to write documents, doodle on the screen, paint, draw, navigate, and a lot more. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6991/">It typically sits at $30, which is already quite affordable considering all that the stylus offers, but Amazon is letting you pick it up for just $17 today.</a> It’s best to grab it as soon as you can, as we’re not expecting the offer to last long.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Devs Behind Steam Game With Over 300,000 Reviews Hit The Panic Button After A Malicious Mod Starts Deleting Fans’ Data]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/people-playground-steam-mod-workshop-virus-2000665028</link>
            <guid>1422793</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The<span> creators of </span><i><span>People Playground</span></i><span>, a lo-fi, cartoonishly gory sandbox with over 300,000 Steam reviews, have warned players to update the game immediately and delete all of their mods after a “malicious add-on” began infecting other mods in the game’s Steam Workshop.</span></p> <p><span>The “</span><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1118200/view/534373847137256681"><span>Urgent PSA</span></a><span>” was posted to </span><i><span>People Playground’</span></i><span>s </span><span>official Steam News Hub on February 1, with a patch for the game following hours later. All Workshop functions, mods, and access to the Workshop page for the game were immediately disabled, but not before the malware claimed its first victims.</span></p>

 <p><span>Several users in the comments of the Steam post report that all of their</span><i><span> People Playground’s</span></i><span> achievements, save files, and Contraptions folders (a separate save file for custom creations) have been wiped. According to the devs, the virus in question “does not destroy your computer,” but instead aims to disable or otherwise destroy certain aspects of </span><i><span>People Playground’s </span></i><span>functionality.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Users who have downloaded any mods from the game’s Workshop are being urged to wipe their entire mod lists, even if they didn’t download the malicious mod in question. This is because the add-on “replaces [mods] with itself,” and has reportedly supplanted several other mods in </span><i><span>People Playground</span></i><span>’s </span><span>workshop.</span></p>

 <p><span>The malicious mod also somehow made its way into </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1qtdmac/comment/o326x09/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>the top-rated section</span></a><span> on </span><i><span>People Playground</span></i><span>’s</span><span> workshop, which may explain how it spread to so many users in such a short space of time, considering the mod was uploaded to the Steam Workshop on January 30.</span></p>

 <p><span>This, unfortunately, isn’t the first time that a Steam Workshop mod has infected users’ games. In February 2022, several mods for </span><i><span>Cities: Skylines</span></i><span> were removed from the Steam Workshop following reports that they contained </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cities-skylines-mods-mod-bitcoin-virus-steam-pc-trojan-1848536798"><span>keyloggers and bitcoin mining software</span></a><span>. In December 2023, the popular Workshop mod </span><i><span>Downfall </span></i><span>for </span><i><span>Slay the Spire</span></i><span> was subject to a “security breach” that infected users’ </span><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/popular-slay-the-spire-mod-downfall-was-hijacked-to-spread-malware-through-steam"><span>machines with malware</span></a><span> that attempted to steal their passwords via their web browsers.</span></p>

            <guid>1422748</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Soundcore Boom 3i by Anker Compact Outdoor Speaker is designed to give you outdoor sound with reliable playback that isn’t affected by rain, sand, or contact with water or dirt. It’s a compact, waterproof, and dustproof IP68 Bluetooth speaker with 50W of output. The flotation system keeps the unit upright in water, maintaining an outward-facing orientation with the sound facing outward. This means you can throw it into a pool or lake, and it will continue to function. The Boom 3i gives you up to 16 hours of playback time, BassUp 2.0, and a removable strap, making it ideal for travel.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4949/">You can purchase the Soundcore Boom 3i by Anker Compact Outdoor Speaker on Amazon for $75, down from its normal price of $140, for a savings of $65 or 46%.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4949/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A loud and capable portable speaker with plenty of power behind it</h2>
<p>The Boom 3i is designed for those who want to enjoy high-quality sound near water. By combining a fully waterproof design with a flotation feature that keeps the speakers pointed toward you, the unit maintains strong sound quality. The IP68 rating lets you submerge the unit and protects it against dust, reducing the likelihood of damage from saltwater, sand, or other debris found near the ocean. The rugged housing is also built to handle normal wear and tear, including drops.</p>
<p>Sound from the Boom 3i comes from a 50W amplifier, a BassUp 2.0 processor, and digital signal control that helps maintain clear voice reproduction and strong low-frequency response. Stereo playback creates a wider sound field and helps maintain a consistent tone even when you raise the volume in an open area.</p>



<p>The Boom 3i offers up to 16 hours of battery life per charge, letting you listen for extended periods without recharging. Bluetooth 5.3 gives you a strong wireless connection to mobile devices while using minimal power. Fast pairing makes it easy to connect additional devices to share playlists and control music, and True Wireless Stereo lets you pair two units to create a wider sound field and higher overall volume.</p>
<p>The companion app adds intelligent features beyond standard music playback. The Voice Amplifier turns the speaker into a portable loudspeaker for amplifying voice messages and announcements, and the Emergency Alarm plays a piercing alert tone to attract immediate attention. The app also includes Buzz Clean, which pushes excess water out of the speaker drivers after heavy exposure to water to help prevent distortion and reduced volume. You can also customize the equalizer settings and choose different listening modes.</p>
<p>Portability features include a water bottle-style design, a removable strap you can attach to backpacks or boat rails, and a size that’s easy to hold with one hand, making it simple to carry.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4949/"> At $75, the Soundcore Boom 3i by Anker Compact Outdoor Speaker</a> gives you high sound pressure levels, true waterproofing, long battery life, and smart app features at a much lower price than its usual $140 list price.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Steam MMO That Raised $3.2 Million On Kickstarter Implodes Just Two Months After Launch As Devs Resign In Protest]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ashes-creation-refund-kickstarter-steam-mmo-layoffs-2000665006</link>
            <guid>1422742</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Ashes of Creation</em> is living up to its name. The fantasy MMORPG came to Steam in Early Access on December 11. Less than eight weeks later, its future is in complete limbo amid staff resignations and reported layoffs. The Intrepid Studios-made open-world game raised over $3.2 million on <a href="https://kotaku.com/kickstarter-survival-horror-pc-mystery-flesh-pit-1849829127">Kickstarter</a> back in 2017. Now its director claims that board control of the company has been stolen away from him and that those who seized it are trying to do unethical things.</p> <p>“I can make a limited statement in my personal capacity and not on behalf of the company, regarding the situation,” director Steven Sharif wrote on Discord on January 31 (via <em><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/ashes-of-creation/layoffs-director-resigns">PCGamesN</a></em>). “Control of the company shifted away from me, and the Board began directing actions that I could not ethically agree with or carry out. As a result, I chose to resign in protest rather than lend my name or authority to decisions I could not ethically support.”</p>

 <p>Sharif doesn’t get into what specific things the board was trying to do but said other senior staff resigned along with him and that the company is currently moving forward with mass layoffs. Intrepid is based in San Diego, California where companies must give notice before laying employees off, but the state’s database doesn’t yet show any updates for the studio. Still, the reports of sudden chaos were backed up by another former employee.</p> <p>Studio communications director Margaret Krohn recently posted on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/margaretkrohn_well-this-chapter-has-come-to-a-close-activity-7423531204198436864-XsUB/">LinkedIn</a> that they’ve left the company as well. “I gave everything I had, and did my very best with what was within my power.” they wrote. “And I ask one last favor of you, please be kind to the developers, we are people who have families who have just lost our jobs after pouring our hearts and souls into <em>Ashes of Creation</em>.” The message continued, “As for how this all ended…I don’t really have the words. It wasn’t what I expected. But I’m holding onto the good because there was so much of it.”</p>

 <h2>A massive Kickstarter goes belly up</h2> <p><em>Ashes of Creation</em> was pitched back in 2017 as a <a href="https://kotaku.com/im-still-looking-for-an-mmo-that-feels-reminds-me-of-th-1824179891">factions-based MMO</a> that would eschew pay-to-win microtransactions. Backers who collectively contributed millions have now been waiting nearly a decade for launch. While it finally came to Steam Early Access in December, some backers are claiming that doesn’t count as a full 1.0 release and are demanding refunds instead. “Early bird backer,” wrote one of them. “Extremely disappointed with the behavior of this company. And yes, I will be pursuing a refund.” Another wrote, “Refund my $500 please.”</p>

 <p>Concerns about funding for the game have hounded its development since the original Kickstarter. At the time, Sharif suggested he was the main financial backer and that <em>Ashes of Creation</em> would need $30 million in total to ship as promised. He denied accusations that it was essentially a “vanity project” led by an inexperienced rich guy. “First and foremost I am an MMORPG gamer,” he <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2017/05/04/ashes-of-creations-steven-sharif-on-his-business-history-30m-funding-goal-and-pvp/">told <em>MassivelyOP</em></a> at the time. “I have been since I first sat down at a computer. I had the fortunate circumstance in life, to become wealthy through hard work at a young age. A couple years ago, I got very fed up with what was happening to a genre that I love. So I decided to put my money where my heart is and do something about it.”</p> <p>Now early players are getting very fed up with <em>Ashes of Creation</em>. The Discord is in a full-on panic and owners on Steam have been review-bombing the game. The user rating sits at an “overwhelmingly negative” 30 percent and players are predicting the MMO’s imminent cancelation. “Since<em> Ashes of Creation</em> will be shutting down soon, purchasing the game right now might be a bad idea,” reads one of the most recent Steam reviews. But Intrepid itself hasn’t confirmed what the actual plan is right now. Just last week it promised a developer update on February 13 to address recent complaints over the game’s biggest design and performance issues. ”</p>

 <p>“We know that some of you are frustrated right now. We feel that. You’ve been candid about the issues impacting your experience, and you deserve clarity and honesty in return,” a January 29 <a href="https://ashesofcreation.com/news/a-director-s-letter-to-the-citizens-of-verra-336">blog post read</a>. “[The game’s setting of] Verra is still growing. We remain deeply committed to making it a world worthy of your time, your stories, and your belief.” It was signed “The <em>Ashes of Creation</em> Team,” whoever that still is.</p>
