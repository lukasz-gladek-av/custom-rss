But now, finally, after 20 years, Blizzard is actually doing it, though it likely won’t be in the game for at least another year or more. </p><p>On November 13, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/warcraft-2-3-rts-classic-remastered-blizzard-pc-1851697730?rev=1731523171634&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/warcraft-2-3-rts-classic-remastered-blizzard-pc-1851697730?rev=1731523171634">during Blizzard’s 3o years of <em>Warcraft </em>event</a></span>, the studio revealed a lot of plans and updates for various <em>Warcraft </em>games. The presentation’s segment about the future of <em>WoW </em>was capped off with a very tiny tease about player housing. Here’s that teaser: </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/world-of-warcraft/player-housing-is-coming-to-world-of-warcraft-after-20-years-though-youll-have-to-wait-until-the-next-expansion-its-a-tremendously-large-undertaking/?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/world-of-warcraft/player-housing-is-coming-to-world-of-warcraft-after-20-years-though-youll-have-to-wait-until-the-next-expansion-its-a-tremendously-large-undertaking/?utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_medium=social" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PC Gamer </em>spoke to <em>WoW </em>director Ion Hazzikostas</a></span> about the teaser and confirmed that, yes, Blizzard is bringing player homes to the MMORPG. However, as seen in the teaser, this feature won’t be added until the next expansion, <em>Midnight</em>. So why tease it now? </p><p>“We want to give players a little sneak preview of some of what the team is cooking,” Hazzikostas explained to <em>PC Gamer</em>. “This also gives us a chance, I think, to have more open conversations about it that aren’t possible when it’s a top-secret feature.”</p><p>According to Hazzikostas, Blizzard wants to hear “what people are excited about, what they expect, and what they’d like to see from housing” in <em>World of Warcraft</em>. The plan is for that input to help “guide the team’s development efforts” on player housing.</p><p>“[Player housing] an idea that’s been kicked around for a long time—but we knew that to do it, we needed to be able to do it right. It’s a tremendously large undertaking,” said Hazzikostas, who also explained that another reason housing is happening now is that Blizzard has developed new tech behind the scenes in <em>WoW</em> to make this feature possible.</p><p>So now people can stop bugging Blizzard about player housing in <em>World of Warcraft</em> and start bugging them about how much they don’t like the way player housing works in <em>WoW </em>once it’s available in game. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And <em>Warcraft’</em>s spin-off card game, <em>Hearthstone, </em>is getting a <em>Starcraft </em>mini-expansion in January 2025.
