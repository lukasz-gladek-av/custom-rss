              <p><em>Arc Raiders</em> devs are assessing the damage from an ongoing duplication glitch before it decides how to respond. T<a href="https://kotaku.com/all-of-besiege-beaten-with-a-single-perfect-machine-1688320789">en years later</a>, <em>Besieged</em> still has new content coming. And <em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em> isn’t skimping on its fighting game roster at launch. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture.</p> <p>The voice actor from <em>Detroit: Become Human</em>, Bryan Dechart, might be <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/samitron.bsky.social/post/3mehke7eta22r">teasing fans with the threat</a> of a sequel. Quantic Dream has announced a live service MOBA called <i>Spellcasters Chronicles </i>and a <em>Star Wars</em> game called <em>Star Wars Eclipsed</em>, but it’s now been almost eight years since it last shipped something. Maybe in the Detroit sequel the humans will try to become AI instead of the other way around. Or maybe Dechart is just trying to get <a href="https://x.com/BryanDechart/status/2020873211286528029">more subscribers on Twitch</a>.</p>   <h2>A duplication glitch taking over <em>Arc Raiders</em> gets an emergency fix</h2> <p>Embark Studios has been playing <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1r0x0i7/just_a_heads_up_before_you_check_the_patch_notes/">whack-a-mole with this exploit</a> for a couple weeks now and it’s taking its toll. Players can essentially duplicate any item in the game that their character can hold, leading to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1qq36np/12m_loot_in_one_raid_killed_a_guy_with_this_loot/">inventory screens</a> that all look hacked. Today’s big &nbsp;1.15.0 patch didn’t have anything about it, but Embark ended up rushing out a hotfix just hours later.</p>

 <p>“We have just pushed a hotfix to resolve the current duplication issue. We are still actively monitoring the situation to ensure we’ve covered all cases – should you encounter other duplication issues, please raise them to us in the bug report channel,” the development team wrote on Discord. “We are still investigating the full impact of the issue, and will be taking action based on the severity of the different cases as we complete our investigation.”</p> <h2>A group of <em>Valheim</em> devs have a demo for their next game</h2> <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FPMxYZAlpPU"><em>Begraved</em> is a medieval PVE looter</a> from some of the developers who made the hit Viking survival crafting sim. Think a coop dungeon crawler with extraction shooter elements. It now has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4113160/Begraved/">a free demo</a> for players to try on Steam ahead of its upcoming Early Access launch.</p>

 <h2>Hit medieval destruction sim <em>Besiege</em> goes to space</h2>  <p>The unusual physics sandbox arrived a decade ago, only hit 1.0 on Steam five years ago, and is still heading to new frontiers. Besiege: The Broken Beyond will hit Steam sometime around mid-2026 and add a new campaign, environment, mechanics, and blocks.</p>

 <h2><em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em> will feature 20 comic book characters</h2> <p>That number l<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-tokon-steams-page-has-been-updated-revealing-roster-size-20-characters-at-launch-single-player-mode-64-player-lobbies-psn-acc-required.1430548/">eaked on Steam</a> ahead of this week’s PlayStation Showcase. <a href="https://kotaku.com/three-things-we-learned-about-the-coolest-looking-marvel-fighting-game-in-years-2000614384">Arc System Works’ riff on the <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> formula</a> has already confirmed eight of its roster members, including Captain America, Doom, and Iron Man. It’s very light on X-Men at the moment so maybe the upcoming State of Play will reveal Magneto and others are joining the fray.</p> <h2><em>Until Dawn</em> studio Supermassive reveals a new release date for its next game</h2> <p>Upcoming horror release Directive 8020 was supposed to be out last year but ended up getting a long delay. It’s now resurfaced with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61OMILUgVyo">a new trailer</a> and a May 12 launch date. Hopefully it marks a turn around from <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/18/dead-by-daylight-studio-behaviour-interactive-has-reportedly-laid-off-45-people">the very rough last few years</a> the studio’s been through.</p>

 <h2>A <em>Marathon</em> hands-on leak out of China sounds very positive</h2> <p>Bungie’s extraction shooter <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1r0wp7k/marathon_handson_event_in_china_impressions_leaked/">reportedly had a recent test event there</a> that went very well. General impressions summarized in a <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1JCcPzYEov/">video posted on Bilibili</a> suggest a lot more depth and tension than the original alpha test in early 2025 conveyed. We’ll probably get a closer look at the world building and lore in a new State of Play trailer this week.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/super-bowl-60-ads-celebs-stars-ben-affleck-dunkin-jurassic-park-ai-de-aged-best-commericals-2000666913">How did Super Bowl ads get so cringe?&nbsp;</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-thing-about-the-winter-olympics-are-the-drone-cameras-2000666958">The best thing about the Winter Olympics are the drone cameras</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/mewgenics-edmund-mcmillen-roguelike-impressions-2000666865">The latest roguelike from Binding of Isaac’s creator is a brilliantly poopy take on strategy&nbsp;</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Norwegian Olympic athlete Sturla Holm Lægreid wasn’t celebrating when he won a bronze medal at the ongoing <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-thing-about-the-winter-olympics-are-the-drone-cameras-2000666958">2026 Winter Olympics in Italy</a>. Instead, he broke down on live TV and confessed to cheating on his girlfriend three months before.</p> <p><a href="https://www.nrk.no/ol/sturla-holm-laegreid-innrommer-utroskap-pa-direkten_-_-mitt-livs-storste-tabbe-1.17763479">On February 10, as first reported by </a><em><a href="https://www.nrk.no/ol/sturla-holm-laegreid-innrommer-utroskap-pa-direkten_-_-mitt-livs-storste-tabbe-1.17763479">Norwegian Broadcasting Company (NRK)</a>,</em> shortly after <a href="https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/norway-and-france-top-podium-mens-biathlon-20km-individual">Sturla won a bronze medal in the men’s 20km biathlon,</a> he was interviewed about his accomplishment. And it was during this interview that Lægreid pivoted to confessing to recently cheating on his girlfriend, losing her, and being miserable.</p>

 <p>“There is someone I wanted to share this with who might not be watching today,” said Sturla in a post-event interview. “Six months ago, I met the love of my life, the most beautiful and kindest person in the world. Three months ago, I made the biggest mistake of my life and was unfaithful.” He said he’d admitted a week ago to cheating and added, “This has been the worst week of my life.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="no" dir="ltr">Så ikke helt denne komme. Tidenes mest absurde medaljeintervju. 🫣 <a href="https://t.co/fFwJ1B0vCO">pic.twitter.com/fFwJ1B0vCO</a></p> <p>— Daniel Vassbund (@Smoothedan) <a href="https://twitter.com/Smoothedan/status/2021231796759748765?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span dir="auto">“I want to be a good role model, but I just have to admit when I make mistakes. </span><span dir="auto">It hurts to admit when you do something you can’t stand for and hurt someone you love so much. But that’s life now.”</span></p>

 <p>So why did Sturla admit to cheating on his girlfriend at the <a href="https://kotaku.com/winter-olympics-injecting-penis-acid-skiing-real-men-ski-jumping-cheating-2000666137">Winter Olympics</a> right after winning a medal? Well, in a follow-up inteview with <em>NRK</em>, the skiier explained it was his attempt at possibly getting her back.</p> <p>“I have nothing to lose. I had a chance at true love, and I screwed up so badly. It’s not necessarily forgivable. But if this gives me a tiny chance to tell her how much I love her, I’d rather commit social suicide on live TV just to get that little chance,” said Strula.</p>

 <p>When the reporter pointed out that he just aired their private situation publicly to the world, he seemed to realize this was probably not the best choice, replying: “Maybe I messed up my chance now to get her back.”</p>

              <p><a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-une-grosse-exclusivite-ps5-debarque-ce-mois-de-fevrier-61029"><i><span>Dealabs</span></i></a> <span>is reporting that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-spider-man-2-review-ps5-venom-miles-morales-1850929271"><i><span>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2</span></i></a><span> is coming to PlayStation Plus this month. So if you have a subscription and still haven’t gotten around to Insomniac’s latest open-world superhero romp, it sounds like you’ll be able to play it soon for free.</span></p> <p><span>Though Sony hasn’t announced it yet, </span><i><span>Dealabs</span></i><span> says that </span><i><span>Spider-Man 2</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Neva </span></i><span>will be part of February’s PlayStation Plus offerings. </span><i><span>Spider-Man 2 </span></i><span>is obviously the headliner, and it’s also coming to the service at a pretty opportune time, as the next game in Insomniac’s Marvel universe is imminent. </span><i><span>Wolverine </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvels-wolverine-trailer-ps5-release-date-bloody-2000628275"><span>is coming to PS5</span></a><span> later this year and while it won’t star Peter Parker and Miles Morales, it will take place in the same shared universe, so there will likely be a nod or two to the Spider-Men’s stories.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Spider-Man 2 </span></i><span>launched on PS5 in 2023, then came to PC </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-2-pc-steam-psn-login-nycc-2024-ps5-1851676683"><span>a little under two years later</span></a><span>. The sequel stars both Peter and Miles as playable characters, and sets up a potential third game that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-spider-man-yuri-lowenthal-ice-alex-pretti-2000663563"><span>actor Yuri Lowenthal</span></a> <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/spider-man-3-ps5-game-story-exclusive"><span>confirmed is in the works</span></a><span>. The first two games, </span><i><span>Spider-Man </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Spider-Man: Miles Morales</span></i><span>, are both part of the PlayStation Plus catalog if you have an Extra or Premium membership, so the whole series will be available to you if you’re a subscriber.</span></p> <p><span>We’ll probably get official confirmation from Sony this week, especially with the State of Play presentation </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-showcase-sony-marvel-wolverine-release-date-2000666866"><span>scheduled for Thursday</span></a><span>. I can already see them showing off new footage of </span><i><span>Wolverine</span></i><span>, giving that game a release date, and being like, “Hey, you can play all of Insomniac’s other Marvel games now on PlayStation Plus.” Brand synergy, ya know?</span></p>
