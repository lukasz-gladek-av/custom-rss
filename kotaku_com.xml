              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/bully-doesnt-sound-like-your-typical-rockstar-game-1845413977"><em>Bully</em> didn’t support online multiplayer when it launched in 2006,</a> but that didn’t stop a team of dedicated fans and modders from seeking to turn the game into a full-featured online experience. And now, they are close to releasing <em>Bully Online</em>, a free mod that essentially turns the school-themed open-world game into something like <em>Grand Theft Auto Online.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>On October 28, Rockstar Games superfan, YouTuber, and modder SWEGTA announced<em> Bully Online</em> and showed off the upcoming free mod via a trailer on his YouTube channel. The mod will include a large roster of playable characters, new drivable vehicles, mini-games, player housing, roleplay support, online racing, and more.&nbsp;<em>Bully Online</em> is built using DSL script loader, a plugin for <em>Bully</em> that allows SWEGTA and his team to extensively mod the original game. Using this plugin, the YouTuber says a lot of “things we thought were impossible just a few years ago can now be done,” including adding full online multiplayer support.</p>

  <p>As explained in the video above, SWEGTA and his team are adding a lot to<em> Bully Online,</em> including the ability to buy cars and even lock them using car keys via a newly added inventory system. The upcoming mod even features a first-person shooter mini-game starring oversized rats, which is presented in-game as a video game you can play against other <em>Bully Online</em> players. Don’t worry, <em>Bully Online</em> isn’t adding guns to Rockstar’s boarding school game. That’s something SWEGTA and the team didn’t want to do. Instead, this FPS mini-game will provide players with some shooting action without handing assault rifles to the students at Bullworth Academy.</p>

 <p>Some fans are worried that <a href="https://kotaku.com/ambitious-gta-underground-mod-shutdowns-after-six-years-1847619249">Rockstar Games might show up and shut all of this down</a> because SWEGTA is a high-profile creator and is making a big announcement out of <em>Bully Online’</em>s reveal. And that’s possible. But I think <em>Bully Online</em> might be safe simply because it’s not directly competing with <em>GTA Online </em>or <em>Red Dead Online.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>According to SWEGTA, <em>Bully Online</em> has been in development for a “very long time,” but he and the team didn’t want to reveal it until it was far enough along that they all felt confident in showing it off to the public. That time is now, with SWEGTA confirming that <em>Bully Online</em> will be available to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&amp;redir_token=QUFFLUhqbG85NU1zU1Y3YnF5SkdOdHJqZ2h3RjZhbjJhZ3xBQ3Jtc0ttWjBNZ0k5bTMtdUQ0aDZ5SGtxQnItaE1rMkVwd3oxQXRXLVZGa2c5NTdZWVVqTWJIMGNScWc0MVQ2MWRXZEwyZDRwZ0tGRDlUbF9pNFlxWXNCVE5wOGd6SEVVZ0FkUmFGOTdmNjZWSW1VOHM1OER0TQ&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fko-fi.com%2Fbullyonline&amp;v=2J0_BnWKvEA"><em>Bully Online</em> paid Ko-Fi subscribers</a> starting in December. The plan is to eventually roll out a fully public server available to anyone who owns <em>Bully</em> on PC and installs the mod. <a href="https://kotaku.com/rockstar-s-dan-houser-teases-bully-sequel-max-payne-3-5860860">It’s not quite <em>Bully 2</em>, but it’s better than nothing</a>.</p>

              <p>Amazon is pulling back from blockbuster games. The company is laying off 14,000 people, including some across its gaming division. According to an internal memo reviewed by <em>Bloomberg</em>, those cuts include halting a “significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work–specifically around MMOs–within Amazon Game Studios.” The company had previously announced an ambitious<em> Lord of the Rings</em> MMORPG.</p> <p>“While we’re proud of our successes in first-party AAA game development and publishing, we have made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work–specifically around MMOs–within Amazon Game Studios, including making significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team,” Amazon head of games, Twitch, and audio Steve Boom wrote in an email to staff, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-28/amazon-makes-significant-cuts-in-video-game-division">reports<em> Bloomberg</em></a>.</p>

 <p>Amazon has mostly struggled in the world of game development outside of 2021’s MMO <em>New World</em>. It’s only other hits like <em>Lost Ark</em> and <em>Throne and Liberty</em> were developed by external partners. It’s currently set to publish the next <em>Tomb Raider</em> game as well as several other unannounced projects, including an internally developed <em>Lord of the Rings</em> MMO and an online AAA action-RPG. It’s now unclear if those projects will move on or be canceled.</p>

 <p>The latest cuts come amid a recent overhaul of Amazon’s cloud gaming service Luna, with an emphasis on party games including one <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=snoop+kotaku&amp;sca_esv=f60ecab60e0aa489&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;sxsrf=AE3TifOXDxq2ETzQl4cY3e3JzPgqEeaJrw%3A1761669797715&amp;ei=pfIAaaqvK-Ot5NoP87KVmQ0&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjqlYS0q8eQAxXjFlkFHXNZJdMQ4dUDCBE&amp;uact=5&amp;oq=snoop+kotaku&amp;gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiDHNub29wIGtvdGFrdTIFECEYoAEyBRAhGKABMgUQIRigATIFECEYoAEyBRAhGJ8FMgUQIRifBTIFECEYnwUyBRAhGJ8FMgUQIRifBTIFECEYnwVIrglQAFjGCHAAeACQAQCYAY0CoAHYCaoBBTkuMi4xuAEDyAEA-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&amp;sclient=gws-wiz-serp">powered by an AI Snoop Dogg avatar</a>. Amazon has also reworked its Prime Game program and seemingly scaled back ambitions for its video streaming platform Twitch over the years. Its gaming retreat comes as companies race to exploit a new gold rush in AI technology.</p> <p>“Some may ask why we’re reducing roles when the company is performing well,” Amaozn’s head of people experience, Beth Galetti, <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/company-news/amazon-workforce-reduction">wrote in a new blog post</a> on Tuesday. “Across our businesses, we’re delivering great customer experiences every day, innovating at a rapid rate, and producing strong business results. What we need to remember is that the world is changing quickly. This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it’s enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”</p>
