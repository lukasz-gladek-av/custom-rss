But it still has plenty of charming characters and replayability.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195755" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The 3 Best And 3 Worst Korok Challenges In Tears Of The Kingdom " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="181" data-playlist="195755,196578,195502" data-current="195755"><div><p>The 3 Best And 3 Worst Korok Challenges In Tears Of The Kingdom </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195755/195755_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195755/195755_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195755/195755_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195755/195755_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21265.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>If you’re looking for a nostalgic experience, or are playing it for the first time, <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em> offers a straightforward-yet-healthy runtime for both veterans and newcomers. Like many other adventure games of its era, <em>Onimusha 2</em> doesn’t take that long to beat, but its branching story paths make it worth revisiting over and over again. </p><h2 id="h659960"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to beat <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em>?</h2><p><strong>A standard playthrough of <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em> can take about 10 to 15 hours to beat if you’re just focusing on the story and if it’s your first time</strong>. It’s quite similar to Capcom’s most notable franchise, <em>Resident Evil</em>, where repeated playthroughs will increase your familiarity, allowing you to beat it quicker on subsequent runs. Speedrunners have completed this game in under than five hours. In fact, the remaster has an achievement for finishing the game within that time.</p><p>If you want to earn all the Achievements and/or Trophies, you’ll also have to beat the game on Ultimate mode, as well as finish a complete playthrough without enhancing any of your weapons or using any jewels.<strong> All of these additional playthroughs can add up to 20 more hours of playtime to the total count</strong>. You’ll also need to collect all files and maps for their respective completion achievements/trophies, which can take multiple playthroughs if you somehow miss any of them.</p><figure id="" data-id="027f14dc6984ce80bd6aa2cbcc0d6956" data-recommend-id="image://027f14dc6984ce80bd6aa2cbcc0d6956" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character in Onimusha 2 glows with energy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character in Onimusha 2 glows with energy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="027f14dc6984ce80bd6aa2cbcc0d6956" data-recommend-id="image://027f14dc6984ce80bd6aa2cbcc0d6956" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character in Onimusha 2 glows with energy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are also multiple endings depending on your friendship with various characters like Ekei, Kotaro, and Magoichi. Throughout the game, you can give them gifts in order to raise their friendship levels and influence which ending you’ll get. There’s also an ending for when you don’t give any of them gifts.</p><p>If you’re a completionist, get ready to spend quite a few hours with <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny.</em> There’s still plenty of time before the next entry, <em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>, launches in 2026. For now, though, join Jubei as he gets his revenge on Nobunaga Oda!</p><hr><p><em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and Windows PCs. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

About 10 minutes into the gameplay demo, the game’s producer Michi Ryu pulled out a USB mouse, plugged it into the console, and started playing the game with it. </p><p>“Once you connect the USB mouse, a message will appear in the top left indicating that the mouse is connected,” said Ryu via English subtitles. “When the USB mouse is connected, it takes priority over the Joy-Con 2.”</p><p>During the demo, the producer also demonstrated that you can switch between the Joy-Con and the mouse instantly as often as you want, letting you use them both at the same time. </p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has pinged Nintendo for more details about the Switch 2 supporting USB mice. I also asked them if the console will support USB keyboards. If so, that would make the Switch 2, which launches on June 5, even more of a direct competitor to the Steam Deck. Either way, I’m excited that the console will support more control options, as that allows more people to play in whatever way works best for them. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Don’t expect any complicated mechanics like ones found in modern games like <em>Sekiro </em>or anything like that. However, there’s still plenty of fun to have with Jubei as he sets out to defeat Nobunaga. Let’s go over a few tips </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196411" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="378" data-playlist="196411,196646,196215" data-current="196411"><div><p>A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21958.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h685909"><a id="1"></a>Impale your enemies</h2><figure id="" data-id="88b3e9eda6a3723880d63059b35a71b9" data-recommend-id="image://88b3e9eda6a3723880d63059b35a71b9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A protagonist of Onimusha 2 braces for an attack from two enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A protagonist of Onimusha 2 braces for an attack from two enemies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="88b3e9eda6a3723880d63059b35a71b9" data-recommend-id="image://88b3e9eda6a3723880d63059b35a71b9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A protagonist of Onimusha 2 braces for an attack from two enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Whenever Jubei downs his enemies, you have the opportunity to walk over to their bodies and impale them with a downward stab simply by pressing the attack button while standing on top. This move is an automatic OHKO (one-hit-knock-out) and prevents enemies from getting back up. Enemies don’t have any health bars so it’s impossible to know how much more health they have until they disappear. But with the downward stab, you’ll know they’re gone for good.</p><p>Just be careful, though, as <strong>you can still be hit by other enemies in the middle of the animation</strong>. Sometimes you won’t get the chance to impale them. But either way, if you have the opportunity to do so, definitely take it as it’s one less enemy to deal with.</p><h2 id="h685910"><a id="2"></a>Absorb every soul</h2><p>Early on in the game, Jubei will get the ability to absorb souls from enemies that he’s defeated. Red souls can be spent upgrading Jubei’s weapons and capabilities, while the yellow and blue ones replenish Jubei’s health and magic, respectively. Jubei can also transform into a powerful and invincible demon for a short time if he collects five purple souls.</p><p><strong>In this remaster, players can now control when Jubei enters this powerful mode</strong> whereas in the original, it automatically activated once the fifth soul was collected. So definitely take advantage of it to unleash hell at opportune times.</p><p>Also, souls disappear after a while if they aren’t absorbed, so make sure to not leave them hanging or you’ll regret it.</p><h2 id="h685911"><a id="3"></a>Regularly switch up your weapons</h2><figure id="" data-id="be6c2bf09a4216473f472bacbeacb568" data-recommend-id="image://be6c2bf09a4216473f472bacbeacb568" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A protagonist in Onimusha 2 impales an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A protagonist in Onimusha 2 impales an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="be6c2bf09a4216473f472bacbeacb568" data-recommend-id="image://be6c2bf09a4216473f472bacbeacb568" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A protagonist in Onimusha 2 impales an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In <em>Onimusha 2</em>, there are plenty of weapons to collect, each with their own unique effects. The Buraitou is a lightning sword that’s both fast and powerful, making it a fantastic all-rounder. The Hyojin-Yari is an ice lance and it has the longest reach out of all the weapons. Use it if you want to keep a safe distance.</p><p>The general idea is to <strong>switch between weapons so that you can maintain an advantage over your enemies</strong>. The wind sword, Senpumaru, might be the weakest in the game, but is incredibly useful for hitting flying enemies while the slow but powerful earth hammer, Dokoutsui can smash through enemies defences like they’re made out of paper.</p><h2 id="h685912"><a id="4"></a>Keep an eye on the ground for helpful items</h2><figure id="" data-id="3410ba8a49dc990e92657664cb502d18" data-recommend-id="image://3410ba8a49dc990e92657664cb502d18" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Onimusha 2 shows a town." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Onimusha 2 shows a town." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3410ba8a49dc990e92657664cb502d18" data-recommend-id="image://3410ba8a49dc990e92657664cb502d18" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Onimusha 2 shows a town." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When you’re killing enemies and (hopefully) impaling them, they’ll drop valuable gold, which is needed to buy things such as healing items, weapons for companion characters, and collectibles like artwork. This will help you prepare for the challenges ahead.</p><p>Additionally, scour rooms for treasure chests. They can provide valuable items like green herbs for Jubei to heal himself. Due to the fixed camera angle, treasure chests can be hard to see sometiomes, but take the time to look at your surroundings and you won’t be disappointed.</p><h2 id="h685913"><a id="5"></a>Save slots are handy</h2><figure id="" data-id="33c8378ebda7cd0ed247f087a548cba8" data-recommend-id="image://33c8378ebda7cd0ed247f087a548cba8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A playable character in Onimusha 2 slashes through an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A playable character in Onimusha 2 slashes through an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="33c8378ebda7cd0ed247f087a548cba8" data-recommend-id="image://33c8378ebda7cd0ed247f087a548cba8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A playable character in Onimusha 2 slashes through an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Modern technology means that the remaster of <em>Onimusha 2</em> doesn’t need memory cards like the original did on the PlayStation 2. But there are still multiple save slots.</p><p>The game has autosave, so you don’t have to worry about potentially losing hours of progress if something happens like your power going out or the game crashes (which didn’t happen to me, to be clear). But saving often and using the slots gives you the ability to go back in case you want to replay a certain segment or if you missed something.</p><hr><p>Follow these tips, and you’ll be breezing through <em>Onimusha 2</em> in no time. They’ll be helpful no matter what difficulty you play on and how many playthroughs you do. </p><p><em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em> is now available on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and Windows PCs. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Each mission features one turtle fighting his way through these maps turn-by-turn, while enemies spawn throughout, also moving on their own turns across the grid. Your goal is often to clear out the baddies while reaching the end of the level. </p><p>At first, I was worried that this tactical and slower-paced turn-based gameplay wouldn’t feel <em>TMNT</em>-enough, that it would lack the kinetic excitement of most of the <em>Ninja Turtle</em> games and shows. But, developers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/el-paso-elsewhere-strange-scaffold-black-in-gaming-1851352903&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/el-paso-elsewhere-strange-scaffold-black-in-gaming-1851352903">Strange Scaffold</a></span> (of <em>Witch Stranding</em>, <em>E</em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/el-paso-elsewhere-max-payne-control-creepy-ps1-review-1850871547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/el-paso-elsewhere-max-payne-control-creepy-ps1-review-1850871547"><em>l, Paso Elsewhere</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>and <em>Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3</em> fame) did a great job infusing the strategic gameplay with flourishes and ideas that make it feel plenty exciting and fast-paced. </p><p>One significant way <em>TMNT: Tactical Takedown</em> makes the action feel exciting is ensuring that you don’t hang out in one area during missions. Instead, you are pushed forward every few turns as the levels grow ahead of you and fall behind you. For example, during one mission, I entered some subway trains and as the train started, the grid outside of the train turned red—a visual warning it was about to vanish—disappearing along with some goons. Then, once the train reached its station, and I had beaten up another dozen or so Foot Clan members, I exited before the carriage itself fell into the void, taking more baddies with it.</p><p> Having levels change every few turns means I had to keep moving forward, similar to an old-school beat ‘em up. And you can even take advantage of the levels changing by kicking back enemies into the red areas and watching them fall into nothing on your next turn. However, it’s even more fun to kick them off the edge of the maps, something I did a lot<em>. </em></p><p>Another design choice I appreciated is that most of the Turtles’ moves encourage you to be aggressive, and then reward it. A lot of times in <em>Tactical Takedown,</em> I was taking out multiple enemies in one turn by chaining attacks in satisfying ways, although given this also means the game is designed around you defeating tons of enemies quickly, it leads to some missions quickly filling up with Foot Clan soldiers who can too often overwhelm your Turtles if you make a mistake. I wonder if, for those hoping for a more arcade-like experience, <em>Tactical Takedown</em> might prove too tactically challenging. </p><p>Of course, any <em>TMNT </em>game is going to star the Turtles themselves, and this is easily the best part of the <em>Tactical Takedown.</em> The Turtles are separated for the entire game, mostly, and that’s a bit strange—sure, if you do enough cool shit you can pull off a team up move—but most of the time you are playing as each turtle separately. </p><figure id="" data-id="37e4cca189013898b38b002b5e4c30be" data-recommend-id="image://37e4cca189013898b38b002b5e4c30be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Strange Scaffold / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="37e4cca189013898b38b002b5e4c30be" data-recommend-id="image://37e4cca189013898b38b002b5e4c30be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But while they don’t fight side by side throughout most of the game, they do talk to each other via cutscenes, and the writing here is excellent. I won’t spoil too much, but the conflict between the brothers is the core of the tale, and it’s shocking how invested I got in the rather simple, but well-delivered story of four mutated turtle warriors dealing with grief, loss, and trying to pick up the pieces together.</p><p>Sadly, too much of<em> TMNT: Tactical Takedown</em> feels barebones. Levels look fine, but are very simple, rarely featuring varying locations or details. The Turtles all play differently, with various moves that reflect their personality, but so many sound effects are reused. Couple that with simplistic, stiff combat animations and levels that go on for too long, and <em>Tactical Takedown</em> can often feel like a game that is trying to trick you into thinking it’s more than it is.</p><p>Still, I’m happy <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> was made, and that I played it. It’s a unique spin on the franchise, and the turn-based combat is frenetic and fun. I also love the way the Turtles are depicted in cutscenes. It’s a shame that there’s not much else here, but what is there is good and feels like a solid foundation for future DLC or sequels that could add more. </p><p> <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown </em>launched on May 22 for PC. It is available now on Steam and runs great on Steam Deck. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’m sure the <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> team would love a mulligan, though there’s no evidence that’s the case here. <br></p><p>We still have no real idea what this next phase of the MCU will revolve around, other than Disney seemingly going back to the well and trying to resurrect the franchise’s earlier magic.

One thing the Star Wars spin-off can rest assured of is that no other major video games will be releasing around it that month. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
