              <p><em>Forza Horizon 6</em> will star in Microsoft’s first gaming showcase of 2026. Rockstar is still claiming fired employees were leaking game secrets. And the anime studio behind <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> is officially no more. Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture, which is even later than usual today because we’re all hung over from The Game Awards.</p> <p>I apologize. It was a late one. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> went home with almost everything. <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em> went home with literally nothing. But who’s really keeping track? <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-game-awards-3%C2%BD-hours-long-17-minutes-of-actual-awards.1381588/">Only 10 percent of the show</a> actually involved people winning awards and making speeches. But some players are still crashing out over <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pkhe5x/my_reaction_to_players_voice_i_find_it_funny/">a gacha game winning multiple trophies</a>, including “Player’s Voice.” At least they didn’t get murdered by the <em>Okami</em> social media account. Did Hideki Kamiya forget he was still logged in? Unfortunately for the person involved, it sounds like it was <a href="https://x.com/TheIshikawaRin/status/1999433036941918307">one big misunderstanding</a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">is this more to your liking <a href="https://t.co/iCrcxbvqqc">pic.twitter.com/iCrcxbvqqc</a></p> <p>— Okami (@OkamiOfficial) <a href="https://twitter.com/OkamiOfficial/status/1999217730478907748?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>Microsoft will hold its first Xbox showcase of 2026 in January</h2> <p>The company has a big raft of games due out next year and will kick things off next month with its first Developer Direct of 2026. It’ll include <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>. “I will tell you that Playground Games is going to be in the Dev Direct,” President of Microsoft gaming content Matt Booty <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/xbox-game-studios-matt-booty-call-of-duty-movie-dev-direct-plans-1236606594/">told <em>Variety</em></a>. “But we’ll have more stuff next year to ship than we can fit into one Dev Direct show in January, which is a good place to be.” <em>Fable</em>, <em>Gears: E-Day</em>, <em>Halo Remastered</em>, and more are expected to launch during the 25th anniversary of Xbox.</p>

 <h2>Microsoft admits annualizing <em>Call of Duty</em> is “difficult”</h2> <p><em>Black Ops 7</em> has performed poorly enough that Activision hasn’t released any sales metrics and has promised never to release back-to-back franchise sequels again. But Matt Booty isn’t worried.</p> <p>“Shipping a major franchise like clockwork every year is a really difficult task, and I’m really proud of what the team did to move the franchise forward in that way,” he told <em>Variety</em>. “And the interesting thing about <em>Call of Duty</em> is, I think that as an IP, it is really well positioned to continue to deliver content for players going forward; the system of seasons. And it’s not just about the launch, but it’s kind of in its own unique category and ability in terms of how the team keeps delivering content throughout the year. So we’re real happy with where we’ve landed with that.”</p>

 <h2><em>Mortal Kombat 2</em>‘s producer isn’t happy about getting dunked on by <em>Street Fighter</em></h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The cast of the Street Fighter Movie just threw BIG shots at the Mortal Kombat Movie Kast at <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheGameAwards?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheGameAwards</a>!

Claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading,” the studio wrote <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developer-rockstar-claims-fired-employees-were-dismissed-for-leaking-specific-game-features-from-upcoming-and-unannounced-titles-not-because-they-were-trying-to-unionize">in a new statement to <em>IGN</em></a>.</p> <div> <p dir="ltr">The union representing the fired developers still claims this isn’t true. “Rockstar’s latest statement is littered with falsehoods and disinformation-they have given multiple, conflicting reasons to explain why the workers were fired, as if attempting to reverse engineer a rationale for the dismissals,” the IWGB responded in a new statement of its own. “Once again, they have chosen to mischaracterize workers speaking about their working conditions in a private forum as ‘leaking information.'”</p> <h2 dir="ltr">Anime powerhouse Gainax officially shut down this week</h2> <p dir="ltr"><em>Evangelion</em> creator Hideaki Anno shared his thoughts about the studio’s troubled collapse. “As someone who has been with the company for over 20 years since its founding and has been involved as a shareholder until today, this is a truly disappointing end, but I am accepting it with a sense of urgency,” he <a href="https://www.khara.co.jp/2025/12/11/251211/">wrote</a>. The animation veteran described his view of the company’s demise which included a legal fight with its management, some of whom were once his close friends.</p> <p dir="ltr">Anno continued, “Specifically, upon learning about the various false statements made by former Fukushima Gainax representative Yoshinobu Asao, Hiroyuki Yamaga, and Yasuhiro Takeda, whom I considered friends since college, toward my company and myself, including instructions from then-President Yamaga [who was <a href="https://kotaku.com/gainax-president-arrested-after-taking-nude-photos-of-t-1840227841">arrested in 2019</a>] to Gainax employees to pretend he was hospitalized, statements that viewed our company as hostile, and schemes to unfairly avoid repayment, I have gone beyond anger to sadness.”</p> <div dir="ltr"> <h2>Xbox exclusive<em> South of Midnight</em> moves to Switch 2 and PS5 in the spring</h2> <p>That’s roughly a year <a href="https://x.com/CompulsionGames/status/1999265189204754913">after it launched</a>. Along with <em>Avowed</em> and <em>Keeper</em>, it was one of the rare new Xbox releases that was still a console exclusive.

Now, every monster that can undergo one of these superpowered transformations can do so in the RPG, including ones that were omitted from the original roster. However, there </span><i><span>is </span></i><span>one of these evolutions that is still missing from the game; you just might not know about it if you haven’t been paying attention to the leaks and datamining communities.</span></p> <p><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>introduces Z forms for two Pokémon who were already able to Mega Evolve. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-evolution-lucario-z-2000649602"><span>Lucario</span></a><span> and Absol have had standard Megas since the mechanic was introduced in </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>, and the DLC adds new ones that change their appearance and give them a special mechanic that lets them speed up their cooldowns at the expense of a prolonged transformation. It seemed odd that Game Freak would create a whole new mechanic for only two monsters, so perhaps it’s not surprising that a third one is in the game’s code, but isn’t obtainable in the game.</span></p>

 <p><span>Garchomp is apparently the third Z form in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, but at the moment, the only traces of it are in datamined models. Fans hypothesize that Game Freak is planning on giving players a new Mega Stone to transform their own dragon/ground beasts into this new form in <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mewtwo-mega-evolution-stones-quest-2000649609">an upcoming event</a>. Despite this, dataminers have unearthed the new form’s model, which you can see below:</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="es" dir="ltr">Mega Garchomp Z <a href="https://t.co/iPy8aHPHD8">pic.twitter.com/iPy8aHPHD8</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1998838515866431571?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>I knew about Garchomp Z from <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-evolutions-2000641670">previous leaks</a>, and was surprised I hadn’t seen it after putting over a dozen hours into </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>thus far. I’ve faced new Megas for Legendary and Mythical monsters already, and I know Garchomp is a ferocious beast, but it doesn’t seem like something you’d turn into an endgame battle after players have faced the final boss, so this explanation makes some sense. We’ll see if the Garchomp Z stone is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-hyperspace-donuts-tips-2000652670"><span>as much of a grind</span></a><span> to get as most other things in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span> whenever Game Freak releases it.</span></p>

              <p>In a night filled with gory trailers for loud action games, one of the new reveals at The Game Awards stood out for its gentle nature: <em>Coven of the Chicken Foot</em>. The game defied almost every trend of the night: it was a single-player game, in a beautiful cel-shaded animation style, in which the main character is an elderly woman. This, it turns out, is the first new game from Bruce Straley, one of the co-directors of the original&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>, since he left Naughty Dog in 2017.</p> <p>In <a href="https://www.polygon.com/bruce-straley-naughty-dog-exit-interview/">an interview with&nbsp;<em>Polygon</em></a>, Straley spoke for the first time about his surprise exit from Naughty Dog, soon after shipping his last game with the company,&nbsp;<em>Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End</em>. After 18 years at the developer, Straley found himself struggling with a sense of repetition as the studio settled into making, you know, Naughty Dog sorts of games. (In the two decades prior, the company had also put out both <em>Crash Bandicoot</em> and&nbsp;<em>Jak and Daxter</em> games, before settling on the cinematic action of <em>Uncharted</em> and&nbsp;<em>TLOU</em>, the only game series Naughty Dog has released since 2007.)</p>

 <p>“I felt like I was answering the same questions over and over again,” Straley told <em>Polygon</em>. “We were kind of in this paradigm of this style of game—that I was part of creating! But it felt like I’ve been in this position before. My brain isn’t good with that type of repetition. I need new problems to solve, I need new creative outlets. I’m not saying there wouldn’t be opportunities there, but couple that feeling with the idea that I was working really, really hard at something that wasn’t mine.”</p>

  <p><em>Coven of the Chicken Foot</em><em>&nbsp;</em>is certainly a significant step away. The first game from Wildflower Interactive, a 16-person team established in 2021, it describes itself as an “emotionally rich, stylized, single-player adventure.” You play as an elderly witch called Gertie, accompanied by a peculiar creature who will learn from Gertie’s actions how to best assist her in their journeys through woods, dungeons and bogs. The claim is that this unnamed beast will be an NPC dynamically shaped by how you play the game.</p> <p>Elderly women are extraordinarily under-represented in video games, almost always confined to being evil antagonists—the only other example of a playable elderly woman I can think of is in Tale of Tales’ 2008 tiny game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/27020/The_Graveyard/"><em>The Graveyard</em></a> (which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/preview-the-graveyard">I loved</a>).&nbsp;<em>Coven</em> looks charming, if a little too close to&nbsp;<em>Ori </em>in its&nbsp;creature design (and vocal sounds for that matter) for my liking. There’s no release date at this point, but you can of course already <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3041680/Coven_of_the_Chicken_Foot/">wishlist the game on Steam</a>.</p>
