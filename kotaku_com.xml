            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It was around the time that I was fighting a giant plant monster in a chemically induced hallucination themed around hate and guilt that I realized this year’s </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> is a strange one. But moments of strangeness, even a few memorable or inspired ones, can’t hide the fact that this latest installment is the digital equivalent of throwing stuff at the wall and seeing what sticks.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-art-user-reviews-steam-2000644734"><i><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</span></i></a><span>’s co-op campaign is a direct sequel to </span><i><span>Black Ops 2</span></i><span>, featuring many characters from and references to this fan-favorite entry. Yet in the end, all those nods to </span><i><span>BLOPS2</span></i><span> just serve as a reminder of how much better that campaign was than this collection of random ideas that you can play either solo or with up to three other buddies.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>And then…and then…and then….</b></h2> <p><span>If I were to describe the plot of </span><i><span>Black Ops 7 </span></i><span>to you out loud, I would sound like a 6-year-old kid who was asked to come up with a big action-packed story on the fly.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>“Okay, so some soldiers go to a secret island to fight a bad lady and her evil company, but it’s a trap, and they are drugged with a gas like from the Batman movies that makes you see scary stuff from your memories and past. Oh, and they are all connected via brain chips, so they all see the same things. And then they fight bad soldiers. Oh, and robots! And also zombies. And then a giant plant monster. And then a giant person. And they go to Tokyo. And then fight some spiders. And then they uh, oh, start a prison riot with undead inmates and uh go underwater to fight giant mechs using big missiles before winning and saving the day. The end!”&nbsp;</span></i></p>

 <p><span>It’s borderline nonsensical and only barely works as a story at all because of some great voice performances and some incredibly expensive-looking cutscenes. It’s a shame that the entire four- to five-hour campaign feels cobbled together in a short amount of time, but considering Treyarch, which co-developed this game, was also the lead developer on last year’s </span><i><span>Black Ops 6</span></i><span>, it’s not surprising, either.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>At least the guns still feel good, and I wasn’t bored because when you’re dealing with this level of batshit nonsense, it’s at least interesting to see what ludicrous scenario the game is gonna throw you into next. Shooting, sliding, jumping, and now wall-jumping (more on that later) are fun regardless of what I’m killing. Less fun and more annoying is that RPG elements have woven their way into the campaign, so you reach points where enemies take a lot of bullets to kill, and you have to wait for the game to decide to end your pain and give you a damage upgrade. Bleh. No good. Don’t like. Never bring this back, thank you.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Speaking of annoying things I never want to see return, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-slop-regulation-2000644735"><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i></a><span> introduces an always-online open world to explore between bigger missions. Even though I played solo, sometimes other players would speak during cutscenes when I was teleported back to this part of the campaign, which acts like an always-online pseudo-hub between some missions. And there’s little to do in these moments. It’s weird, adds nothing, and is <a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-7-campaign-coop-always-online-pause-co-op-xp-challenges-2000644358">likely the reason I can’t pause </a></span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-7-campaign-coop-always-online-pause-co-op-xp-challenges-2000644358"><i><span>BLOPS7</span></i></a><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-7-campaign-coop-always-online-pause-co-op-xp-challenges-2000644358"> while playing the campaign</a>, which is yet one more strange choice to add to the pile of odd decisions that make up this year’s</span><i><span> Call of Duty.</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2><b>Okay, whatever, what about multiplayer!?&nbsp;</b></h2> <p><span>I’m not stupid. I know that </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> is a multiplayer franchise. Most people are buying these games not for the single-player adventure, but for the months of deathmatch they’ll get to play with friends and randoms. And thankfully, this part of</span><i><span> Black Ops 7</span></i><span> is a lot better than the campaign. But if you played last year’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-beta-weekend-1851638800"><i><span>Black Ops 6</span></i></a><span>, you’ll likely feel a big sense of deja vu.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>BLOPS 7</span></i><span> multiplayer feels very, very similar to that of the last entry, down to menus, perks, and gunplay. Now, that’s not inherently horrible, and considering how successful </span><i><span>BLOPS 6</span></i><span> was, it makes sense to build upon that for the follow-up.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>However, I found a lot of the weapons in </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span> to feel very same-y and not distinct at all. I bounced around a few guns in the dozen hours I spent with multiplayer and never found one I particularly liked or hated. They all just mostly blended together, with the only distinction being “Oh, this one is burst fire” or “This is a sniper.” I remember the guns in </span><i><span>BLOPS6</span></i><span> being far more distinct and interesting, and swapping between them was a lot more exciting as a result, as were the firefights against other players.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Maps aren’t a strong element of </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span>, either. Some are genuinely very good, but those are mostly the maps ripped from past </span><i><span>Black Ops </span></i><span>games, like Hijacked (which also appears as a level in the game’s campaign). The new maps felt too big for the number of players found in most game modes, and none of them have stuck in my brain. Maybe in a few weeks, some of these new maps will join my list of best </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> maps ever made. But at the moment… ehhh.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>       <div>                                         <figure>                            </figure>                           <div>                      <p>             Call Of Duty: Black Ops 7           </p>                                       </div>       </div>               <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“War never changes…wait a minute, is that a giant plant monster?”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer</p>                 <p>Treyarch / various other Activision Studios</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Near-future military online FPS with zombie survival mode  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked</p>                 <p>Fantastic cutscenes, snappy and responsive gunplay, and wall-hopping.  </p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Bad campaign, bland guns and maps, and performance problems.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PS5 (played), PS4, PC  </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Finished the campaign in about five hours, played 13 hours of multiplayer, and a few hours of zombies.  </p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>           </div>  <p><span>Perhaps the biggest change found in </span><i><span>BLOPS7</span></i><span>’s multiplayer is the ability to wall hop. This builds on the fantastic omnimovement that debuted in </span><i><span>Black Ops 6, </span></i><span>which let players sprint in any direction and made </span><i><span>CoD</span></i><span> faster than ever.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Wall hops add a new tool to the movement kit, and I love it. Being able to bounce up a wall into a window or over a garage is so much fun. It can also be used to escape an enemy, ambush a group of unsuspecting players, or reach an out-of-the-way spot to do some camping. Shut up, it’s a legitimate strategy.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While my old-man thumbs and fingers sometimes fail to keep up with the youth and their fancy slides, I still mostly had a good time with </span><i><span>BLOPS7</span></i><span>’s multiplayer, even despite the maps being meh and no one gun calling to me. Wall bounces add just enough extra flavor to fights to shake things up, while not getting in the way of the hyper-responsive FPS action </span><i><span>CoD</span></i><span> has long been known for.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I do, however, want to flag that on PS5 Pro, I ran into a ton of random performance issues during multiplayer. This really soured my experience. Even a bad </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> typically runs well, so I was surprised to see so many dropped frames and slowdowns happen in </span><i><span>BLOPS7</span></i><span>. Hopefully, a future patch can improve the situation.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Zombies and the <em>Battlefield</em>-sized elephant in the room</b></h2> <p><span>I’m not a </span><i><span>CoD </span></i><span>Zombies expert, so I can’t speak to specifics about the mode in this year’s entry, but I can say that I enjoyed my time with it. In a lot of ways, Zombies in </span><i><span>BLOPS 7</span></i><span> feels like a return to the versions found in older </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> games, and I like that.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>You can play a classic rounds-based version of Zombies set in one map. I also appreciate that for the first time ever, when playing solo, you can leave a Zombies match and come back later and pick up where you left off. Fucking </span><i><span>wild </span></i><span>that Zombies has a pause option, basically, while the campaign doesn’t. Strange!</span></p>

 <p><span>I would try to explain the story of Zombies, but it is so obtuse and deep at this point, involving multiple dimensions and a dozen characters spread over multiple games and timelines, that I’m just not going to attempt it. There’s a new cowboy-like demon zombie who is really bad, and I think I’m supposed to kill him by completing the main quest found in the primary Zombies mode. To explain more would require a trip to the </span><i><span>CoD</span></i><span> Zombies wiki, and I’m not interested in falling down that wormhole.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000645203" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000645203"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000645203">©Activision</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In a vacuum, this year’s </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> is a weird, really big, and mostly bad misfire that I doubt hurts the franchise all that much in the long run. But if we look beyond </span><i><span>Black Ops 7 </span></i><span>and consider the larger context, this might be the worst version of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912"><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i></a><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912"> for Activision to have launched in 2025,</a> as it’s going up against the super popular, grounded, and back-to-basics </span><i><span>Battlefield 6</span></i><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I bounced between both games over the weekend, and I think that once again, moment-to-moment, </span><i><span>Call of Duty</span></i><span> looks sharper and plays better than </span><i><span>Battlefield</span></i><span>. This has long been the case with these two FPS rivals. But when it comes to content and delivering what fans want, I think</span><i><span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379">Battlefield 6</a> </span></i><span>wins hands down.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Make no mistake, both games have flaws. But</span><i><span> BF6</span></i><span>’s problems can be solved with some patches and a few big maps. </span><i><span>Black Ops 7</span></i><span> can’t be fixed because it isn’t broken, it’s just a weird and incoherent mess that feels more like a fan mod or big update for </span><i><span>BLOPS6</span></i><span> than a proper sequel. And it certainly doesn’t seem like the game </span><i><span>Call of Duty </span></i><span>needed in 2025, but rather just the one we got because Activision can’t let the franchise take a break. Ah well, there’s always next year…&nbsp;</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dispatch%E2%80%99s-best-scene-is-as-funny-as-it-is-violent.1357108/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/dispatch-review-adhoc-studios-all-8-episodes-finale-2000644106"><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> eight-episode run is over, and I stand firm in my belief that the best moment in AdHoc’s superhero workplace comedy comes in episode five, “Team Building.” As the title suggests, protagonist Robert Robertson III takes his staff of reformed villains out for a night at a bar. The problem is, they’re headed to a villain bar. Robert certainly doesn’t look the part, and the bar’s goon and lackey patrons are ready to start a fight when they see him there. What happens next is probably </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span>’s best use of the old Telltale house style, and it’s got players popping off and covering their eyes in equal measure.</span></p>  <p><span>The fight begins with Robert getting a blow to the back of the head, then waking up with his team outside a fast-food joint. At first, you think Robert was knocked out cold and his team got him out of there, so now they’re all just crashing at the local, legally distinct Taco Bell. But then, the group starts to hand Robert his food, and suddenly, you have a QTE to stick your straw in your soda. All right, seems an odd moment to introduce a QTE given that the game uses those pretty sparingly, but—holy shit, I just stabbed a man in the face with a handful of darts!</span></p>

  <p><span>No, Mecha Man did not simply go down without a fight, and the Z-Team wasn’t about to let their boss get made a fool of at their favorite watering hole. So now we swap back and forth between the quiet calm of Z-Team’s late-night snack run and the comically violent excess of their earlier bar brawl. Folks, it’s absolute cinema. The whole fight is set to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6v3vKeg1Ws"><span>Thot Squad’s “Hoes Depressed,”</span></a><span> a catchy-as-hell cheerleader-style hip-hop bop performed by Prism, the Z-Team’s light-manipulating influencer. As the bass bumps through the bar, Robert and co. are making the Red Ring thugs regret even glancing in their direction.</span></p>

 <p><span>There are so many standout gags, I don’t even know where to begin. Prism using her light powers to swat away a man who dared to interrupt her performance, causing him to cover his face and scream that she “temporarily” blinded him, only for her to retort, “Fuck you mean, ‘temporarily’? Bitch, you blind foreva!” is a standout. I also love when the devilish Malevola opens a portal outside the bar, allowing Golem, the team’s giant mud monster who had been exiled outside the establishment, to come in like a bull in a china shop. Punch Up using his short stature to run around below most people’s line of sight and give everyone a fist to the nads is also pretty fun. Those individual character moments are great, but the most effective parts of the whole sequence are the QTE-driven transitions between chilling at the not-Taco Bell and Robert doing some of the most violent non-lethal things he can do to a low-level grunt.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Every time </span><i><span>Dispatch</span></i><span> went back to the restaurant and the Z-Team started giving each other shit about the way the night went, it went on just long enough to lull me into a sense of familiar ease, having forgotten the carnage I had just watched unfold. Then, someone would hand Robert something inconspicuous, like a hot sauce packet, I’d tear the packet open—and immediately be thrown into a scene of Robert yanking the cybernetic implants out of someone’s skull. By the time I was actually biting into the food I’d ordered, I knew not to let my guard down and braced myself for the game to leap back and show me what Robert bit into back at the bar. In addition to being very exciting to play, those moments have been some of the most entertaining to watch people react to, because even after </span><i><span>Dispatch </span></i><span>has established this trick, it still manages to catch players off guard.</span></p>           <p><span>The whole ordeal does end up accomplishing what Robert set out to do, at least. The team becomes a lot closer, and, depending on your choices, will trust their boss more than ever. Sometimes, all you need to bridge the gap between heroes and villains is a good bar brawl.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Fleshy, floaty, fabulous. That’s</span><i><span> Morsels</span></i><span> in a nutshell. A top-down action roguelike in which you collect creatures and swap between their unique powers, it shares familiar DNA with games like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/binding-of-isaac-is-gonna-take-over-my-life-again-1619872452"><i><span>The Binding of Isaac</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nuclear-throne-challenge-completed-beat-the-game-with-1573122068"><i><span>Nuclear Throne</span></i><span>,</span></a><span> but with a </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>-style twist that has you collecting little creatures and harnessing their powers to overcome an on-screen frenzy of gnarly hazards. I love it.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It looks great. It sounds great. I’m having a great time with </span><i><span>Morsels</span></i><span>, even if most of the game still feels like a hard-to-intuit fever dream right now. You technically play as a mouse who is gifted these shape-shifting abilities to take on the appearance and upgrades of various titular morsels as you climb the levels of a colorful sewer to thwart the domination of the cats above. Some shoot lasers. Some fart gas. Others augment your dash. Each comes with its own bubblegum-wrapper flavor text.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I’ve only played three hours of </span><i><span>Morsels </span></i><span>so far. That is not nearly enough to work my brain around all of its unusual logic and hidden secrets, which like any great roguelike are embedded within the monotonous but rewarding fabric of trial and error. But it is enough to know that </span><i><span>Morsels</span></i><span> is not just a fun gimmick wrapped up in a slick aesthetic. I can’t definitively say it has the roguelike juice just yet. However, it is already one of the most intriguing games I’ve played this year.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000645176" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000645176"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000645176">Furcula / Annapurna Interactive</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Made by Furcula and published by Annapurna Interactive, </span><i><span>Morsels </span></i><span>counts among its development team programmer Iggy Zuk (</span><i><span>Bad Ice Cream</span></i><span>), artist Toby Dixon (</span><i><span>Atomicrops</span></i><span>), and composer Sam Webster (</span><i><span>Grindstone</span></i><span>). The world looks like it was made out of the intestines of cows who grazed on confetti and </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD3jJ0LGPEQ"><span>sounds like</span></a><span> lo-fi acid jazz beats to fester to. With a bubbly bullet-hell action loop pulsing at its core, the overall effect produced is that of a trippy tea party hosted inside a garden full of composting garbage. I mean that in the most delightful way possible.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The other thing to know about <em>Morsels</em> is just how much it revels in visual chaos. It’s not as simple as kill/avoid everything else that moves. In fact, playthroughs across meandering levels that often loop back around on themselves are full of strange creatures, neutral NPCs, and side objectives which don’t immediately explain themselves. On paper, <em>Morsels </em>sounds like pretty familiar genre fare, but the actual experience of playing it had me constantly asking “what the hell is going on?” while looking at my screen</span><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>That frenetic sense of uncertainty and mystery, along with the beautiful art and an incredible soundtrack (maybe my favorite of the year) is making <em>Morsels</em> feel like a nice jolt of anxious energy after dozens of hours pulling</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ball-x-pit-vampire-survivors-balatro-roguelike-2000642155"><span>slot machine levers in RNG-heavy roguelikes</span></a><span> that reward you for playing them with making you play them less. Will it have the long-term depth of a </span><i><span>Spelunky</span></i><span>? We’ll see. For now, it has my attention.&nbsp;</span></p>

              <p>Nintendo Switch users squint at the 7-inch handheld screen for hours on end and lose important visual details and straining their eyes in marathon gaming sessions. <strong>Portable monitors solve that by turning handheld consoles into proper gaming rigs</strong> wherever you go and acting as secondary displays for laptop productivity.</p>
<p>This<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5381/"> 15.6-inch monitor gets 1080p resolution in an ultra-thin frame, now sitting at $49 instead of the usual $59 price tag</a>. That pricing undercuts budget gaming controllers but offers functionality that fundamentally shifts how you work and play on the go. The <strong>monitor itself weighs just 1.43 pounds</strong> with a built-in kickstand and makes it truly portable rather than another heavy accessory collecting dust at home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5381/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD IPS Display with 178-Degree Viewing Angles</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch display supports 1920 x 1080 with IPS panel technology</strong> that keeps color and brightness accurate from extreme angles up to 178 degrees. You can position the monitor off to the side when giving presentations or working collaboratively, and colors won’t shift or contrast degrade for viewers at an angle. The designation of an IPS A-grade panel indicates even better panel selection with fewer dead pixels and more consistent backlighting than that found on less-costly panels.<strong> HDR support</strong> will extend the dynamic range in content that supports the feature, brightening highlights and deepening shadows to a more life-like image reproduction.</p>
<p><strong>Low blue light mode</strong> reduces eye strain during extended viewing by filtering out harmful blue wavelengths that contribute to fatigue and sleep disruption. That matters during marathon gaming sessions or situations at work when you’re staring at screens all day for eight-plus hours. The screen also comes with a matte anti-glare coating diffusing any reflections from overhead lights or windows and keeps the screen visible under bright conditions where glossy displays become mirrors. <strong>Response time sits around 5ms</strong> and keeps everything smooth for casual gaming and video playback.</p>



<p><strong>Dual USB-C ports</strong> provide both power and video signal over a single cable when connected to supported devices. Newer laptops using Thunderbolt 3.0, Thunderbolt 4.0, or USB 3.1 Type-C with DisplayPort Alt Mode transmit video over USB-C and removes the need for a separate power adapter or video cables. The second USB-C port acts as a dedicated power input for those devices that cannot supply enough power over their USB-C ports. Additionally,<strong> a Mini HDMI port</strong> is available for older laptops, desktops, and game consoles that depend on traditional video outputs.</p>
<p><strong>The Nintendo Switch connects through USB-C</strong> when the unit is docked or via Mini HDMI with an adapter, and it upgrades instantly from a 7-inch handheld screen to a proper 15.6-inch display. PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series consoles all connect via HDMI, making the portable monitor a dedicated gaming display for bedrooms or travel.</p>



<p>It has dual built-in speakers along the bottom edge and offers stereo sound that is much clearer and louder than laptop speakers. The audio quality remains adequate for video calling, casual gaming and streaming content, though serious gaming or music listening could benefit with headphones or external speakers. The volume controls sit on the side panel alongside power and menu buttons for adjusting brightness and contrast and selecting between inputs.</p>
<p>The monitor <strong>does not rely on external power adapters in the case of devices</strong> that supply sufficient USB-C power when connected. This ensures cable simplicity during travels. In the event of low-power devices, connecting the second USB-C to a power source becomes necessary-an addition of one more cable to your setup. Power consumption remains less than 10 watts during normal use, hence drawing little power from the connected laptops or power banks.</p>
<p>You pay less than most budget game controllers for a full 1080p display that expands your gaming and productivity capabilities at $49. Most competing 15.6-inch portable monitorsbetween $120 to $200 with similar specs which makes this sale drop the price to buy levels.</p>

              <p>The cost of gaming is too damn high. Seriously, these machines just keep going up in price and every year it feels like we’re getting closer to $90-$100 games. Keeping an eye on sales is essential these days, and thankfully, if you’re in the market for a PS5, you can save a full Benjamin on the cost of a new one thanks to <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-friday-2025-ps5-discount-sale-pro-2000644002">Sony’s Black Friday 2025 deal</a>.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-review-one-year-later-worth-it-price-4k-games-2000642988">One Year Later, I’ve Forgotten I Even Own A PS5 Pro</a></p> <p>Black Friday, the most sacrosanct of consumerist holidays, will see Sony offer a suite of PS5 bundles, as well as a flat $100 discount on PS5 Digital Edition, the disc-based version, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-review-one-year-later-worth-it-price-4k-games-2000642988">the PS5 Pro</a>. Sony has outlined the specifics of the deals over on its official <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/11/18/playstations-black-friday-deals-2025/">PlayStation blog</a>. Console savings include:</p>

 <ul> <li aria-level="1">The PS5 Digital Edition 825GB – Fortnite Flowering Chaos Bundle will be available at a recommended retail price of $399.99 USD and the PS5 Console 1TB – Fortnite Flowering Chaos Bundle will be available at a recommended retail price of $449.99. The bundle offerings feature PlayStation-exclusive in-game content** and 1,000 V-Bucks.</li> <li aria-level="1">In select regions, players can also save $100USD on PS5 consoles and $100 USD on PS5 Digital Edition consoles.*</li> <li aria-level="1">Gamers looking for the most visually impressive PS5 gaming experience can also save $100 USD on PS5 Pro consoles.*</li> </ul> <p>But that’s not all. Sony is also taking $100 off of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps-vr2-ps5-sony-oculus-meta-quest-valve-index-alyx-1850121563">PS VR2</a> (which you can also use on a PC with the right adapter, I might add). You can also pick up a new DualSense controller for $20 off, or for $30 off of the more premium (and very good) DualSense Edge gamepad.</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">$100 USD off PlayStation VR2</li> <li aria-level="1">$20 USD off PlayStation Portal remote player</li> <li aria-level="1">$20 USD off Pulse Elite wireless headset</li> <li aria-level="1">$30 USD off Pulse Explore wireless earbuds</li> <li aria-level="1">$30 USD off DualSense Edge wireless controller</li> <li aria-level="1">$20 USD off DualSense wireless controller</li> <li aria-level="1">$20 USD off Access controller</li> <li aria-level="1">Various discounts on PS5 games such as <em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, <em>Lost Soul Aside</em>, <em>Astro Bot</em>, and <em>God of War Ragnarök</em></li> </ul> <p>Speaking for myself, my current controller is starting to show signs of drift, so I’m likely eyeing a new controller anyway. That or I’m gonna get creative with a soldering iron (which might end up being a wildly more expensive indulgence).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good morning! The time is [Redacted] and welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily roundup of interesting news, shit you might care about, and [Redacted]. We hope you enjoy your visit and get to learn more about Valve’s newly revealed Steam Machines, <em>Roblox</em> face-scanning tech, [Redacted], and Shroud’s problems with the Game Awards. And remember, please don’t [Redacted] or you might [Redacted]. Have a great day!</p>  <p>Popular video game streamer and <a href="https://kotaku.com/spectre-divide-shroud-refunds-season-1-shutting-down-1851769661">content creator Shroud</a> is a big fan of this year’s excellent extraction shooter <em>Arc Raiders.</em> And he’s not, apparently, a fan of the Game Awards snubbing the game for its Game of the Year award.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-world-is-just-not-ready-for-ai-in-video-games-shroud-accuses-the-game-awards-of-being-rigged-following-arc-raiders-goty-snub">As reported by <em>IGN</em>,</a> in a recent Twitch stream, Shroud watched the Game Awards nominees being announced and, upon seeing that<em> Arc Raiders</em> wasn’t in the running for the big GOTY award, expressed disappointment, saying, “The world is just not ready for AI in video games, not yet. They’re just not ready. But, hey, at least they nominated it for something. I genuinely thought they wouldn’t nominate it for anything because they were scared to get backlash. But at least they nominated it for something, so that’s good.” He then stated: “Once again, another year, another rigged year. That’s crazy.” Even before the nominees were revealed, <a href="https://x.com/shroud/status/1990460220020240848">he was claiming the show might be rigged.&nbsp;</a></p>

 <p>It’s a bit odd to suggest the world isn’t ready for <em>Arc Raiders</em>, considering it’s one of the most-played games on Steam right now and has received heaps of critical praise. And there is zero evidence that the Game Awards this year or any previous year are rigged. The awards are voted on by a panel of members of the games media and influencers. <em>IGN </em>reports that later in the stream, &nbsp;Shroud expressed disappointment at the possibility of <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> winning, asking “who the fuck is playing” the Switch 2 platformer.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Roblox</em> rolls out age verification via face scanning</strong></h2> <p>Prepare to have your face scanned before playing <em>Roblox</em>. The extremely popular online free-to-play game has started <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/roblox-begins-rolling-out-age-checks-using-facial-age-estimation-technology">rolling out a voluntary face-scanning system</a> that will be used to check a player’s age and limit the ability for kids and adults to communicate. For now, you won’t need to verify your age by scanning your face with the <em>Roblox</em> app to play experiences online, but certain chat features will be locked behind the new process. And next year, age verification via a face scan will be required globally for all players to access the game at all. The company promises that it will delete all images and videos “immediately after processing.”</p>

 <h2><strong><em>KPop Demon Hunters</em> balloons will be included in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000645171" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000645171"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000645171">©Macy’s / Netflix</figcaption></figure> <p>Netflix’s hit animated movie <em>KPop Demon Hunters </em>continues to take over the world. Two characters from the cartoon, Derpy Tiger and Sussie, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/harry-potter-goblet-of-fire-movie-20-anniversary-voldemort-better-book/?link_source=ta_bluesky_link&amp;taid=691c910e43e91a00019ec3e1&amp;utm_campaign=trueanthem&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=bluesky">will be featured in the annual parade’s 99th installment next week as large, colorful balloons</a>. I’ve still not seen the movie yet, so I don’t have much to add beyond the fact that the balloons look cool and oh god it’s almost Thanksgiving and I have done zero Christmas shopping or planning.</p>

 <h2><strong>Close to a decade after launch, Epic finally adds gifting to its store</strong></h2> <p>Seven years after launch, the Epic Game Store has finally added the ability to gift games to other players on the platform, a feature Valve’s Steam store has supported for years now. <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/gifting-now-available-on-egs">According to a blog post</a> about the new feature, players can now buy and send games directly to people on their Epic friends lists. Gifted games can only be sent to friends and they must not own the game already. If they decline it, you get a full refund.</p>

 <h2><strong>Steam Machines are more powerful than 70 percent of PCs that use Steam</strong></h2> <p>Valve’s recently announced Steam Machine, a console-like PC device for your TV, is supposedly more powerful than the majority of computers using Steam in 2025. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-pcs/valve-says-the-steam-machine-is-better-than-what-70-percent-of-pc-gamers-have-at-home-a-convenient-reminder-that-not-all-gaming-pcs-are-monster-rigs/">That’s according to Valve, as spotted by <em>PC Gamer.</em></a> In a recent video from Tested, the channel talked to Valve engineers who explained that for most Steam users, the upcoming Steam Machine will be an upgrade.</p>

 <p>“Another thing that we actually looked at is the Steam Hardware Survey,” said Valve. “Basically, that just gives us a good benchmark of where people’s home devices are at in terms of performance. And the Steam Machine is equal or better than 70 percent of what people have at home.”</p> <p>A good reminder that most people playing PC games aren’t running powerful rigs with cutting-edge tech, but are instead rocking budget builds with older, less powerful parts. So if the Steam Machine is priced smartly, it could be a big hit for those gamers looking to upgrade.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">Please stop cancelling Yoko Taro’s games</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">And here are your Game Awards 2025 nominees</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/escape-from-tarkov-steam-1-0-unheard-edition-2000644941">Everybody is mad about <em>Escape from Tarkov</em> on Steam</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>
