For example, werewolf superhero Wolfpack is one of the original Creature Commandos members in the comics, known for tearing through Nazi flesh with his claws and teeth. Unfortunately, however, his werewolf nature worked against him for Gunn’s version of the team. “I definitely considered Wolfpack, and, especially, Man-Bat (one of my faves),”<strong>&nbsp;</strong>he wrote. “But I knew I wanted to tell Weasel’s story so it felt like too many rabid and fuzzy characters.”</p><p>As much as it may anger comic book fanboys who decry any deviation from the source material, Gunn wanted to make <em>Creature Commandos</em> his own. He expressed interest in not simply copying the Creature Commandos lineup from the comic books, even if it meant excluding fan-favorites. </p><p>“I considered Vincent Velcoro but wanted to choose a ‘creature’ far outside the usual roster from another part of DC - so I went with Dr. Phosphorous instead. I also considered Solomon Grundy, another favorite, but was pretty set on Frankenstein.”</p><p>His divisive choices appear to have paid off. The DC Studios animated series currently has an elite <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/creature_commandos/s01&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/creature_commandos/s01" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">95% Tomatometer score</a></span> on Rotten Tomatoes, and was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/creature-commandos-renewed-season-2-1236257969/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/creature-commandos-renewed-season-2-1236257969/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">renewed for a second season</a></span> before the first season ended. Beyond the numbers and renewals, <em>Creature Commandos</em> stands out as the rare animated series to both subvert the superhero genre with vulgar and bloody depictions while also delivering heartfelt stories about its core characters. Why else do you think people were crying real tears at the origin story of a rabid and deranged hero named Weasel?</p><p>Trust in Gunn, and all will be right. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We may still provide titles that can be playable on both PS4 and PS5 consoles after this date.”</p><p>In the meantime there are still several months of PS4 games coming to the service, with February’s newly revealed haul including the following, available to download between February 4 and March 3:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong><em>Payday 3</em> | PS5</strong></li><li><strong><em>High on Life </em>| PS4, PS5</strong></li><li><strong><em>Pac-Man World Re-Pac</em> | PS4, PS5 </strong><br></li></ul></blockquote><p>Today’s announcement gives current PS4 owners a year’s notice to reconsider whether they want to renew their subscriptions even after the main perk of the service drops out for them. But PS4 players can still claim PS5 games and eventually download and play them once they do decide to make the jump to Sony’s newest hardware. That’s one of the benefits of the current PSN ecosystem: fans’ libraries should remain intact and compatible between console generations, including (hopefully) whenever the PS6 comes out. </p><p>PS Plus subscribers on PS4 had a pretty good run, starting in 2013 with the launch of the console and <em>Resogun</em>, through day-and-date indie releases like <em>Rocket League</em>, as well as blockbusters arriving long after release like the <em>Batman: Arkham trilogy</em>. It will have been 12 years and change by the time PS Plus moves on from PS4, and a similar length of time from when Sony stopped adding monthly PS3 games after the PS4 came out (which happened in February 2019).</p><p>But there are still many months to go of new PS4 games being given away on PS Plus.

Not only do you need the headset (which retains its $549.99 MSRP as of writing), you’ll need a computer powerful enough to handle VR gaming. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-prepare-ps-vr2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-prepare-ps-vr2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can view the PC requirements to use the VR2 here</a></span>, but the TLDR is that <strong>you’ll need a relatively powerful graphics card that has a spare DisplayPort for you to use.</strong> That last part is perhaps most important: You need to have a monitor <em>and</em> your PSVR2 headset plugged in at the same time. The NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1650 came out in 2019 and is listed as a minimum requirement, though Sony recommends either a NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 or AMD Radeon RX 6600XT or later for “best performance.” You’ll also have to buy the correct peripherals to make it work, since the PlayStation VR2 box isn’t going to give you everything you need out of the box. </p><p>If these obstacles seem surmountable and you’re determined to see your PlayStation Headset and your PC work together in gaming harmony, here’s everything you’ll need to get it up and running.</p><figure id="" data-id="cab3988a81bd4a774d98b8b589139497" data-recommend-id="image://cab3988a81bd4a774d98b8b589139497" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1333" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A promotional image of the PlayStation VR2 PC Adapter.

Amazon reviews indicate that these either work poorly or don’t run at all, so an official Sony Adapter remains ideal despite its scarcity. Make sure you’re purchasing from an official storefront (check for <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D92XQL22?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/psvr2-pc-adapter-bluetooth-connection-displayport-1851750509&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0D92XQL22" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">the PlayStation Store mention on Amazon</a></span>), and look for the PlayStation logo on the adapter itself.</p><h2 id="h6035"><a id="2"></a>Step 2: Get equipped with the other accessories you’ll need</h2><p>In a perfect world, the VR2 Headset and adapter would give you everything you need to get into PC VR gaming. Unfortunately, you still might have to spend some extra cash. <strong>The first thing you’ll need is a spare DisplayPort cable</strong> to connect your adapter to your graphics card. Yes, <strong>you <em>do </em>need to have your monitor and headset connected at the same time</strong>, so this isn’t a corner you can reasonably cut. </p><p>The second thing you might need is <strong>a supported Bluetooth dongle</strong>. We’ll get into this below, but some PSVR2 Adapter owners have reported needing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-ps-vr2-bluetooth/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-ps-vr2-bluetooth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the Bluetooth dongles recommended by Sony</a></span> to get the smoothest performance possible. This will probably cost you about $20, though you can find lower prices if you shop at the right time.</p><p>Combined with the headset, this means <strong>you’ll need to spend between $60 and $90 in total to get your PlayStation VR2 headset to work on your computer</strong>. That’s much cheaper than buying a new headset just for your PC, but you’ll have to decide if that’s a price you’re willing to pay before you even drop cash on <em>Half-Life Alyx</em>.</p><h2 id="h6036"><a id="3"></a>Step 3: Set up your PlayStation VR2 Headset on your PC</h2><div><p>Once you have all the necessary components together, plug your adaptor into a power outlet and use your DisplayPort cable to plug the adaptor into your computer’s GPU (make sure you use the right slot!). Plug your headset into the adaptor, turn it on, and then open up Steam. </p></div><p>Next, find and download both <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the PlayStation VR2 app</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/250820/SteamVR/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam VR</a></span>. Open the PlayStation VR2 App, and it’ll take you through instructions for connecting your controllers via Bluetooth. Follow the instructions, and then open the Steam VR app. If done correctly, you should see a window that looks like this when you hover your mouse over Steam VR on your taskbar.</p><figure id="" data-id="3d3807d4358e93ea3d71e9b45b9f97b6" data-recommend-id="image://3d3807d4358e93ea3d71e9b45b9f97b6" data-format="jpg" data-width="264" data-height="148" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A window for Steam VR that shows the PlayStation VR2 headset and accompanying controller icons lit up, which indicates they’re connected." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A window for Steam VR that shows the PlayStation VR2 headset and accompanying controller icons lit up, which indicates they’re connected." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3d3807d4358e93ea3d71e9b45b9f97b6" data-recommend-id="image://3d3807d4358e93ea3d71e9b45b9f97b6" data-format="jpg" data-width="264" data-height="148" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A window for Steam VR that shows the PlayStation VR2 headset and accompanying controller icons lit up, which indicates they’re connected." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In my testing, it doesn’t seem like you need to launch the PlayStation VR2 app every time you want to use Steam VR after the initial setup. <strong>Make sure you turn on your headset whenever you want to use it</strong>, otherwise Steam won’t recognize either the device or the accompanying controllers.</p><h3 id="h6037"><a id=""></a>What if I can’t connect my PlayStation VR2 controllers to my PC via Bluetooth?</h3><p>Depending on your setup, you may run into a wall trying to get your VR controllers and your PC to get along. While frustrating, there are a few common culprits that lead to this issue. The first is that your motherboard in your computer may be missing a Wi-Fi antenna, which will weaken both your system’s Wi-Fi connection <em>and </em>its bandwidth for Bluetooth devices. <strong>If your PC came with an antenna that you just never screwed in, I strongly recommend setting that up</strong>. You’ll get a stronger wifi connection too!</p><p>The second common culprit is… well, computers are weird. Your controllers may not even show up in your Bluetooth menu because, I don’t know, your hardware is in a bad mood I guess? In this scenario, restart your computer and give the connection process another shot. </p><p>If your back is really against the wall and you just want to use your headset, <strong>I did find that plugging each controller directly into my computer works</strong>. This of course relies on you having two USB-A to USB-C cords hanging around, but if you own a PS5 and PSVR2 headset, you should have two to work with. I’d only label this a temporary fix, as all the wires will make any game with motion controls cumbersome at best and dangerous at worst. But for games that only require basic pointing and shooting, this setup can work.</p><p><strong>If you have any persistent connection issues, or the controllers just aren’t responsive enough, I recommend looking into </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-ps-vr2-bluetooth/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/pc-ps-vr2-bluetooth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>one of those Sony approved dongles</strong></a></span>. The adapter probably should have come with one of these to save you the headache, but them’s the breaks.</p><h2 id="h6038"><a id="4"></a>Step 4: Enjoy your VR Headset!</h2><p>It’s certainly inconvenient to have to spend extra money on accessories to get this headset to work, and the Bluetooth connection issues can become a hassle if you’re not one who likes to tinker. But after jumping through the initial hurdles, I found PlayStation VR2 works pretty well on PC. It’s relatively easy to pick up and play, and the OLED screen looks great, too. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580190/PlayStationVR2_App/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam reviews</a></span> indicate that some folks deal with software crashing and other glitches while using it, and you should be aware that those reports exist. That said, that hasn’t been my experience so far.</p><p>Despite a good experience when it’s all up and running, I wouldn’t recommend investing in PlayStation VR2 if your primary use case is PC VR gaming. If nothing else, the PlayStation VR2’s relative scarcity means its less supported than more widely-adopted alternatives like the Meta Quest, so there’s no guarantee that future games will be made with the PlayStation headset in mind. Additionally, some of the neatest features of the headset—such as eye tracking and HDR—aren’t supported by the PC adapter. But as long as you know all that going in, the PC adapter does its job and gives you access to Steam’s robust ecosystem of VR games. Let’s just hope that Sony actually makes more of these things so you can actually purchase one!</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
