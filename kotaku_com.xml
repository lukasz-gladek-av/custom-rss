The new hero shooter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-crossplay-xbox-pc-playstation-1851715183&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-crossplay-xbox-pc-playstation-1851715183">makes crossplay refreshingly simple</a></span>, but optimizing your settings is a bit more of a complex task. Getting the best performance that you can out of the game on PC will take a little more legwork than getting into a lobby with your friends.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Sure, there’s an in-game option to optimize your graphics for PC players. But, this sort of just throws you into one of the presets: low, medium, high, or ultra. That can be a good place to start, but if you’re still having performance issues, it’s worth diving into the menu to see what you can change.</p><h2 id="h164360"><a id=""></a></h2><p>To find these settings, click on the gear, then settings. In the display menu, I settled on the following settings.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Display Mode: Fullscreen. Borderless Windowed works better with a multi-monitor setup, but Fullscreen is better for performance.</li><li>Anti-Aliasing and Super Resolution Type: Nvidia DLSS (for those with Nvidia cards)</li><li>Mode: Quality</li><li>Sharpening: 70-80 (This can be lowered further to try and improve performance, but it’s a small gain for a noticeable visual difference).</li><li>Frame Generation Mode: Off</li><li>Low Latency Mode: NVIDIA Reflex Low Latency</li><li><strong>V-Sync: Off</strong></li><li><strong>Global Illumination: SSGI - Low Quality</strong></li><li><strong>Reflection Quality: Screen Space Reflections</strong></li><li>Model Detail: Medium</li><li><strong>Post-Processing: Low</strong></li><li>Shadow Detail: Medium</li><li>Texture Detail: Medium</li><li><strong>Effects Detail: Low</strong></li><li>Foliage Quality: Medium</li></ul><p>This is a good base to start from if you’re running into framerate issues. If everything runs smoothly, you can try upping the non-bolded settings above for options like Texture Detail to squeeze some prettier pixels out of your GPU. But if your frame rate still isn’t where you want it to be, there are some other worthwhile options. You can try lowering settings like foliage quality, shadow detail, and reflection quality. You may also want to try lowering your game’s resolution. </p><h2 id="h164361"><a id=""></a>You can also change your reticle in <em>Marvel Rivals</em></h2><figure id="" data-id="24b6d3464d2a79f0b66516b9d72e40e1" data-recommend-id="image://24b6d3464d2a79f0b66516b9d72e40e1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An options screen in Marvel Rivals shows reticle color options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An options screen in Marvel Rivals shows reticle color options." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="24b6d3464d2a79f0b66516b9d72e40e1" data-recommend-id="image://24b6d3464d2a79f0b66516b9d72e40e1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An options screen in Marvel Rivals shows reticle color options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yes, you can change your reticle already in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>! And, just like <em>Overwatch</em>, you can change these on a character-by-character basis. To find the menu, go to your preferred control method in the top menu (keyboard or controller), then go to combat. Here, in the HUD subsection, you’ll find the in-depth reticle editor. You choose from different types, like a simple dot or a set of crosshairs. You can create a custom color, and change the width and opacity.</p><p>As far as the best reticle, there is no 100% definitive answer. Get in this menu and experiment to see what works best for you! With this knowledge of the settings in your pocket, you’ll be better prepared than ever to help save the timeline!</p><hr><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> is available for free on PS5, Xbox Series X, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With so many players jumping into what is arguably the hottest hero shooter right now, it can be hard to rise above the rest of the pack in Marvel’s new hero shooter. However, learning this character is a great way to start claiming MVP or SVP titles at the end of matches.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196032" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku Unboxes The Spider-Man 2 Limited Edition PS5" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="270" data-playlist="196032,197298,197284" data-current="196032"><div><p>Kotaku Unboxes The Spider-Man 2 Limited Edition PS5</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196032/196032_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196032/196032_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196032/196032_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196032/196032_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21556.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>And if you’re not necessarily looking to main Venom, you may want to spend some time learning how to play him anyway. While <em>Overwatch 2 </em>revolves around the role queue to ensure there are players on each type of hero, <em>Marvel Rivals </em>doesn’t have any such system in place, so you may find yourself needing to flex to play healer (Strategist) and tank (Vanguard) often. With this, learning to play a character of each type will be vital, especially if you’re solo queuing. </p><h3 id="h150682"><a id=""></a><strong>Turn off Easy Swing. You’ll thank me later. </strong></h3><p>This might seem a little counterintuitive for a beginner’s guide, but turning off this setting will help you in the long run. Though Easy Swing makes things somewhat, well, easy by way of selecting a tether point for you to swing to, turning the setting off will see Venom swing in the direction your aiming. As you get better at the game, you’ll come to rely on this greater freedom of control, even if it’s a little more challenging at first.</p><h3 id="h150683"><a id=""></a><strong>Use your melee attack frequently.</strong></h3><p>Some of the melee attacks in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>can feel a bit clunky. However, this is definitely not the case for Venom. This melee strike can add up to a three-hit combo, which does enough damage to put the finishing touch on low health Duelists are trapped in your tendrils.</p><h3 id="h150684"><a id=""></a><strong>Delay your shield</strong>. </h3><p>When diving into enemy lines, keep a very close eye on your health, and <strong>use your shield ability when your health is very low</strong>, ideally all the way down to the double digits of Venom’s sizable health bar. </p><h3 id="h150685"><a id=""></a><strong>Watch your opponent’s composition closely</strong>. </h3><p>Keeping an eye on who’s on the battlefield will determine how early you should use your shield. Watch out especially for characters that can stun, like Luna Snow. If they do manage to stun you, use your shield ability earlier, right about when your health is around 200. </p><h3 id="h150686"><a id=""></a><strong>Use your Ultimate for preservation</strong>. </h3><p>Venom’s ultimate, unlike many others in the game, does not do a whole lot of damage. It also doesn’t have a major healing effect. Instead, it grants special temporary health depending on how much damage you dish out. Mainly, Venom’s Ultimate is is good for a last ditch effort at self-preservation. </p><hr><p><em>Marvel Rivals</em> is available for free on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Five months later at a WWE x C4 event, the former WWE World Heavyweight champion revealed he was “sworn to secrecy” about any involvement in the project, likely with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-kevin-feige-mcu-blade-1851696307&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-kevin-feige-mcu-blade-1851696307">Kevin Feige</a></span> holding with a (metaphorical) gun to his head. Questions about his involvement began to arise when he told a fan on X (formerly Twitter) that no, an individual in the <em>Captain America </em>trailer released last November <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/WWERollins/status/1855427081695363583?t=yiMqYVzTfX5or9ZR-brTYw&amp;s=19&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/WWERollins/status/1855427081695363583?t=yiMqYVzTfX5or9ZR-brTYw&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wasn’t him</a></span>. </p><p>Now, we have definitive answers from Rollins about his work on the film. “The script went through a lot of rewrites and reshoots so what I was there to do, essentially my role got either repurposed or completely erased,” Rollins explains. “So I did do a bit of an audition to possibly pop into another role, I believe, or the repurposing of my role, I’m not exactly sure on what it was, but they ended up going in a different direction with it.”</p><p>It’s curious that a star of his caliber wouldn’t be given a straight answer on why he was removed from what may be the first blockbuster of 2025. With that said, he easily could be lying to set up a major reveal that shocks the audience. He has some experience in doing that, right? </p><p>In the end, Rollins or not, we’ll be seated and ready for Marvel’s attempt to improve upon a rather lackluster 2024 (and 2023, if we’re being honest) at the box office. Maybe a little WWE theatrics is just what they need. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Stevenson was a highlight of the show’s first season, presenting a noble but twisted former Jedi warrior who had turned Sith mercenary after surviving Order 66, the directive which killed most of the rest of Jedi order in the prequel trilogy. He clashes with Ahsoka in his hunt for a map that would lead him to the banished mastermind Grand Admiral Thrawn, providing a worthy and charismatic foil for her principles and worldviews in the process. </p><p>Tragically, Stevenson passed away from illness just prior to season 1 airing, leaving questions as to who would carry on the pivotal role heading into season 2. McCann, who became one of <em>Game of Thrones</em>’ emotional lynchpins across the hit HBO show’s eight seasons, seems like a natural choice to step into the character’s conflicted shoes. After all, he spent most of his time as The Hound being a noble-hearted asshole who was easy to root for even when he was being terrible. </p><p>It’s not clear when McCann, who recently appeared as head of the Praetorian guard in <em>Gladiator 2</em>, will join the rest of the cast in filming season 2. The show’s schedule hasn’t yet been confirmed as the slate of <em>Star Wars</em> movies and TV spin-offs remains mired in delays, cancellations, and shifting plans. <em>Andor</em> is the next Star Wars show set to come to streaming via Disney+ <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-andor-season-2-release-date-disney-streaming-1851694453&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-andor-season-2-release-date-disney-streaming-1851694453">for its second and final season in April</a></span>. <em>Skeleton Crew</em> also just recently wrapped up a pretty good first season. Beyond that, however, the rest of the upcoming<em> Star Wars</em> programing slate remains a mystery. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
