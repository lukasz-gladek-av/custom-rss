              <p>Amazon’s <em>Prime Big Deal Days</em> leave no brand behind nor any product category, introducing deep discounts on even the highest-end tech available out there. When setting up a high-performance PC, when upgrading a gaming rig or when processes on a professional level demand scorching fast storage velocities, the <strong>Samsung 990 Pro SSD is the ultimate consumer-grade solid-state drive</strong> at hand.</p>
<p>Currently, the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4513/">2TB variant has fallen to an all-time-low $159 on Amazon, from its usual $199 asking price</a>. This fantastic Gen4 NVMe storage from Samsung is the sort serious gamers, video editors, 3D artists, and data pros depend on when seconds on load time make a difference.</p>

<h2>Sequential Velocities That Recalibrate What Fast Is</h2>
<p><strong>Sequential reads go up to 7,450 MB/s, writes up to 6,900 MB/s</strong>. To give you a better idea, you’re getting close to the theoretical limit of the PCIe 4.0 interface which is around 8,000 MB/s tops. That means the drive takes less than eight seconds to unload a 50GB installation for a game or relocate a 4K video workflow file whilst getting coffee. These speeds are thanks to <strong>Samsung’s proprietary controller and V-NAND</strong>&nbsp;which stacks memory cells vertically for elevated density and performance without increasing the physical size of the M.2 2280 form factor that occupies standard motherboard slots.</p>



<p>But sequential raw speeds are only part of the equation: Random read and write performance is more relevant to real-world computing because the majority of activities involve accessing spuradically distributed data across the drive, not large swathes of contiguous files. <strong>Samsung boosted random performance by more than 55% over the last-generation 980 Pro</strong>, directly translating to snappier program launches and less stuttering in open-world titles constantly streaming assets from disk.</p>



<p>The Samsung 990 Pro delivers up to 50% better performance per watt than the previous generation so you get those scorching speeds using less energy and less heat output. This matters for compact form factors with limited airflow, thin notebooks where battery life is a concern or multi-drive workstations where overall heat accumulation might become a problem.</p>
<p>The 2TB capacity provides a sweet spot for current computing requirements – and games are increasingly going over 100GB installations, with some titles such as Call of Duty going over 200GB. Serious video editors who deal with 4K or even 6K video have a need for storing raw files, render caching, and project libraries. Data analysts working on large datasets prefer storing all of them on fast local storage instead of sluggish network drives.</p>
<p>The Samsung 990 Pro SSD is powered by a 1,200 terabytes written endurance rating on the 2TB model which means theoretically you have the capability of writing 600GB of information every single day for five years until the warranty expiration limit is reached. For most users, that is a lifetime of usage. The drive also includes Samsung’s Magician software, which monitors the health of the drives, manages firmware updates, and includes a secure erase feature.</p>
<p>At $159, this is the best pricing that we have seen on Samsung’s highest performance consumer-grade SSD yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cleaning your floors shouldn’t feel like a never-ending chore, especially when pet hair seems to multiply overnight and daily messes keep piling up. The good news? The <strong>Roborock Q10 S5+</strong> just<strong> became Amazon’s #1 bestseller in robot vacuums</strong> during Prime Big Deal Days, and that’s impressive enough to catch your attention.</p>
<p>This newly released powerhouse combines serious suction, advanced mopping and a self-emptying station into one complete package, and right now it’s <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/">dropped to an all-time low of $299 on Amazon, down from its usual $399 price tag</a>. When a robot vacuum climbs to the top of the sales charts with those kinds of numbers, you know something special is happening.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4512/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Q10 S5+ addresses the fundamental frustration of robotic cleaning: constant maintenance. Its <strong>self-emptying station holds a massive 2.7-liter dust bag that handles up to 70 days of debris</strong> before you need to think about it. For households with shedding pets or high foot traffic, this means you can essentially forget about your vacuum for more than two months while it quietly does its job. The <strong>station automatically pulls dirt and hair from the robot after each cleaning session</strong>&nbsp;so you’re not emptying tiny dustbins every other day like with basic models.</p>
<h2>Powerful Performance That Handles Real-World Messes</h2>
<p>The suction power here is worth a mention because numbers count when you’re working with ground-in dirt. At 1<strong>0,000 Pa, the HyperForce suction power creates enough pressure for it to remove embedded pet hair</strong> from carpet fibers, lift crumbs out of hardwood crevices and deal with the type of debris that lesser robots just bulldoze around. That’s about double what you’ll get on starter versions.</p>



<p>But a vacuum on its own won’t cure the tangling problem plaguing the majority of robot vacs, especially homes with long hair or fluffy pets. Roborock created a dual anti-tangle solution comprising a JawScrapers Comb main brush with a special side brush designed specifically to fight hair wrap. The structure of the comb separates and directs hair dynamically into the suction stream instead of wrapping it round the roller, so you’ll have a lot less time spent cutting out bunched-up grime from the brush bar.</p>
<p>The VibraRise 2.0 cleaning system provides a dual-zone sonic vibration technology that cleans floors 3,000 times a minute. This isn’t the languid wet pad sliding you witness on less advanced models. The active scrubbing action indeed addresses dried-on spills and tacky areas, and the system automatically lifts the mop pad 0-8mm when it recognizes carpet using ultrasonic sensors. That same recognition initiates automatic suction boost on the carpets for further cleaning while safeguarding them against moisture damage.</p>
<p>The navigation tech distinguishes advanced robots from simple bump-and-go ones, and the <strong>Roborock Q10 S5+ makes full home 360-degree mapping</strong> a breeze with its PreciSense LiDAR scanning tech. The tech provides precise floor plans and multi-level mapping, so a two-storey home, for instance, will have both floor plans remembered by the robot, which then changes cleaning strategy to suite both areas. ReactiveTech obstacle avoidance with structured light detection detects chair legs, toys, and cables, amongst others and cleverly navigates a path around them without getting stuck or requiring rescue.</p>
<p>Make sure you don’t miss that deal before it runs out of stock (which is a matter of time).</p>
