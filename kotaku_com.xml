              <p data-start="140" data-end="945">Laptops often get more praise than they deserve. While they’re convenient for mobility, nothing quite compares to a well-designed desk setup with large monitors, a responsive mechanical keyboard, and the comfort of a dedicated workspace. Such an environment not only boosts productivity but also creates a place you’ll genuinely enjoy returning to whenever it’s time to focus. One of the best ways to power a setup like this is with the Apple Mac Mini. Despite being a desktop machine, it’s still compact enough to take with you when needed. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">Even better, the 2024 version of Apple’s compact desktop is currently discounted by 17% on Amazon, dropping the price from $599 to $499.</a> If you’ve been considering an upgrade, this is an ideal moment to treat yourself while saving a whole $100.</p>
<p data-start="947" data-end="1618">The discounted model is the 2024 Apple Mac Mini equipped with Apple’s M4 chip, which features a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU. The device is sold in 256 GB and 512 GB variants, although the higher-capacity version is currently selling for over $700. Alongside that storage, the system includes 16 GB of RAM. The M4 processor is the star of the show here, giving this compact desktop a tremendous performance boost. Apple claims it can operate up to 13 times faster than the fastest Intel-based Mac Mini. That makes the machine suitable for everyday productivity as well as demanding creative tasks like photo or video editing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="1620" data-end="2060">In terms of connectivity, the 2024 Mac Mini packs a generous selection of ports and wireless options. You’ll find three Thunderbolt 4 ports, two USB-C ports, HDMI, and Gigabit Ethernet, along with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 for fast and stable wireless connections. Apple may have phased out the headphone jack on the iPhone years ago, but it remains present on the Mac Mini, giving you the convenience of wired audio whenever you want it.</p>
<p data-start="2062" data-end="2748">The desktop comes loaded with macOS 15.1 Sequoia, which continues Apple’s emphasis on privacy and security. It includes an upgraded Secure Enclave to help safeguard your personal data and system integrity. MacOS supports a wide variety of software, from productivity essentials to creative tools. You can use the full Microsoft 365 suite, Adobe Creative Cloud applications, Zoom, and thousands of other programs. In fact, the App Store offers more than 15,000 apps, many of which are optimized specifically for the M4 chip.</p>


<h2>Better With Apple Accessories</h2>
<p data-start="2750" data-end="3035">To enhance your experience even further, you can pair the Mac Mini with other Apple accessories. It works seamlessly with the Apple Studio Display and integrates perfectly with peripherals like the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, offering a smooth and cohesive setup across your devices.</p>
<p data-start="3037" data-end="3278"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">For a short time, Amazon is selling the 2024 Mac Mini with the M4 chip for $499, an even $100 reduction from its standard price.</a> AppleCare+ isn’t included, but you can add three years of coverage for a combined total of $588—that’s at a $120 discount.</p>

              <p>According to a report by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-wins-the-warner-bros-discovery-bidding-war-enters-exclusive-deal-talks/"><em>TheWrap</em></a>, Netflix is now entering exclusive talks to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, having outbid other competitors for the&nbsp;<em>Batman</em>-owning megacorp. If the deal goes through, rumored to be at $30 a share, it would mean the streaming giant would own everything from HBO to DC comics, including all your favorite Lego and <em>Batman</em> games.</p> <p>Warner Bros. boss David Zaslav has been making it clear he wants to sell the company for a good while now, but holding out for a big exit. In October this year he <a href="https://kotaku.com/holy-monopoly-batman-warner-bros-reportedly-reject-a-buyout-bid-from-paramount-2000634581">turned down a bid from Paramount</a> said to be at $20 a share, with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-12/warner-bros-is-said-to-rebuff-paramount-takeover-approach"><em>Bloomberg</em> claiming</a> the CEO was holding out for 50 percent higher. That valuation seemed crazy, and it was assumed that Paramount came in much lower to test the waters, with the expectation of either a $25 per share bid to follow, or more hostile takeover moves. However, instead, it seems Netflix has swooped in with that $30 offer thus won the war.</p>

 <h2>What are the implications of this deal?</h2> <p>If the deal goes through, this would mean streaming giant Netflix would own one of its big rivals, HBO Max, and presumably look to merge the two services. It would also own Warner’s entire movie business including New Line Cinema, all of DC Entertainement, the Discovery network of channels, and multiple networks like CNN, TBS, TNT and the Cartoon Network. And, of course, Warner Bros. Games.</p>

 <p>In a normal universe, this would be the sort of deal that would be tangled in monopolistic concerns for years to come, as people questioned the unparalleled power this could offer Netflix over multiple industries. However, given other recent mergers that have taken place after, um, payments made to the Trump orbit, what might happen is anyone’s guess. However, earlier talk last month of the potential deal between Netflix and Warner <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-warner-bros-bid-antitrust-concerns-darrell-issa-letter/">resulted in antitrust concerns being raised</a>, and certainly there will be a lot of fight from those concerned how the deal could affect Hollywood.</p>

 <p>Yet, at the same time, Paramount was allowed to merge with Skydance and Disney was allowed to buy Fox, so Netflix has plenty of precedent to argue from. As it happens, it could be Paramount that objects the loudest to the Netflix deal, given how it and so many others had assumed it would get Warner eventually, and the company is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/04/paramount-questions-warner-bros-discovery-sale-process-letter.html">already questioning the “fairness and adequacy”</a> of the process. A Warner attorney wrote, “It has become increasingly clear, through media reporting and otherwise, that WBD appears to have abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process, thereby abdicating its duties to stockholders, and embarked on a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder.”</p>

 <h2>A messy breakup for gaming?</h2> <p>The Netflix deal also makes another aspect of Warner Bros. Discovery more interesting. <a href="https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-separate-two-leading-media-companies">Zaslav had appeared determined to break up the company</a> such that its linear cable channel businesses would be separated from the rest, and then that loss-making sector take all the company’s debt with it. Because that’s legal I guess. However, while Paramount likely wouldn’t want to end up owning a bunch of profitless cable channels, for Netflix the vast number of new shows to stream could be a real boon. Not only would it have everything on HBO Max, but also be able to strip-mine the remaining cable channels for extra content.</p>

 <p>At the same time, the deal could be very concerning for games players, given <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-gaming-hades-monument-vally-golden-idol-braid-1851785038">Netflix’s very clear backward step from anything other than mobile gaming</a>. Its owning the studios that develop the <em>Arkham</em> and&nbsp;<em>Lego</em> games could mean bad times for console players if the pattern continues.</p> <p>There’s obviously a lot of fighting to come, and presumably some hefty legal challenges from those who feel dropped at the altar, let alone the antitrust maneuvers. But given [broad sweeping gesture], it won’t be in the least bit surprising to see it happening sooner rather than later.</p>
