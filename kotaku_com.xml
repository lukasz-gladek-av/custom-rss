There was a time when video games were all about gruesomely murdering people, watching as the viscera was torn from their dismembered limbs, hearing that sloppy, wet slap as a severed leg flopped messily to the ground. But now it’s all factories and conveyor belts, with careful industrious management and not a writhing stream of entrails to be found. And we let <em>children</em> play these games?</p><p>To give you an idea of how popular this reasonably new genre has become (yes, yes, such games have appeared since the dawn of the hobby, but not as part of a thriving genre), the Automation Fest includes 259 games, primarily from the last ten years. And that’s a lot of games to look through if you don’t know where to start. Fortunately, like the well-oiled, overly elaborate machine we are, we <em>do</em> know where to begin digging through the stockpiles, and which games you should—I dunno—place on the conveyor belt to your wishlist? Is that something? (<em>Well, it’s</em> something<em>—Ed</em>)</p><h2 id="h415415"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/300570/Infinifactory/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/300570/Infinifactory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infinifactory</a></span></h2><p>It would be foolish to attribute the current success of automation games to one specific developer, not least because no game appears in a vacuum, instead influenced by the decades of development that came before it. But that aside, I’m going to entirely attribute the current success of automation games to one specific developer: Zachtronics.</p><p>Founded by Zach Barth, Zachtronics first created <em>Infiniminer—</em>a game which influenced&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>—and then blew up puzzle gaming with 2011's <em>SpaceChem</em>. But in 2015, the studio released <em>Infinifactory</em>, combining ideas from both, and in doing so, instantly made automation gaming A Big Thing. Rather than simply being a factory sim where you build these intricate assembly lines to solve challenges, <em>Infinifactory</em> also had a batshit storyline of alien abduction and being forced to manufacture suspicious equipment likely to be used for nefarious purposes.</p><p>Now 10 years old, it feels like the granddaddy of this whole festival, discounted to half price for the week.</p><p>Rather than bloat the rest of these selections with other games from Zachtronics, which could very reasonably just have the entire list to itself, I’ll just note that nearly all the studio’s classics are discounted this week. There’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/558990/Opus_Magnum/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/558990/Opus_Magnum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Opus Magnum</em></a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/92800/SpaceChem/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/92800/SpaceChem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>SpaceChem</em></a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/504210/SHENZHEN_IO/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/504210/SHENZHEN_IO/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Shenzhen I/O</em></a></span> and many others at half off. The studio’s last game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1511780/Last_Call_BBS/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1511780/Last_Call_BBS/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Last Call BBS</em></a></span>, isn’t discounted, but you can pick it up as part of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/2925/The_Zachtronics_Puzzle_Pack/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/2925/The_Zachtronics_Puzzle_Pack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zachtronics Puzzle Pack</a></span> which contains all the games, currently 39 percent off.</p><h2 id="h415416"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/526870/Satisfactory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Satisfactory</a></span></h2><p>At the other end of the timeline sits <em>Satisfactory</em>, 2024's smash hit evolution of the genre, where your assembly line constructions also take place on an alien planet, but this time in an open world that you’re free to explore, and even featuring combat. But, of course, the primary focus is on making a factory, which here can be ridiculously tall, complicated, and...exploitative of local nature?</p><p>First-person is obviously not the normal way such construction-driven games are played, but <em>Satisfactory</em> has absolutely nailed it. (And before we move on, can we just sit back and give a small round of applause for the title? Perfect puns are too easily glossed over, and this deserves its props. Until you’re Googling for it, and then...) This is a factory-building game with jump pads and vehicles and angry fauna.</p><p>It’s pretty hard to overstate the popularity of Coffee Stain Studios’ game (yes, the same people who made <em>Goat Simulator</em>!). This has received an eye-watering 237,000 reviews on Steam, and over 96 percent of them are positive. That’s just extraordinary. And nearly a year after release, it’s still seeing 25,000 or more people playing simultaneously every day. And for good reason. This week you can pick it up for 30 percent off.</p><h2 id="h415417"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427520/Factorio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Factorio</a></span></h2><p>And here, bridging between the two ends of the genre’s long road, is <em>Factorio</em>, 2020's mega-hit automation game. The 2D, top-down factory-making sim feels a lot like a precursor to <em>Satisfactory</em>, with its free building, predatory local fauna, and enormous world. (Well, this one’s infinite, while Coffee Stain’s is a slightly smaller 30km².) </p><p>Do not be fooled by the late-90s style of the graphics; this is a thoroughly modern game of ludicrous complexity, where you mine your resources, research your tech, and automate your production lines, all while—yup—exploiting the local ecology. As such, you’ll also need to defend your factories from external forces. Oh, and credit where it’s due: this game went to Kickstarter in 2013, two years before <em>Infinifactory</em> appeared.</p><p><em>Factorio</em> has been wildly successful, selling millions of copies, and developers Wube Software are still releasing updates as recently as...today! Wube has also committed to never putting the game on sale, which—honestly—good for them! That means it’s always $35, whether you buy it during this fest or next week, but 96 percent of 217,000 people reckon that’s a good deal.</p><h2 id="h415418"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2275490/Kaizen_A_Factory_Story/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2275490/Kaizen_A_Factory_Story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kaizen: A Factory Story</a></span></h2><p>And let’s complete the loop. While it’s only been out for a few hours, it’s fairly safe to say that short of a very surprising twist, <em>Kaizen: A Factory Story</em> is about to be the next big automation game. Why? Because this is developed by Coincidence, which is Zachtronics in a new hat.</p><p>Funnily enough, Zachtronics was closed in 2022 because Zach Barth thought the studio had become stuck making factory-based puzzle games, and wanted himself and his studio mates to be set free to develop other things. Three years  and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870750/Add_Astra/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2870750/Add_Astra/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one math-based puzzle game</a></span> later, it seems that other things weren’t perhaps as attractive as they looked, because Barth and chums are back with a brand new automation-based puzzler. Whoops!</p><p>While <em>Kaizen</em> only has a handful of reviews so far, all have been very positive. This time, you’re running a Japanese assembly line around the turn of the 1990s, working out how to arrange machinery and processes to best create a range of products. And its story explores the time period in what I’ve read are surprisingly emotional ways.</p><h2 id="h415419"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2072840/Word_Factori/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2072840/Word_Factori/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Word Factori</a></span></h2><p>A little more off the beaten path is <em>Word Factori</em>, a puzzle game in which you must create words but only after having invented recipes for the alphabet.</p><p>What begins as a rather cute game about combining letter parts through various machine parts to build new ones, starting with only the letter i and building from there, very quickly becomes the most astonishingly intricate and brain-hurting challenge. It looks so friendly and welcoming, but when you’re trying to optimize your production lines for the more efficient creation of tricksy words, you’ll realize its real depths.</p><p>Spelling the word “CAT” has never been so difficult.</p><hr><p>Obviously there are <em>so</em> many other games worth checking out in the selection, and we’ve barely scraped the surface of even the best-known examples here. If you’re looking to get into automated gaming, these are an excellent way to start, but make sure to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/category/automation&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/automation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dig through the full list</a></span> for any treasures that may perfectly match your mood.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/steam-automation-fest-factory-games-satisfactory-1851786275]]></content:encoded>

While it was a success, <em>Content Warning</em> was a much bigger one made in MUCH less time,” he added. So the team decided to partner with some of the 2024 co-op horror playground game’s developers on something similar, but with the disarmingly twee quirkiness that Aggro Crab is known for.</p><p>The result is <em>Peak</em>, a first-person hiking adventure in which players control lo-fi, child-like avatars as they help one another traverse through hazardous terrain like steep cliffs and scorching lava pits. The game is cheap, just $8 to download, exploits social dynamics for drama and comedy in otherwise familiar gameplay scenarios, and is catnip for social media. TikTok and Instagram are full of perfectly meme-able moments that usually entail one player accidentally falling to their doom as their proximity chat screams gradually fade away.

It’s retained its “mostly positive” rating over 40,000 user reviews later. Like so many indie games that blow up on Steam, iterating on current fads often trumps dream projects years in the making, at least when it comes to grabbing that bag, though it no doubt helps that <em>Peak </em>is also a lot of fun.

So while you’ve only a couple of weeks left to finish <em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em> on your PS4 or PS5, the good news is that you can already move on to <em>Cyberpunk</em>. While that game was a colossal disaster on launch—so much so that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-pulls-cyberpunk-2077-from-playstation-store-says-1845908592&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-pulls-cyberpunk-2077-from-playstation-store-says-1845908592">Sony itself pulled it from sale on its consoles</a></span>—things are working far better five years on. (<em>Five years on</em>? Oh dear god, something is horribly wrong with time itself, and we need to start confronting this as a species.) </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-july-2025-cyberpunk-2077-twisted-metal-1851785914&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-july-2025-cyberpunk-2077-twisted-metal-1851785914">As we previously reported</a></span>, also arriving is <em>Abiotic Factor</em>, a rare day-one launch for PS Plus, albeit of a survival game that came out over a year ago on PC. Deep Field Games’ paranormal craft-me-do has been phenomenally popular on Steam, boasting the enviable Overwhelmingly Positive rating, with 94 percent of over 32,000 reviews giving it a thumbs up. It’s joined by Don’t Nod’s  story-heavy 2024 action-RPG <em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden</em>, and 2020's super-tough third-person roguelite, <em>Risk of Rain 2</em>. Oh, and Amazon’s <em>New World: Aeternum</em> for some reason.</p><p>But where PlayStation giveth it must also taketh away, so come August you’ll see a bunch of games disappearing. Along with Geralt’s departure there’s also the rather tough loss of the fantastic <em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em>, as well as <em>Wild Hearts </em>(eh), <em>UFC 5</em>, and cutesy creature collector <em>Bugsnax</em>, amongst a bunch of others including six different <em>Sword Art Online</em> games.</p><p>It’s a sad time to see <em>The Witcher 3</em> disappearing, given the game is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/witcher-3-mod-support-ps5-xbox-final-patch-1851783100&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-3-mod-support-ps5-xbox-final-patch-1851783100">soon to be able to support mods on the PlayStation</a></span>, but the ten-year-old title can often be picked up for great prices in sales.</p><p>And while you almost certainly cannot start and finish <em>Witcher 3</em> before it goes, you definitely can complete metroidvania-infused action-adventure <em>Jedi: Survivor</em>.
