It’s always a bit disappointing that they don’t do the same when the leak’s coming from inside the house. Such is the case for <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, after Sony seemingly accidentally uploaded <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202502/0611/2c429928f5c5b20df3c78f5053ace69c011d4f391782ab47.mp4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202502/0611/2c429928f5c5b20df3c78f5053ace69c011d4f391782ab47.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a trailer</a></span> that contains the release date straight to the front page of your PS5.

That’s the intended release date for the long-awaited remake of 2004's <em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em>. It’s looking likely to be a faithful recreation of the two-decade-old game, rather than one of those more complicated re-imaginings, albeit now built for PS5, rather than PS2. Part of that is to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-delta-remake-performance-mode-60fps-1851631819&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-delta-remake-performance-mode-60fps-1851631819">give the player a more modern perspective</a></span>, more akin to <em>MGS5: The Phantom Pain</em> than the pulled-back view of the original, alongside a control scheme that matches the most recent entry. But it’s keeping its original voice acting, and has rebuilt its original cutscenes in the Unreal Engine, rather than reinterpreting them.</p><p>The store page for the game, presumably also uploaded unintentionally, mentions <em>Snake Eater</em> will be a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-enhanced-support-8k-60fps-update-ff7-1851644737&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-enhanced-support-8k-60fps-update-ff7-1851644737">PS5 Pro Enhanced game</a></span>, so you can start getting excited about all those frames happening in the same second, <em>Zack</em>. Just try to imagine them all, flickering by faster than the human eye can perceive, and feel confident&nbsp;that justifies spending $800 on a console. Feels <em>good</em>.</p><p>Sony has a State of Play stream due later this month, and you can only imagine this release date news was intended to be part of that. Someone is kicking themselves, or perhaps being kicked by others around them. But then, look, look at all the press this is getting! Everything’s good! Please, for goodness sakes, stop kicking Jeremy.</p><figure id="" data-id="bbba553404ecf8bd893e0cf035073149" data-recommend-id="image://bbba553404ecf8bd893e0cf035073149" data-format="jpg" data-width="1555" data-height="873" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A monkey slaps its bottom in the forest, and sadly we all hear its fall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A monkey slaps its bottom in the forest, and sadly we all hear its fall." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>This is not OK.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bbba553404ecf8bd893e0cf035073149" data-recommend-id="image://bbba553404ecf8bd893e0cf035073149" data-format="jpg" data-width="1555" data-height="873" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A monkey slaps its bottom in the forest, and sadly we all hear its fall." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The trailer ends with a really quite upsetting depiction an <em>Ape Escape</em> monkey slapping its butt.
