              <p>We don’t know much about what <a href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470"><em>Split Fiction</em></a> developer Hazelight’s next big game will be, but I can confirm two things. One, it is in development right now. And two, like the studio’s past projects, it will feature mocapped actors.</p> <p>On February 10, Hazelight founder and <a href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-preview-josef-fares-ai-hazelight-co-op-1851765494"><em>Split Fiction</em></a> director <a href="https://kotaku.com/fuck-the-oscars-watch-a-way-out-directors-rant-at-the-1821108598">Josef Fares</a> posted an image on Twitter that simply says, “Next game in the making.” In the image, we can see Fares in a cozy sweater, giving a big thumbs-up in front of some actors wearing dot-covered motion capture suits. Fares’ arm is perfectly angled in a way to obscure the faces of the actors, so it seems he doesn’t want folks to know who the studio has cast in its follow-up to 2025’s blockbuster co-op-only adventure <a href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-movie-rights-bidding-war-hollywood-ea-1851771617"><em>Split Fiction.</em></a></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Next game in the making 👍😎 <a href="https://t.co/HouYcN903E">pic.twitter.com/HouYcN903E</a></p> <p>— Josef Fares (@josef_fares) <a href="https://twitter.com/josef_fares/status/2021163743036486041?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“<em>Split Fiction</em> is the best-received game we have done, everybody is super happy, but I’m so fully focused and excited on the next thing, that we’ve already started,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9-_n3vqsAQ">Fares told the <em>Friends Per Second</em> podcast in March 2025</a>. At that time, the director said the studio’s next game was very early in development and was mostly just ideas on pages. “[It’s] mostly in the story, what’s going to happen, but a little bit in gameplay as well. It’s kind of like, ‘this is where we start, this is where we’re going.’”</p> <p>Nearly a year later, it seems Hazelight has made good progress on its<em> Split Fiction</em> follow-up. Will it be as successful as the studio’s massively popular co-op game about two authors working together to escape a VR simulation? I’m not sure, but if it’s another inventive and fun co-op-only puzzle-action game that I can play with my wife over a week or two, I’ll be there day one, no questions asked.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[No ICE In Minnesota Bundle Lets You Play Games And Protest Fascism]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/no-ice-in-minnesota-itch-bundle-games-tabletop-2000667229</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Fuck ICE.</p> <p>And what better way to raise a big pile of money for the Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota than buying nearly 300 video games and over 1,000 tabletop games for as much money as you want to give (with a minimum of $10) in <a href="https://itch.io/b/3484/no-ice-in-minnesota">the No ICE In Minnesota bundle</a>.</p>  <p>This latest bundle is once again pioneered by the amazing <a href="https://jesthehuman.itch.io/">Jes Wade</a>, whose previous anti-ICE fundraising efforts launched in July 2025 <a href="https://kotaku.com/itch-io-bundle-no-ice-in-california-table-top-rpg-1851786085">and raised over $100,000 for projects protecting those targeted by ICE in California</a>. The No Ice In Minnesota bundle was launched only yesterday, February 9, and has already raised over $69,000. Given its set to run until March 13, it looks likely to smash the $100k target.</p>

 <p>Headline games in the pack include stunning puzzlers <em>Baba Is You </em>and&nbsp;<em>A Good Snowman Is Hard to Build</em>, alongside cat cafe sim&nbsp;<em>Calico</em> and the deeply engrossing experimental sci-fi game&nbsp;<em>Periphery Synthetic</em>. But of course the real pleasure of a bundle like this is picking games you’ve never heard of at random and encountering something completely fresh and original. And if you’re after something new to play with tabletop buddies, then there are more than one thousand of them to choose from and print out.</p> <p>Clearly the need for the bundle remains horrendous, but if you can’t get out to protest or, like me, live overseas and feel completely helpless watching so much suffering at the hands of untrained, murderous goons with guns, then giving money to the right people is a superb way to respond.</p>

 <p>The <a href="https://www.ilcm.org/about-us/">Immigrant Law Center of Minnesota</a> is a nonprofit that provides free representation to low-income immigrants and refugees living in both Minnesota and North Dakota, and couldn’t be more necessary during the current invasion of ICE and CBP agents. The organization <a href="https://www.ilcm.org/latest-news/ice-murders-second-civilian-in-broad-daylight-in-continued-violent-occupation-of-minnesota/">also provides support</a> for those facing similar violence, and information on who to contact when witnessing such attacks. (I also suggest supporting food banks like <a href="https://www.2harvest.org/">Second Harvest Heartland</a> who are currently delivering food to those too afraid to leave their houses.)</p>

 <p>Fundraising bundles on Itch have become one of the shining lights in dark times, seeing millions of dollars reaching the people who need it the most. In 2020 the <a href="https://kotaku.com/itch-io-is-selling-a-bundle-of-over-700-games-for-5-t-1843936605?_gl=1*140k7j0*_ga*Nzg4NTQ4NDM0LjE2MjQwMjI5MDc.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTIyMzEyMzUkbzQkZzEkdDE3NTIyNDA1MDYkajIwJGwwJGgw">Racial Justice and Equality bundle</a> raised <a href="https://itch.io/b/520/bundle-for-racial-justice-and-equality">an extraordinary $8.15 million</a> for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and Community Bail Fund, while in 2022 a fundraiser for charities working in Ukraine <a href="https://itch.io/b/1316/bundle-for-ukraine">drew in over $6 million</a>.</p>
