Sony had intended to team up with Nintendo on a disc-based, next-gen successor to the SNES. Then the Mario maker decided to stick with cartridges at the last minute, completely changing the console gaming timeline in the process. A new machine was born, one that gave us some of our favorite games ever made. That was thirty years ago, and now it’s clear that it changed video game history forever.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cc70fb42d8aaa4a4cc6aabb08f523b66" data-recommend-id="image://cc70fb42d8aaa4a4cc6aabb08f523b66" data-format="png" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Crash appears in his first game.

This single disc was bursting with arcade action, containing fully realized video game adaptations of all three (at the time, the only three) <em>Die Hard </em>movies, each one completely different from the others. The first is a third-person shooter that has you gunning down hordes of terrorists as you navigate Nakitomi Plaza, while the second is an on-rails, first-person shooter that sees you blast your way through Dulles Airport and beyond before a ludicrous final sequence takes you to the skies in a helicopter, from which you shoot terrorists off the wings of an in-flight 747 before bringing the whole evil airplane down. It’s surprising, stupendous, and so uniquely <em>video games</em>.</p><p>The one I remember the most, though, is <em>Die Hard With a Vengeance</em>, an absolutely crazed driving game in which you barrel down the streets and around the parks of New York City. Drawn into a terrorist’s twisted game, you must intercept cars that have been rigged with bombs and prevent them from exploding, which, of course, you do by crashing into them repeatedly, <em>Chase HQ</em>-style. You get an assortment of camera options here, one of which is a first-person, in-the-car view. Hit pedestrians in this perspective and your windshield might get momentarily splattered with blood, quickly washed away by your windshield wipers. It’s all very ‘90s edgy and extreme. <em>With a Vengeance</em>, while pretty simple and limited, is possessed of the kind of kinetic energy that would later make games like <em>Burnout 3 </em>so exhilarating, and <em>Die Hard Trilogy </em>as a whole crackles with a balls-to-the-wall enthusiasm that made it a defining release of the early PlayStation era.—Carolyn Petit </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4cbb6cdd04885a5db3ab7d81ba1cf94b" data-recommend-id="image://4cbb6cdd04885a5db3ab7d81ba1cf94b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man with giant wheels for hands battles in Paris.

Blow up the Eiffel Tower! Send your opponents plummeting from precarious New York City rooftops!

Instead, I’ll relay a memory. During my senior year of college, some friends and I had a borrowed PlayStation in the apartment we were sharing, much to the detriment of our studies, and the discovery of that game’s world, the struggles of its characters, and the monumental achievement of its design became part of the fabric of that year for us.</p><p>I’d been playing games my whole life, but in so many ways, <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>was like nothing I’d ever played before–so grandiose, so thematically complex, so audacious and spectacular. I’ll never forget one of my roommates coming back from class one afternoon, tossing his backpack down on the ground and shouting, “Gold chocobo!” before recommitting himself to the grind for the precious bird. We knew the world of <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>still held secrets we hadn’t yet attained, and we wanted to explore it for all its mysteries before venturing to that fateful final confrontation with Sephiroth. In the decades since, so many games have given us worlds that are more vast, more graphically detailed, more packed with time-wasting “content,” but I don’t know that there’s ever been a world that was more memorable and astounding, or that has served as the setting for a more epic and unforgettable tale. – Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3dfff4e2b8dfe5705f856b7a092e9d62" data-recommend-id="image://3dfff4e2b8dfe5705f856b7a092e9d62" data-format="png" data-width="1266" data-height="712" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mega Man and Roll run away from sky pirates.

It ditched 2D levels for an expansive, Saturday-morning-cartoon-esque world full of sprawling underground dungeons hiding powerful gear and dark secrets. I still remember the first time I went down a hatch, creeped around a corner, and immediately got skewered by a dual-drill-armed Sharukurusu. It was my first taste of open-world exploration and massive sandbox battles. Everything in this game was firing on all cylinders and it’s a travesty we never got <em>Mega Man Legends 3</em>. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9d618949f860319f0519d95fdca63487" data-recommend-id="image://9d618949f860319f0519d95fdca63487" data-format="png" data-width="1109" data-height="623" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Abe walks along industrial scaffolding.

I wasn’t even 10 years old when I first saw Abe get gunned down outside a totalitarian industrial complex for getting on the wrong side of management and messing up a puzzle. The 2D adventure game had immaculately grim vibes with just enough cheeky, gallows humor to keep it from feeling entirely overbearing. The sequel spin-off had more depth and polish, but it still didn’t come close to the visceral gut punch of the first game. The opening FMV remains seared into my memory, and the late-game mechanical twist is an all-time great one. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7a3da461a0c036da04437e34002ff270" data-recommend-id="image://7a3da461a0c036da04437e34002ff270" data-format="png" data-width="986" data-height="555" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Parappa raps.

By that, I mean it’s emblematic of the spirit of the original PlayStation, a spirit of playful innovation and experimentation that sought to produce new kinds of home console games and to create new kinds of fun and memorable experiences. <em>Parappa </em>proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that tapping buttons on a controller in rhythm with a song could be great fun, and that concept would go on to power some of the biggest games of the decade to come. And yet, it all could have failed if <em>Parappa </em>itself hadn’t been so great–so creatively distinctive, so vibrant, so packed with unforgettable songs. Thankfully, however, within a few minutes of starting the game, an anthropomorphic onion is teaching you to rap and do martial arts with the words, “Kick, punch, it’s all in the mind!” and it’s all so wild and surreal and committed to its own vision that you know, immediately, you are never gonna forget it. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6f8f5e5b7724e972fe79182ed4ed0949" data-recommend-id="image://6f8f5e5b7724e972fe79182ed4ed0949" data-format="png" data-width="1900" data-height="1068" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dracula and other characters from Symphony of the Night appear in official art work.

When <em>Symphony of the Night </em>arrived on the scene in 1997, however, it made a very strong impression, in some ways redefining our collective notions of what was possible in the genre of 2D action games. Going in without pre-defined expectations, many players of the time–myself included–found ourselves absolutely astounded by the game’s richness and depth. Just when we thought the castle couldn’t possibly have more to give, we’d find our exploration rewarded yet again with still more areas, secrets, and bosses. For my money, the game’s second half may represent the single biggest surprise in all of gaming, a secret the likes of which may never be topped. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1f959b058ccb879b4d1385509ed20480" data-recommend-id="image://1f959b058ccb879b4d1385509ed20480" data-format="jpg" data-width="1065" data-height="600" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Lara Croft shoots a Gatling gun.

The incredible intricacy of its environments, however, is also part of what makes it so memorable. <em>Tomb Raider 2 </em>proved that Lara Croft was no mere one-hit wonder, no fleeting sensation rocketed to short-lived stardom merely because of her sex appeal. With the success of this game, her status as an icon was cemented, and at the time, no other figure represented the new, PlayStation-powered era that video games were entering quite like she did. — Carolyn Petit </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="da89d1df6c9c0b06d33f9f37300f4e06" data-recommend-id="image://da89d1df6c9c0b06d33f9f37300f4e06" data-format="png" data-width="1064" data-height="599" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pixel art sprites appear on a bridge in battle.

Not only did the hero not live to tell the tale, the true history of what happened was ultimately buried with him. While <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>examined corporate exploitation and militarism, <em>Tactics</em> interrogated political power and religious dogma. Even optimizing the job system to create a teleporting, dual-wielding ninja of death wasn’t enough to come out the other side alive. History only remembers the victors. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="634edc186a00f239b50c318635216d1c" data-recommend-id="image://634edc186a00f239b50c318635216d1c" data-format="png" data-width="1199" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A skeleton trips out while playing PS1.

A Tim Burton-esque marriage of horror and whimsy, <em>MediEvil </em>is bursting with grody imagery, and though it’s all cartoonish and goofy, that didn’t stop me from fixating on the scary shit when I played it in Kindergarten. <em>MediEvil</em> is clunky to play by modern standards, but its charm and humor are pretty timeless. Maybe that’s why Sony keeps remaking it.

Not only did the developer usher <em>Final Fantasy </em>into a bold new era, but it did so while also producing numerous other incredible works that pushed the role-playing genre forward. <em>Parasite Eve </em>is remarkable for many reasons, not the least of which is its fantastic use of a real-world setting, a real rarity for an RPG at the time of its release. Taking place in New York City in the final days of 1997, the game whisks you from elegant operas to hushed museums to grimy city streets while you–as NYPD officer Aya Brea–work to thwart a horrifying threat to the Big Apple’s population. To this day, Christmastime in New York City still makes me think of <em>Parasite Eve</em>, a game that manages to feel wintry, melancholy, thrilling, and unsettling all at once. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3d5953be9d060a929a912684df9b6d30" data-recommend-id="image://3d5953be9d060a929a912684df9b6d30" data-format="png" data-width="1109" data-height="624" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A woman is cornered by two zombies.

Still, I think plenty of PlayStation owners were keenly aware, by 1999, that the system didn’t really have anything that could compete with <em>Mario Kart</em>. That all changed with the arrival of <em>Crash Team Racing</em>, a kart racer so good, some justifiably felt it beat Nintendo’s series<em> </em>at its own game. <em>CTR</em>’s visuals were vibrant and appealing, the racing was thrilling, the tracks were brilliantly designed and had terrific shortcuts–it had all the pick-up-and-play fun of a kart racer along with the high skill ceiling genre enthusiasts crave. To top it all off, its Adventure Mode, which has you racing against bosses, unlocking new stages and making story progress, was the most elaborate and exciting single-player mode ever offered in a kart racer at the time. — Carolyn Petit </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="18ca289da19740f550809e6dccdfc614" data-recommend-id="image://18ca289da19740f550809e6dccdfc614" data-format="png" data-width="892" data-height="501" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rinoa, Squall, and Seifer stand in a field of flowers.

And I don’t think any conversation about the impact of the original PlayStation is complete without it.</p><p><em>FFVIII</em> arguably endures in the hearts of its fans for many reasons: It’s a moving coming-of-age story set in a strange, hard-to-comprehend world. Its off-beat RPG mechanics are capable of being entertainingly exploited and utterly broken. The game features a rich, hybrid sci-fi/fantasy world with numerous cities and settlements to explore as you piece together its strange, time-bending narratives about moody teenagers shouldered with the burdens of protecting the world and each other. It didn’t land with everyone. But those of us for whom it did are still thinking about it nearly 30 years later.</p><p>I would argue that <em>FFVIII</em>’s dark horse status, however, is part of its character. While other <em>FF</em> games receive endless celebration and expensive remakes, the joy of <em>FFVIII</em>’s greatness is a sort of “if you know, you know” status for fans. In the last 30 years, I’d argue that the PlayStation brand has been home to many such experiences (fans of lesser-celebrated PlayStation titles like <em>Heavenly Sword</em>, <em>Killzone</em>, and <em>SOCOM</em> know what I’m talking about). <em>FFVIII</em>, to me, is one of the best early examples of that: Owning a PlayStation meant you could enjoy landmark titles while also finding some genuine hidden gems in its vast library. — Claire Jackson </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7234dfb629a82ac2a52fe4ad1f6abb84" data-recommend-id="image://7234dfb629a82ac2a52fe4ad1f6abb84" data-format="png" data-width="1028" data-height="577" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A car races down a track.

It might not look realistic, but <em>GT’</em>s polygonal cars and wobbly roads still get the job done and remind me of a time when racing games weren’t live-service monsters.

I spent what was probably hours playing around with the monster fusion mechanic that let me mix the creatures I captured into something that took on their physical traits, which was mind-blowing to me back in the 90s. But even setting that aside, I was enthralled at a young age by its melodrama. Walking through the village I’d been running around all game after its citizens had been turned to stone was terrifying and has been etched in my brain for decades. I never got around to playing the sequel on PS2, but getting to those final hours in the original was enough to know the series has potential. — Kenneth Shepard </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4bd29da861ae0350235df056af20c367" data-recommend-id="image://4bd29da861ae0350235df056af20c367" data-format="png" data-width="966" data-height="543" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A vampire casts a shadow in the shape of an angel.

Dripping with wonderfully overwrought gothic atmosphere, <em>Soul Reaver </em>features a mechanic by which you shift between planes of existence, one material and the other spectral, to solve puzzles and navigate the world. It was a very cool technical achievement for the time that made playing as betrayed wraith Raziel feel unlike anything else out there. Does <em>Soul Reaver </em>hold up as still worth playing today? We’re about to find out, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/soul-reaver-remaster-remake-psn-leak-state-of-play-ps5-1851656134&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/soul-reaver-remaster-remake-psn-leak-state-of-play-ps5-1851656134">remasters of the game and its sequel</a></span> are almost here. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="23930a3bf7878da01c162fd21a816380" data-recommend-id="image://23930a3bf7878da01c162fd21a816380" data-format="png" data-width="1043" data-height="587" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A player shoots Nazis.

Back then, first-person shooters tended to be heavily inspired by sci-fi or action movies, think <em>Doom</em> or <em>Golden Eye</em> on N64. And only a few ever leapt to console. <em>Medal of Honor</em> on the PS1 showed that console gamers were hungry for serious WW2 shooters, and it was also a really good game, which helped, too. — Zack Zwiezen </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2ba2656272e821b2a70aafc357eed327" data-recommend-id="image://2ba2656272e821b2a70aafc357eed327" data-format="png" data-width="1058" data-height="594" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Spyro appears in a render for the sequel.

It added more traversal capabilities like swimming and climbing, and more variety to the puzzles and challenges. It was short but sweet. The Autumn Plains are still my happy place. Breathing fire, collecting gems, and gliding in front of bright empty skyboxes was more fun than it had any right to be. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fc0ce6d682f84510a58162b511daa479" data-recommend-id="image://fc0ce6d682f84510a58162b511daa479" data-format="png" data-width="1178" data-height="663" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A man hangs from the ceiling above fire.

It’s horrible and hilarious every time. <em>Syphon Filter</em> might not be a franchise people talk about much in 2024, but that original game on PlayStation spent a lot of time in my console because it offered up a fun, tense, and action-packed modern-day shooter about secret agents, deadly viruses, and government corruption. And also, that cool taser thing I mentioned earlier. — Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d60e144ad6bdfdc2f19f2331935361b5" data-recommend-id="image://d60e144ad6bdfdc2f19f2331935361b5" data-format="png" data-width="1261" data-height="709" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A kid goes to a Digimon store.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> The <em>Digimon World </em>subseries has taken many different forms since the original launched in 1999, and even the first three games are all drastically different from each other. The first was more evocative of <em>Digimon</em>’s digital pet roots, weaving raising a ‘mon from its baby form into a powerful monster capable of taking on some of the bigger threats you have to face. But it could also be frustratingly tedious, as your partner would go through multiple cycles of life, dying and being reborn as a baby you had to once again raise to the point of usefulness before moving forward. The sequels had their own progress-gating but felt much less arbitrary, and had interesting twists on the <em>Digimon</em> universe that kept them fresh. Would love to see a collection on modern platforms, Bandai Namco. — Kenneth Shepard </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f35e6c4e475114fadf9e51b33f674bc2" data-recommend-id="image://f35e6c4e475114fadf9e51b33f674bc2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dart and his friends fly toward danger.

The Sony-developed RPG took aim at <em>Final Fantasy</em> and missed, but not by much. The pre-rendered backgrounds were magnificent, the music was beautiful, and the mythological stakes helped me look past the ugly enemy designs and incredibly grindy random encounters. I loved it so much, I beat the whole thing and then watched my cousins play it again on an old TV in the basement that had no sound. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f658c9ab379068a6327a0316e41330db" data-recommend-id="image://f658c9ab379068a6327a0316e41330db" data-format="png" data-width="1013" data-height="629" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Spider-Man punches a super villain.

At the time, however, it exploded onto the scene as one of the best superhero games ever made. It nailed the appeal of Spidey–his wisecracks, his decency, his abilities–and swept you up in a breathless adventure that had you swinging from New York City skyscrapers, battling supervillains on top of speeding subway trains, and tackling all kinds of other superhero setpieces. If you ask me, the lineage of great 3D Spider-games that’s still going today all started right here with this incredible achievement. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c5aeec0325158b3df88ab6cb8b593659" data-recommend-id="image://c5aeec0325158b3df88ab6cb8b593659" data-format="png" data-width="845" data-height="475" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Tony Hawk appears beside his avatar.

But <em>THPS2</em> is the better game, boasting the same snappy and responsive 3D skateboarding as its predecessor, but with new features and tricks. <em>THPS2</em> added manuals, letting you combo more tricks together to reach higher scores. It also included create-a-skater and create-a-park, letting younger me spend way too many hours tinkering with the game. Really, the only reason I stopped playing <em>THPS2</em> was to play <em>THPS3</em> on PS2. — Zack Zwiezen </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4d3f07f4bbc7c96a4551e4e8d7f24959" data-recommend-id="image://4d3f07f4bbc7c96a4551e4e8d7f24959" data-format="png" data-width="1105" data-height="621" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ashely faces down a wyvern.

If I’d wanted that I would have played <em>Resident Evil</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>and I very much did not. But I stuck with it and quickly realized I’d actually discovered one of the best games—still to this day—ever made. The writing is brilliant, the atmospheric dungeon crawling is clever and elegant, and the hybrid turn-based action combat is surprising and satisfying. It only had one problem, and that was the awful damage formulas that rendered all attacks useless unless you spent a ton of time grinding against particular enemy types or mastering its baroque blacksmithing system. But I persevered through the single-digit strikes against enemies and one-hit spells from bosses because the medieval noir thriller at <em>Vagrant Story</em>’s core is second to none.—Ethan Gach</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can find these by tapping on the Missions button on the bottom right of the Home or Battle screens. You’ll be sent to the Genetic Apex Dex Missions screen, but you want to look toward the bottom right again and tap on the Themed Collections button. At the bottom of this list will be a handful of missions that award you with an icon. These are the icons and associated missions for the Genetic Apex Expansion:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Electrode Icon: Collect 3 Electrode cards</li><li>Gardevoir Icon: Collect 5 Gardevoir cards</li><li>Charizard Icon: Collect 5 Charizard cards</li><li>Mewtwo Icon: Collect 5 Mewtwo cards</li></ul><p>In addition to those above, a set of icons is exclusive to a secret mission. <strong>Registering 226 cards in the Dex will cause a new mission to appear. Completing it will unlock icons for Mewtwo, Pikachu, and Charizard.</strong> Although that is a lot of cards to register, it only counts those with Diamond rarities. You won’t need to collect the rarer Star or Crown cards with full art illustrations. The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/get-the-pokemon-tcg-pocket-card-you-want-with-the-pack-1851702255&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/get-the-pokemon-tcg-pocket-card-you-want-with-the-pack-1851702255">Pack Point Exchange System</a></span> can cut down time for any of these missions, although using it to complete the Dex will be especially useful.</p><p>The second method is to buy icons from the shop. So far, these seem to be limited to events and can be missed. A Meowth Icon was available during the second part of a Wonder Pick Event that ran during the first half of November. It was also exchangeable only with exclusive Event Shop Tickets that naturally expired.

From the home screen, tap on the small round image of your current icon at the top. This will take you to what is essentially your profile page, where you can adjust options such as your Player Name or what your featured cards are. Tap the larger-sized picture at the top and you’ll bring up the Select Icon menu. You can now switch between any of the initial six profile icons or those you’ve obtained.</p><p>I do want to highlight that this menu only displays what has been unlocked so far. There aren’t any handy greyed-out icons or anything to signify that you might have more to unlock. Be sure to keep up with the events and open boosters whenever possible to add more icons to your selection.</p><hr><p>We can assume that unlocking <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> icons in the future will function similarly to how they do now. Fingers crossed that they add some permanently to the shop, or maybe mix it up with different types of missions.
