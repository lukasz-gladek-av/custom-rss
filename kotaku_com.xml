              <p>With the holidays quickly approaching, we’re all up to our knees in gift shopping. If you’re looking for some easy corporate sponsored White Elephant gifts or perhaps an extra stocking stuffer to fill up the sock, look for something that everyone and their mother could take advantage of. I’m talking about a portable power bank. Anker has myriad of portable chargers in its product lineup, consisting of all different sizes (both physical and in the storage sense).</p>
<p>As the tech has gotten better, prices have come down so you can get something really reliable for dirt cheap — especially when there is a sale. Right now, Amazon has this travel-ready Anker power bank with a 10,000mAh capacity for 40% off: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5384/">Anker PowerCore is normally priced at $29 (which isn’t even all that expensive) and it is now available for just $15</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5384/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Like it says in the name, this <em>Anker PowerCore Slim 10000</em> power bank holds a total power capacity of 10,000mAh. If you’re not familiar with these units, let’s put it a bit more eloquently. This portable charger can provide an iPhone 17 with two full charges from zero to 100%. Likewise, it can bring a Galaxy S25 to 100% just barely under two times. It can also bring an iPad mini 6 back to full one time.</p>
<p>The Anker power bank is lightweight and slim in design. It can easily fit into any pocket or into any bag you may be traveling with. It measures in at 5.99 inches by 2.81 inches 0.61 inches. It’s got a scratch-resistant exterior, so don’t be afraid to put it in your bag with other stuff. It’s been durability tested to withstand a drop of up to 3.2 feet.</p>



<h2>Universally Compatible</h2>
<p>The <strong>power bank uses USB-C for both input and output</strong>, which makes charging quick and easy for any USB-C device. It comes with the USB-C capable for you to charge both your devices like your phone or tablet as well as to recharge the power bank itself. It also has a micro USB port which can be used for recharging the power bank as an alternative.</p>
<p>The<strong> USB-C port supports speeds of up to 15W</strong> in either direction. That’s not the fastest charging on the market, but this can still save you in a pinch if you’re in Penn Station, phones about to die, and you still need to figure what address you’re going to and train you’re taking. Afterall, remember. This thing is only $15. For what it can do, it’s an excellent deal at that price point.</p>

              <p>Gaming laptops don’t come cheap. Of course, the exact price depends on the specs you’re after, but machines that can handle the latest titles without slowing down often land in the $800 to $1,700 range. If you’ve been on the lookout for a solid option without blowing your budget, Amazon is making the upgrade easy.</p>
<p>We just spotted the 16-inch Kaigerr gaming laptop going for $490 on Amazon, after an unbelievable 71% drop, and no, it’s not a glitch. It’s an early Black Friday deal available to both Prime and non-Prime members. Hurry to grab yourself this powerhouse, as there’s no telling how long the discount or the stock will last.</p>

<h2>Massive Memory Paired With Solid Storage</h2>
<p>You’re getting an impressive 16-inch display, which is slightly larger than most standard screens in this range, and pushes brilliant visuals that are both sharp and vivid. The High-Definition IPS screen is bright while also being comfortable on the eyes, so whether you’re pushing some creative boundaries in the morning or streaming at night, you will enjoy an immersive viewing experience throughout. There’s also a backlight keyboard that makes it easy to type in dim settings.</p>



<p>Power-wise, it packs a Ryzen 7 5825U processor with 8 cores and 16 threads, clocking up to 4.5GHz. This translates into ultra-fast performance, even with resource-intensive apps. The processor is paired with 16GB of DDR4 RAM and a 512GB NVMe SSD, so you’re getting both speed and sufficient storage right out of the box. These specs should be enough for most users out there initially, but if you ever want more, the laptop supports up to 64GB of RAM and 2TB of SSD expansion.</p>
<p>Graphics are handled by the Radeon Vega 8 integrated GPU, which keeps everything running smoothly. It’s not really meant for ultra-high-end titles at max settings, but you’ll have no problem running popular games like Fortnite or Minecraft.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include Wi-Fi 6, Bluetooth, plus a bunch of ports like USB 3.2, HDMI, a full-function Type-C, a TF card slot, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. You can connect external displays, add essential peripherals, and more without feeling limited.</p>
<p>All things considered, this gaming laptop delivers a lot of value for under $500. You’ll enjoy fast performance, immersive visuals, massive storage, plus quality graphics, whether you’re playing, working, or streaming. If you have been wanting to treat yourself to a powerful machine, now is a great time to make the move.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re cruising right toward the the end of 2025 which means we’re in the thick of the holiday season and we’ve got lots of gift shopping to take care of. You can hold out until Black Friday or Cyber Monday in order to saver some cash, but right now, if you know where to look, you can find some pretty lucrative deals ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>For instance, Amazon has the popular portable power station — the Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 — currently on sale for 55% off: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5383/">1500W AC battery normally goes for $839 and this discount brings it down to just $386</a>. This bundle also includes an AC cable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5383/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This is a great product to keep on hand in the back or your car or in your garage in the event of an emergency. You find yourself without power, perhaps during a thunderstorm causing a blackout, you can rely on this backup battery to keep your phones charged or to power important appliances.</p>
<p>On the subject of charging phones, the Jackery Explorer 1000 vs power station is capable of refueling your mobile devices up to 7.5 times faster the first generation model. With its six ports, you can even keep six different devices charged at once. This way, everyone in the family is covered in an emergency.</p>
<p>The six ports include<strong> three standard outlets which provide AC 1500W pure sine wave power</strong>. Then we have two USB-C ports, one able to produce 100W while the other does 30W. Then there’s the USB-A port capable of 18W.</p>



<h2>Fast-Charging</h2>
<p>When it comes time to actually recharging the Jackery power station itself, charging with standard settings will have it back up to capacity from zero in just 1,7 hours. If you need something a little faster than the default mode, you can actually set it to emergency super charging mode using the companion app on your phone. On this setting, the Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 is able to get back up to 100% in just one hour.</p>
<p>Perhaps you don’t need it charged super fast and you’re more concerned about the noise it’s making. Set it to quiet charging mode which will bring it down to barely 22dB, letting it slowly recharge over five hours. You can also choose to purchase the optional solar panels which open you up to even more charging options. The panels can be used to recharge it in just three hours.</p>
<p>The battery is built to last. The Jackery Explorer 1000 v2 will be able to provide you with roughly 4,000 cycles of recharging in its life. This is estimated to work out to about 10 years of use.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-quietly-offloads-the-15-6-inch-yxk-portable-screen-now-going-for-literally-pennies-2000641696</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-quietly-offloads-the-15-6-inch-yxk-portable-screen-now-going-for-literally-pennies.1346440/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A single screen can often feel limiting, especially when you need to work on multiple applications at once or share the display with others. Adding a full-size second monitor isn’t an option for everyone, but you can consider investing in a portable display that offers that extra space without the bulk.</p>
<p>Most portable monitors out there are quite affordable, with prices starting at $50, but we just found a way to grab one for even less. Amazon is currently offering the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5381/">15.6-inch <em>Yxk</em> portable screen for just $39, thanks to a 33% discount off its regular $59 price</a>. If you’ve been looking for a budget-friendly way to upgrade your work or play setup, now is the time to make the move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5381/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Consistent Visuals From All Angles</h2>
<p>The display itself measures 15.6 inches, which is the same size as most standard laptops. You’re getting a 1080p Full HD IPS screen with HDR support for clear, vibrant visuals with exceptional color accuracy. The 178-degree viewing angle ensures consistency from all angles, so you will be able to view the content clearly even when you’re not sitting directly in front of the screen. This also makes it easier to share the screen with others, as everyone won’t have to huddle around a single spot uncomfortably.</p>



<p>Long work sessions will no longer be tough on the eyes, thanks to Low Blue Light technology that actively reduces the amount of blue light emitted from the screen. Even better, you can choose between several display modes (mirror, extend, or second screen only) based on what you’re working on. Maybe go for the second screen mode when you need to work on different apps simultaneously, and the mirror mode while presenting! There are also two built-in speakers that make sure audio comes through clearly.</p>
<p>In terms of connectivity, it has two full-function USB-C ports and a Mini HDMI, meaning you can connect it to a range of devices, including laptops, phone, Xbox, PC, etc. The built-in stand makes it easy to set it up literally anywhere, from desk to bed.</p>
<p>Despite the generous size and power, the monitor weighs just 1.43 lbs and is only 0.31 inches thick. It slips into your laptop bag without bulking things up – ready to go where you do! Note that the discount ends soon, so it’s best to snag one for yourself before that happens.</p>
