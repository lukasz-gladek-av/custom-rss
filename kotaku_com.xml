Unprepared hunters are sure to get carted back to their camp quicker than they think. With the right strategies and knowledge, however, this creature will become just another challenge you can farm for exclusive materials.

Here’s hoping they come back around often and not just during seasonal events. At the time of publication, the Arch-Tempered Rey Dau is not actively available. We expect strategies against this monster to be very similar, however, should specific Event Quests return.</p><h2 id="h972027"><a id=""></a>Arch-Tempered Rey Dau’s Weaknesses</h2><figure id="" data-id="e78541d525d8b30947acb2ab86e480c1" data-recommend-id="image://e78541d525d8b30947acb2ab86e480c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Suggested Strategy page for Rey Dau." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Suggested Strategy page for Rey Dau." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e78541d525d8b30947acb2ab86e480c1" data-recommend-id="image://e78541d525d8b30947acb2ab86e480c1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Suggested Strategy page for Rey Dau." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While Arch-Tempered Rey Dau is more intense than its weaker variants, the general faults are the same.

An important distinction is that bringing weapons with an ice element as well as armor with high thunder resistance is more of a requirement than a recommendation this time around. We’ll want to end this as soon as possible, especially with the beast’s abundant health and higher resistance to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-wounds-hunter-mode-solo-co-op-1851771276&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-wounds-hunter-mode-solo-co-op-1851771276">wounds</a></span>.</p><p>Arch-Tempered Rey Dau is also far more aggressive than its Tempered variant, attacking more frequently and stringing together many of its moves. It’s a common occurrence to be hit by one attack and then by another while trying to get up. Remember to call your Seikret for a quick pick-up before you get sent back to camp! Your Seikret is the perfect asset that shouldn’t be overlooked during intense hunts like these. Taking a break from the action to heal up is a lot better than doing so within Rey Dau’s proximity.</p><p>What might be the most notable difference is that many of this monster’s attacks will attract lightning strikes. These increase the likelihood of being stunned and make it more difficult to get some hits in. Hunters who enjoy using weapons with counterattacks will need to keep their guard up a bit longer. A successful <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-offset-attack-monster-weapons-1851775743&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-offset-attack-monster-weapons-1851775743">Offset Attack</a></span> works fine, but other counters will usually be interrupted and leave you defenseless for a more damaging attack. Bringing gear with the Evade Extender skill can be a big help for dodging the lightning as well.</p><p><strong>If you need a break from these aftershocks, destroying the blue Fulgurite crystals along its wings and tail will disable them for around three minutes.</strong> It’s not a permanent solution as the crystals will come back, and you’ll be dealing less damage by not focusing on the head, but this is an ideal tactic if you’re having trouble with these follow-ups.</p><p>Not counting the extra lightning, Arch-Tempered Rey Dau does come with a brand-new move. Standing too close can trigger it to shoot lightning directly beneath it. This is an important attack to be mindful of, since Rey Dau’s underside is a safe spot in previous hunts. Being hit by this will leave you open for a potential follow-up charged beam that can faint you. My advice is to dodge out of the way as soon as you notice it charging up and looking down. You’ll likely have a second at most to react.</p><p>Destroying tempered wounds is still a fantastic way to knock your target down. Coming at odds with this is Arch-Tempered Rey Dau’s high wound resistance. Besides a weak spot that appears after performing its strongest charged beam, there aren’t many opportunities to land a focus strike and some nice damage. Knocking Rey Dau down will mostly require <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-how-to-mount-master-mounter-1851775446">mounting</a></span>, traps (pitfall and vine traps specifically), and the occasional Flash Pod when it’s flying in the air.</p><p>There isn’t much more to the fight than chasing after it to new locations. The electric wyvern is basically enraged the entire fight, so it’s purely a matter of survival. Always prioritize your health to best avoid any one-hit KOs. If you’ve been carted once or twice already, remember that capturing the monster is an option. No shame in finishing this hunt early.</p><h2 id="h972029"><a id=""></a>Arch-Tempered Rey Dau’s Exclusive Rewards</h2><figure id="" data-id="4cfac73c7d909545e759b496c7d4c4f6" data-recommend-id="image://4cfac73c7d909545e759b496c7d4c4f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The post-hunt rewards screen for A Silent Flash, highlighting a Rey Dau Certificate Y." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The post-hunt rewards screen for A Silent Flash, highlighting a Rey Dau Certificate Y." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4cfac73c7d909545e759b496c7d4c4f6" data-recommend-id="image://4cfac73c7d909545e759b496c7d4c4f6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The post-hunt rewards screen for A Silent Flash, highlighting a Rey Dau Certificate Y." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Most of the rewards and drops you receive will be the same as the Tempered version. <strong>The biggest difference for Arch-Tempered Rey Dau is that instead of receiving </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-hunter-symbols-farm-1851779176&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-hunter-symbols-farm-1851779176"><strong>Hunter Symbol III</strong></a></span><strong>, you’ll receive the new Rey Dau Certificate Y material.</strong> This is needed to forge the new Rey Dau Gamma armor for your hunter and Palico, as well as upgrade to the new Defense Charm V and Power Charm III talismans.

It’s an open-world craft-heavy RPG in which you charge around an alien planet, beating up the local flora and fauna, in order to gather their parts to build more effective means of beating up the local flora and fauna. Along the way, there’s the most astonishingly intricate storyline, a vast cast of bonkers characters, and a kerjillion (I counted) items to craft.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196599,196411" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>OK, so not much about the above perhaps sounds fantastically original, and sure, I get that. But what makes <em>Crashlands</em> and its recent sequel stand out from the crowd is that it plays like an action-RPG. Combat is very lively, all about getting in a hit, dashing and rolling, throwing in a bomb, mixing up ranged and melee combat, and all from a comfortable isometric view.</p><p>Each enemy type, of which there are approximately infinity, requires a unique tactic, often with two or three of them getting mixed up in a brawl at the same time. That latter situation is the best, because they all want to fight each other as much as they want to kill you, so luring them toward each other can create a splendid showdown, with you lobbing in explosives from the sidelines. There’s rarely a moment when you aren’t whacking at something, whether it’s rocks, plants or vicious creatures, usually while running to your next quest or destination.</p><p>I really encourage you to play both games, but I’m focusing on <em>Crashlands 2</em> today because it came out just last month, and it’s occupied so many of my evenings and spare moments that it just feels silly not to share that with you. It’s one of those games I’m playing purely for pleasure, looking forward to after a busy day of playing other games, and not even thinking about how I could turn it into work (even though I now accidentally have). I’ve accidentally stayed up far too late far too many nights over the last couple of weeks, thinking I’ll just get another couple of quests ticked off, get the ingredients for the next dagger upgrade, and see about clearing out that one robot base, and then discovering it’s somehow&nbsp;2 a.m. and I have the school run in the morning.</p><p>You play as Flux Dabes, an intergalactic trucker who has been screwed over by her corporation, and finds herself (in both games) dumped on an alien planet—Woanope—without the means to leave. She’s once again accompanied by Juicebox, a floating, um, robotic juice carton, who provides color commentary and endless wry remarks, and the two become intricately involved in the lives of the local intelligent lifeforms and their battle against the same corporation you’ve recently quit.</p><figure id="" data-id="4fc31b5bf5e63d1502eaebc392c608f9" data-recommend-id="image://4fc31b5bf5e63d1502eaebc392c608f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flux Dabes runs up a purple and orange path, surrounded by dark violet water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Flux Dabes runs up a purple and orange path, surrounded by dark violet water." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Butterscotch Shenanigans</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4fc31b5bf5e63d1502eaebc392c608f9" data-recommend-id="image://4fc31b5bf5e63d1502eaebc392c608f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flux Dabes runs up a purple and orange path, surrounded by dark violet water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What’s more extraordinary than anything else about these games is their <em>size</em>. They are so, <em>so</em> big. As you play, your explorable area endlessly grows, gated by the strength of more distant enemies and occasionally by the need to develop means of traveling that you’ve yet to craft. In <em>Crashlands 2</em>, you also build a little home for yourself and your inventive companions packed with research benches for them to work at, where they tirelessly dream up new devices, weapons, nets, bombs, fertilizers, staffs, fishing rods, helmets, wall types, baits, armors, and pieces of decor for you to craft from the billions of items that drop when you hit stuff. Plentiful teleporters mean the ever-growing scale doesn’t become too daunting, and the constant sense of progress is unrelentingly rewarding.</p><p>I really cannot express to you how large this game is. I remember in 2016's <em>Crashlands</em>, thinking I was about to end the game, before discovering I had only explored one landscape out of two. Something similar happened in the sequel, when after a packed 15 hours or so of playing I was wrapping up the storyline, defeating a tougher boss, and thinking I was about to roll credits, only to discover it was teasing me, I wasn’t even halfway. And, crucially, I was delighted! I wasn’t ready for it to be over.</p><figure id="" data-id="9683eef55bbb8766b1386bb9391b60a0" data-recommend-id="image://9683eef55bbb8766b1386bb9391b60a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flux is surrounded by green noxious fumes, while slapping a floaty creature." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Flux is surrounded by green noxious fumes, while slapping a floaty creature." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Butterscotch Shenanigans</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9683eef55bbb8766b1386bb9391b60a0" data-recommend-id="image://9683eef55bbb8766b1386bb9391b60a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flux is surrounded by green noxious fumes, while slapping a floaty creature." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I think a large part of why I didn’t want it to be done, even though I’d gone through a satisfying arc that’d be easily worth the entry fee, is because of the game’s constant positive feedback loop. You’re <em>always </em>progressing, always ticking off something from one of its many lists, and each time experiencing a meaningful difference. Beefing up your knuckles weapon, and then equipping it with a bunch of trinkets and buffs that complement it, means thwacking a tricky enemy is going to be much easier. Boosting your HP with new armor makes you feel so much tougher. Crafting a new workbench suddenly opens up your opportunities in multiple directions.  More means more fantastically animated enemy types, more silly story, more quests to complete, more locations to uncover, more boxes to tick and items to craft and progress progress progress.</p><p>Flaws? Well, weirdly—given how much love is poured into it—I would say the writing. It’s really good! It’s just that there’s far too much of it. Conversations to get a new quest can end up going on for 20, 30 exchanges of speech-bubble text, and while it’s all superbly written and often very funny, I find myself frustrated by just wanting to know what I’m supposed to be doing next. I have, I confess, committed the cardinal sin of clicking through it all and then just checking the quest log. I don’t want to! But honestly, <em>Crashlands 2 </em>is so  wildly overwritten. It needed a detached, heartless editor to cut swathes from it, keep the great gags, and get to the point. </p><p>But&nbsp;when that’s my major complaint about such a detailed and expansive game, you know it must be doing an awful lot right. And all of this in a paid-for game that has no in-app purchases or extra fees. These games could be monetized to utter misery, and instead they don’t even dip a toe in that mire.</p><figure id="" data-id="66c74e221bcd3e118bdc939943776c36" data-recommend-id="image://66c74e221bcd3e118bdc939943776c36" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flux is chatting with some locals in a building, stood around a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Flux is chatting with some locals in a building, stood around a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Butterscotch Shenanigans</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="66c74e221bcd3e118bdc939943776c36" data-recommend-id="image://66c74e221bcd3e118bdc939943776c36" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Flux is chatting with some locals in a building, stood around a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This does make <em>Crashlands 2</em> that most unusual of games: a mobile app that costs money up front. There’s a PC version too, and it’s splendid, but it’s pricier at $25. (And totally worth it. There’s at least 35 hours of game here!) The iOS/Android version is $10, despite being the same game, and while that discrepancy always feels odd, it’s important to note that mobile prices <em>are</em> just a different market: choosing to charge customers at the point of purchase, rather than exploit them ever-after, can be devastating for attention. As such, rather than the million-plus downloads a game like this would get if it were “free-to-play,” it currently sports “5K+” downloads on Android. I really want to express how this is worth every penny, for me one of the most essential games on my tablet, and how important it is to support excellent games that use non-exploitative payments.</p><p>I really don’t know why this isn’t on Xbox or PS5. It’d be the perfect couch game, absorbing your late evening hours, perfectly paired with a light-hearted podcast. But it still sits so well on my Android tablet, one of those games (like the very different <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/faheys-top-10-games-of-2015-1749761792&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/faheys-top-10-games-of-2015-1749761792"><em>Gems of War</em></a></span>) that makes the device feel worth owning. <em>Crashlands 2</em> is such a treat, no matter which device you play it on, a game that feels so endlessly generous and involved.</p><p><em>Crashlands 2</em> is on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1401730/Crashlands_2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1401730/Crashlands_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crashlands-2/id1528199331&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/crashlands-2/id1528199331" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bscotch.crashlands2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bscotch.crashlands2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a></span>, created by the unimprovably named small indie team Butterscotch Shenanigans.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That might feel like forever, but remember: it was seven years between the first big cinematic teaser for<em> Cyberpunk </em>and its buggy release in 2020. </p><figure id="" data-id="f04b6a2cf1e4d08088b2ee2c7b97b7ec" data-recommend-id="image://f04b6a2cf1e4d08088b2ee2c7b97b7ec" data-format="png" data-width="1567" data-height="746" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A chart shows resource allocation at CDPR.

Considering CDPR now has lots of experience with both its third-person fantasy and first-person shooter formulas under its belt, maybe! Both franchises are also moving to Unreal Engine 5 and CDPR is involved in other projects as well, however, including a <em>Witcher</em> spin-off codenamed Sirius and a new IP called Hadar. Plus blockbuster game development just keeps getting more complex, expensive, and time-consuming. What took five years to make on PS5 might take even longer on PS6.</p><p>No wonder, then, that in the meantime CDPR is trying to get the existing <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> in front of more people <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-switch-2-footage-pokemon-violet-scarlet-1851781304&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-switch-2-footage-pokemon-violet-scarlet-1851781304">with the Switch 2 port</a></span>. Unfortunately, despite a next-gen version of<em> The Witcher 3</em> that came out a few years ago, a Switch 2 edition of that game isn’t currently in the works. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
