Folks craft celebrity lookalikes, themselves, and their ideal vision of the perfect hero. Personally, I’m in and out in five minutes, ready to play. But what happens if you speed through that process with your character and then find it’s subpar in gameplay? Fortunately, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> won’t shoulder you with buyer’s remorse given its various settings for tweaking your character’s style.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Once there, follow along with the initial guidance, which tasks you with speaking with your compatriots. </p><p>After the meeting, return to your tent. There, you can rest, play with your Palico, alter your equipment, and<strong> </strong>change your appearance. <strong>You can visit the camp anytime and modify your character’s appearance in <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> as often or as little as you like!</strong></p><h2 id="h299"><a id="camp"></a>What can you change in the camp menu?</h2><figure id="" data-id="7a41d894e3234f1193bb758aae8a8428" data-recommend-id="image://7a41d894e3234f1193bb758aae8a8428" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The character customization screen in Monster Hunter Wilds." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The character customization screen in Monster Hunter Wilds." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7a41d894e3234f1193bb758aae8a8428" data-recommend-id="image://7a41d894e3234f1193bb758aae8a8428" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The character customization screen in Monster Hunter Wilds." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Let’s focus on your character, though it should be noted that you can customize your Palico anytime you want, too.

It’s been like this for a few years, longer if you ask some people, and it doesn’t seem to be getting better anytime soon. Thankfully, <em>Spilled </em>is here. It’s a new game about a tiny boat cleaning up a big mess that at least lets us fix a digital world. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240080/Spilled/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240080/Spilled/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Spilled</em>, out today on PC</a></span>, is the first indie game from developer Lente. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/LenteGameDev/status/1897575001106022591&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/LenteGameDev/status/1897575001106022591" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">She lives on a boat, and this is her first release on Steam</a></span>. And in Lente’s <em>Spilled</em>, you are given the role of a sleepy little boat, tasked with cleaning up a gorgeous pixel art world using an upgradeable vacuum, water cannon, and crane. Some nasty, evil boats have been putting around and leaving black goo everywhere across various biomes and its up to you to save the day by collecting all the goo and recycling it into coins—coins that can then be used to upgrade your boat. </p><p>It’s a fairly simple concept, perfectly nailed in <em>Spilled</em>. Controlling the boat feels good and upgrading its engine to make it faster feels even better. Early on, the goo you encounter is in small patches and easy to suck up. But later on, the spills of goo you find are massive and you’ll need to go back and forth through the messes to effectively clean them. And doing this is immensely satisfying, like perfectly removing the sudsy water from a car windshield using a squeegee. Clean up an area enough  and sea critters, like whales and dolphins, will return and the water will turn blue again. </p><p><em>Spilled </em>will take most players about an hour or so to finish. Though if you want to clean every inch of its cozy world and collect all the hidden animals, you’ll likely need to spend about two hours total. It’s short, but its also packed with a lot of ideas. Every 10 minutes or so, <em>Spilled </em>was either teaching me a new way to clean stuff up—like using a water canon to remove hard-to-reach gunk on rocks—or letting me upgrade my boat again.</p><p> I’d love to see a sequel to <em>Spilled </em>that adds more levels, more ways to clean stuff up, and maybe even co-op. But for now, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-cozy-games-disney-dreamlight-valley-chill-relaxing-1848255535&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-cozy-games-disney-dreamlight-valley-chill-relaxing-1848255535"><em>Spilled</em> is a solid and gentle indie game</a></span> that lets me clean up the world for an hour, and that’s nice. I really like that. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
