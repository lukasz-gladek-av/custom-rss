And I don’t mean that most games lack patriotism or red, white, and blue banners. I mean that, while they may use the country’s landmarks, stars, and cities, and even make reference to its politics, they don’t truly engage with American culture. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/south-of-midnight&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/south-of-midnight"><em>South of Midnight</em></a></span>, a new Xbox action-platformer out now, is different. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195922" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Is Alan Wake Worth Playing Before Its Sequel? | Total Recall" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="390" data-playlist="195922,196345,195719" data-current="195922"><div><p>Is Alan Wake Worth Playing Before Its Sequel? | Total Recall</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195922/195922_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21438.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Developed by Compulsion Games, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/big-games-coming-out-2025-gta-6-borderlands-4-1851730256&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/big-games-coming-out-2025-gta-6-borderlands-4-1851730256"><em>South of Midnight</em></a></span> incorporates American culture, myths, and stories from the South in a way very few games have before. Not all of it is pretty. A lot of it is sad and painful. That’s just the reality of American history. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-developer-direct-doom-dark-ages-ninja-gaiden-1851746052/slides/4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-developer-direct-doom-dark-ages-ninja-gaiden-1851746052/slides/4"><em>South of Midnight</em></a></span> doesn’t shy away from any of that. Instead, it spotlights race, slavery, poverty, generational trauma, and death. Because of its rich, complex, often painful history, the South has developed a unique, beautiful folkloric tapestry of tall tales, heroes, and monsters. And <em>South of Midnight </em>literally lets you weave and unweave this tapestry via a 12-13 hour single-player adventure through its mystical but grounded spin on the American South.</p><p>In <em>South of Midnight</em>, you play as a young Black woman named Hazel Flood. She’s a talented athlete who has a mother consumed with helping abused kids. While this causes some drama between the two, she still cares greatly for her mother. So when a hurricane washes their trailer away down the river, Hazel chases after it and finds herself in a strange and magical version of the South, complete with nasty ghost monsters called haints, who linger in our world after someone has suffered greatly.</p><p>Thankfully, very early on in the game, you discover that Hazel is special. She’s a Weaver, a person who can see the threads of reality and can weave space and time using magical artifacts like sewing needles. The last Weaver to exist was a former slave woman who helped other slaves escape their masters and find freedom. Throughout the game, Hazel learns more about her powers and her connection to the world via this woman and her journey to help a single family escape slavery.</p><p>Of course, this is a video game, so Hazel’s newfound weaving powers allow her to kick ass, double jump, and solve puzzles, too. Sadly, this is where <em>South of Midnight </em>unravels a bit. </p><p>The combat in the game always happens in locked-off arena-like spaces where enemies spawn for a while until you defeat them all and can “pop” a cursed bit of the world and free yourself from the encounter. You do this a lot in <em>South of Midnight</em>, and it gets repetitive quickly, partly because every fight feels the same and also because the combat is serviceable but not much more than that. You can dodge, you can charge some attacks, and you have a stun and some upgrades. If you’ve played a video game in the last decade, none of this will be terribly exciting or feel unique at all. It’s not bad, per se, just stale and easily the weakest part of <em>South of Midnight</em>.</p><p>Hazel’s Weaver abilities are more fun to use when you’re platforming and solving puzzles, and I wish there was more of that in the game and less of the 100+ arenas you have to fight through to reach the end, which is a big combat arena that left a sour taste in my mouth.</p><p>Here’s the thing, though: In the end, I don’t really care that the combat is just so-so and serviceable. That’s because everything else in this game is so good that I can overlook some boring punchy bits.</p><p>The world of <em>South of Midnight</em> is gorgeous. The stop-motion-like animations of characters and critters help sell the painted, hand-crafted feel of every level in the game. Each location in <em>South of Midnight</em> is meticulously detailed and covered in little touches—like animals off in the distance or screaming cicadas—that help immerse you in the game’s lively, stylized slice of the deep South. And it’s not all swamps.</p><p><em>South of Midnight</em>’s locales are greatly varied, offering disgusting places like a town flooded with pig shit-filled water and cool forests dotted with abandoned company towns and slave quarters. And throughout your journey, incredible lighting makes every area distinct, from sun-drenched levels that feel hot and muggy to spooky swamps that feel claustrophobic and dark. I spent a lot of time in <em>South of Midnight</em>, stopping and taking screenshots of every level. And I expect I’m not alone.</p><p>Another key part of <em>South of Midnight</em>’s charm is its wonderful and very Southern music. Many levels in the game feature songs with lyrics directly related to the mythical or supernatural entity or creature you are dealing with, all of them based on real Southern folklore. </p><figure id="" data-id="6dd74cc1c514c8a28cb9fcd55a72ec85" data-recommend-id="image://6dd74cc1c514c8a28cb9fcd55a72ec85" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6dd74cc1c514c8a28cb9fcd55a72ec85" data-recommend-id="image://6dd74cc1c514c8a28cb9fcd55a72ec85" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Some songs, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/ZqExv4Eu_f0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/ZqExv4Eu_f0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like a twangy Dolly Parton-esque diddy about a massive gator named Two-Toed Tom</a></span>, stuck with me for days after playing the game. These songs run the gamut from country to blues to jazz and feature banjos, acoustic guitars, lyrics about heaven and hell, and folk singers belting out sometimes depressing allegories about the past. It’s unlike any video game soundtrack I’ve heard this year, and it will stay with me long after I move on to other games.</p><p><em>South of Midnight</em> is going to be a game that I predict some people will bounce off of after just a few hours. A big reason will be that the combat isn’t anything to write home about. And the first few levels, while gorgeous and filled with great tunes, aren’t as exciting as what follows after the game gives you more abilities, like a double jump. </p><p>But if you can push through some of those issues, what you’ll discover is a wonderful and heartfelt adventure through American history and Southern folklore that is unlike any game I’ve played. Like the South itself, <em>South of Midnight</em> is a messy, complicated, but often beautiful and passionate thing worth experiencing. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One solution to this problem is to use Hall Effect thumbsticks that are basically resistant to drifting as they use <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor#Human_interface_devices&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hall_effect_sensor#Human_interface_devices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">magnetic fields</a></span> and are less susceptible to parts wearing down and failing over time. Unfortunately, Nintendo isn’t using Hall Effect sticks for the Switch 2 Joy-Cons and that has a lot of fans nervous. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/its-official-switch-2-joy-con-will-not-feature-hall-effect-sticks&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/its-official-switch-2-joy-con-will-not-feature-hall-effect-sticks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a recent interview with <em>Nintendo Life</em></a></span>, Nate Bihldorff, senior vice president of product development &amp; publishing at Nintendo of America, confirmed that the Switch 2 doesn’t use Hall Effect sticks. </p><p>“Well, the Joy-Con 2's controllers have been designed from the ground up. They’re not Hall Effect sticks, but they feel really good,” said Bihldorff. </p><p>Bihldorff further explained that the sticks on the Pro Contoller are very quiet and feel great, but didn’t specify if they are Hall Effect thumbsticks or not. Based on the fact that Bihldorff’s media training kicked in when asked about stick drift (a negative topic) and he pivoted to something related, but positive, I’m guessing the Pro Controller also doesn’t have Hall Effect sticks. </p><p>The VP did reiterate something Nintendo previously confirmed, which is that the Joy-Con 2 controllers have been completely redesigned from the ground up. </p><p> “As you may have witnessed and felt, the new Joy-Con 2 controllers for the Nintendo Switch 2 have been really designed from the ground up from scratch, and they have been designed to have bigger movement and smoother movement,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-stick-drift-joy-con-eshop-fix-better-nintendo-1851774614&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-stick-drift-joy-con-eshop-fix-better-nintendo-1851774614">said Switch 2 hardware design lead Tetsuya Sasaki last week during a press event.</a></span> </p><p>That’s nice and all, but if you look at the replies to<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/nintendolife/status/1909230951323877448&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/nintendolife/status/1909230951323877448" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> <em>Nintendo Life</em>’s tweet about the lack of Hall Effect sticks</a></span>, you can see a lot of people who are worried that the Switch 2 will be plagued with stick drift issues. This news, coupled with high prices, delayed pre-orders, and questions about what is included in a Switch 2 physical game case, have really overshadowed what was likely supposed to be a big, fun reveal for Nintendo. It will be interesting to see how the company navigates the current storm. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As Jack Black’s Steve introduces the newly arrived humans to his village, young teenager Henry sees a pig walk past wearing a crown. He asks, “Is he some kind of king?” And for those in the know, the blubbing begins.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>If you’re a follower of <em>Minecraft</em> on YouTube, or the parent of one, you’ll inevitably have heard of Technoblade. The YouTuber, whose real name was Alexander, tragically died from cancer in 2022, aged only 22. A member of Dream SMP, which featured many of the biggest names in the field, Technoblade became known for his incredible skill at the game, and for a YouTube channel with 11 million subscribers.</p><p>Since his untimely death, Technoblade has been canonized by his contemporaries and followers, his name spoken with a lovely reverence. My own kid, only really getting into <em>Minecraft </em>YouTube since Technoblade’s passing, has learned this reverential tone and almost whispers his name. The point is, he was a great YouTuber, respected by his peers, and someone who actively fought against fame for the protection of his family. (His first name only became known after he died, and his last name is still unknown.) One of the many lines of text that can appear when you launch <em>Minecraft </em>reads “Technoblade never dies!”</p><p>So back to that scene in <em>A Minecraft Movie</em>. The bejeweled pig that Henry spots is a reference to Technoblade, whose in-game avatar was a bipedal pig wearing a crown (as seen in the image at the top of this article). The character asks, “Is he some kind of king?”</p><p>“No,” says Jack Black, before a long pause. Then with gravitas adds, “He’s a <em>legend</em>.”</p><p>You can see the moment in somewhat dubiously sourced footage in the following video:</p><p>Before the line had been delivered, just when the pig appeared on screen, all around me in the movie theater I heard kids going, “Technoblade!” with absolute delight in their voices. My son leant over to me and whispered with wide eyes, “That was Technoblade! That pig was Technoblade!” When he explained the reference to my wife in the parking lot as we left, and then solemnly delivered the “No, he’s a legend” line, she cried. She’d never even heard of him before, but the sincerity and touching nature of the tribute—it’s making me well up a bit as I type.</p><p>It turns out it’s only in the movie thanks to the kid playing Henry. According to an interview with director Jared Hess <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://collider.com/a-minecraft-movie-easter-eggs-technoblade-director-jared-hess-torfi-frans-olafsson/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://collider.com/a-minecraft-movie-easter-eggs-technoblade-director-jared-hess-torfi-frans-olafsson/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by <em>Collider</em></a></span>, Sebastian Hansen approached him during the film’s prep and said, “Look, there’s this amazing <em>Minecraft</em> player named Technoblade who passed away, and I would love to be able to honor him somehow in the film.” Hess says he spoke with the design team, and they worked it all out.</p><p>It’s fun to note there were many other easter eggs hidden in there for <em>Minecraft</em> diehards, like a Totem of Undying in Steve’s collection that would make the characters’ journey so much easier if only they knew what it was. And there was another theaterful of excited murmuring when Mojang’s Jens Bergensten appears as a silent waiter in a blink-or-miss-it moment. But of all the film’s fleeting nods to this or that, the tribute to Technoblade is the most special, and no doubt the one that will cause the most lips to quiver with emotion.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
