              <p>You don’t have to spend thousands on a new laptop, especially if you’re just after an everyday machine for casual work and home use. If you’re shopping for one today, we’ve got great news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6631/">Amazon, very generously, has dropped the price of the 14-inch HP computer in Silver to just $300, after taking a massive 35% off its usual price.</a> Your purchase will come with a free 8-in-1 hub, as well as a one-year subscription to Microsoft Office 365; both of which add even more value to the current offer. It’s one of the lowest we have seen this model drop to, but as you’d expect, the discount ends soon. Be sure to snap it up fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6631/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Decent Performance for Regular Tasks</h2>
<p>We won’t sugarcoat it; this laptop is not a powerhouse. It’s appropriate for home use like simple browsing, streaming, video calling, and some basic work tasks. We won’t exactly recommend it to work professionals, but it’s a good pick for seniors who want their own device or kids who are just getting started. You’re getting a modest 14-inch HD display that delivers decent visuals for all your needs. The anti-glare coating makes it easy on the eyes and keeps the picture quality consistent across all lighting conditions. You can view the screen comfortably in daylight (while soaking up some sun), as well as in dim settings after the shadows fall.</p>
<p>The 4GB DDR4 RAM isn’t made for heavy-duty multitasking, but it does a good job of keeping everything running smoothly, as long as you’re not trying to push some creative boundaries. There’s 128GB flash storage, which is nicely paired with a 128GB Micro SD to give you a total of 256GB space to save all your files, content, and programs. It’s more than enough to house hundreds of photos, a ton of videos, a few movies to stay entertained on the go, all your favorite songs downloaded, and more. Power comes from the 4-core Intel N150 processor, which hits up to 3.6 GHz with Intel Turbo Boost Technology.</p>



<p>Wireless connectivity comes from Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.4, while ports like USB Type-C (10Gbps), two USB Type-A, HDMI 1.4b, and an SD card reader make it easy to connect other peripherals without feeling limited. Windows 11 S also comes pre-installed, so the laptop will be ready to go right out of the box. The highlight here, however, is the one-year subscription to Microsoft 365 Office. This gives you access to premium apps like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, OneDrive, Teams, and more. You can use these to create documents, be creative with presentations, work on large spreadsheets, and communicate with teams around the world remotely. The subscription typically costs around $100 a year, but you’re getting it here for absolutely free!</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking to grab a new everyday laptop for regular use, this Amazon deal lets you pick one for basically nothing. Again, it’s not made for heavy-duty work, creative projects, or gaming. It’s designed for basic use, and it does that job quite well. Getting your orders in now will help ensure they reach you before Christmas, which is great if you’re planning to surprise a loved one with a new laptop. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6631/">Additionally, shipping is free, so $300 is all you’ve got to pay today.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anker’s HDMI Switch Crashes Below $10 With Final Discount, Compatible With TV, Laptop, PC, Xbox, Playstation, Projector, and More]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-hdmi-switch-crashes-below-10-with-final-discount-compatible-with-tv-laptop-pc-xbox-playstation-projector-and-more-2000656187</link>
            <guid>1394902</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Don’t look now, but Amazon has this Anker HDMI switch on sale for 38% off. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6623/">That shaves the price down by six whole dollars, bringing the price down from $16 to an even $10.</a></p>
<p>Old hats me remember the dark ages of television inputs. Between my cousins and I, we had an original NES that we kept at our grandmas house. This way we would always have something to do while over. This was when the SNES and even N64 had been out already, so we were retro gamers early on. Anyway, the TV in the backroom with the NES only had one coaxial hookup, which would always be set up to the cable box. It was at the back of the TV which was too heavy for any of us to move, so every visit started with one of us reaching our arm back there blindly to unscrew the cable box cable and then screw in the NES cable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6623/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Since those “switch the input to channel 3,” days, things have gotten much easier, with TVs offering multiple inputs which you can swap between. Though not every modern TV is equipped with enough ports. Maybe you’ve got a cable box, your Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X. If your TV isn’t packing at least four inputs, then you too will be living in the old days of reaching behind the TV to unplug one console to plug in another.</p>
<h2>HDMI Switching Simplified</h2>
<p>You don’t have to live like this. This is the exact scenario that the Anker HDMI switch was designed for. It has two inputs and one output. Just plug two of your consoles into the front end and out the back plug it into your TV. With just the click of a button, you can swap between either of the two inputs. It’s all hassle-free and you can say goodbye to reaching behind your TV to the jungle of tangled cables ever again.</p>



<p>The Anker HDMI switch has a wide range of compatibility. Set it up with a laptop, PC, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, or even a streaming stick like a Fire TV or Roku. And then the other end can hook up to your TV, a monitor, a projector, or even an HDMI compatible VR headset.</p>
<p>It supports resolutions of up to 4K and refresh rates of up to 60Hz, so choose wisely which consoles you choose to go through this instead of your TV’s native HDMI inputs. You won’t be able to make use of the PlayStation 5 Pro’s high-frame rates of 120fps. Also, the switch does not support HDMI CEC. This is the tech that will turn your TV on the same time you turn on your Nintendo Switch or something like that.</p>

              <p>ChatGPT reportedly wants to put sponsored ads in your AI psychosis sessions. The League of Legends fighting game is almost out. And Pluribus’ Rhea Seehorn once <a href="https://x.com/rheangelseehorn/status/2006038032537805032">starred in a<em> Magic: The Gathering</em> tutorial CD-ROM</a> from Best Buy. It’s the last Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture, for 2025. We’ll see you on the other side where more great gaming debates await like whether the myth of the “solo dev” should be retired for good or is <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dominictarason.com/post/3mbbvyts6l72g">still a useful descriptor</a>. 2026 feels like the year we’ll finally get to the bottom of this, and so much more!</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Rhea Seehorn on her early role in the Magic the Gathering video game 🧙‍♀️ <a href="https://t.co/0knL13ppkc">pic.twitter.com/0knL13ppkc</a></p> <p>— 𝙧𝙝𝙚𝙖 𝙨𝙚𝙚𝙝𝙤𝙧𝙣 𝙛𝙖𝙣 (@rheangelseehorn) <a href="https://twitter.com/rheangelseehorn/status/2006038032537805032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>ChatGPT results could soon be manipulated by “sponsored” bots</h2> <p>That’s according to a new report <a href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-ads-push-starts-taking-shape">from <em>The Information</em></a> which points to conversations among some employees at OpenAI about how to inject ads into the popular bot querying platform. A hypothetical example includes asking for recommended ibuprofen dosages for headaches and being recommended an Advil ad instead. Basically, the shitty version of Google, except you have to pay a subscription to access it.</p>

 <p>“As ChatGPT becomes more capable and widely used, we’re looking at ways to continue offering more intelligence to everyone,” a spokesperson for OpenAI told <em>The Information</em> this month. “As part of this, we’re exploring what ads in our product could look like. People have a trusted relationship with ChatGPT, and any approach would be designed to respect that trust.”</p>

 <h2>The <em>League of Legends</em> fighting game arrives next month</h2> <p>A console release date of January 20 for <em>2XKO</em> was <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/2xko-launches-january-20-2026">briefly leaked after a new trailer for the game went up on YouTube early</a>. Launched in early access on PC back in October, the full launch will see Riot Games’ free-to-play fighter arrive on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S as well.</p>

 <h2><em>River City Ransom: Underground</em> is about to disappear</h2> <p>The 2017 beat ’em up is set to be delisted from Steam at any moment now. The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/422810">store page</a> has already lost all of its images and gameplay footage. “Due to the expiration of a licensing agreement, this game will be removed from sale on Steam,” the developer shared in a new update. “The delisting process is currently underway. <wbr>If you already own the game, nothing changes — it will remain available in your Steam Library, and you can continue to download and play as usual.”</p>

 <p>The <i>Kunio-kun</i> franchise is currently owned and overseen by Arc Systems.</p> <h2>Atlus isn’t rushing the next <em>Metaphor: Refantazio</em></h2> <p>“When we initially set out to create this game, we had the ambitions of hoping to cultivate this game into one of our brands within Atlus, like a pillar,” director Katsura Hashino recently <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/refantazio-director-katsura-hashino">told <em>Game Informer</em></a>. “With that being said, just because we had a certain level of success, we don’t want to just jump on that and quickly put out something as a sequel.”</p>

 <p>He went on, “We want to really give it some thought and make sure that if we are able to continue on in this series, we’re putting together something that is building on the values that we were able to infuse into this game, and something that would be worthwhile for the fans that would be waiting for it.”</p>

 <h2>Geoff Keighley shares how the <em>Mega Man</em> reveal at The Game Awards 2025 came together</h2>   <p>“A few weeks later, I was at Capcom HQ in Osaka,” he wrote <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DS5WvBMD8DA/?hl=en&amp;img_index=1">on Instagram</a>. “The lights dimmed, the Mega Man theme played, and through the door walked Minamitani-san in a full Mega Man outfit, alongside Izumi-san, dressed as Dr. Wily. It was classic Capcom.</p> <p>Keighley continued, “We talked about their vision for the next Mega Man, and then they handed me a controller to play a very early ROM and give feedback. That’s when we began discussing how to reveal it to the world.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-review-metroid-prime-4-pokemon-2000656188">The state of the Switch 2 is good but not great</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/nitnendo-switch-2-3ds-xl-used-ebay-prices-2000656110">3DS XL prices are through the roof</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/polymarket-betting-dota2-bot-trump-truth-predict-2000656106">Bots are making hundreds of thousands betting on esports thanks to Trump</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>
