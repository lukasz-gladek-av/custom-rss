Inevitably starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, they were the sorts of movies you could cheer at. There aren’t so many big-budget movies like that today, which is why I’m so completely taken by the trailer for <em>Predator: Badlands</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195358" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="297" data-playlist="195358,195697,197589" data-current="195358"><div><p>Blasphemous 2 Developer Interview</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195358/195358_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20816.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>No delays, enjoy the trailer first:</p><p>Let’s figure out how we got here. 1987's <em>Predator</em> took the then-current U.S. obsession with special forces and commando units fighting in the jungle, and added an alien. And Arnie. And it was goofy-ass perfect. The astonishingly po-faced approach to such a ridiculous concept was directed by the soon-to-be mighty John McTiernan, the movie he made before <em>Die Hard </em>(and just 16 years before his career would collapse in a heap of abysmal flops, and 19 before <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/what-happened-die-hard-director-905219/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/what-happened-die-hard-director-905219/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">criminal proceedings</a></span> would begin that would end with him spending a year in prison for wiretapping and perjury). <em>Predator </em>was a massive success despite an inevitable critical mauling, but has one of the weirdest legacies of the era.</p><p>Rather than spawning a run of rinse-and-repeat sequels, it instead saw the fantastically incongruous and amazingly terrible <em>Predator 2</em>, a Danny Glover vehicle directed by Stephen Hopkins (<em>Lost in Space</em>), which is basically <em>Babe 2: Pig in the City</em> but with killer aliens. That put the kibosh on the franchise for over a decade, until the satanic deal was struck that allowed spin-off universe&nbsp;<em>Alien vs. Predator</em> to become a movie in 2004. In 2010 we got the almost entirely forgotten <em>Predators</em> directed by the almost entirely forgotten Nimród Antal, then in 2018 <em>The Predator</em> from the occasionally brilliant Shane Black (<em>Kiss Kiss Bang Bang</em>, <em>Iron Man 3</em>). That too got slaughtered by critics, and despite making back its money is considered a failure, including by Black himself. (It didn’t help that he cast a sex offender friend of his in a minor role, and then defended this.) </p><p>With all variants of the “Predator” title worn out, this finally brings us to 2022's <em>Prey</em>, from director Dan Trachtenberg (<em>10 Cloverfield Lane</em>), which heads back to 1719, focusing on the predator/prey relationship between an alien hunter and young Comanche woman, and <em>boom</em>, someone had finally figured out a way to make a new <em>Predator</em> movie that didn’t suck. Then just last month, animated feature <em>Predator: Killer of Killers</em> was released, set across four disparate timelines, and again won critics over to a long-struggling franchise.</p><p>So how is Trachtenberg following up this far calmer, far more composed approach to the alien hunter franchise? By going batshit ‘80s crazy, and I am <em>delighted</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="8239222bcc1ef0f19d57d25a5e6468ef" data-recommend-id="image://8239222bcc1ef0f19d57d25a5e6468ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1602" data-height="901" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dek and Thia walk through some wreckage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dek and Thia walk through some wreckage." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Fox / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8239222bcc1ef0f19d57d25a5e6468ef" data-recommend-id="image://8239222bcc1ef0f19d57d25a5e6468ef" data-format="jpg" data-width="1602" data-height="901" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dek and Thia walk through some wreckage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Straight away, we get a shot of a synthetic woman, and a view through a camera with the text “WEYLAND-YUTANI BIO-WEAPONS DIVISION” stamped on screen. Yes. YES. We’re straight away declaring this is now, surely, in the <em>Alien vs. Predator</em> timeline—one completely erased from existence by Ridley Scott’s <em>Alien</em> prequels—and this time we’re on the side of the Predator.</p><p>Set on the Predators’ home planet, we’ve got a young Predator, Dek (Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi), thrown out of his clan to become prey, who teams up with the synth remains of Thia (Elle Fanning) to survive. Then we have flying ships, behemothic monsters, somehow a bunch of armed humans, and then the closing image of what I’m pretty sure is a P-5000 Powered Work Loader mech suit—the thing Ridley uses at the end of <em>Aliens</em>.</p><p>Apparently an entire language has been developed for the Predators, which stuntman-actor Dimitrius Schuster-Koloamatangi learned for the part, and clearly everyone involved has gone wonderfully, spectacularly mad.</p><p>The only thing that could make this better would be an Arnie cameo</p><p>We only have a few months to wait, the film releasing to theaters November 7.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/predator-badlands-trailer-dan-trachtenberg-prey-aliens-1851786667]]></content:encoded>
