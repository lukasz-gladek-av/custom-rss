              <p>Apple has a reputation for keeping prices locked at full retail, especially on their latest releases. The company never discounts anything directly which makes finding deals on new Apple hardware feel like spotting a unicorn. That’s why the current situation with the 2024 Mac Mini is worth your attention: Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">just dropped the latest 256GB M4 model to $499, down from $599</a>, and this is the lowest price we’ve seen on Apple’s newest compact desktop. For this level of performance in such a compact package, there’s really no point looking at Windows alternatives right now.</p>

<h2>M4 Chip Performance That Matters</h2>
<p>The M4 chip in this <strong>Mac Mini features a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU</strong> which means serious computation from an object that’s hardly larger than a coaster. Apple’s chip design means these cores operate differently than standard Intel or AMD processors. The CPU is divided between performance and efficiency cores and uses heavy tasks such as video or 3D rendering on the performance cores and background tasks on efficiency cores without draining power and heat.</p>



<p>The total 16GB of RAM comes into play here as Apple’s architecture divides RAM between the GPU and the CPU instead of having independent ones like in the ancient machines. The <strong>system dynamically allocates memory</strong> depending on what you’re doing in this integrated manner so 16GB is more than enough compared to the same in the case of Windows. You can trim 4K video, have several creative programs open at once, or seriously multitask without the system bogging down. The <strong>256GB SSD offers speedy storage</strong> that’s light years ahead of the hard drives still found in value PCs.</p>
<p>This Mac Mini <strong>coexists nicely with Apple’s ecosystem</strong> in ways Windows mini PCs don’t: The Continuity features allow you to begin writing on your iPad or iPhone and resume where you stopped on the Mac Mini. AirDrop shares files from one device to another in an instant and hassle-free process. You can use your iPhone as a webcam for FaceTime, reply to messages directly from your desktop or even use your Apple Watch to control your Mac by unlocking it.</p>



<p>Wired Gigabit Ethernet is the standard with you getting to enjoy wired network speeds that blow WiFi for massive file transfers or streaming video. WiFi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 wireless connectivity is also available on the Mac Mini. Port alternatives are also ample with various <strong>Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports</strong> providing up to 40Gbps data transmission speeds, up to 6K resolution support for external displays, and speedy charging of devices. <strong>Two USB-A ports</strong> are included for legacy peripherals, and the headphone port is capable of driving high-impedance headphones to provide high-quality audio without an attached DAC.</p>
<p>Its small size allows it to <strong>vanish on a desk or be screwed behind a monitor</strong> with a VESA adapter. It is only 7.7 inches by 7.7 inches and 2 inches in height, occupying less space than most external hard drives. The <strong>fanless design makes it silent to operate</strong> which is ideal for recording studios, bedrooms, or offices where fan noise becomes irritating.</p>
<p>Priced at $499, this Mac Mini offers performance that would run much higher in a run-of-the-mill desktop or mini PC of this size. If you’ve been waiting for Apple to budge on pricing, this is as good as it gets.</p>
