At one point a chicken enters the arena and then a baby zombie is lowered onto the chicken’s back, creating a Chicken Jockey, a rare sighting in the actual <em>Minecraft </em>game. The line and moment, which first appeared in a trailer, has quickly become a viral meme online thanks to social media and TikTok. And while most of the time people just shout out the line and laugh, some showings have reportedly become more chaotic as younger fans and teens toss popcorn, scream, and record the action. At least one of these incidents reportedly led to police being called to remove some troublemakers. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/xjjKFmT-kDs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/xjjKFmT-kDs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As explained in this new video from YouTuber Zyphon</a></span>, the Chicken Jockey meme has exploded in the last few days as the movie hit theaters. In the video, one particular incident is highlighted involving a large number of younger audience members tossing popcorn in the air the moment the line was uttered. </p><p>According to Zyphon and others reporting on the incident, the crowd was so rowdy and chaotic that eventually the police were called and some of the people who allegedly started the chaos were removed from the theater before the <em>Minecraft Movie </em>continued. </p><p>Outside of this incident, you can find <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=chicken%20jockey&amp;t=1744062582121&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/search?q=chicken%20jockey&amp;t=1744062582121" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">plenty of folks sharing clips online</a></span> of people <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tiktok.com/@willyispr0/video/7489979161075846446?q=chicken%20jockey&amp;t=1744062582121&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tiktok.com/@willyispr0/video/7489979161075846446?q=chicken%20jockey&amp;t=1744062582121" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">screaming and clapping and tossing popcorn around the moment</a></span> Jack Black’s Steve says: “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/cureflamingofan/status/1908629932005351527&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/cureflamingofan/status/1908629932005351527" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chicken Jockey</a></span>.” Other scenes in the movie, including Steve’s introduction earlier in the film, have also become popular moments at which to scream and clap. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/shitpost_2077/status/1908953937459237198&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/shitpost_2077/status/1908953937459237198" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One theater seems to have even put up a sign</a></span> asking people to not do it. </p><p>As for why this is happening, well, it’s a combination of factors. For one, <em>Minecraft </em>is a very popular game and it’s especially popular among younger audience members who might not regularly go to the theater. Another part of this is that a lot of these young moviegoers are irony-poisoned and believe genuine emotions and reactions are “cringe.” So they overreact to things like Chicken Jockey to mask their actual feelings about something. And of course, there’s the fact that these videos are going viral online. </p><p>Heck, I’m six paragraphs deep into writing about this shit. So if you are a young dude looking to get a hit video, why not go to the opening weekend of <em>Minecraft </em>and film your friends “freaking out” at the mention of chicken jockey? It’s easy clout. And that’s all that matters anymore. Clout and tariffs. Shit sucks. </p><p>Anyway, while I don’t mind people getting excited about movies, I’m not a fan of throwing popcorn around. That shit is uncool and is super loser behavior. People have to clean that up and many theaters are understaffed, meaning a bunch of overworked and underpaid movie theater employees now have to clean up piles of spilled popcorn before the next showing can begin. Don’t be a dick to people working hard to make sure you can enjoy a movie. </p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With a folklore-laden story that’s equally heartwarming and heartbreaking, as well as simple yet enjoyable gameplay, there’s an awful lot to love about this romp through the Deep South. If that sounds like your kind of thing, here are a few things to know before diving into <em>South of Midnight</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h183"><a id=""></a>You’re rewarded for veering off the beaten path</h2><figure id="" data-id="448c476ce1fa8495ca07127255a23efa" data-recommend-id="image://448c476ce1fa8495ca07127255a23efa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hazel attacks an object with magical powers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hazel attacks an object with magical powers." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Compulsion Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="448c476ce1fa8495ca07127255a23efa" data-recommend-id="image://448c476ce1fa8495ca07127255a23efa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hazel attacks an object with magical powers." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>South of Midnight</em> is a very linear experience, so you won’t encounter any open-world environments or large-scale level design during the campaign. However, that doesn’t mean there aren’t any side paths and secret locations to uncover. As a matter of fact, <strong>you can find things hidden all across this bayou adventure’s levels</strong>—if you take the time to look around, that is.</p><p>Most notably, <strong>exploration is rewarded with health upgrades and Floofs, the latter of which is <em>South of Midnight</em>’s form of experience points</strong>. You’ll find tons of these all over the place, but most of them will require you to take a detour from the main path in some way. Since they’re required for leveling up your skills, you should <strong>take the time to thoroughly explore locations so you can stock up on as many as possible</strong>.</p><p>In addition to health upgrades and Floofs, you can find some of the game’s readables (collectibles) and world-building moments hidden away in unexpected places in <em>South of Midnight</em>, too. And if you’re aiming to fully complete the game, you’ll want to take the extra time to find these and fill out your collection.</p><h2 id="h184"><a id=""></a>Crouton is a huge help in fights</h2><figure id="" data-id="28067a07ad7fe0de300654e60291f81d" data-recommend-id="image://28067a07ad7fe0de300654e60291f81d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hazel attacks a monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hazel attacks a monster." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Compulsion Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="28067a07ad7fe0de300654e60291f81d" data-recommend-id="image://28067a07ad7fe0de300654e60291f81d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hazel attacks a monster." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Hazel’s little stuffed buddy, Crouton, may not look very tough, but he’s no slouch in battle. He can be thrown into an enemy to briefly take control of them, giving you a temporary ally that can beat the hell out of your attackers for you. If you prioritize control of tougher enemies, you can take them out of the fight for a bit so you can work on the lower-tier foes. When Crouton’s control wears off, you’ll be in a much better position for tackling those big bads. </p><p>It’s a good idea to <strong>invest some skill points into Crouton Detonation and Crouton Surge</strong> as soon as they become available to further improve Crouton’s effectiveness with an AOE (Area of Effect) blast and higher overall damage, respectively. Who knew this little guy would be such a huge help?</p><h2 id="h185"><a id=""></a>Don’t rush; Soak in the story</h2><figure id="" data-id="b2fdc2c44cf824591bcc4c76f8596108" data-recommend-id="image://b2fdc2c44cf824591bcc4c76f8596108" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hazel walks into an oversized magical lab." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hazel walks into an oversized magical lab." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Compulsion Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b2fdc2c44cf824591bcc4c76f8596108" data-recommend-id="image://b2fdc2c44cf824591bcc4c76f8596108" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hazel walks into an oversized magical lab." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Speaking of readables and world-building moments, <em>South of Midnight</em> is a story-driven title that also rewards you with lore and intriguing backstories if you take the time to invest in it. While the main campaign has plenty of compelling story beats on its own, taking the time to read notes and interact with items in the world can help build out the narrative, which will give you even more insight into the history and troubles of those in this fictional version of the Deep South. </p><hr><p><em>South of Midnight</em> is available on April 8, 2025 for Xbox Series X/S and Windows PCs.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Not all of it is pretty. A lot of it is sad and painful. That’s just the reality of American history. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-developer-direct-doom-dark-ages-ninja-gaiden-1851746052/slides/4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-developer-direct-doom-dark-ages-ninja-gaiden-1851746052/slides/4"><em>South of Midnight</em></a></span> doesn’t shy away from any of that. Instead, it spotlights race, slavery, poverty, generational trauma, and death. Because of its rich, complex, often painful history, the South has developed a unique, beautiful folkloric tapestry of tall tales, heroes, and monsters. And <em>South of Midnight </em>literally lets you weave and unweave this tapestry via a 12-13 hour single-player adventure through its mystical but grounded spin on the American South.</p><p>In <em>South of Midnight</em>, you play as a young Black woman named Hazel Flood. She’s a talented athlete who has a mother consumed with helping abused kids. While this causes some drama between the two, she still cares greatly for her mother. So when a hurricane washes their trailer away down the river, Hazel chases after it and finds herself in a strange and magical version of the South, complete with nasty ghost monsters called haints, who linger in our world after someone has suffered greatly.</p><p>Thankfully, very early on in the game, you discover that Hazel is special. She’s a Weaver, a person who can see the threads of reality and can weave space and time using magical artifacts like sewing needles. The last Weaver to exist was a former slave woman who helped other slaves escape their masters and find freedom. Throughout the game, Hazel learns more about her powers and her connection to the world via this woman and her journey to help a single family escape slavery.</p><p>Of course, this is a video game, so Hazel’s newfound weaving powers allow her to kick ass, double jump, and solve puzzles, too. Sadly, this is where <em>South of Midnight </em>unravels a bit. </p><p>The combat in the game always happens in locked-off arena-like spaces where enemies spawn for a while until you defeat them all and can “pop” a cursed bit of the world and free yourself from the encounter. You do this a lot in <em>South of Midnight</em>, and it gets repetitive quickly, partly because every fight feels the same and also because the combat is serviceable but not much more than that. You can dodge, you can charge some attacks, and you have a stun and some upgrades. If you’ve played a video game in the last decade, none of this will be terribly exciting or feel unique at all. It’s not bad, per se, just stale and easily the weakest part of <em>South of Midnight</em>.</p><p>Hazel’s Weaver abilities are more fun to use when you’re platforming and solving puzzles, and I wish there was more of that in the game and less of the 100+ arenas you have to fight through to reach the end, which is a big combat arena that left a sour taste in my mouth.</p><p>Here’s the thing, though: In the end, I don’t really care that the combat is just so-so and serviceable. That’s because everything else in this game is so good that I can overlook some boring punchy bits.</p><p>The world of <em>South of Midnight</em> is gorgeous. The stop-motion-like animations of characters and critters help sell the painted, hand-crafted feel of every level in the game. Each location in <em>South of Midnight</em> is meticulously detailed and covered in little touches—like animals off in the distance or screaming cicadas—that help immerse you in the game’s lively, stylized slice of the deep South. And it’s not all swamps.</p><p><em>South of Midnight</em>’s locales are greatly varied, offering disgusting places like a town flooded with pig shit-filled water and cool forests dotted with abandoned company towns and slave quarters. And throughout your journey, incredible lighting makes every area distinct, from sun-drenched levels that feel hot and muggy to spooky swamps that feel claustrophobic and dark. I spent a lot of time in <em>South of Midnight</em>, stopping and taking screenshots of every level. And I expect I’m not alone.</p><p>Another key part of <em>South of Midnight</em>’s charm is its wonderful and very Southern music. Many levels in the game feature songs with lyrics directly related to the mythical or supernatural entity or creature you are dealing with, all of them based on real Southern folklore. </p><figure id="" data-id="6dd74cc1c514c8a28cb9fcd55a72ec85" data-recommend-id="image://6dd74cc1c514c8a28cb9fcd55a72ec85" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6dd74cc1c514c8a28cb9fcd55a72ec85" data-recommend-id="image://6dd74cc1c514c8a28cb9fcd55a72ec85" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Some songs, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/ZqExv4Eu_f0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/ZqExv4Eu_f0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like a twangy Dolly Parton-esque diddy about a massive gator named Two-Toed Tom</a></span>, stuck with me for days after playing the game. These songs run the gamut from country to blues to jazz and feature banjos, acoustic guitars, lyrics about heaven and hell, and folk singers belting out sometimes depressing allegories about the past. It’s unlike any video game soundtrack I’ve heard this year, and it will stay with me long after I move on to other games.</p><p><em>South of Midnight</em> is going to be a game that I predict some people will bounce off of after just a few hours. A big reason will be that the combat isn’t anything to write home about. And the first few levels, while gorgeous and filled with great tunes, aren’t as exciting as what follows after the game gives you more abilities, like a double jump. </p><p>But if you can push through some of those issues, what you’ll discover is a wonderful and heartfelt adventure through American history and Southern folklore that is unlike any game I’ve played. Like the South itself, <em>South of Midnight</em> is a messy, complicated, but often beautiful and passionate thing worth experiencing. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
