Think <em>Left 4 Dead 2</em>, but with more sticky notes, missions, and a full progression system. However, that progression system is getting a big overhaul in update 1.3, just one of a few updates Remedy has pushed out to improve the game based on fan feedback. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540?emclan=103582791474781150&amp;emgid=536605983645893984&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540?emclan=103582791474781150&amp;emgid=536605983645893984" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Update 1.3, out now on all platforms</a></span>, rebalances how perks work in <em>FBC</em>. Perks are a key part of the game’s progression, letting players unlock new abilities—like being able to get rid of status effects by jumping—and changing how you play the game. Previously, they were hard to unlock as you had to collect resources, some of which the game did a poor job of highlighting. But now some lower-level perks are cheaper to unlock while some higher-level ones cost more resources. The idea, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536605983645893033&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536605983645893033" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as Remedy explained in a blog post</a></span>, is to get people using more perks, more quickly, and then making it easier to unlock higher-level options as they play more. </p><p>It sounds good to me, someone who is still playing<em> FBC: Firebreak </em>on and off between other games. The last few updates have done a great job of improving the game, but looking at what publicly available data there is, like SteamDB’s player count charts, <em>FBC </em>seems to be struggling. </p><h2 id="h687109"><a id=""></a>Remedy was disappointed by <em>FBC’s </em>launch</h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-launch-wasnt-what-studio-hoped-for-but-remedy-isnt-giving-up/1100-6532823/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fbc-firebreak-launch-wasnt-what-studio-hoped-for-but-remedy-isnt-giving-up/1100-6532823/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a new interview,</a></span> Remedy communications director Thomas Puha talked to <em>GameSpot</em> about the launch of <em>FBC</em>, its player count, and its future. And he was frank and honest, saying “We aren’t naïve; we had hoped for a better launch.” </p><p> But Puha says the team is “super-motivated to continue building the game” and is using player feedback to guide future updates. He also pushed back on people using <em>FBC’s </em>low Steam player count as evidence that the new shooter has flopped. </p><p>“Steam is a very important part of the business of <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>,” said Puha. “The Steam [active player count] is a very easy statistic to dig up, but it isn’t everything.”</p><p>As for the future of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/fbc-firebreak&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/fbc-firebreak"><em>FBC</em></a></span>, Puha reiterated Remedy’s plans to add two new missions to the game later this year as well as some new, undisclosed features. But he also acknowledged that some plans have changed based on the rough launch. </p><p>“We’ve rearranged some of our development plans, prioritized certain features, and deprioritized others already during the week of the game being live,” said Puha. “The game is live, players’ feedback comes in, things will change, that’s what we expected.”</p><p>“It’s exciting that the game starts evolving now that it’s live,” continued Puha, “Remedy is fully committed to <em>FBC: Firebreak</em>. We are all curious to see what it will be like later in the year.”</p><p> .</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/remedy-control-fbc-firebreak-lowplayer-count-update-1-3-1851785449]]></content:encoded>

It is simultaneously an adventure with a defined end goal and an open world (or I guess open house?) mystery, so the question of “how long <em>Blue Prince </em>is” will depend entirely on what you want to get out of it. This ambiguity has also led to some discourse among the game’s fans that I <em>personally </em>take umbrage with, even if said discourse was well-intentioned. Let’s break it down.</p><h2 id="h350638"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to beat Blue Prince?</h2><figure id="" data-id="c431f5f48995253c284bff360d75b3e5" data-recommend-id="image://c431f5f48995253c284bff360d75b3e5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Blue Prince.

Three gems are shown on a shelf in front of a crest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At the outset of <em>Blue Prince</em>, you have a clear objective: reach the 46th room of the randomized 45 room house you’ve inherited from your uncle Herbert Sinclair. While it is <em>technically </em>possible to accomplish this task in one in-game day (there’s a trophy for it, even), 99.999999999% of players will need to aimlessly stumble throughout the house while they gather clues and unlock permanent upgrades first. <strong>The game’s credits will play after finding Room 46</strong>, so you could consider this “beating” <em>Blue Prince</em>.</p><p><strong>While you can finish <em>Blue Prince</em> in 15 to 20 hours</strong>, this estimate can swing wildly. If you’re really good at puzzle games and luck is on your side, you could find your way to the end of <em>Blue Prince </em>in under ten hours. However, if you aren’t accustomed to roguelikes or puzzle games (or both), you could easily spend 25 or 30 hours to reach the credits. Frankly, there’s nothing wrong with that! <strong><em>Blue Prince </em>leaves a lot up to chance by design</strong>, so you could go hours without seeing clues that other players might find incredibly early on their journey.</p><p><strong>That said, <em>Blue Prince </em>has a <em>ton </em>of mysteries to solve after the credits</strong>. These relate directly to the main story and include some pretty big discoveries, but uncovering these will take <em>a lot</em> more notetaking and out-of-the-box thinking. <strong>Peeling back every layer of <em>Blue Prince </em>and seeing every challenge to the end can absolutely take you over 100 hours</strong>. Again, that estimate should be taken with a grain of salt, as many secrets will depend on whether a lot of random events line up just right for you on a given in-game day. Your completion time will also change if you use guides or want to solve absolutely everything yourself.</p><p>This massive postgame is why many fans have taken to calling the quest for Room 46 “the tutorial.” That said, if you haven’t played <em>Blue Prince </em>yet, I’d strongly advise <em>against</em> looking at the opening act as an appetizer to overcome before you get to the game’s main course.</p><h2 id="h350639"><a id=""></a>Why I don’t think you should call getting to Room 46 in <em>Blue Prince </em>“the tutorial”</h2><figure id="" data-id="dc6ffa5d5c5d5ad960f91a6462108af2" data-recommend-id="image://dc6ffa5d5c5d5ad960f91a6462108af2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Blue Prince.

Before I could even press play, I was barraged with tips and facts about <em>Blue Prince </em>that I <em>had </em>to know if I wanted to play it the <em>right </em>way. You gotta take notes about everything! You haven’t <em>really</em> started <em>Blue Prince </em>until you reach a certain point! You’re just a <em>noob</em> if you complain about the Billiards room! You won’t believe how many layers there are to <em>Blue Prince</em> and you have to <em>see them all</em>!</p><p>I’ll be frank; this discourse damn near ruined <em>Blue Prince </em>for me. I was <em>so </em>stressed out in the opening hours of the game that I obsessively noted every observation I had about every room, worried about all these intricate and complex puzzles that would await me when the game <em>really </em>started. I wasn’t even sure <em>what </em>I was looking for, I just <em>had </em>to get through this “tutorial” fast so I could understand why everyone’s losing their mind about this game. What spectacular secret will I find once I enter Room 46? What will <em>Blue Prince</em> be like once I finally get to the “real” part of the game?</p><p>Without outright spoiling, I’ll say this: <strong>there’s no reality-shifting moment in Room 46</strong>. There is no “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/doki-doki-literature-club-plus-deserves-to-be-replayed-1847202498&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/doki-doki-literature-club-plus-deserves-to-be-replayed-1847202498">Just Monika</a></span>” or “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/portal-the-companion-collection-switch-valve-nintendo-1849117877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/portal-the-companion-collection-switch-valve-nintendo-1849117877">The Cake is a lie</a></span>” twist that will force you to make that shocked face you see in 90% of YouTube thumbnails. The only big reveal is—as mentioned above— there are several extra puzzles in <em>Blue Prince </em>that involve more obsessive note taking and riddle-decoding to solve. When people call the first act of <em>Blue Prince</em> “the tutorial,” they just mean there’s a lot more game remaining.</p><p>By focusing so much on what was next in <em>Blue Prince</em>, I wasn’t able to enjoy those opening hours of the game. I nearly put it down for good until I started playing it alongside my girlfriend, which finally helped me ignore the sky-high expectations put in my brain from internet commentators. I really regret that my first hours with the game were tainted by focusing on what came next, so my advice is to take <em>Blue Prince </em>slowly and enjoy every phase of the game however you’d like.</p><h2 id="h350640"><a id=""></a>Play as much of <em>Blue Prince </em>as you want, even if you don’t “beat” it</h2><figure id="" data-id="470f8c61ae4f9b067b2bc6694705b371" data-recommend-id="image://470f8c61ae4f9b067b2bc6694705b371" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Blue Prince.

At best, it’s redundant: You’ll inevitably find bread crumbs for extra puzzles and objectives on your journey to Room 46. <em>Blue Prince </em>naturally does a good job of prodding your curiosity, so you’ll know which threads to pull next if you’re ready for more after the credits. </p><p>At worst, the tutorial framing is patronizing. It undermines the accomplishment of getting to Room 46, as if to say the player shouldn’t feel proud because the puzzles that lie ahead are just so much harder. Even if there’s no ill intention involved, it’s the same vibe as telling someone they haven’t <em>really </em>played an MMORPG until they’ve participated in high-end raid content, or you haven’t played <em>Elden Ring</em> unless you use a strength build and never use Spirit Ashes and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-missmikkaa-erdtree-boss-fight-dance-pad-1851606332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-missmikkaa-erdtree-boss-fight-dance-pad-1851606332">play exclusively with a dance pad</a></span>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/skip-boss-fights-elden-ring-metroid-prime-argument-1851781231&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/skip-boss-fights-elden-ring-metroid-prime-argument-1851781231">Not everyone enjoys video games the same way</a></span>, and that’s okay! Reaching Room 46 is worth celebrating, whether it took you five or fifty hours to pull off.</p><p><strong><em>Blue Prince </em>is about the journey, not the destination</strong>. So if you aren’t enjoying the journey, there’s no big moment at the end that’ll make it all worthwhile. The post-credits puzzles in <em>Blue Prince </em>are way more intricate and cryptic than everything that came before, and you might not enjoy those challenges as much as the straightforward quest to find Room 46. Others may say that the endgame challenges of <em>Blue Prince </em>are the best part. It’s up to you to decide whether or not you want to dive so deep into the game that you become a walking wiki for it.</p><p><br>All of this is to say, don’t worry too much about what the “true end” of <em>Blue Prince </em>is. It is, indeed, a quick adventure if you want it to be. But if you want to dig deeper into it, you’ll be pleased by just how deep this rabbit hole goes. For best results, <strong>I recommend going slowly with the game and taking breaks if you get stuck, as a good night’s sleep can make all the difference between a puzzle being fun or frustrating</strong>. And most importantly, enjoy your time in Mt. Holly manor!</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/blue-prince-how-long-to-beat-room-46-tutorial-puzzles-1851785424]]></content:encoded>

I’m here for answers. I’m here for closure. Hopefully I’ll find some mementos to bring back to the families that lost people in the accident. But it’s not just sunken, rusted metal that lines the ocean floor. No, something else is here. Or is it? Am I losing my mind? Strange visions cloud my sight. A sudden metallic thud announces the presence of…<em>something </em>out there in the deep. Am I hearing voices?

No, I’m in my apartment here in Brooklyn in reality. I’ve just hit the escape key to pause this game; I need to take a moment and sober up my brain from the immersion that, for a split second, made me think I was actually underwater and something was coming to get me. Real phobias were triggered, but I am safe. I take a few breaths. I have to continue. I have to know what happened. And I have to face this fear. Why go through all this trouble to come back empty handed? I hear another sound. Oh god…I shouldn’t be here.</p><hr><p>Set about a decade after the events of the base game, <em>Siren’s Rest</em> is an expansion to 2024’s horror walking simulator <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/still-wakes-the-deep-review-the-chinese-room-1851544587&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/still-wakes-the-deep-review-the-chinese-room-1851544587"><em>Still Wakes the Deep</em></a></span>. <em>Siren’s Rest</em> tells the story of Mhairi, a diver who sets out to find what remains of the tragic and mysterious incident that caused the Beira D oil rig to sink in the base game. Given instructions to collect any memorabilia from the deceased and photograph any bodies you find, you’ll drift through the impossible depths of the ocean and explore the rig as you seek to learn what happened. It seems, however, that you’re not alone down here. And I’m not talking about your crew. There’s something else here, too.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/still-wakes-the-deep-review-the-chinese-room-1851544587&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/still-wakes-the-deep-review-the-chinese-room-1851544587"><em>Still Wakes The Deep</em>: The <em>Kotaku</em> Review</a></span></p><p>It took me about three hours to reach the conclusion of <em>Siren’s Rest</em>—and, given my very real thalassophobic responses to its setting and scares, it was a rough three hours at that. Provided they don’t share my fear of watery depths, the DLC might feel too short for some, and could risk being a touch boring in that you mostly just swim around collecting stuff. But, if you stick around for the character-driven story woven through the murky depths, you’ll come to find that this DLC, much like the base game, is here to hold up a mirror to your own life, to ask you when your instincts might be the most dangerous threat to your existence. And just when you’re in the middle of some deep thought about the human desire for knowledge and our impulsive curiosity, <em>Siren’s Rest</em>’s horror is here to remind you that some forces of nature may ever elude that knowledge and perhaps punish that very curiosity we so often value.</p><figure id="" data-id="326c78198075b793e893500d9458e03b" data-recommend-id="image://326c78198075b793e893500d9458e03b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An oxygen cord stretches from the player out into the depths of the ocean." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An oxygen cord stretches from the player out into the depths of the ocean." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Chinese Room / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="326c78198075b793e893500d9458e03b" data-recommend-id="image://326c78198075b793e893500d9458e03b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An oxygen cord stretches from the player out into the depths of the ocean." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As a pseudo sequel to <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em>, <em>Siren’s Rest </em>benefits from you having played the base game before jumping into the literal and proverbial deep end it provides. But if you played <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> around the time of its release and have forgotten various details, don’t worry. I did too, and there was something resonant about coming across the wreckage of the original game as my mind slowly caught up to what happened. The DLC is a character-focused story at heart, so an encyclopedic knowledge of details about what happened in the original game beyond “crazy monster shows up and destroys everything” isn’t terribly necessary. So come on in. The water’s fi—no, this shit’s horrifying, what am I talking about? </p><h2 id="h287722"><a id=""></a>The walking simulator learns to swim</h2><figure id="" data-id="5b6ec9e3400e493ba83cc5f706b66bd6" data-recommend-id="image://5b6ec9e3400e493ba83cc5f706b66bd6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist looks out at a fellow diver deep underwater." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist looks out at a fellow diver deep underwater." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Chinese Room / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5b6ec9e3400e493ba83cc5f706b66bd6" data-recommend-id="image://5b6ec9e3400e493ba83cc5f706b66bd6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist looks out at a fellow diver deep underwater." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Though the entirety of <em>Siren’s Rest</em> takes place at the bottom of the ocean floor, it is still very much like previous games from developer The Chinese Room: It’s a short trip of wandering and collecting, with the occasional test of your reflexes during chase sequences. You’re also given an arc welder early on that lets you cut open grates and doors to gain access to new areas. </p><p>You can’t cut just anything open, though. Instead, you’ll come to spot signature clusters of rusted metal nodules on the areas you’re allowed to cut, which typically come up at points when Mhairi finds herself at a dead end. This usually leads to the person chatting in her headpiece, Rob, telling her “well, look around!” and then you eventually find the door or grate or whatever that needs to be cut open. This pattern repeats a bit too often.</p><figure id="" data-id="bdbce3e977c8367f5d2d379b940ff24f" data-recommend-id="image://bdbce3e977c8367f5d2d379b940ff24f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist swims through a cramped space." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist swims through a cramped space." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Chinese Room / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bdbce3e977c8367f5d2d379b940ff24f" data-recommend-id="image://bdbce3e977c8367f5d2d379b940ff24f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist swims through a cramped space." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s unfortunate there’s not more freedom to play and explore in an unscripted way. The game wants<em> </em>you to poke around a bit and to feel free to explore, but there’s not a whole lot to be found if you venture off the straight and narrow path as you make your way toward the increasingly creepy experiences that await, buried under thousands of feet of water and rusted metal.</p><p>I have no issues with the simplicity of the “walking simulator” genre. I dig it—especially as a palette cleanser from larger, more demanding games. And there is something precious and refreshing about a game that you can just bang out in three hours. That said, there were more than a few times I wished the Chinese Room would’ve considered ways to push this genre a little more. Giving me a bit of freedom with the arc welder to cut into random, unmarked surfaces would’ve been a neat way to encourage me to poke around a bit more and get into the headspace of a deep sea diver uncovering mysteries. </p><figure id="" data-id="b9660e23d82f6ecbc0794be285587d20" data-recommend-id="image://b9660e23d82f6ecbc0794be285587d20" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist observes a doorway where their oxygen cord is laced through." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist observes a doorway where their oxygen cord is laced through." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Chinese Room / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b9660e23d82f6ecbc0794be285587d20" data-recommend-id="image://b9660e23d82f6ecbc0794be285587d20" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist observes a doorway where their oxygen cord is laced through." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Swimming underwater for the vast majority of the game does grant a sense of freedom you don’t usually find in this genre, however. The simple ability to move in all three dimensions makes the spaces feel less linear, and of course contributes to the sense of dread that comes with being at the bottom of the ocean. I’d love to see more devs run with the concept of a focused, narrative-driven game set underwater; it made me think in three dimensions more than I would’ve expected, which in turn allowed me to more easily immerse myself in the dread that <em>Siren’s Rest</em>’s environment holds. </p><p>On that subject, fellow <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalassophobia&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalassophobia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thalassophobes</a></span>, let’s have a chat about how this game <strong>will </strong>make your stomach turn. </p><h2 id="h287723"><a id=""></a>If you suffer from thalassophobia or submechanophobia, please be careful</h2><figure id="" data-id="a23584fb7177dab7596813adf817069d" data-recommend-id="image://a23584fb7177dab7596813adf817069d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A diver looks out over a steep underwater cliff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A diver looks out over a steep underwater cliff." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Chinese Room / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a23584fb7177dab7596813adf817069d" data-recommend-id="image://a23584fb7177dab7596813adf817069d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A diver looks out over a steep underwater cliff." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I fully consented to subjecting myself to a game that runs on the very things that terrify me the most: being stranded in a vast ocean, being deep underwater, and being in a large body of water with…things.</p><p>This has been a lifelong terror of mine. All the other shit that spooks me—arachnophobia, being abducted by aliens, trying and failing to use my rice cooker—all that takes a distant back seat to the behemoth of the ocean. So yeah, this game was hard for me to play. And the fact that I fell in love with the narrative only complicated that experience. At the sight of the impossible depths of <em>Siren’s Rest</em>’s ocean, my stomach physically felt like it turned several times; I had to smack the escape key to pause the game and take a breath more on numerous occasions. And yes, one moment did get me to yelp like a little girl and cover my eyes with my hands. Thankfully my roommate wasn’t home when this happened. I was loud. </p><figure id="" data-id="4b5e3056cf73779f36adb11597bbaab9" data-recommend-id="image://4b5e3056cf73779f36adb11597bbaab9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist swims toward a sunken helicopter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist swims toward a sunken helicopter." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Chinese Room / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4b5e3056cf73779f36adb11597bbaab9" data-recommend-id="image://4b5e3056cf73779f36adb11597bbaab9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist swims toward a sunken helicopter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I like to play around with fear and danger; it can be a rewarding and positive experience when done safely and with consent. But if you’re like me and genuinely do suffer from a sense of dread from large bodies of water, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submechanophobia&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submechanophobia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">submechanophobia</a></span>, kenophobia, or agoraphobia (and claustrophobia given the tight spaces you must squeeze yourself through sometimes), please be careful with this game. The flipside of its effective thalassophobic simulation is that <em>Siren’s Rest</em> can actually be a neat way to safely face some of these fears. And that very concept of facing something that scares you or confuses you is core to the DLC’s strongest asset: its gorgeous, resonant, and memorable narrative themes. </p><h2 id="h287724"><a id=""></a>Fight, Flight, or Freeze</h2><p>Running away, and the notion that we exacerbate problems by fleeing from them, was the most compelling aspect of 2025’s <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> for me. The protagonist in the base game finds himself in a horrific situation <em>because</em> he’s running away from some problems at home. The game then uses inexplicable cosmic horror to give the character, and you, a persistent experience of flight, of running in terror, refusing to face what pursues you. And I simply love a game that bakes its themes into the gameplay itself.</p><p>You’ll have to escape from a few things in <em>Siren’s Rest</em>, but the previous game’s theme of running away is flipped. Instead of being someone who always runs <em>from</em> things, Mhairi continues to push further underwater, exploring the remains of the oil rig. She’s someone who consistently pursues things as a part of her character and temperament. She’s curious and persistent. You’ll come to learn that Mhairi has her own connection to the incident of the first game, and it seems clear that her curiosity and persistence, admirable qualities in the right circumstances, are the very things that are endangering her and her crew as the story unravels.</p><div><h4> The political themes are louder this time around  </h4><p> The first game wasn’t shy about its politics, driving home that private,  for-profit control and a lack of unionized labor was every bit as  responsible for the destruction of the rig as was the creepy thing  lurking in the waters. And if anything, playing <em>Siren’s Rest </em>only makes it even more clear just how much that first game had to say. Characters in <em>Siren’s Rest</em>  chat about how the imposing and abusive managerial structure of the  fictional Cadal oil company is what pushed the crew to its breaking  point, while the Lovecraftian beasties serve as an unknowable  representation of said breaking point. There’s a powerful story about  labor and environmental justice woven into this DLC.  </p></div><p>If <em>Still Wakes the Deep</em> tries to instill in you the lesson that perpetually running away from your problems won’t solve anything and in fact will only ruin things further, then <em>Siren’s Rest</em> is here to caution you about the extreme opposite reaction. The danger of persisting and the need to continue to dig to find closure on something mysterious and unknowable is at the core of this DLC. During one fascinating sequence, the crew in <em>Siren’s Rest</em> is given an opportunity to turn away and return to the surface after something unfortunate happens, but it’s Mhairi, not an overbearing manager who expects results, who wants to stay and keep digging, out of curiosity, out of a <em>need to know</em>. It’s a moment rooted in character that speaks to larger themes as well. Yes, the social and economic structures we build are often what swallow us whole when we’re not united against power and capital. But at the same time, we should be cautious about certain impulses of our own that might threaten our ability to unite against those forces.</p><p>But it’s not just its deft, rich commentary on capitalism and our impulse to seek answers that makes <em>Siren’s Rest </em>worth playing, nor is it just the fear of what lurks beneath the ocean’s surface that provides its nightmare fuel. <em>Siren’s Rest</em> is here to give you some cosmic, Lovecraftian horror—to scare the hell out of you, sure, but, to provide a powerful masterclass in how and why unknowable horror can be such a powerful narrative tool as well.</p><figure id="" data-id="e4d0ed34f2c7e0fbb5abb88e88a39810" data-recommend-id="image://e4d0ed34f2c7e0fbb5abb88e88a39810" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist of Siren's Rest photographs a dead body." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Siren's Rest photographs a dead body." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Chinese Room / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e4d0ed34f2c7e0fbb5abb88e88a39810" data-recommend-id="image://e4d0ed34f2c7e0fbb5abb88e88a39810" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist of Siren's Rest photographs a dead body." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Siren’s Rest</em> isn’t here to give you a lore dump on the ecology of whatever the hell came out of the ocean floor in the first game. Those hellish threats remain unnamed, mysterious, able to make you doubt reality itself. <em>Siren’s Rest</em>, instead, wants you to consider our connections to other people and how they are strained by the very relatable, human need to find closure. The “umbilical” cable that provides Mhairi with her oxygen serves as a reminder of her connection with safety, with other human beings. But despite how essential this connection is to sustaining her own life, <em>Siren’s Rest</em> sees Mhairi repeatedly test just how much stress she can put on that fragile connection. And at the same time, the game also wants to caution you that, just maybe, some shit is best <em>left alone</em>. If only it were so easy to just let sleeping dogs lie, even those sunken far below the ocean’s surface.</p><hr><p>A short runtime and lack of freedom, on top of some unfortunate bugs, might hold <em>Siren’s Rest</em> down from reaching its potential for some. But the beautifully written character stories at the heart of this horror game are what make it worth experiencing. <em>Siren’s Rest</em> is a powerful and terrifying B-side to a fantastic horror game from last year, one I’ll think about for a long time to come.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/sirens-rest-still-wakes-chinese-room-walking-simulator-1851785437]]></content:encoded>

In the show, the gruesome struggle for survival is a spectator sport in which The Front Man and the competition operators allow a select group of rich, masked douchebags to watch the games on television screens—like a sports bar for the perverse.</p><p>In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/squid-game-season-3-netflix-saw-black-mirror-circle-1851785257&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/squid-game-season-3-netflix-saw-black-mirror-circle-1851785257">Season 3</a></span>, the sadistic voyeurism goes to scarier depths when we find out some VIPs are given the chance to dress up as guards and execute contestants who didn’t finish the game properly. These are the people who personify the term “insanely rich.” Dong-hyuk said those people share a connection with one of the richest men in the world.</p><p>“Everybody talks about him. Not only is he the head of a huge tech company that controls the world, almost, but he’s also this showman. After writing [Season 3], of course I thought, ‘Oh, some of the VIPs do kind of resemble Elon Musk.’”</p><p>This isn’t the first time he’s noted the parallels between his imaginary class of elitists and the ones all over the news. In a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/squid-game-director-season-2-hwang-dong-hyuk-netflix-interview-1234670491/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/general/squid-game-director-season-2-hwang-dong-hyuk-netflix-interview-1234670491/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2021 interview with <em>IndieWire</em></a></span>, released a month after <em>Squid Game</em> premiered, he said President Donald Trump reminded him of one of the VIPs in the first season because “it’s almost like he’s running a game show, not a country, like giving people horror.” He told <em>Time</em> years later that the January 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol “was also part of the current events that inspired me.”</p><p>Truly, these are the reasons shows like <em>Squid Game</em> draw massive audiences. Economic imbalances afford certain groups of people the ability to watch those less fortunate desperately fight and kill for resources others&nbsp;have in abundance, resources they can frivolously spend on things like kicking back and taking in this brutal spectacle. <em>Squid Game</em> is far from a documentary, but as Dong-hyuk has all but admitted, it is a product of its time.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/netflix-squid-game-season-3-elon-musk-donald-trump-1851785435]]></content:encoded>
