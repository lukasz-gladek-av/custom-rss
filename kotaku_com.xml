              <p>Apple unveiled its latest pair of earbuds – the Apple AirPods Pro 3 – in September this year, and our audio experts loved the upgrades these brought. They launched at the standard $249 price, but we just spotted a deal that lets you pick them up for less today.</p>
<p>Amazon has now dropped the AirPods Pro 3 to $199, after taking 20% off, bringing the pair back to its lowest price ever. All shoppers get to enjoy free delivery with their purchase, and placing your orders today can help you get them just in time for Christmas. If you’ve been meaning to upgrade your audio gear, or surprise a music lover in your life this holiday season, now is the time to make the move.</p>

<h2>Impressive Sound, Better ANC Capabilities</h2>
<p>These look quite similar to AirPods Pro 2, but feature a slightly redesigned shape with new foam-infused silicone ear tips for a better fit. The new acoustic architecture gives sound quality a boost, delivering rich, deep audio that lets you enjoy your favorite tracks and podcasts with detailed clarity. It lets you feel every instrument, with vivid vocals like never before.</p>
<p>Active noise cancellation capabilities have improved, too, as this pair is capable of removing up to 2x more unwanted noise than AirPods Pro 2; great for when you want to stay fully immersed in the moment with your favorite track playing. The ANC mode works well when you don’t want background sounds to distract you. You can enable it when you’re working in a busy cafe or trying to focus on an important task in the office. Of course, this level of noise blocking doesn’t work for every situation – sometimes it’s better to stay present and aware of what’s happening around. For that, there’s the transparency mode, which lets some ambient sound in.</p>



<p>Regardless of the mode, AirPods Pro 3 customize the sound signature for your unique ear geometry and fit with its next-generation Adaptive EQ. What’s more, these protect your hearing health, too. You can take an at-home hearing test that checks your hearing in a broader range of everyday conditions, or use the pair as a hearing aid when you need the voices around you amplified. Those often exposed to loud environmental noise can put them on to prevent hearing loss as well. Other health features include heart rate sensing, which monitors your heart rate, plus calories burned for up to 50 different workout types.</p>
<p>Another solid selling point is the Live Translation feature, which uses Apple Intelligence to offer real-time translation for face-to-face conversations around the world. Basically, the earbuds pick up on what someone is saying and translate it instantly, letting you reply in your preferred language using your iPhone or their AirPods. As for the battery life, you’ll enjoy up to 8 hours of listening on a single charge with Active Noise Cancellation on, and up to 10 hours in Transparency using the Hearing Aid feature.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6363/">This deal brings the price of this feature-packed pair to $199, from $249</a>. It’s a big discount, sure, considering how these just launched, it’s still a welcome drop. It won’t last long, though, so it’s best to get your orders in quickly before it wraps up. Ordering now will also help you enjoy free shipping with your purchase!</p>
