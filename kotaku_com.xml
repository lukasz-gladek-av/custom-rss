The sequel to 2018's<em> God Of War, Ragnarök</em> is a bigger and often better open-world action game that tells an epic story about the end of the world, gods fighting each other, and a father learning to let his son grow up.

This was a PS2 and Wii game released in 2009 (a very late PS2 game) that wasn’t great and was quickly forgotten. But hey, it never got an Xbox port, so its sort of Sony’s own exclusive Indiana Jones game. It’s not as good as last years <em>Great Circle</em>, which will land on PS5 in 2025, but hey, its something! </p><hr><p>Anyway, here’s the full list of games being added to PS Plus and its various tiers next week:</p><h2 id="h753"><a id=""></a>PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>God of War Ragnarök</em>| PS4, PS5</li><li><em>Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name</em> | PS4, PS5</li><li><em>Atlas Fallen: Reign Of Sand </em>| PS5</li><li><em>SD Gundam Battle Alliance</em> | PS4, PS5</li><li><em>Sayonara Wild Hearts</em> | PS4</li><li><em>ANNO: Mutationem</em> | PS4, PS5</li><li><em>Orcs Must Die 3</em> | PS4, PS5</li><li><em>Citizen Sleeper</em> | PS4, PS5</li><li><em>Poker Club</em> | PS4</li></ul><h2 id="h754"><a id=""></a>PlayStation Plus Premium</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings</em> | PS4, PS5</li><li><em>Medievil 2</em>| PS4, PS5</li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I enjoyed what little time I spent with the new tank hero Hazard, but a whole new hero shooter that felt fresh was a few button presses away on my PlayStation 5. My friends are playing <em>Marvel Rivals </em>regularly and are excited to do so, rather than requiring the weeks or months of my begging to have them begrudgingly play <em>Overwatch</em> for an hour. This will probably be the first time I don’t finish a battle pass in <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s lifetime. But I can’t lie, I miss <em>Overwatch</em>’s heroes.

In the face of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ success, <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s offerings feel even more paltry, and fans have taken notice.</p><p>The shift is palpable. While we can’t see concurrent players across all platforms, there are signs that <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is eclipsing <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s audience, such as the stark gap between the two in streaming numbers.</p><p><em>Overwatch 2 </em>has work to do if it wants to reclaim this ground. Right now, Blizzard is testing a 6v6 format akin to the original game, which has some fans interested in a return to the series’ roots. But there’s still a fair bit of stink on <em>Overwatch 2 </em>after Blizzard failed to deliver the game it announced in 2019. Without a sense of forward momentum, <em>Overwatch 2 </em>feels stagnant, and lackluster skins and cosmetics aren’t enough to overtake <em>Marvel Rivals</em>. This has resulted in a lot of <em>Overwatch </em>fans in a weird limbo of not wanting to say goodbye but not having much reason to go back. Still, I can’t help but look at the Soldier: 76 statue on my shelf and feel like I’m grieving a long-time relationship.</p><p>Despite all my issues with <em>Overwatch 2</em>, on a strictly mechanical level I think it’s probably the better game. Heroes are more balanced, the map design is more consistent, and as divisive as it might be, I love having Role Queue in <em>Overwatch 2</em>, meaning I can guarantee there will be healers on my team. But that broken chaos has also been what has made <em>Marvel Rivals </em>feel fresh. If <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s future doesn’t include the promised PvE modes, I don’t know what the game’s future looks like. Hopefully, now that <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is breathing down its neck, Blizzard will have a promising update in the coming months.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When Fisk asks why Murdock stopped being a vigilante, our blind hero answers, “A line has been crossed,” before we see his cracked Daredevil mask fall to the ground. From the sounds of it, Murdock is struggling with the common vigilante paradox of how enacting violence may debatably stop some violence but also blurs the line between justice and retribution. Obviously he gets back to bone-crushing action before all is said and done (and, by the looks of it, breaks many, many bones indeed), but the season could find him struggling to reconcile his thirst for vengeance with his duty to protect. </p><p>Another aspect of the new trailer that should pique everyone’s interest is the dynamic between Murdock and Mayor Fisk. The trailer reveals it was Murdock who invited Fisk to meet at the diner. But more importantly, we see Fisk’s almost sentimental connection to his archnemesis, displayed when he remarks, “It’s not entirely unpleasant seeing you again.” Looks like there may be a mutual level of respect between the two men who both succumb to their violent sides to serve their individual purposes.  </p><p>Something tells me there’ll be some common enemy or convoluted entanglement of circumstances that invariably leads to Fisk and Daredevil temporarily teaming up. We’ll find out if I’m right when the series premieres on March 4. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
